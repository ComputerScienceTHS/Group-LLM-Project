xlii WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONThe Agricultural Revolution
Around 10,000 years ago, or about 8000 B.C.E., the climate was warming 
from an Ice Age. As it did, humans began to plant crops and raise animals for 
food. This change, called the Agricultural Revolution , began in the Middle 
East. Because of this development, people began to produce a surplus of food. 
For the first time in human history, one part of the population produced enough 
food to feed everyone. This allowed part of the population to specialize in non-
food producing activities. This specialization change transformed every aspect 
of human life, causing innovations and trends that have existed ever since:
• The population grew. People lived in larger settlements that eventually 
developed into cities.
• People became highly skilled at one job. Artisans made tools and 
weapons. Merchants engaged in trade. Priests conducted rituals. 
• People developed new technology. They learned how to improve 
irrigation systems, make use of the wheel in transportation, and replace 
stone with metals such as bronze and iron for making tools and art.
• People created more extensive governments and taxation. The desire to 
keep records about trade and taxes led to the invention of writing.
• Competition for resources and the accumulation of wealth increased 
group conflicts. However, the development of government provided a 
more peaceful way to settle conflicts between individuals.
• People became more sharply divided into social classes by wealth and 
occupation. In general, the status of women declined. 
The First Civilizations
Trends that began to emerge after the Agricultural Revolution led to the first 
civilizations, large societies with cities and a powerful state. Most were in 
river valleys, places with fresh water and fertile land. 
Mesopotamia  The world’s first civilization was in Mesopotamia, a 
region around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is today Iraq. Several 
cultures emerged in this region, many based on city-states. A city-state  is an 
independent state made up of a city and its surrounding territory. All city-
states were highly patriarchal, built monumental architecture such as religious 
temples called ziggurats, and engaged in long-distance trade. The people were 
polytheistic, believing in many gods.
Sumer was a city-state along the southernmost region of ancient 
Mesopotamia. As taxes and trade became more complex, the Sumerians 
invented cuneiform, the first written language in history. They used cuneiform 
to record the first written laws.
Egypt  In the Nile River valley, Egypt prospered. Though it shared many 
traits with Mesopotamia, Egypt was highly centralized under one ruler, called 
a  pharaoh. The Egyptians developed their own writing system (hieroglyphics) 
xliii PROLOGUEand a complex system of mathematics. They built monumental architecture 
(pyramids) that demonstrated the pharaoh’s power. Egyptian women were 
allowed to own property, and they were recognized as legally equal to men in 
court. These rights gave women a higher social standing than their counterparts 
in other patriarchal civilizations.
Indus  Archaeological remains show the sophistication of ancient 
civilizations along the Indus River in South Asia. Cities such as Harappa and 
Mohenjo-Daro engaged in long-distance trade with Mesopotamia, practiced 
polytheism, developed technology such as indoor plumbing, and planned the 
layout of urban areas. However, no one has deciphered their language, so less 
is known about them than about other early civilizations. 
China  Along the Huang He River in northern China, a highly patriarchal 
and centralized system developed. One of its distinctive features was the 
special honor that its people gave to their ancestors. 
Non-River Valley Civilizations  Two early civilizations in the Americas 
did not develop in river valleys. The Olmec in Mesoamerica and the Chavin in 
the Andes were complex societies that participated in extensive trade.

xliv WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONHinduism and Judaism 
At the same time that cities were growing, people began developing new ideas 
about religion. In animism, most deities were identified with specific places. 
Over time, people developed more abstract beliefs in which deities were not 
fixed in location. As people moved, they could take their deities with them. In 
some places, belief in many gods (polytheism) was replaced with a belief in 
just one supreme deity, monotheism.
Hinduism  The belief now called Hinduism  is sometimes categorized 
as polytheistic and sometimes as monotheistic. The origins of Hinduism go 
back at least 3,500 years. People called Aryans from north of the Himalaya 
Mountains migrated south to what is now Pakistan and India. They spoke an 
Indo-European language, and they brought with them scriptures called the 
Vedas and a belief that many deities existed. However, over time, people came 
to regard all deities as the expression of one supreme deity. 
The Vedas taught that the soul of a person is reborn, or reincarnated, 
many times. Eventually, a soul would spiritually advance enough to become 
liberated from this cycle of death and rebirth. The Vedas taught that people 
should organize society into sharply defined classes, called castes. The 
caste system prohibited social mobility. While the caste system kept society 
stratified, society was also unified. 
Zoroastrianism  A clear example of an early form of monotheism is 
Zoroastrianism. This belief system developed in Persia. Followers of this faith 
focus on human free will and the eternal battle between the forces of good and 
evil.
Judaism  The most influential example of monotheism is Judaism . Its 
earliest adherents were known as Hebrews or Israelites, but they have long 
been called Jews. Judaism developed in and around what is now the state of 
Israel. The Jewish people trace their history to the teachings of Abraham, who 
lived about 4,000 years ago. 
Jews believe that they have entered into a covenant, or mutual promise, 
with their God, whom they call Yahweh. In return for their devotion, Yahweh 
would consider them his chosen people. Judaism was further developed with 
the codification of Hebrew Scriptures, sometimes called the Old Testament. 
Like Judaism, two other faiths—Christianity and Islam—are also 
monotheistic religions that looked back to Abraham as an important figure. 
Christianity and Islam will be discussed later in this Prologue. 
xlv PROLOGUEPart 2:  The Classical Era, c. 600 B.C.E.  
to c. 600 C.E. 
Several great empires that arose between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E. became the 
core foundations of later civilizations in their region: 
• western Eurasia: the Persian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine empires
• southern Asia: the Mauryan and Gupta empires 
• eastern Asia: the Qin and Han dynasties
• Mesoamerica: the Mayan Empire
These empires provided political and economic security for their people. 
Goods and ideas flowed along land routes such as the ones in Eurasia known 
as the Silk Roads and maritime routes in the Mediterranean Sea and Indian 
Ocean. These trade routes fostered the development of such great cities as 
Rome (Italy), Constantinople (Turkey), Damascus (Syria), Pataliputra (India), 
and Chang’an (China).

Buddhism and Developments in South Asia
While intense spirituality and distinct social organization have provided 
continuity in South Asian history, strong political centralization has not. The 
region was unified under a single government only twice during the Classical 
Period. The most influential development in South Asia was the development 
of the religion of Buddhism.
xlvi WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONBeginning of Buddhism  The founder of Buddhism  was Siddhartha 
Gautama. Born into a wealthy Hindu family around 530 B.C.E., he became 
sharply aware of all the suffering people endured. To understand why people 
suffered, he left his wealthy family and pursued a life of poverty and meditation. 
According to Buddhist traditions, Siddhartha had been meditating for several 
days underneath a bodhi tree when he finally understood the cause of suffering 
and how to end it. He called himself the Buddha or “enlightened one,” and 
sought to teach others what he had come to understand. 
Buddhist doctrines became summarized in the Four Noble Truths, which 
sought to eliminate desire and suffering by following the Eightfold Path. This 
path requires an individual to meditate, reflect, and refrain from excessive 
earthly pleasures. The goal is, over time, to achieve enlightenment and the 
peaceful bliss known as nirvana, which would end the cycle of reincarnation. 
The Spread of Buddhism  Buddhism provided an alternative to the Vedic 
beliefs that were the foundation of Hinduism. Because Buddhism rejected 
the caste system, it became popular with members of the lower caste. It 
spread quickly throughout India and across Asia. Those spreading it included 
missionaries and merchants along the Silk Roads and around the Indian Ocean. 
Unlike Hinduism and Judaism, which remained the faiths of particular 
groups of people in particular places, Buddhism was a universalizing religion, 
one that actively sought converts among all people. Buddhism is also a 
monastic faith, one that develops monastery communities for men and women.
The Mauryan Empire  The first period of unity in South Asia was under 
the Mauryan Empire  (322 B.C.E.–187 B.C.E.) It reached its high point 
during the rule of Ashoka. He promoted prosperity by creating an efficient 
tax system and by building roads that connected commercial centers. Ashoka 
spread knowledge of the law by inscribing his edicts on pillars throughout the 
empire. 
Ashoka is one of the few powerful rulers in history who converted from 
one faith—Hinduism—to another. He became a Buddhist. His conversion 
helped spread the faith throughout India. After Ashoka, the Mauryan Empire 
soon declined in power, resulting in political decentralization.
The Gupta Empire  The second period of unity in South Asia was under  
the Gupta Empire . It ruled from c. 320 C.E. to c. 550 C.E. (C.E. stands 
for Common Era, sometimes called A.D.; c. stands for circa  and means 
approximately). This period is referred to as the Golden Age of India. Under 
a centralized government based in Pataliputra, a city in northwestern India, 
intellectual and cultural life flourished. In public hospitals, physicians 
made advances in medicine, such as using inoculations to prevent disease. 
Mathematicians developed a numbering system that combined a small number 
of symbols, 0 through 9, and the idea of place value. The system was so 
efficient that it is used throughout most of the world today. 
The social structure in the Gupta era was patriarchal. Men held most 
positions of power in public life. To unify people, the Gupta strongly supported 
Hinduism. Hinduism is the most common religion in India today.
xlvii PROLOGUEConfucianism and Developments in East Asia
Central China was united under the Zhou Dynasty (1076 B.C.E.–256 B.C.E.). 
However, as the dynasty weakened, China suffered a time of instability and 
decentralization referred to as the Warring States period.
Mandate of Heaven  One legacy of the Zhou Dynasty in China was in 
how people thought about government. This was the concept of a Mandate 
of Heaven,  the idea that “heaven,” or some universal force, provided the 
justification for an emperor and his family to rule China. If the ruler was corrupt 
or ineffective, “heaven” would show its displeasure in the form of natural 
disasters. These disasters, such as drought or famine, were a sign to the Chinese 
people that the ruler had lost the Mandate of Heaven. Several major peasant 
uprisings in China were a direct result in this belief.
Confucianism  During the Warring States period, around 551 B.C.E., the 
philosopher K’ung Fu-tzu, whose westernized name is Confucius , was born. He 
lived around the same time as the Buddha in India. The teachings of Confucius, 
written down by his followers in the Analects , describe how people should 
behave in everyday life. Unlike the teachings of Hinduism and Judaism, the 
Analects  do not focus on any deity. Rather, Confucius focused on education, 
benevolence, virtue, respect for those with authority (especially the emperor), 
and a patriarchal social structure. He emphasized filial piety, the duty of people 
to honor their ancestors. The teachings of Confucius affected Chinese beliefs 
and values more than any other philosophy. 
Daoism  A second response to the chaos of the Warring States period was 
Daoism. While Confucianism focused on how people could live in harmony 
with one another, Daoism  focused on how people could live in harmony with 
nature. The practices of Daoism emphasized internal reflection more than 
external behavior. Daoism would be influential throughout Chinese history.
The Qin and Han Dynasties  China regained stability when the Qin  
Dynasty  (221 B.C.E.–207 B.C.E.) and Han Dynasty  (206 B.C.E.–220 C.E.) 
established centralized control. The Qin standardized Chinese script, established 
a uniform system of weights and measures, and built canals and roads. Together, 
these changes provided the foundation for increased trade and prosperity.
Building on the accomplishments of the Qin, the Han Dynasty became a 
Golden Age of Chinese history. Under the Han, China was more peaceful and 
its population grew. Chinese science and technology prospered, producing such 
developments as the magnetic compass, paper, and the sternpost rudder. Under 
Han regulation, trade extended from Chang’an, the capital of the empire, west 
to the Mediterranean Sea. Most of the trade was in luxury items such as spices, 
gems, precious metals, tea, and, most famously, silk.
The Han transformed China’s government by creating a civil service exam . 
It required students to analyze Confucian teachings. Those who scored well 
received prestigious jobs in the government bureaucracy. This system produced 
a government of well-educated individuals and allowed for some social mobility. 
xlviii WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONCivilizations of Western Eurasia and Christianity
In western Eurasia between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E., strong civilizations 
developed in Persia, Greece, and Rome. Trade, war, and the flow of ideas 
connected these civilizations to one another. Each civilization prospered 
through a combination of trade and military strength.
Persia  Around 559 B.C.E., a large empire developed in Persia (modern-
day Iran) under the leadership of Cyrus the Great. The Persian Empire  
included most of the lands from the Aegean Sea in the west to the border of 
India in the east. The empire also became known as the Achaemenid Empire. 
With a strong centralized government, efficient bureaucracy, and network 
of roads, the Persian empire promoted trade, prosperity, and stability. The 
vast empire was ethnically and religiously diverse, which the government 
recognized by practicing religious toleration. 
Greece  While Persia was a vast but united empire, Greece was divided 
into approximately 1,000 city-states. The numerous islands and mountainous 
terrain made unifying the Grecian region under one leader very difficult. 
One cultural trait shared by Greeks was religion. Unlike the monotheistic 
Hebrews who worshipped a single all-powerful God, the Greeks believed in 
many deities and each possessed human frailties. These frailties help explain 
why Greeks developed a feeling that they controlled their own destiny.
Two of the largest city-states, Athens and Sparta, reflected the great variety 
among Greece’s many city-states. 
• Spartans organized their society around a powerful military. Women, 
the elderly, and enslaved people all filled roles that allowed free men to 
train as soldiers and fight when needed. 
• Athenians made impressive advances in architecture, literature, theater, 
and philosophy. Many of these came during its Golden Age in the 
late 400s B.C.E. Athens also developed the concept of democracy , a 
system of government in which a large part of the population runs the 
government. Athens allowed free adult males the ability to participate 
directly in making political decisions. 
In the 300s B.C.E., the army of Alexander the Great spread Greek culture 
into Egypt, across Persia, and east to India. This region became known as the 
Hellenistic world. 
Rome  According to legend, Rome was founded in 753 B.C.E. Roman 
culture borrowed heavily from the Greeks. The Romans incorporated the 
Greek gods into their pantheon of deities, relied on slavery, and made advances 
in government that continue to have lasting influence on governments today. 
Romans developed the practice of a representative government and of the 
judicial concept “innocent until proven guilty.” To protect individual rights, 
the Romans publicly displayed written laws known as the Twelve Tables. 
Spreading awareness of laws provided a check on abuses of government 
power, a concept that would be built into numerous constitutions in the future.
xlix PROLOGUELike Greece, Rome had a patriarchal society. However, compared to 
Greek women, Roman women gained more rights, including the right to own 
and inherit property and the right to initiate divorce proceedings. 
While the Greek city-states remained small, Rome expanded outward 
in all directions, turning the Mediterranean Sea into “a Roman lake.” At the 
peak of its power, the Roman Empire ruled territory from Scotland to northern 
Africa to the Middle East. In the large size of its territory, Rome was more like 
Persia. Both Rome and Persia were land-based empires under a strong central 
government. Both fostered trade and prosperity with well-maintained roads 
and strong militaries to protect travelers. Rome was also famous for other 
publicly funded projects, such as aqueducts, which were systems to transport 
water to cities, and large stadiums for public entertainment. 
Despite Rome’s wealth and power, it faced many challenges. Roman 
leaders over-extended the Roman military, were often corrupt, and failed to 
deal with devastating epidemics caused by smallpox and the bubonic plague. 
Gradually, trade and urban populations declined. As a result, Roman lands 
suffered economically. Rome’s decline was made worse by invasions from 
groups such as the Huns, Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and Vandals. By 476 C.E., the 
empire was so weak that a non-Roman became emperor for the first time in 
more than a thousand years.   
The Development of Christianity  Rome’s most enduring legacy was 
not in its military or its engineering achievements. It was in religion. Rome 
generally tolerated all faiths as long as subjects agreed to accept the divine 
nature of the emperor. People with polytheistic beliefs could do this easily.

l WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONHowever, monotheists could not. In particular, Jews living the Middle East 
refused to recognize any deity but their own. Roman persecution of Jews 
living in the Middle East contributed to the diaspora,  or spreading, of Jews 
to lands throughout northern Africa and Europe as they looked for places to 
worship freely.
One leader who emerged from the Jewish community was Jesus. For 
his teachings, he was executed by the Romans. Since the followers of his 
teachings considered him the Christ, or savior of humanity sent by God, they 
became known as Christians. Despite persecution by the Romans, Jesus’s 
disciples continued to spread his teachings. By the end of the 1st century C.E., 
Christians were practicing their faith throughout the empire. 
This new faith was particularly attractive to the poor because it taught that 
people could have a better life after death if they believed in Jesus. Despite 
continued persecution, Christianity  grew stronger. In the 4th century, under 
the emperor Constantine, Christianity became legal and was accepted as the 
official religion of the empire. 
Constantine’s endorsement of Christianity accelerated its growth. Like 
Buddhism, Christianity was a universalizing religion, meaning it actively 
sought converts and it was easily adaptable to areas outside its place of origin. 
It also offered monastic lifestyles for men (monks) and women (nuns) to 
devote their lives to practicing the faith. This new monotheistic faith would 
have far-reaching impact on future civilizations. 
Byzantine  By the middle of the 4th century, the eastern half of the Roman 
Empire had become wealthier and politically more powerful than the western 
half. For this reason, in 330, Emperor Constantine moved the capital of the 
empire eastward to Byzantium and renamed the city Constantinople (Istanbul 
today). In 395, the Roman Empire  was divided into two distinct entities. 
Rome became the capital in the west, and Constantinople became the capital 
in the east. 
Constantinople quickly became a political and economic hub. Geography 
aided its rise to prominence as rivers from the north flowed into the nearby 
Mediterranean and Black seas. As an entrep ôt, or coastal trading center , 
Constantinople prospered  as raw goods arrived from northern Europe, cereals 
came from Egypt, and precious spices and finished products came from the 
east. 
At its height, the Byzantine Empire  extended throughout the eastern 
half of the Mediterranean world. The reign of Justinian the Great (527–565) 
included great accomplishments. One was the construction of a magnificent 
church called Hagia Sophia (537). Another was the creation of the Justinian 
Code. This consolidation of Roman law would serve as the foundation of legal 
knowledge in Europe into the 19th century. Though constantly threatened by 
foreign incursion, the Byzantine Empire would survive for another 900 years.

Early American Civilizations
Afro-Eurasian civilizations developed in isolation from American civilizations 
during the classical era. Two of the most important were in Mesoamerica, the 
region that is now Mexico and Central America.
Teotihuacan  One of the most important civilizations in the Americas was 
based in the city of Teotihuacan , located near modern-day Mexico City. It 
was a multicultural urban area that prospered through regional trade. By the 
6th century C.E., its population of 125,000 made it one of the largest cities 
in the world. Teotihuacan featured streets laid out on a grid and monumental 
religious temples dedicated to the gods of the sun and moon. The city was 
abandoned by 650, but the “city of the gods” as it was called, would later 
influence other powerful civilization such as the Aztecs. 
The Mayans  South of Teotihuacan lived the Mayans . They were the most 
influential classical civilization in the Americas. The Mayans can be traced as 
far back as 1500 B.C.E. They reached their height of population and wealth 
between 250 C.E. and 900 C.E. The Mayans developed the most complex 
written language in the Americas before contact with people from Europe. 
Mayan priests created a very accurate calendar, a sign that they studied and 
understood the movement of Earth through space. Mayans understood the 
importance of the concept of zero, something people in the Mediterranean 
world had not grasped in this period. 
lii WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONComparisons in the Classical Age
The  empires that emerged between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E. shared several 
traits in economics and politics. In general, increased trade, technological 
innovation, and centralized government worked together to make the lives of 
people longer, safer, and more comfortable. In general, the empires also shared 
similar reasons for their decline. 
Early Trade Networks  As technological developments made trade easier, 
strong and stable governments provided the wealth and security to foster and 
sponsor trade. The Eurasian exchange networks utilized the strength of the 
Roman and Han innovations, such as stirrups that made riding horses easier 
and networks of places to rest and eat that made long journey travel more 
dependable.  
Other key technologies included the improvements in sail design and ship 
hulls that enabled ships to maneuver in less than favorable wind conditions. 
The knowledge of monsoon winds facilitated trade along the entrepôts in the 
Indian Ocean. The improvements to the camel saddle made caravan trade 
profitable and possible across the Sahara. 
The Mediterranean Sea lanes continued to facilitate cultural exchange and 
goods between the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, and people of North Africa. 
Long-distance trade was only beginning to hit its stride. These developments 
ushered in the first Golden Age of the Silk Roads.
Decline of Classical Empires  By 600 C.E., many of the great classical 
empires were losing or had lost their unity and political power. As a result, 
people faced growing problems that they could not agree on how to address. 
Each unsolved problem then made peace and prosperity more precarious:
• challenges collecting taxes weakened government
• declines in trade decreased access to foreign goods and markets
• spread of disease reduced urban populations
• increases in the gap between the rich and poor created social conflict
• lack of broad support for leadership made solving problems harder
• attacks by outside groups led to a need for more spending on defense
In some areas, the spread of a common religion helped keep society unified 
even as a government failed. In later centuries, this unity would help new 
empires arise. For example, in Europe, the Roman Empire broke apart in the 
5th century, but Christianity held society together. Confucianism filled a similar 
role in China, while Hinduism and Buddhism did the same in South Asia.

liv WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONPart 3:  Postclassical Civilizations,  
c. 600–c. 1200
In many parts of the world, the decline of classical civilizations was marked 
by a century or more of declines in trade, intellectual innovation, and social 
stability. However, new centralized states that promoted peace and prosperity 
emerged to replace them. Throughout Afro-Eurasia, trade intensified after 
600 as networks of exchange widened and became more profitable. The Silk 
Roads, the Indian Ocean trade networks , and the trans-Saharan trade 
routes were brimming with items such as porcelain, ivory, teakwood, spices, 
and silk. These networks of exchange also provided ways for technology and 
ideas to move from one culture to another. More and more regions became 
familiar with the compass, the astrolabe, new forms of credit, paper money, 
and new religious beliefs. 
However, all of this exchange came with a high price. Deadly diseases 
also spread along these same pathways. 
Afro-Eurasia and the Americas remained separate, but people in 
Mesoamerica and the Andes Mountains experienced similar developments. 
The growth of more centralized states in each region also promoted trade and 
the spread of ideas.
The Spread of Islam
At the beginning of the 7th century, the people of the Middle East were a 
mixture of animists, Zoroastrians, Jews, Christians, and others. A merchant 
named Muhammad living on the Arabian Peninsula believed that he had 
received revelations from God. These revelations were later recorded in the 
Quran, the sacred scriptures of the religion of Islam . Those who followed 
the teachings in the Quran became known as Muslims. They believed that 
Muhammad was last in a line of great prophets that included Abraham, Moses, 
and Jesus.  
The Teachings of Islam  The core principles of the Quran became known 
as the Five Pillars of Islam: a belief in one god called Allah, ritual prayer, 
almsgiving, fasting, and making a pilgrimage to Mecca. They evolved a law 
code based on the Quran, called sharia , to regulate Muslim religious and civic 
behavior. Unlike the laws of the Romans, sharia made no distinction between 
religious and civil law. 
Sunnis and Shi’as  Through Muhammad’s leadership, Islam quickly 
unified and brought peace to the warring tribes of the Arabian Peninsula. 
However, Islam experienced a crisis upon the death of Muhammad in 632. 
He had made no provision for a successor. People fell into two warring camps  
over who should become the political leader, called the caliph, of the Islamic 
community. This rift, which continues today, created a divide between the 
two major branches of Islam: Sunni and Shi’a. Sunni Muslims felt that the 
caliph could be selected from among all leaders in the Islamic community. 
lv PROLOGUEShi’a Muslims felt that the caliph should be a blood relative of Muhammad. 
Today, Sunnis form the majority of Muslims in the world. Shi’a Muslims are 
strongest in Iran and Iraq. 
Expansion of Islam  Despite this early division among Muslims, Islam 
spread rapidly. In less than a century, Islam had united southern Spain, North 
Africa, the Middle East, and parts of India. This area became known as the 
House of Islam, or Dar al-Islam . 
The Abbasids  The most influential rulers in Dar al-Islam were those of 
the Abbasid Caliphate  (750–1258). Under them, Islamic culture experienced  
a golden age. A stable government allowed trade to once again prosper. The 
Abbasids helped China, then under the Tang Dynasty, reestablish a booming 
trade along the Silk Roads. They also facilitated the growth of trans-Saharan 
trade to West Africa and were major participants in the diffusion of ideas and 
goods throughout the Indian Ocean. 
Islamic society, particularly in the capital in Baghdad, thrived under the 
Abbasids. The empire became a center of learning where people made advances 
in medicine, built astronomical observatories, developed algebra, improved the 
astrolabe, and preserved Greek and Roman texts. The government practiced a 
degree of religious toleration. Non-Muslims could keep their faith by paying 
an additional tax called the jizya . 
The Abbasids ended female infanticide and strengthened the marriage and 
property rights of women. The Abbasids continued to support the veiling of 
women and the right of a man to take up to four wives.

lvi WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONChina 
After the Han Dynasty declined in the 3rd century, China suffered three 
centuries of turmoil and disunity. However, after that, China experienced 
several centuries of growth.
Sui Dynasty  China’s period of troubles was ended by the short-lived 
Sui Dynasty  (581–618). By reconstituting a centralized government, the 
Sui provided the foundation on which China again became prosperous. The 
dynasty’s most dramatic accomplishment was the construction of the Grand 
Canal. Stretching over 1,000 miles, it connected the agricultural south to the 
population centers in the north. Besides fostering economic growth, the Grand 
Canal helped unify the varied ethnic and cultural groups of China.
Tang Dynasty  Building on the accomplishments of the Sui, the Tang 
Dynasty  (618–907) extended China’s boundaries north into Mongolia, 
west into Central Asia, and south into Vietnam. China’s population grew 
significantly under the Tang. Learning to grow a fast-ripening variety of rice 
allowed peasants to produce more calories per acre, so the land could support 
more people. 
The Tang expanded the civil service exam and the empire’s bureaucracy, 
which developed into an ongoing feature of the Chinese government. Under 
the Tang, the Chinese invented gunpowder and developed paper money,  
which facilitated trade. Political stability and steady demand for China’s silk, 
porcelain, and other goods ushered in a second golden age of the Silk Roads.

lvii PROLOGUEThe Chinese had long viewed their country as the “Middle Kingdom,” 
possibly because they believed they were at the center of cultural advances 
in the world.  Based on this viewpoint, they developed the tributary system, 
the idea that surrounding kingdoms should make payment, or tribute, to the 
Chinese and officially submit to their rule in exchange for trading privileges.
The strength of the Tang eventually declined. A combination of internal 
peasant uprisings and invasions from the west and north led to the downfall 
of the dynasty.
Song Dynasty  After the Tang collapsed, a new dynasty, the Song Dynasty 
(960 –1279), was able to restore order. Under the Song, China continued its 
golden age. Chinese meritocracy allowed for more upward mobility than any 
other hiring system of its time. China became the leading manufacturer in the 
world, producing iron, steel, silk, and porcelain, and it had the largest cities in 
the world. Neo-Confucianism, a melding of Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist 
philosophies that had begun under the Tang, became popular. It was during 
this time that paper money and the magnetic compass was exported from East 
Asia to other parts of the world. 
Japan
Between about 800 and 1200, Japan had its own golden age of achievements 
in painting and literature. Though influenced by China, Japan always had a 
separate and distinctive culture. However, by the end of this period, powerful 
clans of land-owning nobles were eroding the emperor’s power. As government 
became more decentralized, warfare between these clans increased. A strong 
political and social hierarchy developed over the control of land and included 
hierarchical obligations. At the top was the shogun , a military general, 
followed by powerful landlords called daimyos . Each daimyo had a force of 
warriors called samurais who pledged loyalty to serve him. Below the samurai 
were the peasants, followed by merchants. 
Culturally, Japan’s official religion was Shinto , a set of beliefs centered 
on the veneration of ancestors and nature spirits. However, missionaries from 
China and Korea brought Buddhism to the country, and it became popular at 
this time. Many Japanese adopted Buddhism yet keep their Shinto beliefs. 
Africa 
In most of sub-Saharan Africa between 600 and 1200, people often lived in 
small self-governing chiefdoms in which many people were related. These kin-
based communities often cooperated with one another and sometimes formed 
larger political units. While cultures were as diverse as the geography of the 
continent, similarities existed. Some similarities resulted from the migrations 
of Bantu-speaking people out of a region in west central Africa between  
c. 1000 B.C.E. and c. 1500 C.E. These migrating people spread a language, 
farming techniques, and knowledge of how to work with iron. 
lviii WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONBy 1000 C.E., complex agricultural practices such as irrigation and 
the allocation of land for people to cultivate demanded the development of 
more complex forms of government. With a stronger government came more 
control over production and distribution of surplus products. This government 
regulation, combined with the introduction of the camel and use of the camel 
saddle, led to long-distance trade across the Sahara. Muslim merchants greatly 
increased trade, which benefited the kingdom of Ghana  (c. 700–c. 1240). The 
trans-Saharan trade route allowed Ghana to become very wealthy. The rulers of 
Ghana protected these trade routes and taxed the gold and salt that continually 
entered or exited their trading centers. 
The development of trade also affected the religion of the people of West 
Africa. As Muslim merchants from North Africa traded in the region, they 
spread Islam. The region became part of Dar al-Islam. The legacy of this 
period can be seen today in the large number of Muslims in some countries. In 
Nigeria, about 50 percent of the population identifies as Muslim. In Mali, over 
90 percent do. 
On the east coast of Africa, merchants linked into the Indian Ocean trading 
network. Through it, Africans and people from the Middle East, South Asia, 
and Southeast Asia were all connected. African merchants exported gold, ivory, 
and enslaved people. They imported porcelain, silk, and spices. 
While governments were generally small and local in most of Africa, 
outside of West Africa, one large kingdom arose in the southeast part of the 
continent, Great Zimbabwe . It dominated the region between the 12th and 
15th centuries. The reasons Great Zimbabwe declined are not clear, though one 
reason was probably the reduced output of gold mines in the region.
South Asia and Southeast Asia
After the fall of the Gupta empire in 550, South Asia was riddled by disunity 
and fighting. Despite this decentralization, Hinduism and the caste system kept 
southern India unified and relatively stable. Northern India, however, suffered 
a series of invasions and weak confederations. One of those invasions brought 
Islam to the region in 711. 
Despite a period of divisions and conflict, South Asian trade flourished. As 
people better understood the pattern of the monsoon winds , India’s location 
made it the hub of Indian Ocean trade. Silks and porcelain from East Asia, 
spices from southeast Asia, horses from the Middle East, and enslaved people 
and ivory from Africa were all traded in India.
Religion and trade dominated South Asia’s influence on Southeast Asia. 
Buddhists and Hindus used trade networks to spread their religions’ teachings. 
Islam also significantly influenced Southeast Asia at this time. Muslim 
merchants, though often not consciously missionaries, spread their faith by 
settling in new regions with their families. Islam soon became the dominant 
religion in the Spice Islands and the Malay peninsula.

Europe
The Postclassical period saw a dramatic shift in Europe. The Eastern Roman 
Empire, based in Constantinople, flourished. In contrast, the decline of the 
Western Roman Empire left a power vacuum in the rest of the continent. 
Invasions of people from Northern Europe, known as the Vikings, brought 
another group of people into the cultural exchanges. Central and western 
Europe devolved into thousands of duchies and fiefdoms. As a result of the 
lack of strong central governments, Europe could not provide the protection 
and stability merchants desired. It did not benefit from long distance Afro-
Eurasian trade as much as other regions did. 
Just as Hinduism provided cultural unity to a politically divided South 
Asia, Christianity became the one unifying force in central and western Europe. 
In 800, the pope demonstrated his power and authority by bestowing on the 
French king, Charlemagne, the title of “Emperor of the Romans.” However, 
European Christian unity would not endure. In 1054, it split into two branches, 
the Roman Catholic Church in the west and the Orthodox Church  in the 
east.  
In 1095, the Roman Catholic pope called for a Holy Crusade to free 
Jerusalem and the lands around it from Islamic control. The early crusaders 
had some limited success. But after two centuries of trying, the crusades failed 
to seize power. However, they had a large impact culturally. The Crusades 
made Europeans more aware of the achievements of the Middle East and the 
rest of Asia. This awareness was one factor in stimulating Europe to become 
more interested in intellectual and technological advances. 
lx WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONThe Americas
By the year 900, the Mayan golden age in Mesoamerica was ending. A 
combination of environmental degradation, drought, and warfare caused 
Mayans to abandon many of their cities. However, some Mayan cities, such as 
Chichen Itza, continued to be inhabited. 
Two other large civilizations developed in the Western Hemisphere during 
this time. One was the Mississippian  civilization, near present-day St. Louis. 
It flourished between the 8th century and the 16th century. Its city of Cahokia 
was a major trade hub with a population larger than that of London. 
The other was the Toltecs  civilization, which emerged in the 10th century 
in Mesoamerica. The Toltecs adopted many Mayan practices, including a 
religion that was both polytheistic and animistic. The Toltecs had a major 
influence on a later empire in the region, the Aztecs.

lxi PROLOGUEThe World in 1200
By 1200, much of the world had recovered from the decline of the classical 
civilizations. In many regions, new states were emerging that were promoting 
trade and the transfer of ideas among regions:
• Africa, Europe, and Asia were connected through Indian Ocean trade, 
the Silk Roads, and trans-Saharan trade routes.
• The Byzantine Empire and various Islamic empires provided some 
stability in the region from Eastern Europe through the Middle East to 
South Asia.
• China and Dar al-Islam continued to be leading centers of learning and 
innovation.
• Western Europe and Japan had decentralized systems of government 
that featured powerful land-owning nobles. 
• Africa largely remained stateless, except for some regions in West 
Africa and East Africa that were part of Dar al-Islam.
• Afro-Eurasia, America, and Oceania were developing in isolation from 
each other.
In 1200, people in Africa and Eurasia might have predicted that in the next 
three centuries, the regions of the world would remain on their paths. China 
would grow wealthier, Islamic states would become stronger, and Europe 
would continue to learn from other regions. However, few could have guessed 
that in the 13th century a little-known group of nomads from Central Asia 
would upend life in Eurasia. Then, in 1492, a voyage by a European would 
reshape the lives of people around the world.

Understand the Context
Between 1200 and 1450, several large empires emerged around the world. Some 
were modified revivals of earlier empires in their region. Others represented 
new developments. All were shaped by the context of regional trade, which had 
been increasing since around 600. 
The Revival of Large Empires  Between 1200 and 1450, the wealthiest 
and most innovative empire in the world was the Song Dynasty in China. It 
was the latest in a series of states that had ruled a unified and prosperous China. 
Similarly, in Mesoamerica, the rise of the Aztec was influenced by an earlier 
empire under the Mayans. Two other centers of great intellectual achievement, 
Baghdad and Spain, reflected the emphasis on learning in the Islamic world. 
However, in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, the growth of regional 
trade produced larger and more complex states than had previously existed in 
those regions. Trade across the Sahara resulted in the West African empires of 
Ghana and Mali. Trade in the Indian Ocean provided the context for large states 
in =imbabwe in East Africa and various states in India and Southeast Asia.
Unity in Central Eurasia  Shaping the context for events throughout 
Eurasia between 1200 and 150 was the remarkable emergence of the 
Mongols. A group of nomads from Central Asia, the Mongols conquered lands 
from central Europe to the Pacific Ocean, creating the largest land empire in 
human history. The conquest came with great devastation. However, the unity 
of so much territory under the rule of one group allowed trade to flourish once 
again across Eurasia, with new ideas and technology spreading easily. These 
developments set the stage for the intensifying  global interactions that helped 
define the period after 150.

DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIA 3
1.1
Developments in East Asia
From now on, our ordinances will be properly enforced  
and the morality of our people will be restored. 
—Ming Dynasty “Prohibition Ordinance” (1368–1644)
Essential Question:   How did developments in China and the rest of East 
Asia between c. 1200 and c. 1450 reflect continuity, 
innovation, and diversity? 
The Song Dynasty in China 60±12 was the leading example of diversity 
and innovation in Afro-Eurasia and the Americas during the 1th century. 
China enjoyed great wealth, political stability, and fine artistic and intellectual 
achievements. Neo-Confucian teachings, illustrated in the above quotation, 
supported the government and shaped social classes and the family system. 
In addition, China developed the greatest manufacturing capability in the 
world. However, the spread of Confucianism and Buddhism might be the most 
enduring testimony to Chinese influence. 
Government Developments in the Song Dynasty
The Song Dynasty  replaced the Tang in 60 and ruled for more than three 
centuries. They lost control of northern lands to invading pastoralists from 
Manchuria who set up the Jin Empire. Although the Song ruled a smaller region 
than the Tang, their reign was prosperous and under them the arts flourished.
Bureaucracy  China’s strength was partially the result of its imperial 
bureaucracy , a vast organization in which appointed officials carried 
out the empire’s policies. The bureaucracy had been a feature of Chinese  
government since the Qin dynasty (221 B.C.E.–207 B.C.E.). It represented a 
continuity across centuries and dynasties. Under the Song, China’s bureaucracy 
expanded. Early in the dynasty, this strengthened the dynasty.
Meritocracy and the Civil Service Exam  One of Emperor Song Taizu’s 
great achievements was that he expanded the educational opportunities to 
young men of the lower economic classes so they could score well on the civil 
service exams. By scoring well, a young man could obtain a highly desired job 
in the bureaucracy. These exams were based on knowledge of Confucian texts. 
Because officials obtained their positions by demonstrating their merit on these 
exams, China’s bureaucratic system was known as a meritocracy . Though 
4 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONthe poor were vastly underrepresented in the bureaucracy, the Chinese system 
allowed for more upward mobility than any other hiring system of its time. 
However, by the end of the Song, the bureaucracy had grown so large that it 
contributed to the empire’s weakness. By creating so many jobs and by paying 
these officials so handsomely, the Song increased the costs of government to 
the point that they began drying up China’s surplus wealth. 
Economic Developments in Postclassical China
The flourishing Tang Dynasty had successfully promoted agricultural 
development, improved roads and canals, encouraged foreign trade, and spread 
technology. These accomplishments led to rapid prosperity and population 
growth during the Song Dynasty. The Grand Canal  was an inexpensive and 
efficient internal waterway transportation system that extended over 0,000 
miles. Expanding the canal enabled China, under the Song Dynasty, to become 
the most populous trading area in the world. 
Gunpowder  Although gunpowder had been invented in China in previous 
dynasties, innovators in the Song Dynasty made the first guns. Over centuries, 
the technology of making gunpowder and guns spread from China to all parts 
of Eurasia via traders on the Silk Roads.

5 DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIA 5.ingdom in present-day 9ietnam, greatly expanded agricultural production in 
China. This rice and other strains developed through experimentation allowed 
farming to spread to lands where once rice could not grow, such as lowlands, 
riverbanks, and hills. In some areas, it also allowed farmers to grow two crops 
of rice per year, a summer crop and a winter crop. 
Innovative methods of production contributed to agricultural success. For 
example, Chinese farmers put manure both human and animal on the fields 
to enrich the soil. They built elaborate irrigation systems using ditches, water 
wheels, pumps, and terraces to increase productivity. New heavy plows pulled 
by water buffalo or oxen allowed previously unusable land to be cultivated.
The combination of these changes in agriculture produced an abundance 
of food. As a result, China’s population grew quickly. In the three centuries of 
Song Dynasty rule, China’s population increased from around 25 percent of 
the total world population to nearly 40 percent.
Manufacturing and Trade  Industrial production soared, as did China’s 
population. China’s discovery of “black earth”²coal²in the th century 
B.C.E. enabled it to produce greater amounts of cast iron goods. Though 
massive use of coal to power machines wouldn’t happened until the 18th 
century, China did have the greatest manufacturing capability in the world. 
The Chinese later learned how to take the carbon out of cast iron and began 
to manufacture steel. They used steel to make or reinforce bridges, gates, and 
ship anchors. They also used steel to make religious items, such as pagodas 
and Buddhist figurines. Steel also strengthened the agricultural equipment, 
contributing to the abundance of food production as well. 
Under the Song²and earlier than in Western Europe²China experienced 
proto-industrialization , a set of economic changes in which people in rural 
areas made more goods than they could sell. Unlike later industrialization, 
which featured large-scale production in factories using complex machinery, 
proto-industrialization relied more on home-based or community-based 
production using simple equipment. For example, artisans , or skilled 
craftworkers, produced steel and other products in widely dispersed smelting 
facilities under the supervision of the imperial government. Artisans also 
manufactured porcelain and silk that reached consumers through expanding 
trade networks, especially by sea. Porcelain was highly desired because it 
was light-weight yet strong. Further, it was light-colored, so it could be easily 
painted with elaborate designs.
The Chinese used the compass in maritime navigation, and they redesigned 
their ships to carry more cargo. China’s ability to print paper navigation 
charts made seafaring possible in open waters, out of sight of land, and sailors 
became less reliant on the sky for direction. 
China became the world’s most commercialized society. Its economy 
changed from local consumption to market production, with porcelains, 
textiles, and tea the chief exports. The Grand Canal supported a vibrant internal 
trade while advances in naval technology allowed China to control trade in 
the South China Sea. The military power of the Tang and Song enabled them 
to protect traders from bandits. 
6 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONTaxes  The Song also promoted the growth of a commercial economy by 
changing how they built public projects, such as roads and irrigation canals. 
Instead of requiring that people labor on these projects, the government paid 
people to work on them. This change increased the amount of money in 
circulation, promoting economic growth.
Tributes  Another source of income for the government came from the 
tributary system, an arrangement in which other states had to pay money or 
provide goods to honor the Chinese emperor. This system cemented China’s 
economic and political power over several foreign countries, but it also created 
stability and stimulated trade for all parties involved. The origins of the system 
existed in the Han Dynasty. By the time of the Song Dynasty, Japan, .orea, 
and kingdoms throughout southeast Asia were tributary states. The emperor 
expected representatives from tributary states to demonstrate their respect by 
performing a  kowtow,  a ritual in which anyone greeting the Chinese emperor 
must bow his or her head until it reached the floor. The Chinese sent out 
tremendous fleets led by =heng He to demonstrate the power of the emperor 
and to receive tribute. (Zheng He’s voyages are described in more detail in 
Topic 2..
Social Structures in China
Through most of Chinese history, the majority of people lived in rural areas. 
However, urban areas grew in prominence in this productive period. At the 
height of the Song Dynasty, China was the most urbanized land in the world, 
boasting several cities containing more than 100,000 people. The largest cities, 
Chang’an an ancient capital, Hangzhou at the southern end of the Grand 
Canal, and the port city of Guangzhou were cosmopolitan metropolises²
active centers of commerce with many entertainment options to of fer. 
China’s Class Structure  Though urbanization represented a significant 
development in China, life in rural areas grew more complex as well. The 
bureaucratic expansion created an entirely new social class, the scholar gentry . 
They soon outnumbered the aristocracy, which was comprised of landowners 
who inherited their wealth. The scholar gentry were educated in Confucian 
philosophy and became the most influential social class in China. 
Three other classes ranked below the scholar gentry: farmers, artisans, 
and merchants. The low status of merchants reflected Confucian respect for 
hard work and creating value. The tasks of merchants did not require physical 
strength or endurance, and they simply exchanged goods without growing or 
making anything new.
Lower rungs of Chinese society included peasants who worked for wealthy 
landowners, often to pay off debts, and the urban poor. The Song government 
provided aid to the poor and established public hospitals where people could 
receive free care.
Role of Women  Confucian traditions included both respect for women 
and the expectation that they would defer to men. This patriarchal pattern 
7 DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIAstrengthened during the Tang and Song dynasties. One distinctive constraint on 
women’s activities in China was the practice of foot binding , which became 
common among aristocratic families during the Song Dynasty. From a very 
young age, girls had their feet wrapped so tightly that the bones did not grow 
naturally. A bound foot signified social status, something suitors particularly 
desired. It also restricted women’s ability to move and hence to participate in 
the public sphere. Foot binding was finally banned in 112.
Intellectual and Cultural Developments
During the Tang and Song eras, China enjoyed affluence, a well-educated 
populace, and extensive contact with foreign nations. As a result, intellectual 
pursuits (technology, literature, and visual arts) thrived.
Paper and Printing  The Chinese had invented paper as early as the 2nd 
century C.E., and they developed a system of printing in the th century. They 
were the first culture to use woodblock printing . A Buddhist scripture produced 
in the th century is thought to be the world’s first woodblock printed work. 
For information on the Gutenberg press, a related technology, see Topic 1.6. 
In the Song era, printed booklets on how to farm efficiently were distributed 
throughout rice-growing regions.
CHINESE  WOODBLOC K PRINTING
Source : Thinkstock 
With the development of woodblock printing in China, people could make multiple copies of art 
or written texts without laboriously copying each by hand.
8 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONReading and Poetry  The development of paper and printing expanded the 
availability of books. Though most peasants were illiterate, China’s privileged 
classes had increased access to literature. Confucian scholars not only 
consumed literature at a tremendous rate, they were also the major producers 
of literature throughout the era. The Tang and Song dynasties’ emphasis on 
schooling created generations of well-rounded scholar-bureaucrats. Later, 
Europeans with such diverse skills would be called “Renaissance men.”
Religious Diversity in China
Buddhism  had come to China from its birthplace in India via the Silk Roads. 
Its presence is evident during the anarchic period between the later Han and 
the Sui dynasties. However, its popularity became widespread during the Tang 
Dynasty. The th century Buddhist monk ;uanzang helped build Buddhism’s 
popularity in China. 
Buddhism and Daoism  Three forms of Buddhism from India came to 
shape Asia, each developing a different emphasis: 
• Theravada Buddhism  focused on personal spiritual growth through 
silent meditation and self-discipline. It became strongest in Southeast 
Asia.
• Mahayana Buddhism  focused on spiritual growth for all beings and 
on service. It became strongest in China and Korea.
• Tibetan Buddhism  focused on chanting. It became strongest in Tibet.
All three include a belief in the Four Noble Truths, which stress the idea 
that personal suffering can be alleviated by eliminating cravings or desires and 
by following Buddhist precepts. All three also embrace the Eight-Fold Path, 
the precepts including right speech, right livelihood, right effort, and right 
mindfulness that can lead to enlightenment or nirvana. 
Monks introduced Buddhism to the Chinese by relating its beliefs to Daoist 
principles. For example, Buddhism’s idea of dharma became translated as dao 
“the way”. Eventually, Buddhist doctrines combined with elements of Daoist 
traditions to create the syncretic , or fused, faith Chan Buddhism , also known 
as Zen Buddhism . Like Daoism, =en Buddhism emphasized direct experience 
and meditation as opposed to formal learning based on studying scripture. 
Because of its fusion with Chinese beliefs, Buddhism became very popular 
in China. Monasteries²buildings where monks lived together²appeared in 
most major cities. 
The presence of these monasteries became a problem for the Tang 
bureaucracy. Many leaders of the Tang Dynasty, which considered itself the 
“Middle .ingdom,” had trouble accepting that a foreign religion would have 
such prominence in society. Buddhism’s popularity, which drew individuals 
away from China’s native religions, made Daoists and Confucians jealous. 
Despite monasteries’ closures and land seizures, however, Chan Buddhism 
remained popular among ordinary Chinese citizens.
9 DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIABuddhism and Neo-Confucianism  The Song Dynasty was somewhat 
more friendly towards Buddhism, but it did not go out of its way to promote 
the religion. It preferred to emphasize China’s native traditions, such 
as Confucianism. However, Buddhism had a strong presence and many 
Confucians began to adopt its ideals into their daily lives. The development 
of printing had made Buddhist scriptures widely available to the Confucian 
scholar gentry. The Song Dynasty benefited from the Confucian idea of filial 
piety , the duty of family members to subordinate their desires to those of the 
male head of the family and to the ruler. The emphasis on respect for one’s 
elders helped the Song maintain their rule in China.  
Neo-Confucianism  evolved in China between 0 and 80. It was a 
syncretic system, combining rational thought with the more abstract ideas of 
Daoism and Buddhism. This new incarnation of Confucianism emphasized 
ethics rather than the mysteries of God and nature. It became immensely 
popular in the countries in China’s orbit, including Japan, .orea, and 9ietnam.
Comparing Japan, Korea, and Vietnam
An important dynamic in the histories of Japan, .orea, and 9ietnam was 
each country’s relationship with China. When China was unified, its political 
strength, economic wealth, religious traditions, intellectual advances, and 
technological innovations made the world’s most powerful realm. Its smaller 
neighbors benefited from being so close to China but faced a challenge of 
maintaining their own distinctive cultures. Each had to confront the issue of 
sinification, or the assimilation of Chinese traditions and practices.
Japan
Since Japan was separated from China by a sea rather than land, it had more 
ability to control its interactions with China than .orea or 9ietnam could. The 
impact of Chinese culture appeared in many aspects of life:
• Japan’s Prince Shotoku Taishi 5±622 promoted Buddhism and 
Confucianism along with Japan’s traditional Shinto religion. During 
this era, Japan learned how to do woodblock printing from China. 
• During the Heian period  ±1185 Japan emulated Chinese 
traditions in politics, art, and literature. 
• However, Japanese writers also moved in new directions. For example, 
in the 11th century, a Japanese writer composed the world’s first novel, 
The Tale of Genji.  It is the story of a Japanese prince and his life at 
court, particularly his many romances. 
Feudalism For hundreds of years, Japan had been a feudal society without 
a centralized government. Landowning aristocrats, the daimyo , battled for 
control of land, while the majority of people worked as rice fa rmers. 
10 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONJapanese feudalism was similar to European feudalism, which is described 
in Topic 1.6. Both featured very little social mobility, and both systems were 
built upon hereditary hierarchies. In Japan, peasants, known as serfs, were born 
into lives of economic dependency, while samurai were born into their roles as 
protectors and daimyo were born into lives of privilege. In Europe, the three 
groups were serfs, knights, and nobles.
What distinguishes Japanese feudalism from that of Europe was that the 
daimyo enjoyed much more power than the nobility in Europe did. The daimyo 
ruled over vast stretches of land and, in reality, were more powerful than 
either the emperor or the shogun. By contrast, Europe’s hierarchy placed the 
monarch above the nobility. Though there were periods when authority of the 
monarch waned and power was distributed among nobility, the main centralized 
power structure of European feudalism would not change until the Modern  
Industrial Era. 
In Europe, the ideal knight held to the code of chivalry, with duty to 
countrymen, duty to God, and duty to women, the last expressed through 
courtly love and the virtues of gentleness and graciousness. In Japan, the code 
was known as bushido  and stressed frugality, loyalty, the martial arts, and 
honor unto death.
Japan also differed from China in how it was governed. China was ruled by 
an emperor who oversaw a large civilian bureaucracy. For much of its history, 
China had a central government strong enough to promote trade and peace. In 
contrast, when the Heian court declined, a powerful land-owning family, the 
Minamoto clan, took charge. In 1192, the Minamoto installed a shogun, or 
military ruler, to reign. Though Japan still had an emperor, he had little power. 
For the following four centuries, Japan suffered from regional rivalries among 
aristocrats. Not until the 17th century would shoguns create a strong central 
government that could unify the country. (Connect: In a paragraph, explain 
how Buddhism and Confucianism influenced the development of Chinese 
governments in the period from 1200 to 150. See Prologue.
Korea
Korea’s location gave it a very direct relationship with China. The countries 
shared a land boundary, and China extended both the north and south of .orea.
Similarity to China  Through its tributary relationship, Korea and China 
were in close contact. Thus, .orea emulated many aspects of China’s politics 
and culture. It centralized its government in the style of the Chinese. Culturally, 
.oreans adopted both Confucian and Buddhist beliefs. The educated elite 
studied Confucian classics, while Buddhist doctrine attracted the peasant 
masses. Koreans adopted the Chinese writing system, which proved to be 
very awkward. The Chinese and Korean languages remained structurally very 
different. In the 15th century, .orea developed its own writing system. 
Powerful Aristocracy  One important difference between .orea and 
China was that the landed aristocracy were more powerful in .orea than in 
11 DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIAChina. As a result, the .orean elite were able to prevent certain Chinese reforms 
from ever being implemented. For example, though there was a .orean civil 
service examination, it was not open to peasants. Thus, there was no truly 
merit-based system for entering the bureaucracy.
Vietnam
Like Japan and .orea, 9ietnam traded with and learned from China. For 
example, 9ietnam adapted the Chinese writing system and architectural styles. 
However, 9ietnam had a more adversarial relationship with China. At times, 
the 9ietnamese launched violent rebellions against Chinese influence.
Gender and Social Structure  9ietnamese culture differed from Chinese 
culture in several ways, which explains the strong resistance to Chinese power. 
For example, 9ietnamese women enjoyed greater independence in their married 
lives than did Chinese women in the Confucian tradition. While the Chinese 
lived in extended families, the 9ietnamese preferred nuclear families  (just a 
wife, husband, and their children. 9ietnamese villages operated independently 
of a national government political centralization was nonexistent.
Although 9ietnam adopted a merit-based bureaucracy of educated men, 
the 9ietnamese system did not function like the Chinese scholar-bureaucracy. 
Instead of loyalty to the emperor, scholar-officials in 9ietnam owed more 
allegiance to the village peasants. In fact, 9ietnamese scholar-officials often led 
revolts against the government if they deemed it too oppressive. 9ietnamese 
women resented their inferior status under the Chinese. In particularly, they 
rejected the customs of foot binding and polygyny , the practice of having more 
than one wife at the same time. In spite of 9ietnamese efforts to maintain the 
purity of their own culture, sinification did occur.
Military Conflict with China  As the Tang Dynasty began to crumble in 
the 8th century, 9ietnamese rebels pushed out China’s occupying army. In their 
battles against the Chinese, they showed a strong capacity for guerilla warfare, 
perhaps due to their deep knowledge of their own land.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“The Moral Nature
Being upright and modest, reserved and quiet, correct and dignified, sincere 
and honest: these constitute the moral nature of a woman. Being filial and 
respectful, humane and perspicacious >shrewd, wise@, loving and warm, meek

Cultivation of the Self
. . . Now if the self is not cultivated, then virtue will not be established. If 
one’s virtue is not established, rarely can one be an influence for good in 
the family±how much less in the wider world. Therefore, the wife is one 
who follows her husband. The way of husband and wife is the principle of 
the strong and the weak. In the past, the reason why enlightened monarchs 
were careful about establishing marriage was that they valued the way of 
procreation and perpetuation. >The rise and fall of the state is intimately

14 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   C O N T E XTUALIZE HISTORICAL  
DEVELOPMENTS
To contextualize is to look at an event, development, or process in 
history within the situation, or context, in which it occurs. After you 
place events in context, you begin to see themes and patterns emerge 
in history. Historians use these themes and patterns to understand the 
interactions of laws, institutions, culture, events, and people. 
For example, one way to understand the Song Dynasty’s success from 
960 to 1279 is to place its political, social, and economic development 
in the context of what came before and after it. In the context of what 
came before, the imperial bureaucracy represents a political continuity, 
since the bureaucratic system had been in place in earlier dynasties as 
well. However, its modification under the Song to allow more upward 
mobility represents a change. Similarly, considering the Song imperial 
bureaucracy in the economic context of what came after, you might gain 
insights into causation. That is, the cost of supporting the bureaucracy 
drained China of its wealth, which in turn helped create problems that 
led to the decline of the Song Dynasty. Contextualizing also promotes 
understanding of comparisons among different cultures and time 
periods. 
Explain how the passage below provides context for the spread of 
Buddhism in China in light of other developments of the time. 
In 62, a Chinese Buddhist monk named ;uanzang left China to go 
on a pilgrimage to India, the birthplace of Buddhism. He traveled west 
on the Silk Roads to Central Asia, then south and east to India, which 
he reached in 60. Along the way and in India he met many Buddhist 
monks and visited Buddhist shrines. In order to gain more insight into 
Buddhism, he studied for years in Buddhist monasteries and at Nalanda 
University in Bilar, India²a famous center of Buddhist knowledge. 
After 1 years away, ;uanzang finally returned to China, where people 
greeted him as a celebrity. He brought back many Buddhist texts, which 
he spent the rest of his life translating into Chinese. These writings were 
highly instrumental in the growth of Buddhist scholarship in China.

DEVELOPMENTS IN DAR AL-ISLAM 15
1.2
Developments in Dar al-Islam
Allah will admit those who embrace the true faith and do good works  
to gardens watered by running streams.
—The Quran, Chapter 47
Essential Question:   In the period from c. 1200 to c. 1450, how did Islamic 
states arise, and how did major religious systems 
shape society?
After the death of Muhammad  in 62, Islam spread rapidly outward 
from Arabia. Through military actions and the activities of merchants and 
missionaries, Islam’s reach extended from India to Spain. As the quotation 
suggests, many Islamic leaders showed tolerance to Christians, Jews, and 
others who believed in a single god and did good works. Under the Abbasid 
Empire, scholars traveled from far away to Baghdad to study at a renowned 
center of learning known as the House of Wisdom . The Islamic community 
helped transfer knowledge throughout Afro-Eurasia. When the Abbasids 
declined, they were replaced by other Islamic states. 
Invasions and Shifts in Trade Routes
In the 1100s and 1200s, the  Abbasid Empire confronted many challenges. Like 
the Chinese, they had conflicts with nomadic groups in Central Asia. Unlike 
the Chinese, they also confronted European invaders. 
Egyptian Mamluks  Arabs often purchased enslaved people, or Mamluks , 
who were frequently ethnic Turks from Central Asia, to serve as soldiers and 
later as bureaucrats. Because of their roles, Mamluks had more opportunities 
for advancement than did most enslaved people. In Egypt, Mamluks seized 
control of the government, establishing the Mamluk Sultanate (1250–1517). 
They prospered by facilitating trade in cotton and sugar between the Islamic 
world and Europe. However, when the Portuguese and other Europeans 
developed new sea routes for trade, the Mamluks declined in power . 
Seljuk Turks  Another challenge to the Abbasids came from the Central 
Asian Seljuk Turks , who were also Muslims. Starting in the 11th century, they 
began conquering parts of the Middle East, eventually extending their power 
almost as far east as Western China. The Seljuk leader called himself sultan , 
thereby reducing the role of the highest-ranking Abbasid from caliph to chief 
Sunni religious authority.
16 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONCrusaders  The Abbasids allowed Christians to travel easily to and 
from their holy sites in and around Jerusalem. However, the Seljuk Turks 
limited this travel. European Christians organized groups of soldiers, called 
Crusaders , to reopen access. (See Topic 1.6.) 
Mongols  The fourth group to attack the Abbasid Empire were among the 
most famous conquerors in history: the Mongols . (See Topic 2.2.) Like many 
Mamluks and the Seljuk Turks, they came from Central Asia. The Mongols 
conquered the remaining Abbasid Empire in 1258 and ended the Seljuk rule. 
They continued to push westward but were stopped in Egypt by the Mamluks.
Economic Competition  Since the 8th century, the Abbasids had been an 
important link connecting Asia, Europe, and North Africa. Goods and ideas 
flowed from one region to another on trade routes controlled by the Abbasids. 
Many went through Baghdad . However, trade patterns slowly shifted to 
routes farther north. As Baghdad lost its traditional place at the center of trade, 
it lost wealth and population. It could not afford to keep its canals repaired. 
Farmers could not provide enough food for the urban population. Slowly, the 
infrastructure that had made Baghdad a great city fell into decay .
Cultural and Social Life
Over time, the Islamic world fragmented politically. Many of these new states 
adopted Abbasid practices, but they were distinct ethnically. The Abbasid 
Caliphate  was led by Arabs and Persians, but the later Islamic states were 
shaped by Turkic peoples who descended from people in Central Asia. For 
example, the Mamluks in North Africa, the Seljuks in the Middle East, and 
the Delhi Sultanate in South Asia were all at least partially Turkic. By the 
16th century, three large Islamic states had their roots in Turkic cultures: the 
Ottoman Empire in Turkey, the Safavid Empire in Persia, and the Mughal 
Empire in India. See Topic .1. 
However, these Islamic states continued to form a cultural region. Trade 
spread new goods and fresh ideas. The common use of shariah created similar 
legal systems. Great universities in Baghdad, Iraq Cyrdoba, Spain Cairo, 
Egypt and Bukhara in Central Asia created centers for sharing intellectual 
innovations.
Cultural Continuities  Islamic scholars followed the advice of the 
prophet Muhammad: “Go in quest of knowledge even unto China.” By 
learning from many cultures, they carried on the work of earlier thinkers:
• They translated Greek literary classics into Arabic, saving the works 
of Aristotle and other Greek thinkers from oblivion. 
• They studied mathematics texts from India and transferred the 
knowledge to Europeans.
• They adopted techniques for paper-making from China. Through 
them, Europeans learned to make paper. 
17 DEVELOPMENTS IN DAR AL-ISLAM 17Cultural Innovations  In addition to building on the intellectual 
achievements of other cultures, scholars during the “golden age” in Baghdad 
made their own achievements. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi  (1201–1274) was one 
of the most celebrated Islamic scholars. He contributed to astronomy, law, 
logic, ethics, mathematics, philosophy, and medicine. An observatory built 
under his direction was the most advanced in the world and produced the most 
accurate astronomical charts. He studied the relationship between the lengths 
of the sides of a triangle and the angles. This laid the groundwork for making 
trigonometry a separate subject. Medical advances and hospital care improved 
in cities such as Cairo, while doctors and pharmacists studied for examinations 
for licenses that would allow them to practice.
Ibn .haldun 12±106 was well known for his historical accounts and 
is widely acknowledged as a founder of the fields of historiography the study 
of the methods of historians and sociology. 
Sufi poet and mystic ‘A’ishah al-Ba’uniyyah  (1460–1507) may be the 
most prolific female Muslim writer before the 20th century. Her best-known 
work, a long poem honoring Muhammad called “Clear Inspiration, on Praise of 
the Trusted One,” refers to many previous poets, reflecting her broad learning. 
Many of her works describe her journey toward mystical illumination. 
µA’ishah’s poetry reflects a contrast between most Muslims and Sufis. 
Unlike Muslims who focused on intellectual pursuits, such as the study of the 
Quran, Sufis emphasized introspection to grasp truths that they believed could 
not be understood through learning. Sufism may have begun as a mystical 
response to the perceived love of luxury by the early Umayyad Caliphate.
Sufi missionaries played an important role in the spread of Islam. They 
tended to adapt to local cultures and traditions, sometimes interweaving local 
religious elements into Islam, and in this way they won many converts.  
Commerce, Class, and Diversity  Helping to power the golden age of 
natural and moral philosophy and the arts was commerce. Islamic society 
viewed merchants as more prestigious than did other societies in Europe and 
Asia at the time. Muhammad himself had been a merchant, as had his first 
wife. With the revival of trade on Silk Roads, merchants could grow rich from 
their dealings across the Indian Ocean and Central Asia. They were esteemed 
as long as they maintained fair dealings and gave to charity in accord with the 
pillars of the Islamic faith. Some merchants were even sent out as missionaries.  
In the non-Arab areas of Islamic expansion, control by Islamic caliphs led 
to discrimination against non-Arabs, though rarely to open persecution. This 
discrimination gradually faded in the th century. The caliph’s soldiers were 
forbidden to own territory they had conquered. The presence of a permanent 
military force that kept order but did not own property allowed life for most 
of the inhabitants of the countryside to remain virtually unchanged. However, 
people paid tribute to Islamic caliphs rather than to Byzantine rulers.
Slavery  Islam prohibited Muslims from enslaving other Muslims or 
monotheists such as Jews, Christians, and =oroastrians. See Prologue. 
However, it permitted enslaving others. Muslims often imported enslaved 
18 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONpeople from Africa, .ievan Rus present-day Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, 
and Central Asia, but the institution of hereditary slavery had not developed. 
Many enslaved people converted to Islam, after which their owners freed them. 
Enslaved women might find themselves serving as concubines to Islamic 
men who already had wed their allotment of four wives. They were allowed 
more independence²for example, to go to markets and to run errands²than 
the legal wives. Only enslaved women were permitted to dance or perform 
musically before unrelated men. This opportunity to earn money sometimes 
enabled females in slavery to accumulate enough to buy their freedom. 
Free Women in Islam
Some practices now associated with Islam were common cultural customs in 
Central Asia and the Byzantine Empire before the time of Muhammad. For 
example, women often covered their heads and faces. This practice solidified 
under Islam, with most women observing  hijab,  a term that can refer either to 
the practice of dressing modestly or to a specific type of covering. Men often 
wore head coverings, from turbans to skull caps. While women could study 
and read, they were not to do so in the company of men not related to them.
Muhammad’s Policies  Muhammad raised the status of women in several 
ways. He treated his wives with love and devotion. He insisted that dowries, 
the payments prospective husbands made to secure brides, be paid to the 
future wife rather than to her father. He forbade female infanticide, the killing 
of newborn girls. Muhammad’s first wife was educated and owned her own 
business, which set a pattern for the recognition of women’s abilities. 
The Status of Women  Overall, Islamic women enjoyed a higher status 
than Christian or Jewish women. Islamic women were allowed to inherit 
property and retain ownership after marriage. They could remarry if widowed, 
and they could receive a cash settlement if divorced. Under some conditions, 
a wife could initiate divorce. Moreover, women could practice birth control. 
Islamic women who testified in a court under shariah see Topic . were to 
be protected from retaliation, but their testimony was worth only half that of 
a man. One gap in the historical record is written evidence of how women 
viewed their position in society: most of the records created before 150 were 
written by men.
The rise of towns and cities in Islamic-ruled areas resulted in new 
limitations on women’s rights, just as it did in other cultures. The new status 
of women might best be symbolized by the veil and the harem, a  dwelling set 
aside for wives, concubines, and the children of these women.
Islamic Rule in Spain
While the Umayyads ruled only briefly in the Middle East, they kept power 
longer in Spain. In 11, after Muslim forces had defeated Byzantine armies 
across North Africa, they successfully invaded Spain from the south. They 
designated Cyrdoba as their capital for Spain. 
19 DEVELOPMENTS IN DAR AL-ISLAMBattle of Tours  The Islamic military was turned back in 2 when it lost 
the Battle of Tours against Frankish forces. This defeat, rare for Islamic armies 
during the 00s, marked the limit of rapid Islamic expansion into Western 
Europe. Most of the continent remained Christian, but Muslims ruled Spain 
for the next seven centuries. (Connect:  In a paragraph, compare the status of 
women in Chinese society to the status of women in Islamic society in the 
period c. 1200 to c. 1450.)
Prosperity Under Islam  Like the Abbasids in Baghdad, the Umayyad 
rulers in Cyrdoba created a climate of toleration, with Muslims, Christians, 
and Jews coexisting peacefully. They also promoted trade, allowing Chinese 
and Southeast Asian products to enter into Spain and thus into the rest of 
Europe. Many of the goods in this trade traveled aboard ships called dhows. 
These ships, first developed in India or China, had long, thin hulls that made 
them excellent for carrying goods, though less useful for conducting warfare. 
Cultural and Scholarly Transfers  The Islamic state in Spain, known 
as al-Andalus, became a center of learning. Cyrdoba had the largest library in 
the world at the time. Among the famous scholars from Spain was Ibn Rushd , 
known in Europe as Averroes 12th century. He wrote influential works on 
law, secular philosophy, and the natural sciences. 
The Muslims, Christians, and Jews living in al-Andalus²all “people of 
the book” as Muslims regarded them²not only tolerated one another but also 
influenced one another. For example, Ibn Rushd’s commentaries on Aristotle 
influenced the Jewish philosopher Maimonides c. 115±c. 120. Maimonides 
developed a synthesis of Aristotle’s reasoning and biblical interpretation. He, 
in turn, influenced Christian philosophers, including St. Thomas Aquinas 
1225±12. Islamic scholarship and scientific innovations, along with the 
knowledge transferred from India and China, laid the groundwork for the 
Renaissance and Scientific Revolution in Europe. For example, making paper, 
a technology developed in China and taught to Europeans by Muslims, was 
vital to spreading ideas in Europe.

that follows.
“I paid a visit to the tomb of John the son of =echariah >a figure in the Christian 
Bible@²God’s blessing on both of them²in the village of Sebastea in the 
province of Nablus >a region in the Middle East near the Jordan River@. After 
saying my prayers, I came out into the square that was bounded on one side 
by the Holy Precinct >a place of worship@. I found a half-closed gate, opened it 
and entered a church. Inside were about ten old men, their bare heads as white 
as combed cotton. They were facing east, and wore on their chests >wooden

oath on this sign and gave hospitality to those who needed it. The sight of 
their piety touched my heart, but at the same time it displeased and saddened 
me, for I had never seen such zeal and devotion among the Muslims. 
For some time I brooded on this experience, until one day, as Mu’in ad-Din

Old Men >people who practice severe self-discipline@.’
‘Certainly,’ I replied, and we dismounted and went into a long building set at 
an angle to the road. For the moment I thought there was no one there. Then 
I saw about a hundred prayer mats, and on each a sufi, his face expressing 
peaceful serenity, and his body humble devotion. This was a reassuring sight, 
and I gave thanks to Almighty God that there were among the Muslims men 
of even more zealous devotion than those Christian priests. Before this I had 
never seen sufis in their monastery, and was ignorant of the way they lived.”

Unit 1 is called “The Global Tapestry” to suggest that world history 
is a complex interweaving of different threads from different parts of 
the world at different times. However, to fully appreciate the whole, 
historians try to unravel the tapestry thread by thread to see just how each 
fits in. As they do, they use such historical concepts  as change, continuity, 
perspective, cause and effect, significance, and empathy. Applying 
these concepts, they come to understand historical developments ²
patterns of changes or growth over time. To see these patterns, they look 
at subjects in historical context²how did they start out, and what did 
they become over time" Historians also try to understand the historical 
processes  that made certain developments possible, such as migration, 
industrialization, conquest, and state building.

Developments in South and 
Southeast Asia
What the books taught me, I’ve practised.  
What they didn’t teach me, I’ve taught myself.  
I’ve gone into the forest and wrestled with the lion.  
I didn’t get this far by teaching one thing and doing another.
—Lal Ded (1320–1392)
Essential Question:   How did various beliefs and practices in South and 
Southeast Asia affect society and the development  
of states?
The poetry of Lal Ded, known as Mother Lalla, illustrates a major cross-
interaction between religious traditions that shaped the history of South and 
Southern Asia. She was born in .ashmir, a region of northern India. While a 
Hindu, her emphasis on experience appealed to many Muslims, particularly 
Sufis. The interaction of Hindus and Muslims, though sometimes violent,  
created dynamic developments in religious thought, politics, economics, art, 
and architecture. Despite the strong Islamic presence in the region, local Hindu 
kingdoms continued to play a major role in India’s decentralized political 
landscape. A third religion, Buddhism, also had a strong presence in the area, 
particularly in the Sinhala dynasties in present-day Sri Lanka and the great 
kingdoms of Southeast Asia. 
Political Structures in South Asia
South Asia was only occasionally united as a single state in its history. After 
the Gupta Dynasty that had dominated South Asia collapsed in 550, ending 
the so-called Golden Age or Classical Era of Indian history, disunity returned 
to the region for most of the next 1,000 years. Northern and southern India 
developed separate political structures. However, Hinduism provided some 
cultural unity throughout the region. Many people combined their own local 
faith tradition with adherence to the same scriptures and core beliefs respected 
throughout the region. 
Political Structures in Southern India  Southern India was more stable 
than northern India. The first kingdom, the Chola Dynasty, reigned over 
southern India for more than 00 years 850±126. During the 11th century, 
24 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONthe dynasty extended its rule to Ceylon, the large island just south of India. 
(Today it is known as Sri Lanka.) 
The second kingdom, the Vijayanagara Empire 16 –1646)  took its 
name from the word for “the victorious city.” It began with the arrival of two 
brothers, Harihara and Bukka, from the Delhi Sultanate in north-central India. 
They were sent to the area because the Delhi Sultanate wished to extend its 
rule to southern India. These brothers had been born as Hindus and converted 
to Islam for the sake of upward mobility. When they left the region controlled 
by the Delhi Sultanate, they once again embraced the religion of their birth 
and established their own Hindu kingdom. The 9ijayanagar Empire existed 
from the mid-100s until the mid-1500s, when a group of Muslim kingdoms 
overthrew it.
Political Structures in Northern India  Northern India experienced a 
great deal more upheaval than did southern India. After the fall of the Gupta 
Empire (see Prologue ), the Rajput kingdoms gradually formed in northern 
India and present-day Pakistan. These were Hindu kingdoms led by leaders 
of numerous clans who were often at war with one another. Because of the 
competition among clans, no centralized government arose, once again 
demonstrating the diversity and the regionalism of South Asia. The lack of a 
centralized power left the kingdoms vulnerable to Muslim attacks.
While the Himalayas protected India from invasions from the north and 
east, mountain passes in the northwest allowed invasions by Muslim armies. 
Each attack disrupted a region that had been mostly Hindu and Buddhist. Over 
time, the Islamic presence in the region grew:
• In the 8th century, Islamic armies invaded what is today Pakistan. 
However, they brought little change to everyday life. Located on the 
eastern fringes of the Dar al-Islam, the region was isolated from the 
center of the culture. In addition, the Rajput princes skillfully wielded 
their power to limit the Muslim conquerors’ influence.
• In the 11th century, Islamic forces plundered northern India’s Hindu 
temples and Buddhist shrines for their riches. In addition, they erected 
mosques on Hindu and Buddhist holy sites²much to the anger of 
followers of those faiths. 
In the early 1th century, Islamic forces managed to conquer the city of 
Delhi and much of the northern portion of South Asia. Bringing Islam into 
India, the Delhi Sultanate  reigned for 00 years, from the 1th through the 16th 
centuries. The interaction of Islam and Hinduism in northern India dominated 
the political history of the era. While some Hindus converted to Islam, others 
resented  Muslims and considered them foreigners. One factor contributing to 
this resentment was that the Delhi Sultanate imposed a tax, called the jizya, on 
all non-Muslim subjects of the empire. 
Throughout its reign, the Delhi Sultanate never organized an efficient 
bureaucracy in the style of the Chinese. For this reason, sultans had difficulty 
imposing their policies in a land as vast and diverse as India. Despite the strong 
25 DEVELOPMENTS IN SO UTH AN D SOUTHEAST ASIA 25Islamic presence in the region, local kingdoms continued to play a major role 
in India’s decentralized political landscape.
The sultans wanted to extend their rule southward. Before they succeeded, 
though, they became focused on defending themselves from an onslaught 
by the Mongol army from the northwest. The Delhi Sultanate prevented the 
Mongols themselves from conquering South Asia. However, in 1526, the 
sultans lost power to a new empire, the Mughals, whose leaders did trace their 
ancestry to the Mongols. 
Religion in South Asia
Religion always held a dominant place in South Asian history. Before the 
arrival of Islam, most South Asians practiced Hinduism, while a smaller 
number identified themselves as Buddhists. South Asians encountered a 
starkly different religion when Islam arrived. 
• Hindus pray to many gods, while Islam is strictly monotheistic. 
• Hindu temples and artwork are replete with pictures of deities, while 
Muslims disapprove of any visual representation of Allah. 
• Hinduism was associated with a hierarchical caste system, while Islam 
has always called for the equality of all believers. 
• Hindus recognize several sacred texts, while Muslims look to only the 
Quran for spiritual guidance.
The Arrival of Islam  The relationship between Hindus and Muslims 
shaped the history of South Asia beginning in the th century, and it continues 
to shape regional culture and politics today. Islam initially entered India 
forcefully yet eventually took on a more peaceful approach. But while Islam 
was a universalizing religion, one that wanted to proselytize , or actively seek 
converts, Muslim rulers found early in their reign that forcing their Hindu and 
Buddhist subjects to convert was not successful. Thus, most converts came to 
Islam voluntarily. Many Muslim merchants in the Indian Ocean trade moved 
to Indian port cities and married. Their wives often ended up converting to 
their husband’s religion. 
With its emphasis on the equality of all believers, Islam also attracted 
low-caste Hindus who hoped that conversion would improve their social 
status. In this sense, Islam in India was like Christianity in the Roman Empire. 
Both appealed to the people who suffered the most under the existing social 
structure. 
The largest numbers of converts to Islam, however, were Buddhists. 
Corruption among the monks and raids on monasteries by early Muslim 
conquerors left the Buddhist religion disorganized. The spread of Islam helped 
make Buddhism a minority religion in its place of birth. (Connect: Make an 
outline comparing the spread of Islam in South Asia to the spread of Buddhism 
in China. See Topic 1.1.)
26 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONSocial Structures in South Asia
The arrival of Islam did little to alter the basic structure of society in South 
Asia. India’s caste system is its strongest historical continuity. While obviously 
inequitable, it lent stability to a politically decentralized land. The caste system 
was flexible and able to accommodate newcomers. Muslim merchants and 
migrants, even though they were not Hindu, found a place for themselves 
within the caste hierarchy based on their occupation. These subcastes based 
on occupation operated like workers’ guilds, soon becoming absorbed into the 
social fabric of Indian society. Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the caste 
system in South Asia to the social structures in China in the period from 1200 
to 1450. See Topic 1.1.)
At the same time, most of those who tried to escape the grip of the caste 
system failed. The low-caste Hindus who converted to Islam as a way to improve 
their social status usually did not achieve that goal. Individuals required more 
education and opportunities for better jobs, not just a new religion, to help 
them escape their low status in life. 
As Islam spread, Muslims varied how they applied its core teachings, 
depending on their culture before converting. For example, Islam did not alter 
gender relations greatly. In South Asia, women in the Hindu tradition were 
confined to a separate social sphere, and Islamic women received similar 
treatment. In Southeast Asia, women enjoyed more independence before the 
arrival of Islam. This pattern continued as people became Muslims. Thus, 
converts in South and Southeast Asia found ways to accommodate a new faith, 
but most people did not reject their traditions in the process.
Cultural Interactions in South Asia
People in South Asia and the Middle East shared their intellectual and 
cultural achievements with each other. For example, Arab astronomers 
and mathematicians added to the body of knowledge begun by their Indian 
counterparts. Indian developments in algebra and geometry were translated 
into Arabic, and spread throughout Dar al-Islam. One result of this movement 
of ideas was that the numeral system referred to in the West as “Arabic 
numerals,” actually originated in India.
In India itself, sultans erected buildings melding the intricate artistic details 
of Hindu art with the geometric patterns preferred by Islamic architecture. The 
city of Delhi is filled with examples of Islamic architecture built during the Delhi 
Sultanate. One famous example, the Qutub Minar , stands in the southern part 
of the city. Rulers from the Delhi Sultanate built an elaborate mosque on top 
of a Hindu temple and used materials for the mosque from nearby Hindu and 
other religious shrines. Towering over the mosque is the Qutub Minar itself, a 
gigantic leaning tower, the tallest structure in India today. Historians debate the 
reason for its construction one obvious function is its presence as a symbol of 
Islamic influence and, at one time, dominance of northern India. 
27 DEVELOPMENTS IN SO UTH AN D SOUTHEAST ASIAAn entirely new language developed among Muslims of South Asia: 
Urdu . Urdu melded the grammatical pattern of Hindi the language of 
Northern Indians, and with the vocabulary of Arabic and some elements 
of Farsi the language of Persians. Today, Urdu is the official language of 
Pakistan. 
The Bhakti Movement  Beginning in the 12th century, some Hindus 
began to draw upon traditional teachings about the importance of emotion in 
their spiritual life. Rather than emphasize studying texts or performing rituals, 
they focused on developing a strong attachment to a particular deity. This 
development, known as the Bhakti Movement , started in southern India. It  
was especially appealing to many believers because it did not discriminate 
against women or people of low social status. For example, one of the most 
famous figures of the Bhakti Movement would be a female, the poet  Mira Bai, 
who lived in the 16th century.
Though the bhaktis were Hindus, they were similar in some ways to 
Sufi Muslims. Both groups were mystical movements, ones that emphasized 
inner reflection in order to achieve a direct personal relationship with a deity. 
Because they placed less emphasis on strict adherence to traditional rituals 
and beliefs, bhaktis and Sufis each appealed to people outside their traditions. 
Just as the Sufis helped spread Islam, the Bhaktis helped spread Hinduism.

28 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONSoutheast Asia
Like China, South Asia strongly influenced its neighbors, particularly the 
lands of Southeast Asia²today’s Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, 
Laos, and 9ietnam. Indian merchants had contact with these Southeast Asian 
lands as early as 500 B.C.E. The merchants sold gold, silver, metal goods, 
and textiles in the region and brought back its fine spices. Trade voyages 
introduced the Indian religions of Hinduism and Buddhism to Southeast Asia.  
Much of the region became and remains today mostly Buddhist. The region, 
like Southwest Asia, was strategically significant. Whoever controlled this 
region could influence the valuable trade between South Asia and East Asia. 
Sea-Based Kingdoms  Because Southeast Asia was so important, several 
kingdoms emerged there. Two were particularly long-lasting:  
• The Srivijaya Empire  (670–1025) was a Hindu kingdom based on 
Sumatra. It built up its navy and prospered by charging fees for ships 
traveling between India and China. 
• The Majapahit Kingdom  12±1520 based on Java had 8 
tributaries at its height. Like Srivijaya, Majapahit sustained its power 
by controlling sea routes. Unlike Srivijaya, Majapahit was Buddhist. 
Land-Based Kingdoms  Other kingdoms in Southeast Asia drew power 
from their control over land. The Sinhala dynasties in Sri Lanka had their 
roots in the arrival of early immigrants, most likely merchants, from north 
India. Buddhists arrived in the rd century B.C.E. and the island became a 
center of Buddhist study. Monasteries and nunneries flourished. Both men and 
women found a life of contemplation and simple living attractive. 
Buddhism was so deeply embedded that Buddhist priests often served as 
advisors to the monarchs. The government of one of the kingdoms oversaw 
the construction of a network of reservoirs and canals to create an excellent 
irrigation system, which contributed to economic growth. However, attacks 
by invaders from India and conflicts between the monarchy and the priests 
ultimately weakened the kingdoms.
The Khmer Empire , also known as the Angkor .ingdom 802±11, was 
situated near the Mekong River and also did not depend on maritime prowess 
for its power. The kingdom’s complex irrigation and drainage systems led 
to economic prosperity, making it one of the most prosperous kingdoms in 
Southeast Asia. Irrigation allowed farmers to harvest rice crops several times 
a year, and drainage systems reduced the impact of the heavy monsoon rains. 
The Khmer capital was at Angkor Thom. The temples there showed the 
variety of Indian cultural influences on Southeast Asia. Hindu artwork and 
sculptures of deities abounded. But at some point the .hmer rulers became 
Buddhist. Starting in the 12th and 1th centuries, they added Buddhist 
sculptures and artwork to the temples without destroying any of the Hindu 
artwork. 
29 DEVELOPMENTS IN SO UTH AN D SOUTHEAST ASIADuring the same period and only one-half mile from Angkor Thom, rulers 
constructed the ornate and majestic Buddhist temple complex of Angkor Wat. 
In 11, the Thais of the Sukhothai Kingdom  invaded the area, forcing the 
.hmers out. Nevertheless, ruins of the magnificent structures in Angkor Thom 
and Angkor Wat still stand, testifying not only to the sophistication of Southeast 
Asian culture but also to the powerful influence of Indian culture on the region.  
Islam  Islam’s movement into the Indian Ocean region paralleled its 
expansion elsewhere. The first Southeast Asian Muslims were local merchants, 
who converted in the 700s, hoping to have better trading relations with the 
Islamic merchants who arrived on their shores. Islam was most popular in 
urban areas at the time. Islam spread to Sumatra, Java, and the Malay Peninsula. 
Today, Indonesia includes more Muslims than any other country. 
Sufis Sufis  also did missionary work in Southeast Asia. (See Topic 1.2.) 
Because of their tolerance for local faiths, people felt comfortable converting 
to Islam. They could be Muslims and still honor local deities.

32 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:  IDENTIFY  CLAIMS
A claim is a statement asserted to be true. It differs from provable fact, 
such as “Baghdad was the largest city in the Abbasid Empire” or simple 
preference, such as “World history is more interesting than algebra.” 
Instead, in modern scholarship, a claim expresses a viewpoint with 
which thoughtful people can reasonably disagree. It forms the basis of 
an argument ²reasoning backed up with evidence. 
A claim is often a somewhat general statement that reflects a 
judgment shaped by the point of view of the writer. In some historical 
texts with a clear bias, the claim may simply be the author’s main 
idea, and it may be based more on opinion or overgeneralization than 
rigorous reasoning. In modern scholarship, however, claims should be 
grounded in facts and informed opinions. While claims are general, the 
evidence used to support them should be specific.
Reread the excerpt by the Muslim scholar Al-Beruni on page 30. 
Determine which sentence below best expresses his claim by looking 
for the most general statement. Then explain whether the claim is 
based on informed opinions or overgeneralizations.

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS 33

Developments in the Americas 
I love the song of the mockingbird,  
Bird of four hundred voices,  
I love the color of jade  
And the intoxicating scent of flowers,  
But more than all I love my brother, man!
—Nezahualcoyotl (1402–1472), Aztec poet 
Essential Question:   What states developed in the Americas, and how did 
they change over time?
Following the decline of the Olmecs in Mesoamerica and the Chavin in the 
Andes,  new civilizations, such as the Mayans, the Aztecs, and the Incas rose in 
the same regions. In addition, the first large-scale civilization in North America 
developed. As in Afro-Eurasia, several of these civilizations developed strong 
states, large urban centers, and complex belief systems. Current knowledge 
about these civilizations combines archaeological evidence, oral traditions, 
and writings by Europeans who came to the Americas after 12. One poem 
recorded by the Spanish was the one above from an Aztec writer. 
The Mississippian Culture
The first large-scale civilization in North America emerged in the 00s or 800s 
in what is now the eastern United States. Since it started in the Mississippi 
River 9alley, it is known as the Mississippian culture. While other cultures 
built monumental buildings, Mississippians built enormous earthen mounds, 
some of which were as tall as 100 feet and covered an area the size of 12 
football fields. The largest of these mounds is Cahokia , located in southern 
Illinois.
Government and Society  The Mississippian society had a rigid class 
structure. A chief called the Great Sun ruled each large town. Below the Great 
Sun was an upper class of priests and nobles and a lower class of farmers, 
hunters, merchants, and artisans. At the bottom were enslaved people, who 
usually were prisoners of war. In general, women farmed and men hunted. The 
Mississippians had a matrilineal society , which means that social standing 
was determined by the woman’s side of the family. For example, when the 
Great Sun died, the title passed not to his own son, but to a sister’s son.
34 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe Decline of Mississippian Civilization  People abandoned Cahokia 
around 1450, and other large Mississippian cities by 1600. Historians disagree 
on why the Mississippian people moved. One theory posits that flooding or 
other weather extremes caused crop failures and the collapse of the agricultural 
economy needed to sustain the populations of the large cities. Another theory 
suggests that diseases introduced by the Europeans decimated the population.
Chaco and Mesa Verde
Soon after the rise of the Mississippian Civilization, various cultures emerged 
in what is now the southwestern United States. Living in a dry region, people  
developed ways to collect, transport, and store water efficiently. In addition, 
because of the climate, trees were small and scarce, so people had little wood 
to use to build homes. Two cultures became well-known for their innovations:
• The Chaco built large housing structures using stones and clay, some of 
which included hundreds of rooms.
• The people of Mesa 9erde built multi-story homes into the sides of 
cliffs using bricks made of sandstone. 
Both groups declined in the late 1th century as the climate became drier .
The Maya City-States
Mayan civilization reached its height between 250 and 00 C.E. Mayans 
stretched over the southern part of Mexico and much of what is now Belize, 
Honduras, and Guatemala. Most lived in or near one of the approximately 0 
cities that ranged in size from 5,000 to 50,000 people. At its peak, as many as 
2 million Mayans populated the region.  
Mayan Government  The main form of Mayan government was the 
city-state , each ruled by a king and consisting of a city and its surrounding 
territory. Most rulers were men. However, when no male heir was available 
or old enough to govern, Mayan women ruled. Wars between city-states were 
common. At times, city-states were overthrown. However, Mayans rarely 
fought to control territory. More often they fought to gain tribute²payments 
from the conquered to the conqueror²and captives to be used as human 
sacrifices  during religious ceremonies. 
Each Mayan king claimed to be descended from a god. The Mayans 
believed that when the king died, he would become one with his ancestor-
god. The king directed the activities of the elite scribes and priests who 
administered the affairs of the state. Royal rule usually passed from father to 
son, but kings who lost the support of the people were sometimes overthrown. 
The common people were required to pay taxes, usually in the form of crops, 
and to provide labor to the government. City-states had no standing armies, so 
when war erupted, governments required citizens to provide military service. 
No central government ruled all Mayan lands, although often one city-state 
was the strongest in a region and would dominate its neighbors.
35 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS 35Mayan Religion, Science, and Technology  The Mayans were innovative 
thinkers and inventors. For example, they incorporated the concept of zero into 
their number system, developed a complex writing system, and learned to make 
rubber out of liquid collected from rubber plants. 
Mayan science and religion were linked through astronomy. Based on the 
calendar, priests decided when to celebrate religious ceremonies and whether 
to go to war. As a result, keeping an accurate calendar was very important. 
Although the Mayans had no telescopes, they made very precise observatories 
atop pyramids such as the one at Chichen Itza. Their observations enabled 
priests to design a calendar more accurate than any used in Europe at the time.
One task of priests, who could be either male or female, was to conduct 
ceremonies honoring many deities. Among the most important deities were 
those of the sun, rain, and corn. Mayans made offerings to the gods so prayers 
might be answered. War captives were sometimes killed as offerings. (Connect: 
Compare the political structures of the Mayans with the political structures of 
South Asia. See Topic 1..

Mayan pyramids, with steps going up the side, were similar to Mesopotamian ziggurats. Similarly 
shaped architecture can be found from Spain and Algeria to China and Indonesia.  
The Aztecs
The Aztecs, also known as the Mexicas , were originally hunter-gatherers who 
migrated to central Mexico from the north in the 1200s. In 125, they founded 
their capital Tenochtitlin on the site of what is now Mexico City. Over the next 
100 years, they conquered the surrounding peoples and created an empire that 
stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. 
Capital City  The Aztecs located Tenochtitlin on an island in the middle of 
a swampy lake in order to protect it from attacks. Tenochtitlin grew to almost 
200,000 people, making it one of the largest cities in the world. To provide 
water for the city, they built a network of aqueducts. At the center of the city, 
the Aztecs built a pyramid that rose 150 feet into the air. This Great Pyramid and 
other pyramids, temples, and palaces were made of stone. On Lake Texcoco, the 
Aztecs built floating gardens called chinampas  to increase the amount of space 
for food production. The Aztecs dug ditches to use lake water to irrigate their 
fields and to drain parts of the lake for more land.  
36 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONGovernment, Economy, and Society  As the Aztecs conquered much of 
Mesoamerica, they developed a tribute system that insured their dominance. 
Conquered people were forced to pay tribute, surrender lands, and perform 
military service. Tribute included practical goods such as food, cloth, and 
firewood, as well as luxury items such as feathers, beads, and jewelry. The 
Aztecs allowed local rulers to stay in their positions to serve as tribute collectors. 
This allowed Aztec political dominance without direct administrative control. 
In exchange, the conquered people were extended Aztec protection. 
To administer the empire, the Aztecs grouped city-states into provinces. 
They moved warriors and their families to each province’s capital to make 
sure the province remained under Aztec control. In addition, an Aztec official 
was stationed in each capital to collect tribute from local officials. 
Aztec government was a theocracy , which is rule by religious leaders. At 
the top was the emperor, known as the Great Speaker, who was the political 
ruler as well as a divine representative of the gods. Next in the social hierarchy 
were land-owning nobles, who also formed the majority of Aztec military 
leadership. Next in rank were scribes and healers, followed by craftspeople 
and traders. A special merchant class called pochteca traded in luxury goods. 
Below the traders were the peasants and soldiers. Aztec people could be 
enslaved as well, usually because they did not pay their debts or were being 
punished for crimes. Besides being used for labor, enslaved people were also 
offered up as sacrifices in religious ceremonies. 
Religion  The intricate and complex religion of the Aztecs was central 
to their society. They worshipped an ever-evolving pantheon of hundreds of 
deities, many of whom were considered to have both male and female aspects. Source:  DEQG DAGLIORTI Granger, NYC 
The construction of chinampas in Mesoamerica was one way people expanded the land on which 
to grow crops.

37 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS Worship among the Aztecs involved a great many rituals and feast days as 
well as human sacrifices. The Aztecs believed that the gods had sacrificed 
themselves in order to create the world²thus human sacrifice and blood-
letting was a sort of repayment and atonement for human sin. Human sacrifice 
probably had a political component, in the sense that it demonstrated the 
great might of the Aztec Empire in dramatic fashion. The number of human 
sacrifices may never be known. Much of the information about Aztec society 
comes from Spanish invaders, who may have exaggerated the extent of human 
sacrifice in order to make the Aztecs seem more deserving of conquest. 
Role of Women  Women played an important role in the Aztec tribute 
system since they wove the valuable cloth that local rulers demanded as part 
of the regular tribute. As the demand for cloth tribute increased, an Aztec 
husband might obtain more than one wife in order to be able to pay the tribute. 
While most Aztec women worked in their homes, some became priestesses, 
midwives, healers, or merchants. A few noblewomen worked as scribes to 
female members of royal families. Therefore, at least these few women knew 
how to read and write.
The Decline of the Aztecs  By the late 15th century, the Aztec Empire 
was in decline. The Aztecs’ comparatively low level of technology²such as 
the lack of wheeled vehicles and pack animals²meant that agriculture was 
arduous and inefficient. The Aztecs’ commitment to military victory and the 
constant desire for more human sacrifices induced the leadership to expand the 
empire beyond what it could reasonably govern. Finally, the extraction from 
conquered people of tribute and sacrifice victims inspired more resentment 
than loyalty. Because of this resentment, many tribes ruled by the Aztecs 
were ready to rebel if they thought they had an opportunity to succeed. This 
opportunity would come later, when Spaniards arrived in 1519.
The Inca
In 18, a tribal leader who called himself Pachacuti , which means 
“transformer” or “shaker” of the earth, began conquering the tribes living 
near what is now Cuzco, Peru. His military victories, followed by those of 
his son, combined the small tribes into a full-fledged state, the Incan Empire . 
It extended from present-day Ecuador in the north to Chile in the south. By 
1, Pachacuti’s grandson, Huayna Capac, ruled the empire. He  focused on 
consolidating and managing the many lands conquered by his predecessors. 
Government, Economy, and Society  In order to rule the extensive 
territory efficiently, the Incan Empire was split into four provinces, each with 
its own governor and bureaucracy. Conquered leaders who demonstrated 
loyalty to the empire were rewarded. In contrast to the people living under the 
Aztecs, conquered people under the Inca did not have to pay tribute. Rather, 
they were subject to the mit’a system , mandatory public service. Men between 
the ages of 15 and 50 provided agricultural and other forms of labor, including 
the construction of roads. 
38 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONReligion  The name Inca means “people of the sun,” and Inti, the sun 
god, was the most important of the Incan gods. Inca rulers were considered 
to be Inti’s representative on the earth. As the center of two critical elements 
in Incan religion²honoring of the sun and royal ancestor veneration²the 
Temple of the Sun  in Cuzco formed the core of Incan religion. 
Royal ancestor veneration was a practice intended to extend the rule of 
a leader. Dead rulers were mummified and continued to “rule” as they had 
in life and were thought to retain ownership of their servants, possessions, 
and property. Thus, Incan rulers could not expect to inherit land or property 
upon assuming power. This practice was a partial motivator for the constant 
expansion of the empire. 
Priests were consulted before important actions. To the Inca, the gods 
controlled all things, and priests could determine the gods’ will by studying the 
arrangement of coca leaves in a dish or by watching the movement of a spider. 
Priests diagnosed illnesses, predicted the outcome of battles, solved crimes, 
and determined what sacrifices should be made to which god. Serious events 
such as famines, plagues, and defeat in war called for human sacrifices²
although scholars do not believe that human sacrifice was practiced with the 
same frequency as it probably was with the Aztecs. 
Inca religion included some animism ²the belief that elements of the 
physical world could have supernatural powers. Called huaca, they could be 
large geographical features such as a river or a mountain peak. Or, they could 
be very small objects such as a stone, a plant, or a built object , such as a bridge. 
Achievements  In mathematics, the Inca developed the quipu,  a system of 
knotted strings used to record numerical information for trade and engineering 
and for recording messages to be carried throughout the empire. In agriculture, 
the Inca developed sophisticated terrace systems for the cultivation of crops 
such as potatoes and maize. The terraces utilized a technique called waru 
waru , raised beds with channels that captured and redirected rain to avoid 
erosion during floods and that stored water to be used during dry periods. 
The Inca were especially good builders of bridges and roads. Using captive 
labor, they constructed a massive roadway system called the Carpa Nan , with 
some 25,000 miles of roads used mainly by the government and military. In a 
mountainous region, bridges were particularly important.
Decline  Upon the arrival of Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro in 
152, the Incan Empire was in the midst of a civil war of succession after 
the death of emperor Huayna Capac. Some scholars believe that the civil war 
weakened the Incan army, making it easier for Pizarro’s forces to prevail. 
Others believe that other factors such as diseases introduced by the Europeans 
led to the decline. In 15, the Spanish conquered the core of the empire, 
although outposts held out until 152. Today, the Inca ruins at Machu Picchu 
are one of the most-visited sites in the world. 
39 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS Continuities and Diversity
Historians have debated how closely Mesoamerican cultures are related to 
one another. Many argue that most are based on the Olmec civilization, since 
many later cultures adopted some of its features. For example, the Olmecs’ 
feathered snake-god became fundamental in both the Mayan and Aztec 
religion. The subjects depicted on Olmec pottery have been found in pottery 
in other civilizations. The Olmecs’ ritual sacrifices, pyramids, and ball courts 
were also continued in other cultures. Other historians argue that different 
cultures developed complex civilizations more or less independently .

41 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“Unluckily, the accounts of Spanish authors concerning Maya mythology do 
not agree with the representations of the gods delineated >described precisely@ 
in the codices. That the three codices have a mythology in common is certain. 
Again, great difficulty is found in comparing the deities of the codices with 
those represented by the carved and stucco bas-reliefs of the Maya region. 
It will thus be seen that very considerable difficulties beset the student in 
this mythological sphere. So few data have yet been collected regarding 
the Maya mythology that to dogmatize >represent as absolute truth@ upon 
any subject connected with it would indeed be rash >impulsive@. But much 
has been accomplished in the past few decades, and evidence is slowly but 
surely accumulating from which sound conclusions can be drawn.”

Developments In Africa
After that the chief of the poets mounts the steps of the pempi [a raised 
platform on which the ruler sits] and lays his head on the sultan’s lap, then 
climbs to the top of the pempi and lays his head first on the sultan’ s right 
shoulder and then on his left, speaking all the while in their tongue, and finally 
he comes down again. I was told that this practice is a very old custom 
amongst them, prior to the introduction of Islam, and that they have kept it up.
—Ibn Battuta, c. 1352
Essential Question:   How and why did states develop in Africa and  
change over time? 
Ibn Battuta’s commentary on Mali society sheds light on the cultural forces at 
work in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1th century. A scholar from Morocco 
on the northwest coast of Africa, he was well versed in Islamic law, also known 
as shariah. Islamic governments in Mogadishu east Africa and Delhi India 
sought his advice and welcomed him to their lands. Ibn Battuta’s travelogue 
demonstrated how Islam’s phenomenal growth increased connections among 
cultures of Asia, Africa, and southern Europe. As Ibn Battuta’s account makes 
clear, African societies that had adopted Islam kept many of their traditions. 
Some parts of Africa resisted Islam. To better defend themselves against 
attacks by Islamic forces, they built churches with labyrinths, reservoirs, and 
tunnels. Other parts of the continent, especially in the south, had little contact 
with Islam until later in history.
Political Structures in Inland Africa
The development of Sub-Saharan Africa was heavily shaped by the migrations 
of Bantu-speaking people outward from west-central Africa. By the year 
1000, most of the region had adopted agriculture. With the sedentary nature 
of agriculture, people needed more complex political relationships to govern 
themselves. In contrast to most Asian or European societies, those in Sub-
Saharan Africa did not centralize power under one leader or central government. 
Instead, communities formed kin-based networks , where families governed 
themselves. A male head of the network, a chief , mediated conflicts and dealt 
with neighboring groups. Groups of villages became districts, and a group of 
chiefs decided among themselves how to solve the district’s problems.
44 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONAs populations grew, kin-based networks became more difficult to govern. 
Competition among neighbors increased, which in turn increased fighting 
among villages and districts. Survival for small kin-based communities 
became more challenging. Though many such communities continued to 
exist in Sub-Saharan Africa until the 1th century, larger kingdoms grew in 
prominence, particularly after 1000. 
The Hausa Kingdoms  Sometime before 1000, in what is now Nigeria, 
people of the Hausa ethnic group formed seven states, the Hausa Kingdoms . 
The states were loosely connected through kinship ties, though they too had 
no central authority. People established prospering city-states, each with a 
speciality. For example, several were situated in plains where cotton grew 
well. 
Though the region lacked access to the sea, contact with people from 
outside the region was important. Many Hausa benefited from the thriving 
trans-Saharan  trade , a network of trading routes across the great desert. 
A state on the western edge of the region specialized in military matters 
and defended the states against attack. Because the states lacked a central 
authority, however, they were frequently subject to domination from outside. 
In the 14th century, missionaries introduced Islam to the region. (Connect:

Political Structures of West and East Africa
.ingdoms on both the western and eastern sides of Africa benefited from 
increased trade. The exchange of goods brought them wealth, political power, 
and cultural diversity. The spread of Islam added to the religious diversity of 
the continent, where animism and Christianity were already practiced. Four of 
these kingdoms were Ghana, Mali, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia.
Ghana  Nestled between the Sahara and the tropical rain forests of the 
West African coast, the kingdom of Ghana  was not in the same location as 
the modern nation of Ghana. Historians believe that the kingdom had been 
founded during the 5th century, at least two centuries before the time of 
Muhammad, but Ghana reached its peak of influence from the 8th to the 11th 
centuries. Ghana’s rulers sold gold and ivory to Muslim traders in exchange 
for salt, copper, cloth, and tools. From Ghana’s capital city, .oumbi Saleh, the 
king ruled a centralized government aided by nobles and an army equipped 
with iron weapons.

North African and Arab merchants. Sundiata cultivated a thriving gold trade 
in Mali. Under his steady leadership, Mali’s wealth grew tremendously. His

gold left a lasting impression. See Topic 2. for the later developments in West 
Africa, such as the growth of the city of Timbuktu and the Songhai Empire.
Zimbabwe  In East Africa, the architecture demonstrated the growing 
wealth of one kingdom. Though most houses had traditionally been constructed 
from wood, by the th century chiefs had begun to construct their “zimbabwes,” 
the Bantu word for “dwellings,” with stone. This word became the name of 
one of the most powerful of all the East African kingdoms between the 12th 
and 15th centuries² Zimbabwe . It was situated between the =ambezi and 
Limpopo rivers in modern-day =imbabwe and Mozambique. 
=imbabwe built its prosperity on a mixture of agriculture, grazing, trade, 
and, above all, gold. Like Ghana and Mali on the other side of the continent, 
=imbabwe had rich gold fields, and taxes on the transport of gold made the 
kingdom wealthy. While Ghana and Mali relied on land-based trade across the 
Sahara, =imbabwe traded with the coastal city-states such as Mombasa, .ilwa, 
and Mogadishu. Through these ports, Zimbabwe was tied into the Indian 
Ocean trade , which connected East Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and 
East Asia. In East Africa, traders blended Bantu and Arabic to develop a new 
language, Swahili . Today, Swahili is spoken by various groups in the African 
Great Lakes region as well as other parts of Southeast Africa. 
The rise and decline of =imbabwe was reflected in the defensive walls 
used to protect cities. By the end of the 1th century, a massive wall of stone, 
0 feet tall by 15 feet thick, surrounded the capital city, which became known 
as the Great Zimbabwe . The stone wall was the first large one on the continent 
that people built without mortar. Inside the wall, most of the royal city’s 
buildings were made of stone. In the late 15th century, nearly 20,000 people 
resided within the Great =imbabwe. However, overgrazing so damaged the 
surrounding environment that residents of the bustling capital city abandoned 
it by the end of the 100s. The wall still stands in the modern country of 
Zimbabwe.
Ethiopia  Christianity had spread from its origins along the east coast of 
the Mediterranean Sea south into Egypt and beyond. In what is today Ethiopia , 
the kingdom of Axum developed. It prospered by trading goods obtained from 
India, Arabia, the Roman Empire, and the interior of Africa. Beginning in the 
th century, the spread of Islam made the region more diverse religiously. 
In the 12th century, a new Christian-led kingdom in Ethiopia emerged. Its 
rulers, like those of other countries, expressed their power through architecture. 
They ordered the creation of 11 massive churches made entirely of rock. 
47 DEVELOPMENTS IN AFRICACarved rock structures had been a feature of Ethiopian religious architecture 
since the 2nd millennium B.C.E.
From the 12th through the 16th centuries, Ethiopia was an island of 
Christianity on the continent of Africa. Separated from both the Roman 
Catholic Church of western Europe and the Orthodox Church of eastern 
Europe, Ethiopian Christianity developed independently. People combined 
their traditional faith traditions, such as ancestor veneration and beliefs in 
spirits, with Christianity to create a distinct form of faith. 
Social Structures of Sub-Saharan Africa
In Sub-Saharan Africa, strong central governments ruling over large territories  
were uncommon. Instead, Sub-Saharan Africa’s small communities were 
organized around several structures: kinship, age, and gender. .inship 
connections allowed people to identify first as members of a clan or family. 
Age was another significant social marker. An 18-year-old could do more hard 
labor than a 60-year-old, but younger people often relied on the advice of their 
elders. Thus, communities divided work according to age, creating age grades 
or age sets. Finally, gender had an influential role in social organization. 
• Men dominated most activities that required a specialized skill. For 
example, leather tanners and blacksmiths were typically men.

48 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITION• Women generally engaged in agriculture and food gathering. They also 
took the primary responsibilities for carrying out domestic chores and 
raising their family’s children.
Slavery in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southwest Asia  Slavery had a long 
history in Africa. Prisoners of war, debtors, and criminals were often enslaved. 
Most men and some women did agricultural work. Most women and some 
men served in households. In many kin-based societies, people could not own 
land privately, but they could own other people. Owning a large number of 
enslaved people increased one’s social status. Slavery existed in many forms.

A strong demand in the Middle East for enslaved workers resulted in an 
Indian Ocean slave trade  between East Africa and the Middle East. This 
trade started several centuries before the Atlantic Ocean slave trade between 
West Africa and the Americas. In some places, it lasted into the 20th century. 
The enslaved East Africans, known in Arabic as zanj,  provided valuable 
labor on sugar plantations in Mesopotamia. However, between 86 and 88, 
they and many Arab workers mounted a series of revolts known as the Zanj 
Rebellion . About 15,000 enslaved people successfully captured the city of 
Basra and held it for ten years before being defeated. The large size and long 
length of time before it was defeated make the =anj Rebellion one of the most 
successful slave revolts in history. 
49 DEVELOPMENTS IN AFRICACultural Life in Sub-Saharan Africa
Playing music, creating visual arts, and telling stories were and continue to be 
important aspects of cultures everywhere because they provided enjoyment 
and mark rituals such as weddings and funerals. In Africa, these activities 
carried additional significance. Because traditional African religions included 
ancestor veneration, song lyrics provided a means of communicating with the 
spirit world. African music usually had a distinctive rhythmic pattern, and 
vocals were interspersed with percussive elements such as handclaps, bells, 
pots, or gourds.
9isual arts also commonly served a religious purpose. For example, 
metalworkers created busts of past rulers so that ruling royalty could look to 
them for guidance. Artists in Benin, West Africa, were famous for their intricate 
sculptures in iron and bronze. In the late 1th century, the sophistication of 
these pieces of art would cause some Europeans to increase their respect for  
West African cultures.
Griots and Griottes  Literature, as it existed in Sub-Saharan Africa, was 
oral. Griots, or storytellers,  were the conduits of history for a community. 
Griots possessed encyclopedic knowledge of family lineages and the lives and 
deeds of great leaders. In general, griots were also adept at music, singing their 
stories and accompanying themselves on instruments, such as the drums and a 
12-string harp called the kora. 
The griots were both venerated and feared as they held both the power of 
language and of story. People said that a griot could sing your success or sing 
your downfall. By telling and retelling their stories and histories, the griots 
preserved a people’s history and passed that history on from generation to 
generation. .ings often sought their counsel regarding political matters. When 
a griot died, it was as though a library had burned. 
Just as men served as griots, women served as griottes. They would sing 
at special occasions, such as before a wedding. For example, the griotte would 
counsel the bride to not talk back if her mother-in-law abused her or reassure 
the bride that if things got too bad, she could return home. Griottes provided 
women with a sense of empowerment in a patriarchal society.

Developments in Europe 
I should not wish to be Aristotle if this were to separate me from Christ.
—Peter Abelard, Letter 17 to Heloise (1141)
Essential Question   How did the beliefs and practices of the predominant 
religions, agricultural practices, and political 
decentralization affect European society from  
c. 1200 to c. 1450?
As the Roman Empire declined in power in the 5th and 6th centuries, 
Western Europe entered the Middle Ages, sometimes called the medieval 
period. Throughout Europe, trade declined, intellectual life receded, and the 
united Roman state was replaced by smaller kingdoms that frequently fought 
one another for control of territory. In response, European kings, lords, and 
peasants worked out agreements to provide for common defense. Only the 
Roman Catholic Church remained powerful in most of Europe from Roman 
times to the 16th century.
However, between 1000 to 1450, learning and trade began to revive in 
Europe. This era is called the High Middle Ages. Like many scholars of this 
period, Peter Abelard studied classical thinkers such as Aristotle and sometimes 
criticized the Church, but he remained a faithful throughout his life. 
Feudalism: Political and Social Systems
European civilization in the Middle Ages was characterized by a decentralized 
political organization based on a system of exchanges of land for loyalty 
known as feudalism . Lacking a strong government, people needed some 
protection from bandits, rival lords, and invaders such as the 9ikings from 
northern Europe. The core of feudalism was a system of mutual obligations:
• A monarch, usually a king, granted tracts of land, called fiefs, to lords. 
In return, a lord became a king’s vassal , a person who owed service to 
another person of higher status. 
• Lords then provided land to knights. In return, knights became vassals 
of the lord, and pledged to fight for the lord or king.
• Lords also provided land and protection to peasants. In return, peasants 
were obligated to farm the lord’s land and provide the lord with crops 
and livestock, and to obey the lord’s orders. 
54 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONFeudalism provided some security for peasants, equipment for warriors, 
and land to those who served a lord. Since the entire system was based on 
agriculture, wealth was measured in land rather than in cash.
The feudal system incorporated a code of chivalry ²an unwritten set 
of rules for conduct focusing on honor, courtesy, and bravery²as a way to 
resolve disputes. Since women were to be protected, the code put them on a 
pedestal while not investing them with any significant additional importance. 
In practice, women did not have many rights. (Connect: Compare European 
feudalism and Japanese feudalism. See Topic 1.1.
Manorial System  Large fiefs or estates were also referred to as 
manors . The manorial system  provided economic self-sufficiency and 
defense. The manor produced everything that people living on it required, 
limiting the need for trade or contact with outsiders. Many serfs spent their 
entire lives on a single manor, little aware of events in the rest of Europe.
Manor grounds were small villages that often included a church, a 
blacksmith shop, a mill, and wine presses. They included the homes of 
peasants known as serfs . Serfs, while not enslaved, were tied to the land. 
This meant they could not travel without permission from their lords. Nor 
could they marry without their lord’s approval. In exchange for protection 
provided by the lord of the manor, they paid tribute in the form of crops, 
labor, or, in rare cases, coins. Children born to serfs also became serfs.
As both climate and technology slowly improved, the amount of arable 
or farmable land gradually increased. Agriculture became more efficient 
near the end of the Middle Ages. The three-field system , in which crops 
were rotated through three fields, came into use. 
• One field was planted with wheat or rye, crops that provided food.
• A second field was planted with legumes such as peas, lentils, or 
beans. These made the soil more fertile by adding nitrogen to it.
• A third field was allowed to remain fallow, or unused, each year. 
Technological developments included windmills and new types of plows. 
Heavier plows with wheels worked well in the dense soil north of the Alps, 
while lighter plows worked better in southern Europe. These changes 
promoted population growth.
Political Trends in the Later Middle Ages
In the later Middle Ages, monarchies grew more powerful at the expense 
of feudal lords by employing their own bureaucracy and a military. These 
employees worked directly for the king or queen. In contrast, in modern  
countries such as the United States, bureaucrats and soldiers work for the 
country, not the chief executive. The lands these monarchs collected under 
their control, particularly in England and France, were beginning to look 
like the modern countries of Europe.

bureaucracy. Yet it was not until Philip I9 ruled 1285±11 that the first 
Estates-General   met. The Estates-General was a body to advise the king 
that included representatives from each of the three legal classes, or estates , 
in France: the clergy, nobility, and commoners. Although the French kings 
consulted this Estates-General when necessary, they did not exact regular taxes 
from the upper two estates, the clergy and nobility. Consequently, the Estates-
General had little power. The clergy and nobility felt little responsibility 
to protect a government that they were not financing, a problem that only 
continued to increase in France up to the eve of the French Revolution of 18.
Holy Roman Empire  The German king Otto I  was crowned Holy  Roman 
Emperor in 962, hearkening back to Charlemagne’s designation as Emperor 
of the Romans. Otto’s successors survived the power struggle with the papacy 
over the lay investiture controversy  of the 11th and 12th centuries. This 
dispute was over whether a secular non-religious leader, rather than the 
pope, could invest bishops with the symbols of office. It was finally resolved 
in the Concordat of Worms of 1122, when the Church achieved autonomy 
from secular authorities. The Holy Roman Empire remained vibrant until it 
was virtually destroyed during the Thirty Years’ War 1618±168. It lingered 
on, but with little power. The Empire came to a formal end when the French 
leader Napoleon Bonaparte invaded central Europe in 1806.
56 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONNorman England  The Normans  were descendents of 9ikings who settled 
in northwestern France, a region known as Normandy. In 1066, a Norman 
king, William the Conqueror, successfully invaded England. This gave him 
kingdoms on both sides of the English Channel. He presided over a tightly 
organized feudal system, using royal sheriffs as his administrative officials. 
The fusion of Normans and Anglo-Saxons created the modern English people.
Many English nobles objected to the power of William and the succeeding 
Norman monarchs. These nobles forced limits on that power. In 1215, they 
forced .ing John to sign the Magna Carta , which required the king to respect 
certain rights, such as the right to a jury trial before a noble could be sentenced 
to prison. They also won the right to be consulted on the issue of scutage a tax 
paid on a knight who wanted to pay money instead of provide military service. 
Finally, the first English Parliament  was formed in 1265. These developments 
increased the rights of the English nobility, but not of the general population.
In the first full parliamentary meeting in 1265, the House of Lords 
represented the nobles and Church hierarchy, while the House of Commons 
was made up of elected representatives of wealthy townspeople. Eventually, 
the power of these two legislative bodies in England became stronger than that 
of similar bodies on the European continent. 
The Hundred Years’ War  Between 1 and 15, the rival monarchies 
of England and France fought a series of battles known as the Hundred Years’ 
War. English archers armed with longbows about six feet long helped win 
several early victories. However, by the end of the conflict, the English retained 
only the port of Calais in France. Two other important results of the war were 
on how people saw themselves and how they fought. 
• On each side, serving under a monarch fostered a sense of unity 
among soldiers who often spoke distinct languages or dialects. The 
war marked another step towards people identifying themselves as 
“English” or “French” rather than from a particular region. 
• The war also demonstrated the spreading use of gunpowder weapons. 
Gunpowder had been invented by the Chinese and spread west by 
Mongols. 
Christians versus Muslims  In addition to conquering England, the 
Normans also conquered Sicily, taking control of that Mediterranean island 
from Muslims. Muslims had conquered Spain in the 8th century. From that 
time, Christians had wanted to reconquer it. This effort, called the reconquista , 
occurred over many centuries. It was finally completed in 12.
Roman Catholic Church during the Middle Ages 
In 1054, the Christian Church in Europe divided into two branches, a split 
called the Great Schism . The Roman Catholic Church continued to dominate 
most of Europe for another five centuries, while the Orthodox Church was 
powerful farther east, from Greece to Russia. 
57 DEVELOPMENTS IN E UROPE The Roman Catholic Church was the most powerful institution in a Europe 
divided into hundreds of small political states. Often Church staff were the 
only people in a community who knew how to read and write. If common 
people needed something written or read, they asked a Church official to do 
it. Most manors had a small church and a priest on the grounds. Christianity 
provided people a shared identity even as vernacular languages, ones spoken 
by the people in a region, emerged to replace Latin.
Education and Art  The Church established the first universities in 
Europe. Because the Church led in the area of education, most philosophers, 
writers, and other thinkers of the Middle Ages were religious leaders. All 
artists worked for the Church. Most artwork focused on religious themes, 
which provided images to help illiterate serfs understand the Bible.
Church and State  The Church held great power in the feudal system. 
If a lord displeased the Church, it could pressure the lord in various ways. 
For example, a local bishop might cancel religious services for his serfs. This 
angered the serfs, who would demand that the lord give in to the bishop.
Like the Roman Empire, the Roman Catholic Church had an extensive 
hierarchy of regional leaders. The regional religious leaders, called bishops, 
owed allegiance to the pope, the supreme bishop in Rome. The bishops also 
selected and supervised local priests. 
Monasticism  Although some Christian clergy withdrew to monasteries 
to meditate and pray, they remained part of the economies of Western 
Europe. The monasteries had the same economic functions of agriculture 
and protection as other manors. Women were permitted to become nuns and 
exerted their influence in the monasteries of the Catholic Church. 
Reform  Although clergy took vows of poverty and supported charities 
in their communities, the clergy also wielded considerable political influence, 
and some monasteries became quite wealthy. Wealth and political power led 
to corruption during the 1th and 1th centuries. Eventually, corruption, as 
well as theological disagreements, drove reformers such as Martin Luther to 
take stands that would shatter the unity of the Roman Catholic Church in the 
16th century.
Christian Crusades 
Just as Europeans fought to drive Muslims out of Sicily and Spain, they also 
sought to reclaim control of the Holy Land, the region of Palestine in the 
Middle East that contains sites of spiritual significance to Jews, Christians, 
and Muslims. European Christians had enjoyed access to these lands for 
centuries, even after they came under the control of Muslims. 
Social and economic trends of the 11th century added to the pressure 
among Europeans to invade the Middle East. Rules of primogeniture , under 
which the eldest son in a family inherited the entire estate, left a generation 
of younger sons with little access to wealth and land. The landed nobles saw 
58 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONa military campaign as a way to divert the ambitions of these restless nobles 
as well as unemployed peasants, who often pillaged the lands of neighboring 
lords. Furthermore, merchants desired unfettered access to trade routes through 
the Middle East. The combination of these religious, social, and economic 
pressures resulted in the Crusades— a series of European military campaigns 
in the Middle East between 1095 and the 1200s.
Politics shaped the conduct of Crusades. Tensions between popes and 
kings strengthened the intention of the Roman Catholic Church to take control. 
The Church also used its spiritual authority to recruit believers. It granted 
relief from required acts of atonement and penance and even promised people 
they would reach heaven sooner if they joined a Crusade. Support came for the 
Orthodox branch of Christianity as well. Alarmed by news of the persecution of 
Christian pilgrims by Seljuk Turks, the Orthodox patriarch at Constantinople 
appealed to Pope Urban II to help retake the Holy Land from Islamic control. 
The First Crusade  Of the four major Crusades, only the first was a clear 
victory for Christendom. The European army conquered Jerusalem in July 
10. However, Muslim forces under Saladin regained control of Jerusalem 
in 118. The Crusades did promote cultural exchange between Europe and the 
Middle East. The Middle East had a higher standard of living, and European 
Crusaders increased the demand for Middle Eastern goods.  (Connect: Create 
a timeline tracing the spread of Islam up through the Crusades. See Topic 1.2.
The Fourth Crusade  During the fourth and last major Crusade 1202±
120, 9enice, a wealthy city-state in northern Italy, had a contract to transport 
Crusaders to the Middle East, an area known as the Levant. However, 9enice 
was not paid all of what was due, so the 9enetians persuaded the Crusader 
debtors first to sack =ara, an Italian city, and then Constantinople, a major 
trade competitor of 9enice. The Fourth Crusade never made it to the Holy 
Land. Eventually, Islamic forces prevailed in the Levant. 
Economic and Social Change
The Crusades were just part of the changes occurring in Europe in the late 
Middle Ages. Local economic self-sufficiency in Europe gradually gave way 
to an interest in goods from other European areas and from far-flung ports. 
Marco Polo  In the late 1th century Marco Polo , an Italian native 
from 9enice, visited the court of .ublai .han in Dadu, modern-day Beijing. 
Polo’s captivating descriptions of the customs of the people he met intrigued 
Europeans. For example, he described how Mongols had multiple marriages, 
drank mare’s milk, burned black stones (coal) to heat their homes, and bathed 
frequently  ²often three times per week. Curiosity about Asia skyrocketed, 
stimulating interest in cartography, or mapmaking.
Social Change  Growth in long-distance commerce changed the social 
pyramid of Western Europe. Economic success started to rival religious 
vocation or military service in winning status. This middle class, between the 
59 DEVELOPMENTS IN E UROPE elite nobles and clergy and the mass of peasants, began to grow. .nown as the 
bourgeoisie , or burghers , it included shopkeepers, merchants, craftspeople, 
and small landholders. 
Urban Growth  With renewed commerce came larger cities. The change 
to the three-field system and other advances in agriculture led to population 
growth in the late Middle Ages. This agricultural surplus encouraged the 
growth of towns and of markets that could operate more frequently than 
just on holidays. As the demand for more labor on the manors increased, the 
supply decreased. A series of severe plagues swept through Eurasia in the 1th 
century. In Europe, an outbreak of bubonic plague known as the Black Death 
killed as many as one-third of the population. The growing demand for labor 
and the deaths of so many people gave serfs more bargaining power with lords. 
Urban growth was hampered after about 100 by a five-century cooling 
of the climate known as the Little Ice Age . Lower temperatures reduced 
agricultural productivity, so people had less to trade and cities grew more 
slowly. The Little Ice Age led to an increase in disease and an increase in 
unemployment. These, in turn, created social unrest. The crime rate increased, 
and Jews, and other groups that already faced discrimination, were the victims 
of scapegoating²being blamed for something over which they had no control.
Jews  During the Middle Ages, the small Jewish population in Christian 
Europe began to grow. Many Jews lived in Muslim areas in the Iberian 
Peninsula present-day Spain and Portugal and around the Mediterranean 
Sea when these areas were overtaken by European Christians. In time, Jews 
who could afford to moved northward in Europe. Some political leaders, 
particularly in Amsterdam and other commercial cities, welcomed them, since 
they brought valuable experience in business and trade.
The Roman Catholic Church also had a policy that Christians could not 
charge interest on loans to other Christians. However, Jews were not bound 
by this restriction. With few other economic opportunities, many northern 
European Jews became moneylenders. The resulting increase in the flow of 
money contributed to the economic growth of Europe. 
However, anti-Jewish sentiment, or antisemitism , was widespread among 
Christians. They thought of Jews as outsiders and untrustworthy. Jews were 
expelled from England in 120, France in 1, Spain in 12, and Portugal in 
1, as well as from various independent kingdoms and cities in northern and 
central Europe. Jews expelled from western and central Europe often moved to 
eastern Europe. While Jews had lived in this region since the 1st century, their 
numbers increased greatly because of the expulsions.
Muslims  Like Jews, Muslims faced discrimination in Europe. In 12, 
the Spanish king expelled the remaining Muslims in the kingdom who would 
not convert to Christianity. Many Muslims moved to southeastern Europe. In 
the 1th century, the Muslim Ottoman Empire expanded its reach from Turkey 
into the Balkan countries of present-day Albania, .osovo, and Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. These countries developed large Muslim populations. 
60 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONWhile Europe was predominantly Christian, and despite their persecution, 
both Jews and Muslims helped shape society. Unlike most people in Europe in 
the Middle Ages, Jews lived in urban areas, and they served as a bridge between 
Christians and the Muslims whose goods they desired in trade. Contacts with 
traders in Muslim caliphates opened up a world of trade and a world of ideas 
for Europeans who had long been self-sufficient and isolated under feudalism.
Gender Roles  Women found their rights eroding as a wave of patriarchal 
thinking and writing accompanied the movement from an agricultural society 
to a more urban one. Even fewer women than men received an education, 
although women often managed manor accounts. One place where women had 
greater opportunities to display their skills in administration and leadership was 
in religious orders. Some women became artisans and members of guilds²
associations of craftspeople and merchants²although not all had property 
rights. Women in Islamic societies tended to enjoy higher levels of equality, 
particularly in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. 
Renaissance
The expansion of trade, the growth of an agricultural surplus, and the rise of 
a middle class able to patronize artists sparked great creativity in Europe. The 
Renaissance  was a period characterized by a revival of interest in classical 
Greek and Roman literature, art, culture, and civic virtue. Scholars recovered 
and studied decaying manuscripts that had been written many centuries earlier. 
Developed in 1, Johannes Gutenberg’s movable-type printing press initiated 
a revolution in print technology. The printing press allowed manuscripts to be 
mass-produced at relatively affordable costs. It fostered a growth in literacy 
and the rapid spread of ideas.
One characteristic of the Renaissance was the interest in humanism , the 
focus on individuals rather than God. Humanists sought education and reform. 
They began to write secular literature. Cultural changes in the Renaissance, 
such as the increased use of the vernacular language, propelled the rise of 
powerful monarchies, the centralization of governments, and the birth of 
nationalism. Connect: List three elements of classical Greece and Rome 
revived by the Renaissance. See Prologue. 
Southern Renaissance  In the regions of Italy and Spain, church patronage 
supported the Renaissance. For example, the writer Dante Alighieri 1265±
121 used a religious framework for The Divine Comedy, which features hell, 
purgatory, and heaven. Nevertheless, his fearlessness in criticizing corrupt 
religious officials and his willingness to use Italian vernacular instead of 
Latin reflected his independence from the Roman Catholic Church. Wealthy 
families, such as the Medicis of Florence, used their money to support painters, 
sculptors, and architects. 
Northern Renaissance  By 100, the Renaissance spirit spread to northern 
Europe. While many Renaissance artists emphasized piety in their work, others 
61 DEVELOPMENTS IN E UROPE emphasized human concerns. Geoffrey Chaucer, writing in The Canterbury 
Tales in the late 100s, portrayed a microcosm of middle-class occupations in 
England, including several Church positions. His satirical writings portrayed 
monks who loved hunting and overly sentimental nuns. Like Dante a century 
earlier, Chaucer chose a vernacular, Middle English, for this work, although 
many of his other writings were in Latin.

The Origins of Russia 
During the late Middle Ages in Eastern Europe, extensive trade in furs, fish, 
and grain connected people from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean to Central 
Asia. The city-state at the center of this trade was .ievan Rus, based in 
what is today .iev, Ukraine. Because it adopted the Orthodox Christianity, 
it maintained closer cultural relationships with Byzantium than with Roman 
Catholic Europe. In the 1th century, the Mongols overtook this region, so it 
developed even more separately from of the rest of Europe. See Topic 2.2.
The Mongols required local nobles to collect taxes for them. As these 
nobles grew wealthy in their role, they began to resist Mongol rule. In the late 
15th century, under the leadership of a Moscow-based ruler known as Ivan 
the Great, the region became independent of the Mongols. This marked the 
beginning of the modern state of Russia.

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:  IDENTIFY  HISTORICAL  DEVELOPMENTS
Europe in c. 1200 was an area of decentralized feudal kingdoms with 
little contact with the world beyond the manor. Europe in c. 1450, in 
contrast, was a region of agricultural abundance, growing towns and 
cities, increasing trade with other parts of the world, growing commerce, 
and centralizing states. 
For each of the following aspects of life in Europe, write a sentence 
identifying a development—an event or series of events that fit into 
a broader pattern—that contributed to the changes between c. 1200 
and c. 1450. Review the chapter as needed.

Essential Question:   In what ways was the process of state-building  
in various parts of the world between c. 1200  
and c. 1450 similar and different? 
Between c. 1200 and c. 150, states in core areas of civilization grew larger 
while smaller states declined. In this way, much of the world followed the 
same trend of building more centralized, more powerful states. However, the 
process varied from place to place. In most of Asia, the military strength of 
the Mongols created the largest land-based empire in world history. In West 
Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, the religion of Islam was a key part 
of state-building. In Europe, trade, both internal and with the more advanced 
civilizations of the Middle East, had greater impact. 
State-Building and New Empires
As stronger, more centralized states rose, the influence of nomadic societies 
began to wane by the 15th century. During this period, new empires emerged 
and states around the world expanded. 
• The Song Dynasty in China continued a long period of technological 
and cultural progress.
• The Abbasid Caliphate in the Middle East was fragmented by invaders 
and shifts in trade. Following it, new Muslim states arose in Africa, the 
Middle East, and Spain.
• In South and Southeast Asia, the Chola .ingdom and 9ijayanagar 
Empire used trade to build strong states, while the Delhi Sultanate in 
northern India was more land-based.
• In Africa, the rulers of Mali created an empire that was bigger and 
more centrally administered than the Empire of Ghana that preceded it.
66 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITION• In the Americas, the Aztecs formed a tributary empire in Mesoamerica 
that relied on a strong military. The Inca Empire in the Andean region 
used the elaborate mit’a system as a way to support state-building. In 
contrast, most of the Americas lacked centralized states.
• In Europe, feudal ties declined in importance as centralized states 
developed. This development was clearer in the Western European 
kingdoms of England and France than in Eastern Europe. 
• Japan, unlike most states, became more decentralized and feudal.
The Role of Religion in State-Building
One similarity in much of the world was that religion was a vital part of state-
building. To help unite a diverse population, empires and states often turned 
to religion to strengthen political control over their territory. One excellent 
example of how religion worked with state-building was in the Islamic world. 
Through the unifying power of shared beliefs and a use of the common 
language of Arabic, Islam provided the basis for the legitimacy of rulers from 
West Africa to Southeast Asia.
China and East Asia  Other states also were strengthened by religion. In 
China, the Confucian belief system was closely tied to civil service. The Song 
Dynasty relied on Confucian scholars to run a powerful, enduring bureaucracy. 
No other state had such a well-established and extensive system for conducting 
government affairs across such a large territory. The ability to implement laws 
and carry out imperial edicts was a key part of state-building in China.
Neo-Confucianism see Topic 1.1 spread to .orea and Japan, allowing 
rulers in these East Asian regions to justify and consolidate their political power 
as well. Similarly, rulers in South and Southeast Asia relied on Hinduism and 
Buddhism to aid them in strengthening their states.
Europe  In Europe, the relationship between Roman Catholic Church and 
state-building was somewhat different than in most of Eurasia. At times, the 
Church was part of the state-building process. However, because European 
states were so weak for most of the Middle Ages, the Church had provided 
an alternative structure for organizing society. Then, between 1200 and 150, 
as more powerful states emerged in France and the Holy Roman Empire, the 
Church sometimes became a rival power. 
Diffusion of Religion  The spread of major religions during this time 
period resulted in the influence of religion over wide areas. Islam, Buddhism, 
and Christianity all encouraged their followers to convert non-believers. 
Therefore, missionary activity was an important factor in the decline in the 
practice of local religions in places such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast 
Asia, and East Asia. In South Asia, converts to Islam increased partly as a 
result of military invasions by Islamic armies from Central Asia. However, 
Hinduism remained the predominant religion in South Asia, setting the stage 
for intermittent periods of conflict and tolerance between followers of Islam 
67 COMPARISON IN THE PERIO D FROM C. 1200 TO C. 1450 COMPARISON IN THE PERIO D FROM C. 1200 TO C. 1450 67and Hinduism on the sub-continent. Trade networks in the Indian Ocean, 
South China Sea, East and Central Asia, and across the Sahara Desert helped 
to spread religions as commercial activity increased. 
State-Building Through Trade
Fueled by increased trade, cross-cultural exchanges of technology and 
innovation increased. Innovations in crop production, such as Champa rice 
that spread from 9ietnam to China, helped the Song Dynasty feed and sustain 
a growing population. The resulting effect, a larger and more urban citizenry, 
supported the development of China’s manufacturing capability²the largest 
in the world at the time. Porcelain, silk, steel, and iron production all increased 
during this time. Together, these changes built the Song into the strongest state 
in China since the time of the Han a millennium earlier.
Paper manufacturing, invented in China in the 2nd century B.C.E., made 
its way across Eurasia, reaching Europe around the 1th century. The resulting 
printed material led to increased literacy rates across Europe, the Middle East, 
and North Africa. The focus on intellectual thought and learning led to advances 
in mathematics and medicine, especially in Islamic centers of learning such as 
the House of Wisdom in Bagdad. 
Europe benefited from exchanges with the Middle East, and through it 
with the rest of Asia. Not all contact between Europe and Asia was peaceful. 
Muslims had conquered Spain by force in the 8th century and Christian 
crusaders attempted to seize lands they considered holy in the Middle East 
beginning around 1100. The Mongols fostered the transfer of knowledge, but 
only after they carried out brutal conquests. All of these contacts with Asia 
contributed to state-building in Europe. Between 1200 and 150, the process 
was small and slow, held back by the manorial system and serfdom, but it was 
noticeable. After 150, state-building would increase in speed and significance 
in Europe.
The Impact of Nomadic Peoples
Nomadic peoples played a key role in the process of state building between 
1200 and 150. The Mongols, a pastoral people from the steppes of Central 
Asia, ruled over significant areas of Asia and Eastern Europe during the 1th 
century. (For more on the Mongols, see Topic 2.2.) The political stability 
resulting from Mongol dominance allowed trade across Eurasia to greatly 
expand. Cross-cultural interactions and transfers intensified and some of 
the first direct contacts between Europe and China since the classical period 
occurred, also facilitated by Mongol rule.  
Similar to the Mongols, Turkish peoples, also from the Central Asian 
steppes, increased their dominance over large land-based empires in the eastern 
Mediterranean, Persia, and South Asia that lasted well past 150. However, 
unlike the Mongols, who built their empire initially as a coordinated campaign 
by unified Mongol clans, different Turkish groups built separate empires. 
68 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe Seljuk and Ottoman Turks became dominant forces in the Mediterranean 
region while another Turkish group established an empire located in Persia and 
the surrounding territories. 
The creation of these empires would be among the last major impacts of 
the interaction between settled and nomadic peoples. The role of nomads in 
commerce and cross-cultural exchange diminished as they were replaced by 
organized groups of merchants and trading companies.
Patriarchy and Religion
Social organization in most cultures remained patriarchal. However, cultures 
varied. While religion often reinforced the power of men, its record was mixed.  
For example, convent life for Christians in Europe and in Jainist and Buddhist 
religious communities in South Asia provided women with opportunities for 
learning and leadership. In contrast, in China, women lost some independence 
as the custom of foot binding became more common.

UNIT 1 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   WHO DEVELOPE D GUNS?
The development of gunpowder and its use in guns revolutionized 
world history. However, historians presented various arguments to 
explain who was responsible for starting this revolution.
Chinese Claims and European Doubts  While the Chinese 
long took credit for developing both gunpowder and guns, European 
historians were traditionally skeptical because they doubted the 
Chinese had the technological ability to make such advances. For 
example, Henry Hime, a British military officer, argued in his 10 
book, Gunpowder and Ammunition: Their Origin and Progress,  
that the Chinese “possessed little genius for mechanical or chemical 
inventions” so they had probably “obtained their first gunpowder and 
firearms from the West.” 
Fireworks  European scholars gradually recognized Chinese 
contributions to the technologies that led to the development of guns. 
They first recognized that the Chinese had invented gunpowder and 
that knowledge of the explosive substance had been carried by traders 
and the Mongols to Europe in the 1th century. However, European 
historians continued to argue that the Chinese had used gunpowder only 
for fireworks, not for weaponry. Historian Jack .elly, in a recent book 
about the history of gunpowder, noted that historians had not moved 
much beyond Hime’s argument in their views of Chinese abilities. “The 
notion of China’s benign relationship with gunpowder sprang in part 
from Western prejudices about the Chinese character. Some viewed the 
Chinese as amateurs who stumbled onto the secret of gunpowder but 
couldn’t see its potential. Others saw them as pacifist sages who wisely 
turned away from its destructive possibilities.” 
Agreement  The next step was for Europeans to acknowledge that 
the Chinese historians were correct, and that the Chinese had begun 
using gunpowder to make early forms of guns since the 10th century. 
British scholar Joseph Needham revolutionized Western attitudes 
toward China with his multivolume work Science and Civilization in 
China . Begun in 15, it continued after Needham’s death under other 
scholars and now includes more than 25 volumes. Needham called 
the development of gunpowder “no doubt the greatest of all Chinese 
military inventions.” And he concluded that the Chinese had developed 
the first gun “before other peoples knew of the invention at all.” 
Develop an Argument:  Evaluate the extent to which historical 
evidence supports one of the perspectives on the historical development 
and use of gunpowder. Review outside sources as necessary.

Understand the Context
Between 1200 and 1450, economic activity along existing trade routes 
increased in volume and scope. Technological and commercial innovations, 
imperial expansion, and demand for luxury goods were key factors in the 
ongoing expansion of trade. Growing trade networks accelerated cultural, 
biological, and technological diffusion across Afro-Eurasia. 
Factors that Expanded Trade  Between 1200 and 1450, the rise of 
powerful states and empires played a critical role in increasing the volume and 
geographical reach of existing trade networks. The Mongol Empire promoted 
trade along the Silk Roads, creating a vast commercial network across Eurasia. 
Trade routes across the Sahara and in the Indian Ocean added both West 
Africa and East Africa to this network. Improvements to previously existing 
commercial practices, including forms of credit, facilitated larger networks 
of exchange. Driving this growth in trade was a growing demand for luxury 
goods, such as silk and porcelain from China and gold from Africa. 
Consequences of Trade  In the context of this growing trade, powerful 
new trading cities emerged scattered across Africa and Eurasia. Trade provided 
the setting for significant cross-cultural exchanges. As merchants and other 
travelers moved from place to place, they introduced religious beliefs such as 
Islam and developments in technology such as paper making and gunpowder 
to new communities. Against the backdrop of this transfer of ideas and things, 
came also the rapid spread of deadly diseases, most notably the bubonic plague.

—Italian merchant Francesco Balducci Peglotti (1471)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the growth  
of networRs  of e_change  after 1200?
More than 1,00 years after the first accounts of travel on the Silk Roads, 
these fabled routes that had fallen into disuse had revived by the 8th and 9th 
centuries. As described by merchant Peglotti, the land route of the Silk Roads 
was vibrant and essential to interregional trade in the 14th and 15th centuries. 
Demand for luxury goods increased in Europe and Africa. Chinese, Persian, 
and Indian artisans and merchants expanded their production of textiles and 
porcelains for export. Caravans made travel safer and more practical, and the 
Chinese developed a system using paper money to manage increasing trade. 
Interregional trade on the Silk Roads flourished.
Causes of the Growth of Exchange Networks
The Crusades helped pave the way to expanding networks of exchange, as 
lords and their armies of knights brought back fabrics and spices from the 
East. Despite the inroads on the Byzantine Empire by the Ottoman Turks, the 
Silk Roads trade routes remained in operation, as did sea routes across the 
Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. China was still eager for Europe’s 
gold and silver, and Europe was growing more eager than ever for silk, tea, 
and rhubarb. Global trade increased. Although Europeans had not yet found 
a route around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, they had 
been making overland trips across Europe for many centuries. 
Rise of New Empires  After the collapse of classical civilizations such 
as the Roman and Han empires, the first golden age of the Silk Roads came 
to an end, and activity declined dramatically. However, by the 8th and 9th 
centuries, Arab merchants from the Abbasid Empire revived the land route 
of the Silk Roads as well as sea routes in the Indian Ocean. Tang China had 
much to offer the newly revived global trade network, including the compass, 
78 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONpaper, and gunpowder. China exported porcelain, tea, and silk. From other 
parts of Asia, China imported cotton, precious stones, pomegranates, dates, 
horses, and grapes. These luxury goods appealed to the upper class of Chinese 
society, whose members reveled in their country’s newfound affluence. This 
period marked the second golden age of the Silk Roads.
No other cause, however, had as significant an impact on the expansion of 
trade as did the rise of the Mongol Empire . Mongols conquered the Abbasid 
Caliphate in 1258, and in the 14th century China came under their control as 
well. Parts of the Silk Roads that were under the authority of different rulers 
were, for the first time, unified in a system under the control of an authority 
that respected merchants and enforced laws. The Mongols improved roads 
and punished bandits, both of which increased the safety of travel on the Silk 
Roads. New trade channels were also established between Asia, the Middle 
East, Africa, and Europe. Those who survived the conquests by the Mongols 
and their descendants benefited from the reinvigoration of trade routes that had 
not been heavily used since the days of the Roman and Han Empires. (You will 
read more about the Mongols in Topic 2.2.)
Improvements in Transportation Technologies  Another cause for the 
expansion of exchange networks was the improvement of transportation. 
Travelers on the overland Silk Roads learned that traveling with others in 
caravans was safer than traveling alone. They also learned how to design 
saddles for camels that greatly increased the weight of the load the animals 
could carry. 
Centuries earlier, China had made advances in naval technology that 
allowed it to control sea-based trade routes in the South China Sea. During 
the Han Dynasty, Chinese scientists developed the magnetic compass  and 
improved the rudder , both of which helped aid navigation and ship control 
along the seas. The Chinese junk , also developed in the Han Dynasty, was 
a boat similar to the Southwest Asian dhow. It had multiple sails and was 
as long as 400 feet—at least triple the size of the typical Western European 
ship of its time. The hull of a junk was divided into compartments. The walls 
making these divisions strengthened the ship for rough voyages at sea and 
made sinking less likely.

Two significant effects of the expansion and stability of the Silk Roads were 
the series of oases that developed along the routes, including thriving cities, 
and commercial innovations that greatly helped to manage the increasing 
trade. 
Cities and Oases  Long stretches of the overland Silk Roads passed 
through inhospitable terrain—hot arid lands where water was scarce. Cities 
along the routes that were watered by rivers became thriving centers of trade. 
For example, the city of Kashgar  is located at the western edge of China where 
northern and southern routes of the Silk Roads crossed, leading to destinations 
79 THE SI LK ROA DS79in Central Asia, India, Pakistan, and Persia. It sits where the Taklamakan Desert 
meets the Tian Shan Mountains and is watered by the Kashgar River, which 
has made the lands along it fertile for crops such as wheat, rice, fruits, and 
cotton. Travelers on the Silk Roads depended on Kashgar for its abundance 
of water and food. Artisans in Kashgar produced textiles, rugs, leather goods, 
and pottery. Its food and handicrafts were sold in a bustling market. At the 
crossroads of both ideas and goods, the once primarily Buddhist city also 
became a center of Islamic scholarship. 
Similarly, Samarkand,  in present-day Uzbekistan in the Zeravshan River 
valley, was a stopping point on the Silk Roads between China and the 
Mediterranean. Samarkand was a center of cultural exchange as much as it was 
a center for trading goods. Archaeological remains show the presence of 
diverse religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and 
Islam. Like Kashgar, Samarkand was known for its artisans as well as its 
centers of Islamic learning and magnificently decorated mosques.

Caravanserai  Large flourishing trading cities such as .ashgar and 
Samarkand, however, were not the only oases along the arid Silk Roads. Once 
the routes of the Silk Roads became stabilized, inns known as caravanserai 
sprang up, often about 100 miles apart. That distance is how far camels could 
travel before they needed water. At the caravanserai, travelers could rest both 
themselves and their animals and sometimes trade their animals for fresh ones. 
The word caravanserai  derives from the Persian words for caravan and palace.
Commercial Innovations   To manage the increasing trade, China 
developed new financial systems. China had long been a money economy—
using money rather than bartering with such commodities as cowrie shells or 
80 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONsalt. However, the  copper coins they used became too unwieldy to transport 
for everyday transactions, so the government developed a system of credit 
known as flyinJ cash . This allowed a merchant to deposit paper money  under 
his name in one location and withdraw the same amount at another location. 
Locations for exchanging flying cash became the model for the banks of the 
modern era, including the banking houses  established in European cities in 
the 1300s. At a banking house, a person could present a bill of exchange— a 
document stating the holder was legally promised payment of a set amount 
on a set date—and receive that amount of money in exchange. Each of these 
innovations encouraged and supported trade by providing convenience and the 
stability of institutions.
The Crusades awakened Europeans’ interest in luxury goods from Asia. 
To acquire them, they organized the trade of European resources. In the 13th 
century, cities in northern Germany and Scandinavia formed a commercial 
alliance called the Hanseatic League . Controlling trade in the North Sea and 
the Baltic Sea, member cities of the league, such as Lubeck, Hamburg, and Riga, 
were able to drive out pirates and monopolize trade in goods such as timber, 
grain, leather, and salted fish. League ships would leave the Baltic and North 
Seas. They would round the Atlantic Coast of Western Europe, proceeding to 
the ports of the Mediterranean. There, they might pick up valuable goods from 
Arab caravans. The league lasted until the mid-17th century, when national 
governments became strong enough to protect their merchants.( Connect:

Increase in Demand  The growing demand for luxury goods from 
Afro-Eurasia, China, Persia, and India led to a corresponding increase 
in the supply of those goods through expanded production. Craftworkers 
expanded their production of such goods as silk and other textiles and 
porcelains for export. Increased demand also led to the expansion of iron 
and steel manufactured in China, motivating its proto-industrialization.

Essential Question:   How did Eurasian empires grow over time, and how did 
their e_pansion  influence  trade and communication?
The Mongols of Central Asia marched across much of Eurasia throughout the 
13th century, leaving destruction and chaos in their wake. The reputation of the 
Mongols for slaughter spread even farther than their actual conquest. Matthew 
Paris had no firsthand knowledge of the Mongols as he wrote from the safe 
vantage point of a Benedictine abbey in England. Like Paris, most writers of 
the time focused on Mongol atrocities. However, in their quest for blood and 
treasure, the Mongols also sparked a period of interregional connection and 
exchange at a level that the world had not experienced in a thousand years. 
The Mongols and Their Surroundings
In the 12th century, the Mongols were multiple clans of pastoral nomads who 
herded goats and sheep and who were also hunter-foragers, north of the Gobi 
Desert  in East Asia. Life on the arid Asian steppes was harsh, and it shaped 
the Mongol culture. 
The Mongols expected everyone, male and female, to become skilled 
horse riders, and they highly valued courage in hunting and warfare. They 
were surrounded by other tribes—the Tatars, the Naimans, the Merkits, and the 
powerful Jurchen in northern China. The Mongols coveted the relative wealth 
of tribes and kingdoms that were located closer to the Silk Roads and had 
easier access to luxury goods such as silk clothing and gold jewelry. 
86 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONGenghis Khan 
The Mongol leader Temujin, 
born in 1162, spent the early 
decades of his life creating a 
series of tribal alliances and 
defeating neighboring groups 
one by one. He formed key 
friendships and married his 
oldest son to the daughter of 
a neighboring khan , or king. 
Temujin was intensely focused 
on building power. With this 
focus, he sometimes appointed 
talented nonfamily members to 
positions over family members. 
He was often also ruthless. 
For example, he killed his own 
stepbrother. He considered 
personal loyalty the best way 
to run his growing kingdom. In 
1206, Temujin gathered the Mongol chieftains at a meeting called a kuriltai  
where he was  elected khan of the Mongolian Kingdom. He took the name 
Genghis Khan , or “ruler of all.”
The Beginning of Conquest  In 1210, Genghis Khan and his troops 
headed east and attacked the powerful Jin Empire, which had been established 
by the Jurchens a century earlier and now ruled Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, 
and northern China. Its capital was the city of Zhongdu, present-day 
Beijing. Genghis Khan earned his reputation as a terrifying warrior during 
this campaign; anyone who resisted him was brutally killed in retribution. 
Sometimes the Mongols wiped out the civilian populations of entire towns 
after defeating their armies. Stories of Khan’s brutality spread in advance of 
his new westward campaigns, inducing some leaders to surrender before an 
attack. In 1219, Khan conquered both the Central Asian Kara Khitai Empire  
and the Islamic Khwarazm Empire  farther west. By 1227, Genghis Khan’s 
khanate , or kingdom, reached from the North China Sea to eastern Persia. 
(Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the reign of Genghis Khan to the reign 
of Sundiata. See Topic 1.5.)
Genghis Khan at War  Khan’s empire would not have been possible 
without the skilled and fearsome soldiers under his command. Mongolian 
soldiers were strong riders and proficient with the short bow. They were also 
highly disciplined, and .han developed an efficient command structure. To 
help with communication between units, a messenger force was created whose 
members rode for days without stopping, even sleeping on their horses while 
continuing to ride. With the help of Genghis Khan, the Mongolian armies

87 THE MONGO L EMPIRE AN D THE MO DERN WOR LD 87developed special units that mapped the terrain so that they were prepared 
against attacks and knew which way to go to attack their enemies. Their military 
strategies extended to surprise and craft. For instance, Mongol forces frequently 
deployed a band of warriors smaller than that of their enemy, retreating in 
feigned defeat; usually, enemy forces pursued the retreating Mongols, who then 
amassed larger forces to confuse and outflank the enemy.
When coming upon an enemy settlement, Genghis Khan sent a small group 
ahead to ask for surrender. If the enemy refused, he killed all the aristocrats. 
Craftworkers, miners, and others with skills, such as the ability to read and 
write, were recruited for the Mongol Empire. Others were used as laborers for 
tasks such as carrying looted goods back to the Mongol capital or as fodder in 
the front lines of battles.
Mongols quickly incorporated into their military the weapons and 
technology of the peoples they conquered. For example, when they conquered 
parts of China and Persia, they exploited the expertise of captured engineers 
who knew how to produce improved siege weapons , such as portable towers 
used to attack walled fortifications and catapults that hurled stones or other 
objects. To keep contact with the far reaches of the empire, Genghis Khan 
created a type of pony express, except instead of carrying written letters riders 
carried oral messages.
Genghis Khan at Peace  Those who expected Genghis Khan to govern 
the way he made war were surprised. The period of Eurasian history between 
the 13th and 14th centuries is often called the Pax Mongolica , or Mongolian 
peace. Genghis Khan established the capital of his empire at Karakorum, near 
the center of what is now the modern country of Mongolia. In constructing the 
city and establishing his government, he consulted with scholars and engineers 
of Chinese and Islamic traditions. Genghis Khan may have been responsible for 
more new bridges than any other ruler in history. The social policies of Genghis 
Khan were liberal for the day. For example, he instituted a policy of religious 
tolerance throughout the empire, which was unusual in the 13th century. Freed 
from years of warfare, Genghis Khan’s soldiers took charge of protecting the 
Silk Roads, making them safe for trade and ushering in the third golden age 
of the Silk Roads. New trade channels were also established between Asia, 
the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. Those who survived the conquests by 
the Mongols and their descendants benefited from the reinvigoration of trade 
routes that had not been heavily used since the days of the Roman and Han 
Empires. (Connect: List the similarities and differences in religious policies 
between the Pax Mongolica and the Romans. See Prologue.)
Genghis Khan’s effort to unify his empire included directing a scribe 
captured in 1204 to adapt the Uyghur alphabet  to represent Mongol. Although 
the effort to establish one system throughout the empire failed, the alphabet is 
still used in Mongolia today.

the empire into Asia and Europe. With each conquest, the empire expanded, 
with new people absorbed into its economy and networks of exchange. 
Batu and the Golden Horde  In 1236, Batu , the son of Khan’s oldest son, 
led a Mongolian army of 100,000 soldiers into Russia, which at the time was a 
loose network of city-states and principalities. Batu’s army, which came to be 
known as the Golden Horde , marched westward, conquering the small Russian 
kingdoms and forcing them to pay tributes. In 1240, the capital city of Kiev 
was looted and destroyed. 
The Golden Horde continued pushing westward. An initial period of sympathy 
for the Mongols, based on religious toleration and promotion of trade, evaporated 
when Western Europe saw the Golden Horde conquer a Christian region, Russia. 
In 1241, Batu led the Golden Horde into a successful military encounter with 
Polish, German, and French knights under the leadership of King Henry of Silesia. 
Soon afterward, Batu defeated a force of Hungarian knights. He next set his sights 
on Italy and Austria, but fate intervened. Back in Karakorum, Ogodei Khan, the 
Great Khan’s successor, had died. Batu called off the attacks and returned home to 
attend the funeral and to see to issues of succession. By the time Batu returned to 
Europe, he had apparently lost interest in conquering Western Europe. 
The Mongols ruled northern Russia by working through existing Russian rulers, 
who sent regular tributes. The Mongols chose this form of indirect rule because they East

89 THE MONGO L EMPIRE AN D THE MO DERN WOR LD did not want to live in the forests. The rulers of the city-state of Moscow  b e g a n 
collecting additional tributes, which they set aside to develop an army to resist the 
Mongols, and began building an anti-Mongol coalition among the Russian city-
states. This coalition, under Moscow’s leadership, rose up against the Golden Horde 
and defeated it in 1380 at the Battle of Kulikovo . After this battle, Mongol influence 
began to decline.  By the mid-16th century, Russia had defeated all of the descendant 
khans of the Mongols except the Crimean Tatars, who were not defeated until the 
late 18th century. Connect: Create a five-event timeline tracing the history of  Russia 
from the Mongols to the development of the modern state. See Topics 1.6 and 2.1.)
The Mongols had long-lasting impact on Russia. As elsewhere, Russia 
suffered widespread devastation and death from the Mongol attacks. But once 
the destruction by the Golden Horde was over, Russia began to recover. The 
invasions prompted Russian princes to improve their military organization and 
to accept the value of more centralized leadership of the region. In addition, three 
centuries of Mongol rule severed Russia’s ties with much of Western Europe. As a 
result, Russia developed a more distinctly Russian culture than it had before, and 
resistance to the Mongols created the foundation for the modern Russian state.
Hulegu and the Islamic Heartlands  While Batu led the western armies, 
Hulegu , another grandson of Genghis Khan, took charge of the southwest 
region. In 1258, Hulegu led the Mongols into the Abbasid territories, where 
they destroyed the city of Baghdad and killed the caliph, along with perhaps 
200,000 residents of the city. Hulegu’s Mongolian armies continued to push 
west, threatening more of the Middle East. In 1260, however, they were 
defeated as a result of a temporary alliance between the Muslim Mamluks, 
under their military leader Baibars, and Christian Crusaders in Palestine. Both 
religious groups viewed the Mongols as a serious threat.
At the time of this defeat, Hulegu’s kingdom, called the Il-khanate , in 
Central Asia stretched from Byzantium to the Oxus River, which is now called 
the Amu Darya. Mongols ruled this kingdom, but Persians served as ministers 
and provincial and local officials. The Mongols found that this arrangement 
resulted in maximum tax collection.
Eventually, Hulegu and most of the other Mongols living in the Il-khanate 
converted to Islam. Before this conversion, the Mongols had tolerated all 
religions in Persia. After the conversion, however, Mongols supported 
massacres of Jews and Christians.
Kublai Khan and the Yuan Dynasty  Meanwhile, in the eastern part of 
the Mongolian Empire, a grandson of Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan , set his 
sights on China, which was then ruled by the Song Dynasty. China was a more 
formidable opponent than those faced by the other khans, and Kublai’s armies 
spent the years from 1235 to 1271 attempting to conquer China. In 1260, 
.ublai assumed the title of Great .han, and eleven years later finally defeated 
the Chinese. Adhering closer to Chinese tradition, rather than enforcing 
Mongolian practices of leadership and control, Kublai Khan established the 
Yuan Dynasty . He rebuilt the capital at Zhongdu, which had been destroyed 
by the Mongols in 1215, calling it Dadu. Kublai Khan proved to be skilled at 
90 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONgoverning a large, diverse territory. Like his grandfather, he instituted a policy 
of religious tolerance, which inspired loyalty in formerly oppressed groups 
such as Buddhists and Daoists, who were out of favor in China at the time. 
His policies were also tolerant toward Muslims, Jews, and Christians. With 
these and other reforms and the protection of the Mongolian armies, most 
Chinese initially enjoyed the rule of the Great Khan; he brought prosperity to 
China because of cultural exchanges and improved trade with other countries, 
including European ones. 
Mongol women led more independent lives than women in other societies 
of the time. In their nomadic culture, women tended flocks of sheep and goats 
in addition to raising children and providing meals for the family. Since they 
rode horses as Mongol men did, the women wore the same kind of leather 
trousers. Mongol women could remarry after being widowed and could initiate 
divorces.
Mongols Lose Power  Despite Kublai Khan’s adoption of many Chinese 
customs, Mongolian leaders eventually alienated many Chinese. They hired 
foreigners for the government rather than native-born Chinese. By promoting 
Buddhists and Daoists and dismantling the civil service exam system, 
the Mongols distressed the Chinese scholar-gentry class who were often 
Confucians. Although the official policy was one of tolerance, the Mongolians 
tended to remain separate from the Chinese and prohibited non-Mongols from 
speaking Mongolian.
Just as Batu had reached the limit of Mongol expansion to the west, the 
Mongolian rulers of China failed to expand beyond China. Starting in 1274, 
the Yuan Dynasty tried and failed to conquer Japan, Indochina, Burma, and the 
island of Java. These defeats suggested to the already disenchanted Chinese 
population that the Mongols were not as fearsome as they once had been. In 
the 1350s, the secret White Lotus Society  began quietly organizing to put an 
end to the Yuan Dynasty. In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang , a Buddhist monk from a 
poor peasant family, led a revolt that overthrew the Yuan Dynasty and founded 
the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). 
The Mongols’ defeat in China paralleled a general decline in their power 
elsewhere, and the empire began to shrink. The Golden Horde had lost its 
territory by about 1369, while Central Asian territories were conquered by 
Tamerlane, also known as Timur the Lame, at around the same time.

Topic 2.1.)
The Long-Term Impact of the Mongolian Invasions
The Mongolian invasions played a key role in history in many ways, positive 
and negative. 
• Mongols conquered a larger area than the Romans, and their bloody 
reputation was usually well-earned.Their empire was the largest 
continuous land empire in history.
91 THE MONGO L EMPIRE AN D THE MO DERN WOR LD • During the period known as the Pax Mongolica (c. 1250–c. 1350), 
Mongols revitalized interregional trade between Asia, the Middle East, 
Africa, and Europe. The Mongols built a system of roads and continued 
to maintain and guard the trade routes. 
• Interregional cultural exchange occurred as well. Islamic scientific 
knowledge made its way to China, and paper from China made 
possible the revolution in communication powered by the Gutenberg 
printing press (see Topic 1.6). The Mongols transferred Greco-Islamic 
medical knowledge and the Arabic numbering system to Western 
Europe.
• The Mongol conquests helped to transmit the fleas that carried the 
bubonic plague , termed the Black Death, from southern China to 
Central Asia, and from there to Southeast Asia and Europe. It followed 
familiar paths of trade and military conquest.
• The Mongols ruled successfully due to their understanding of 
centralized power, a capacity that would transfer in many cases to 
the occupied civilizations. The Mongols devised and used a single 
international law for all their conquered territories. Thus, after the 
Mongols declined in power, the kingdoms and states of Europe, Asia, 
and Southeast Asia continued or copied the process of centralizing 
power.
• Mongol fighting techniques led to the end of Western Europe’s use of 
knights in armor. The heavily clad knights could not react in time to the 
Mongols’ use of speed and surprise.
• The era of the walled city in Europe also came to an end, as walls 
proved useless against the Mongols’ siege technology. Some consider 
the cannon  a Mongol invention, cobbled together using Chinese 
gunpowder, Muslim flamethrowers, and European bell-casting 
techniques.

had taken place since the death of [Genghis Khan], and the partition of his 
vast dominions. And then the younger Duke, Wsewolodovics, took up the 
tale.
‘Lord King!’ he began, ‘these Mongols don’t carry on warfare in an 
honorable, chivalrous way. They fight only to destroy, they are bloodthirsty, 
merciless; their only object is to plunder, slay, murder, and burn, not even to 
make any use of what lands they conquer. They are like a swarm of locusts. 
They stay till everything is eaten up, till all are plundered, and what they 
can’t carry off, that they kill, or reduce to ashes. They are utterly faithless; 
their words and promises are not in the least to be trusted, and those who do 
make friends with them are the first upon whom they wreak their vengeance if 
anything goes wrong. We are telling you no fairy tales! We know to our own 
cost what they are, we tell you what we have seen with our own eyes. And let

that follows.
“And the Monarch of the World, the Hatim of the Age, [Mengü] Qa’an [Khan] 
passed away, Güyük, his eldest son had not returned from the campaign 
against the Qifchaq, and therefore in accordance with precedent the dispatch 
of orders and the assembling of the people took place at the door of the . . . 
palace of his wife, Möge Khatun. . . . But since Törengene Khatun was the 
mother of his eldest sons and was moreover shrewder and more sagacious 
than Möge Khatun, she [Törengene Khatun] sent messages to the princes, 
i.e. the brothers and nephews of the Qa’an . . . and said that until a Khan was 
appointed by agreement someone would have to be ruler and leader in order 
that the business of the state might not be neglected nor the affairs of the 
commonwealth thrown into confusion; in order, too, that the army and the 
court might be kept under control and the interests of the people protected.  
. . . therefore, until a quriltai [an assembly of Mongol nobles] was held, it was 
she [Törengene Khatun] that should direct the affairs of the state, and the old 
ministers should remain in the service of the Court, so that the old and new 
yasas [political structure or order] might not be changed from what was the

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:   IDENTIF Y CONNECTIONS  BETWEEN  
HISTORICA L DEVELOPMENTS
Making connections helps historians see developments not as isolated 
happenings but rather as pieces of a larger pattern. For example, examining 
the exchange of goods between c. 1200 and c. 1450 takes on much more 
meaning when it is connected with the exchange of ideas, knowledge, 
technology, and religion. The impact of trade on states that participated 
in the Silk Roads exchanges from c. 1200 to c. 1450 went far beyond just 
the goods that changed hands.
Explain the connection between the development described in each 
statement and the overall development of the Mongol Empire from 
1210 to 1369. 
1. The Mongols’ bloody reputation spread farther than their conquest.
2. The Mongols incorporated the weapons and technology of the 
people they conquered into their military.  
3. Kublai Khan instituted a policy of religious tolerance. 
4. The Mongols restored interregional trade among Asia, the Middle

1. In one to three paragraphs, explain how Eurasian empires grew over 
time and how their expansion influenced trade and communication.
EXCHANGE IN THE IN DIAN OCEAN 95
2.3
Exchange in the Indian Ocean
:eek ye knowledge, e]en to *hina 
—Hadith (9th century)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the growth 
of networRs  of e_change  after 1200, and how did 
environmental  Rnowledge  support that e_pansion?
The saying from the Hadith, traditionally attributed to the prophet 
Muhammad, provides guidance to Muslims, encouraging them to travel and 
learn. Following this advice, it is understandable that Dar al–Islam—literally 
the House of Islam, or Muslim world²might be called the world’s first global 
empire. It connected societies from North Africa to South Asia. 
Even before missionaries and imperial armies spread Islam around the 
world, Muslim merchants traveling to non-Muslim lands in search of trading 
partners were paving the way. In fact, Arab merchants had been traveling to 
South Asia for centuries before Islam began expanding. Muslim merchants’ 
connections to Dar al-Islam interacted with developments in sailing technology 
and environmental knowledge to transform the Indian Ocean into an economic 
hot spot during the Postclassical Era .
Causes of Expanded Exchange in the Indian Ocean 
South Asia, with its location in the center of the Indian Ocean, benefited 
enormously from the trade in the Indian Ocean Basin . (Connect: Write a 
paragraph comparing the Islamic global empire with the Mongolian Empire. 
See Topic 2.2.)  Although some of the causes of expanded trade in the Indian 
Ocean Basin were the same as those of expanded overland routes, some related 
specifically to ocean travel and knowledge.
Spread of Islam  Although the Indian Ocean trade had existed as early 
as 200 B.C.E., the expansion of Islam connected more cities than ever before. 
Trading partners existed in East Africa, East and Southeast Asia, and South Asia. 
Muslim Persians and Arabs were the dominant seafarers and were instrumental 
in transporting goods to port cities across the Indian Ocean. Cities on the west 
coast of India, such as Calicut  and Cambay, became thriving centers of trade 
due to interactions with merchants from East Africa and Southwest Asia. 
Calicut, especially, became a bustling port city for merchants in search 
of spices from southern India. Foreign merchants from Arabia and China met 
96 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONin Calicut to exchange goods from the West and the East, respectively. Local 
rulers welcomed the presence of Muslim and Chinese merchants, as it brought 
the city wealth and prominence in the Indian Ocean Basin. 
Increased Demand for Specialized Products  As the Indian Ocean trade 
grew, so did the demand for specialized products. Every region involved in 
trade had something special to offer its trading partners.
• India became known for the high quality of its fabrics, particularly 
cotton. In addition, merchants traveled to India in search of 
meticulously woven carpets as well as high-carbon steel (used for 
knives and swords), tanned leather, and artisan-crafted stonework. 
Merchants also sought pepper from India’s southern coastal cities. 
• Modern-day Malaysia and Indonesia became known as the Spice 
Islands  because of the fragrant nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and 
cardamom they exported. 
• Enslaved people, ivory, and gold came from the Swahili coastal cities 
of Mombasa, Mogadishu, and Sofala. 
• China exported silks, and Chinese porcelain became coveted 
worldwide, which is why people in the West still refer to their fancier 
dishes as “fine china.”
• From Southwest Asia came horses, figs, and dates.
Trade in enslaved people also played a role in exchanges in the Indian 
Ocean. While most Africans who were enslaved and transported to the 
Americas after 1500 came from west and central Africa, there had been a long-
running slave trade in the eastern part of the continent. By routes over land or 
in the Indian Ocean, enslaved people from eastern Africa were sold to buyers 
in northern Africa, the Middle East, and India. Many were transported to the 
islands off the southeast coast of Africa, such as Madagascar. The trade reached 
its peak in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Enslaved people taken in the Indian Ocean trade suffered fates different 
from those who were taken across the Atlantic. Those in the Indian Ocean trade 
were more likely to provide forced labor in seaports in the shipping industry 
and as household servants. Some worked as sailors or even soldiers. Living 
in towns or cities, they had more opportunity to develop communities and to 
work alongside free laborers than did enslaved people taken to the Americas. 
Enslaved people who ended up in Islamic communities had certain rights, such 
as the right to marry. As a result of the Indian Ocean slave trade , African 
words, musical styles, and customs can be found in Oman, India, and elsewhere.
Environmental Knowledge  Knowledge of monsoon winds  was essential 
for trading in the Indian Ocean. In the winter months, winds originated from 
the northeast, while in the spring and summer, they blew from the southwest. 
Thus, merchants had to time their voyages carefully, often remaining in port 
cities for months at a time, depending on when favorable winds would come 
their way. 
97 EXCHANGE IN THE IN DIAN OCEAN 97Advances in Maritime Technology  Travelers needed ships capable of 
navigating the Indian Ocean’s winds. Arab sailors used sailing technology to 
aid their travel. It is debatable whether Arab sailors invented the triangular 
lateen sails  that they used, but the sails were popular because sailors found 
that the triangular shape could easily catch winds coming from many different 
directions. Chinese sailors during the classical period had invented the 
stern rudder , which gave their ships more stability and made them easier 
to maneuver. The small wooden dhows used by Arab and Indian sailors 
dominated the seas during the Postclassical Era. Trade facilitated the rapid 
spread of sailing technology across the many lands bordering the Indian Ocean 
in this period. (See Topic 4.1 for later Chinese maritime technology, such 
as the magnetic compass and improved rudder.) The astrolabe , improved by 
Muslim navigators in the 12th century, allowed sailors to determine how far 
north or south they were from the equator.
Growth of States The trading networks in the Indian Ocean fostered the 
growth of states to help institutionalize the revenue from trade. One Muslim 
city-state, Malacca , also spelled Melaka , became wealthy by building a navy 
and by imposing fees on ships that passed through the Strait of Malacca, a 
narrow inlet that many ship captains used to travel between ports in India and 
ports in China. The Sultan of Malacca became so powerful in the 1400s that 
he expanded the state into Sumatra and the southern Malay Peninsula. As in 
city-states in East Africa, Italy, and the Americas, Malacca’s prosperity was 
based on trade rather than agriculture or mining or manufacturing. 
The sultanate ended when the Portuguese invaded the city in 1511. The 
Portuguese hoped that by conquering the key city on the Strait of Malacca, 
they could control the trade that flowed through it between Europe, India, and 
China. They were successful enough to generate great wealth for their empire. 
However, they were less successful than they had hoped. Their conquest 
touched off conflicts among the other states in the region and caused traders to 
diversify their routes and the ports they used. 
(σecWsRf([SDnGeG([cKDnJeinWKe,nGiDn2ceDn
Some of the very factors that caused expansion of exchange networks in the 
Indian Ocean also, in time, became effects. 
Diasporic Communities  Without the arrival of merchants in distant lands, 
trade could not have expanded. As a natural result of waiting for favorable 
winds for travel, these merchants interacted with the surrounding cultures 
and peoples of the region. In fact, many Arab and East African merchants 
stayed in western Indian port cities permanently because they married women 
they met there. Arab and Persian merchants settled in East Africa. Thus, these 
merchants from Dar al-Islam were the first to bring Islam to southern Asia, 
not through missionary work or conquest, but through intermarriage. Their 
children would generally be raised within Muslim traditions. 
98 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONSettlements of people away from their homeland are known as a diaspora . 
In these communities, settlers introduced their own cultural traditions into 
the indigenous cultures. Those cultures, in turn, influenced the culture of the 
merchants. Diasporas arose through trade in many parts of the world.

Response to Increased Demand  In a similar way, increased demand 
for products caused trade to expand. At the same time, however, it resulted in 
several effects with long-lasting impact. For example, to meet rising demand, 
producers needed to find ways to become more efficient²to grow more crops, 
to make more textiles, to manufacture more iron. In some places, the role of 
the state increased even more to oversee these efforts at efficiency and to raise 
money through customs—taxes on imported goods—and fees for the use of 
seaports. The western Indian Rajput kingdom of Gujarat,  for example, became 
the go-between for trade between the East and West. The revenue from customs 
in Gujarat was many times more than the entire worth of some European states.
Swahili City-States The Indian Ocean trade also created thriving city-states 
along the east coast of Africa, sometimes known as the Swahili city-states . 
“Swahili,” which literally means “coasters,” referred to the inhabitants of 
bustling commercial centers, such as Kilwa, Mombasa (in modern Kenya), and 
Zanzibar (in modern Tanzania). The traders of the Zanj Coast, as it was known 
in Arabic, sold ivory, gold, and enslaved people to their Arab trading partners, 
as well as more exotic goods such as tortoise shells, peacock feathers, and 
rhinoceros horns. In exchange, the “Zanj” cities acquired Chinese porcelain, 
Indian cotton, and manufactured ironwork. Trade was so vigorous with East 
Asia that Chinese porcelain remains a common find among the ruins of Swahili 
cities.
Trade brought considerable wealth to the cities on the East African coast. 
Architectural ruins in Kilwa suggest the wealth and grandeur that once existed 
there. For example, most buildings had traditionally been constructed of mud 
and clay. However, at the Indian Ocean trade’s height, many mosques and 
wealthy merchants’ homes were made of stone or coral.
99 EXCHANGE IN THE IN DIAN OCEANSiJnificant Cultural 7ransIers  The transfer of knowledge, culture, 
technology, commerce, and religion intensified as a result of thriving trade in 
the Indian Ocean Basin. The voyages of the Muslim admiral Zheng He  (1371–
1 reflect this transfer, as well as the conflicts it sometimes generated.  In 
105, the Ming emperor Yongle sent =heng He on the first of seven great 
voyages. Zheng traveled to Indonesia, Ceylon, and other coastal areas on the 
Indian Ocean, to Arabia, and to the east coast of Africa as well as to the Cape 
of Good Hope. The main purposes of the voyages were to display the might of 
the Ming Dynasty to the rest of the world and to receive tribute from the people 
he encountered. =heng’s fleet was impressive: At its height, his fleet included 
more than 300 ships that carried 28,000 people. 
The expeditions won prestige for the Chinese government and opened up 
new markets for Chinese goods. Zheng He and his crew returned to China with 
exotic treasures, such as the first giraffe the Chinese had ever seen. They also 
brought back a new understanding of the world beyond China’s borders. The 
voyages inspired some to immigrate to ports in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.
Zheng He’s voyages stirred controversy, though. Confucianism promoted 
a stable, agrarian lifestyle, and scholars worried that greater interaction and 
trade with foreign cultures threatened China’s social order. Some critics simply 
looked down upon other cultures, deeming them barbaric and vastly inferior to 
Chinese culture. Some thought the voyages were too expensive.
Emperor Yongle’s successor, his son Zhu Gaozhi, ended Zheng He’s 
travels, and he also discouraged all Chinese from sailing away from China. 
To emphasize his point, he made building a ship with more than two masts a 
punishable offense. Zheng’s voyages did have one positive short-term result: Arabian

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS 
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“Merchants boast that their wisdom and ability are such as to give them a free 
hand in affairs. They believe that they know all the possible transformations 
in the universe and therefore can calculate all the changes in the human 
world, and that the rise and fall of prices are under their command. These 
merchants do not know how insignificant their wisdom and ability really 
are . . . . If farmers do not work, there will be an insufficiency of food if 
craftsmen do not work, there will be an insufficiency of tools if merchants do 
not work, circulation of the three necessities will be cut off, which will cause 
food and materials to be insufficient . . . . As to the foreigners in the Southeast, 
their goods are useful to us just as ours are to them. To use what one has to 
exchange for what one does not have is what trade is all about . . . . Foreigners 
are recalcitrant [uncooperative] and their greed knows no bounds.”

102 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   APPROACHES  TO MAKING  HISTORICA L 
CONNECTIONS
Making historical connections requires the use of three reasoning 
processes: comparison, causation, and/or continuity and change. 
Following are questions you can ask yourself to make historical 
connections using these processes. The answers to these questions will 
reveal connections.
• Comparison: What topic, idea, or event in history is like another 
topic, idea, or event? How is one topic, idea, or event like and/or 
unlike another? Possible answer and connection:  The expansion 
of sea routes for trade is like the expansion of the land-based Silk 
Roads for trade. They are alike in that they both extended global 
interconnections and depended on new technologies.
• Causation: What caused something to happen? Possible answer 
and connection:  China’s withdrawal from sailing to distant lands 
caused a return of piracy in the China Sea.
• Continuity and change: In what ways is something a continuation 
of what came before it? In what ways did something differ from 
what preceded it? Possible answer and connection:  Trade in the 
Indian Ocean had periods in which it flourished before the spread 
of Islam, and flourishing trade continued after the spread of Islam. 
Some changes after the spread of Islam were the high regard 
afforded Muslim merchants and the expansion of trade routes. 
Make three historical connections between what you read about in

Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of Trans-Saharan  
trade, and how did the growth of empires influence  
trade and communication?
While the East African Coast had been fairly well populated for many 
centuries before the arrival of Islam, few societies had inhabited the Sahara 
Desert  because its arid climate made it nearly impossible to farm. Though 
nomadic communities did conduct some trade across the Sahara, the volume 
of trade increased with the arrival of Muslim merchants in the 7th and 8th 
centuries. When empires such as Mali took over the area in the early 1200s, 
commerce expanded dramatically. As illustrated in the commentaries of Ibn 
Battuta, a Muslim scholar and explorer of the 14th century, merchants and 
traders used caravans to facilitate commerce. Africans traded gold, ivory, 
hides, and enslaved people for Arab and Berber salt, cloth, paper, and horses.
Trans-Saharan Trade
The Sahara Desert is immense, occupying 3.6 million square miles—about 
the same size as China. Of that vast expanse of sand and rock, only about 800 
square miles are oases —places where human settlement is possible because 
water from deep underground is brought to the surface, making land fertile. In 
some oases, the water comes from underground naturally. In others, humans 
have dug wells to access the water. 
Camels, Saddles, and Trade  Muslim merchants from Southwest Asia 
traveled across the Sahara on camels. Native to the Islamic heartland (Arabia), 
camels began to appear in North Africa in the 3rd century B.C.E. Accustomed 
to the harsh, dry climate of the Arabian Desert , camels adapted well to living 
104 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONin the Sahara. Compared to horses, camels can consume a large quantity of 
water at one time (over 50 gallons in three minutes) and not need more water 
for a long time. They began to replace horses and donkeys after 300 C.E.
As use of the camel spread, people developed as many as 15 types of 
camel saddles for different purposes. South Arabians developed a saddle in 
which the rider sits in back of the hump, which makes riding easier because 
the rider can hold onto the hair of the hump. Northern Arabians developed a 
saddle for sitting on top of the hump, putting them high in the air, which gave 
them greater visibility in battles. Being near the head gave the rider the best 
possible control over the camel.
However, the saddle that had the greatest impact on trade was one the 
Somalis in Eastern Africa developed. They were semi-nomadic and needed to 
carry their possessions with them, so they designed a saddle for carrying loads 
up to 600 pounds. Without the development of this type of saddle, camels 
could not have been used to carry heavy loads of goods in trade.

105 TRANS-SAHARAN TRA DE RO UTES 105The caravans that crossed the Sahara often had thousands of camels laden 
not only with goods to trade but also with enough provisions, including fresh 
water, to last until the travelers could reach the next oasis. The people leading 
the caravans generally walked the entire way. The map on page 44 shows some 
of the main trade routes across the Sahara. There were seven north-south trade 
routes and two east-west routes. These put the people in Sub-Saharan Africa in 
touch with an expanding number of cultures and trading partners.
By the end of the 8th century C.E., the trans-Saharan trade  had become 
famous throughout Europe and Asia. Gold was the most precious commodity 
traded. West African merchants acquired the metal from the waters of the 
Senegal River, near modern-day Senegal and Mauritania. Foreign traders 
came to West Africa seeking not only gold but also ivory and enslaved people. 
In exchange, they brought salt, textiles, and horses. For more than 700 years, 
trans-Saharan trade brought considerable wealth to the societies of West Africa, 
particularly the kingdoms of Ghana and Mali. They also brought Islam, which 
spread into Sub-Saharan Africa as a result. ( Connect: Compare the impact of 
trade across the Sahara and throughout the Andes. See Topic 1.4. )

West African Empire Expansion
By the 12th century, wars with neighboring societies had permanently 
weakened the Ghanaian state. (See Topic 1.5.) In its place arose several new 
trading societies, the most powerful of which was Mali . North African traders 
had introduced Islam to Mali in the 9th century.
Mali’s Riches  The government of Mali profited from the gold trade, 
but it also taxed nearly all other trade entering West Africa. In that way, it 
became even more prosperous than Ghana had been. Most of Mali’s residents 
were farmers who cultivated sorghum and rice. However, the great cities of 
Timbuktu and Gao accumulated the most wealth and developed into centers 
of Muslim life in the region. Timbuktu in particular became a world-renowned 
center of Islamic learning. By the 1500s, books created and sold in Timbuktu 
brought prices higher than most other goods.
106 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONExpanding Role of States  The growth in trade and wealth gave rise to 
the need to administer and maintain it. For example, rulers needed to establish 
a currency whose value was widely understood. In Mali, the currency was 
cowrie shells, cotton cloth, gold, glass beads, and salt. Rulers also needed 
to protect both the trade routes and the areas where their currencies were 
made or harvested or their other trade resources were produced. Sometimes 
empires expanded their reach to take over resource-rich areas. They did so 
with military forces well provisioned with horses and iron weapons bought 
with the tax revenue. With each expansion, more people were drawn into the 
empire’s economy and trade networks, bringing more people in touch with 
distant cultures.
Mali’s founding ruler, Sundiata , became the subject of legend. His father 
had ruled over a small society in West Africa in what today is Guinea. When 
his father died, rival groups invaded, killing most of the royal family and 
capturing the throne. They did not bother to kill Sundiata because the young 
prince was crippled and was not considered a threat. In spite of his injury, he 
learned to fight and became so feared as a warrior that his enemies forced him 
into exile. His time in exile only strengthened him and his allies. In 1235, 
Sundiata, “the Lion Prince,” returned to the kingdom of his birth, defeated his 
enemies, and reclaimed the throne for himself.
Sundiata’s story made him beloved within his kingdom, but he was also an 
astute and capable ruler. Most scholars believe he was a Muslim and used his 
connections with others of his faith to establish trade relationships with North 
African and Arab merchants. Sundiata cultivated a thriving gold trade in Mali. 
Under his steady leadership, Mali’s wealth grew tremendously.
Mansa Musa  In the 14th century, Sundiata’s grand-nephew, Mansa 
Musa , brought more fame to the region. However, Mansa Musa was better 
known for his religious leadership than for his political or economic acumen. 
A devout Muslim, Mansa Musa began a pilgrimage in 1324 to Mecca , Islam’s 
holiest city. His journey, however, was unlike that of any ordinary pilgrim. 
Mali’s prosperity allowed him to take an extraordinarily extravagant caravan 
to Arabia, consisting of 100 camels, thousands of enslaved people and soldiers, 
and gold to distribute to all of the people who hosted him along his journey. His 
pilgrimage displayed Mali’s wealth to the outside world.
Mansa Musa’s visit to Mecca deepened his devotion to Islam. Upon his 
return, he established religious schools in Timbuktu, built mosques in Muslim 
trading cities, and sponsored those who wanted to continue their religious 
studies elsewhere. Though most West Africans continued to hold onto their 
traditional beliefs, Mansa Musa’s reign deepened the support for Islam in Mali.
However, in fewer than 100 years after Mansa Musa’s death, the Mali 
kingdom was declining. By the late 1400s, the Songhai Kingdom  had taken 
its place as the powerhouse in West Africa. Following processes like those 
Mali had gone through, Songhai became larger and richer than Mali. In 
spite of Mali’s fall, Mansa Musa’s efforts to strengthen Islam in West Africa 
succeeded: The religion has a prominent place in the region today.

the trade networRs  from c. 1200 to c. 1450?
whether by caravan through the Sahara or Gobi deserts or by junk 
or dhow on the China Sea or Indian Ocean, goods, people, and ideas 
traveled with relative freedom through the networks of exchange in Afro-
Eurasia in the years between c. 1200 and c. 1450. One reason for this 
free exchange was the stability of the Mongol Empire and the protection 
it offered merchants and travelers. The empire reached well past former 
boundaries, incorporating new people, goods, and ideas within its 
authority. Technological developments, such as gunpowder and paper 
from China, were diffused by trade. Literary and artistic interactions and 
cultural exchanges were documented by travelers such as Marco Polo 
and Ibn Battuta, who told of the wonders they saw and the extraordinary 
people they met. The known world became a larger place.
Religious, Cultural, and Technological  
(σecWsRf,nWeUDcWiRn
The diffusion of different religions between c. 1200 and c. 1450 had 
varying effects. In some cases, the arrival of a new religion served to 
unify people and provide justification for a kingdom’s leadership. It often 
also influenced the literary and artistic culture of areas to which it spread, 
where themes, subjects, and styles were inspired by the spreading religion. 
In other places, it either fused or coexisted with the native religions. 
The interactions resulting from increased trade also led to technological 
innovations that helped shape the era.
112 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITION,nfluence oI %uGGhisP on (ast $sian Culture  Buddhism came to China 
from its birthplace in India via the Silk Roads, and the 7th-century Buddhist 
monk Xuanzang helped make it popular. Monks related Buddhism to familiar 
Daoist principles, and in time Buddhist doctrines fused with elements of 
Daoist traditions to create the syncretic faith Chan Buddhism, also known as 
Zen Buddhism. Although some leaders in China did not want China’s native 
religions diminished as a result of the spread of Buddhism, Chan Buddhism 
remained popular among ordinary Chinese citizens. Under the Song Dynasty 
(960–1279), many Confucians among the scholar gentry began to adopt its 
ideals into their daily lives. The development of printing had made Buddhist 
scriptures widely available to the Confucian scholar gentry. Buddhist writers 
also influenced Chinese literature by writing in the vernacular rather than the 
formal language of Confucian scholars, a practice that became widespread. 
Japan and Korea, countries in China’s orbit, also adopted Buddhism, 
along with Confucianism. In Korea, the educated elite studied Confucian 
classics, while Buddhist doctrine attracted the peasants. Neo-Confucianism 
was another syncretic faith that originated in China, first appearing in the 
Tang Dynasty but developing further in the Song Dynasty. Neo-Confucianism 
fused rational thought with the abstract ideas of Daoism and Buddhism and 
became widespread in Japan and 9ietnam. It also became .orea’s official state 
ideology.

113 CULTURAL CONSEQ UENCES OF CONNECTI VITY 113Spread of Hinduism and Buddhism  Through trade, the Indian religions 
of Hinduism and Buddhism made their way to Southeast Asia as well. The 
sea-based Srivijaya Empire on Sumatra was a Hindu kingdom, while the 
later Majapahit Kingdom on Java was Buddhist. The South Asian land-based 
Sinhala dynasties in Sri Lanka became centers of Buddhist study with many 
monasteries. Buddhism’s influence was so strong under the Sinhala dynasties 
that Buddhist priests often advised monarchs on matters of government. (See 
Topic 1.3.) 
The Khmer Empire in present-day Cambodia, also known as the Angkor 
Kingdom, was the most successful kingdom in Southeast Asia. The royal 
monuments at Angkor Thom are evidence of both Hindu and Buddhist cultural 
influences on Southeast Asia. Hindu artwork and sculptures of Hindu gods 
adorned the city. Later, when Khmer rulers had become Buddhist, they added 
Buddhist sculptures and artwork onto buildings while keeping the Hindu 
artwork. 
Spread of Islam  Through merchants, missionaries, and conquests, Islam 
spread over a wide swath of Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The chart 
below summarizes some of the cultural influences of that expansion.
Cultural Inﬂuences of Islam in Afro-Eurasia
Region 0nÅ\enJeZ
Africa • Swahili  language is a blend of Bantu and Arabic and is still 
widely spoken today.
• Timbuktu became a center of Islamic learning.
• Leaders of African states deepened Islamic ties through 
pilgrimages to Mecca.
South Asia • Before Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism were popular.
• After Islam arrived, Buddhists converted more readily than 
Hindus because they were disillusioned by the corruption 
among Buddhist priests.
• With its emphasis on equality, Islam also attracted lower-caste 
Hindus.
• Architecture blended Hindu designs with Islamic patterns.
• Urdu language had influences from Sanskrit-based Hindi, as 
well as from Arabic and Farsi, a Persian language.
• Bhakti poets and missionaries sought links between Hinduism 
and Islam. 
Southeast Asia • Muslim rulers on Java combined Mughal Indian features, local 
traditions, and Chinese-Buddhist and Confucian traits.
• Traditional Javanese stories, puppetry, and poetry absorbed 
Muslim characters and techniques.
Scientific anG 7echnoloJical ,nnoYations  Along with religion, science 
and technology traveled the trade routes. Islamic scholars translated Greek 
literary classics into Arabic, saving the works of Aristotle and other Greek 
thinkers from oblivion. Scholars also brought back mathematics texts from 
114 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIndia and techniques for papermaking from China. They studied medicine 
from ancient Greeks, Mesopotamians, and Egyptians, making advances in 
hospital care, including surgery. (See Topic 1.2.)
Improvements in agricultural efficiency, such as the use of Champa 
rice, spread from India to Vietnam and China. With a reliable food supply, 
the population grew, as did cities and industries, such as the production of 
porcelain, silk, steel, and iron. Papermaking reached Europe from China in 
the 13th century and along with printing technology helped lead to a rise in 
literacy.
Seafaring technology improved with lateen sails , the stern rudder , the 
astrolabe , and the magnetic compass  as Chinese, Indian, and Southwest 
Asians expanded their knowledge of astronomy and other aspects of the natural 
world. Production of gunpowder  and guns spread from China and influenced 
warfare as well.
Thanks, in part, to the writing of Marco Polo, historians have a good picture 
of the city of Hangzhou  in China. It shows how trade supported urbanization. 
Hangzhou was large—it was home to about one million people—but other 
Chinese cities were larger. Chang’an had about two million people. However, 
Hangzhou was the center of culture in southern China, the home of poets such 
as Lu Yu and Xin Qiji, and other writers and artists. Located at the southern 
end of the Grand Canal, it was also a center of trade. Like other important 
cities of the era, such as Novgorod in Russia, Timbuktu in Africa, and Calicut 
in India, the city grew and prospered as its merchants exchanged goods. This 
trade brought diversity to Hangzhou, including a thriving community of Arabs.
Other cities on the trade routes that grew and thrived included Samarkand  
and Kashgar.  (See Topic 2.1.) They were both known as centers of Islamic 
scholarship, bustling markets, and sources for fresh water and plentiful food 
for merchants traveling the Silk Roads. 
Factors Contributing to Growth of Cities
• Political stability and decline of invasions
• Safe and reliable transportation
• Rise of commerce
• Plentiful labor supply
• Increased agricultural output
Declining Cities  Kashgar, however, declined after a series of conquests 
by nomadic invaders and in 1389–90 was ravaged by Tamerlane. (See Topic 
2.2.) Another once-thriving city, the heavily walled Constantinople  in present-
day Turkey, also suffered a series of traumatic setbacks. Mutinous Crusader 
armies weakened Constantinople after an attack in the Fourth Crusade in 1204 
(see Topic 1.6), and in 1346 and 1349, the bubonic plague killed about half of 
the people in Constantinople. After a 5-day seige, the city finally fell to the 
Ottomans in 1453, an event some historians believe marks the end of the High 
Middle Ages. (Connect: Describe the relationship between urban growth in 
Europe and later urban decline. (See Topic 1.6.)
115 CULTURAL CONSEQ UENCES OF CONNECTI VITY Factors Contributing to Decline of Cities
• Political instability and invasions
• Disease
• Decline of agricultural productivity
Effects of the Crusades  Knowledge of the world beyond Western Europe 
increased as Crusaders encountered both the Byzantine and Islamic cultures. The 
encounters also increased demand in Europe for newfound wares from the East. In 
opening up to global trade, however, Western Europeans also opened themselves 
to disease. The plague, referred to as the Black Death , was introduced to Europe 
by way of trading routes. A major epidemic broke out between 1347 and 1351. 
Additional outbreaks occurred over the succeeding decades. As many as 25 
million people in Europe may have died from the plague. With drastically reduced 
populations, economic activity declined in Europe. In particular, a shortage of 
people to work on the land had lasting effects on the feudal system. Also, exposure 
to new ideas from Byzantium and the Muslim world would contribute to the 
Renaissance and the subsequent rise of secularism.

116 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMarco Polo  In the late 13th century, Marco Polo , an Italian native from 
Venice, visited the court of Kublai Khan. (See Topic 2.2.) Chinese cities 
impressed Polo. After Polo returned to Italy in 1295, he wrote a book about 
his travels. However, many Europeans refused to believe his descriptions 
of China’s size, wealth, and wonders. Only when other Europeans followed 
Polo’s route to China did people widely accept that China was prosperous 
and innovative. Polo’s captivating descriptions of the customs of the people 
he met intrigued Europeans. Polo wrote extensively about the high levels of 
urbanization he saw in the 13th century. Polo’s point of view as a merchant 
kept him focused on trade-related matters.
They use paper money as currency. The men as well as the women are fair-
skinned and handsome. Most of them always dress themselves in silk, as a 
result of the vast quantities of that material produced in Hangzhou, exclusive 
of what the merchants import from other provinces.
Ibn Battuta  He was just 21 years old, Ibn Battuta  (1304–1353), a 
Muslim scholar from Morocco, set out to see the world he read about. 
I set out alone, having neither fellow-traveller in whose companionship I 
might find cheer, nor caravan whose part I might join, but swayed by an 
overmastering impulse within me and a desire long-cherished in my bosom 
to visit these illustrious sanctuaries.
Over 30 years, Ibn Battuta traveled through Central Asia, Southeast Asia, 
South Asia, China, Spain, North Africa, and Mali, mainly to Muslim lands. 
After telling his tales to the Sultan of Morocco, Battuta was told to “dictate 
an account of the cities which he had seen in his travel, and of the interesting 
events which had clung to his memory, and that he should speak of those 
whom he had met of the rulers of countries, of their distinguished men of 
learning, and of their pious saints.” His book A Gift to Those Who Contemplate 
the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Traveling  provides a wealth of detail 
about the places he visited and their cultures. Unlike Polo, Battuta had the 
point of view of a Muslim devoted to his faith. His journey was in large part 
to learn as much as he could about Islam and its people and accomplishments. 
Margery Kempe  English mystic Margery Kempe  (c. 1373–c. 1440), 
whose The Book of Margery Kempe  was one of the earliest autobiographies 
in English, if not the first, could neither read nor write. She dictated her book 
to scribes who wrote down her descriptions of her pilgrimages to Jerusalem, 
Rome, Germany, and Spain. She does relate details of her travel experiences, 
such as being so overcome by the sight of Jerusalem as she approached it that 
she nearly fell off her donkey. However, her book is also significant because it 
is a firsthand account of a middle-class medieval woman’s life. .empe conveys 
both the intense spiritual visions and feelings of her mystical experiences and 
the trials of everyday life for a woman with 14 children.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“Ibn Battuta traveled primarily in Muslim-ruled lands, the Dar al-Islam [House 
or Abode of Islam], while the Christian Polo, son of a European merchant, 
lived and worked in countries whose cultures and religions were foreign to 
him. This difference makes a comparison of their works most interesting. 
Marco Polo’s knowledge of four Asian languages as well as Italian allowed 
him to communicate with foreigners and even work as an administrator for the 
Chinese emperor. Yet, in all his travels, he remained culturally an “outsider” 
to the peoples he met, and this fact enhanced his power of observation and 
stimulated his natural curiosity. By contrast, Ibn Battuta usually traveled as an 
“insider” and his hosts accepted him as a respected Muslim jurist [qadi] and 
student of Islamic mysticism >Sufism@. Traveling to more than sixty Muslim 
courts, where he met rulers and their officials, Ibn Battuta was able to judge 
the behavior of his hosts in light of the Muslim scripture, the Koran, and the 
precepts of Islamic law. For him, the difference between their native cultures 
and his own North Arabic culture was a secondary importance.”

that follows. 
“The borrowing and lending necessary for most of the crusaders stimulated 
credit formation and the development of credit institutions and instruments. 
Indeed, the money economy as a whole must have been stimulated by these 
great enterprises which took so much money. The transformation of gold and 
silver altar ornaments into coin for crusaders may have helped to heighten 
the inflation that occurred during the Crusades, especially in the later 12th 
century. The sale of land to finance most assuredly helped to make the market 
in real estate which was bringing about a new social order in the age of the 
Crusades. The principal beneficiaries of all these financial transactions were 
the bourgeoisie, who loaned the money, bought the land, sold the provisions, 
furnished the transportation, and generally benefited from the financial 
activity of the crusaders.”

well as secondary sources created later based on information from 
primary sources and other secondary sources. While they all might be 
“truthful,” each has a perspective, or point of view, that might color 
the interpretation of events and experiences. To evaluate historical 
evidence, identify a source’s point of view, purpose, historical situation,

• What might be unique about his or her point of view? 
• For what purpose was the source created?
• For whom and in what situation was it created? 
• How did people use it at the time?

Essential Question:   What were some of the environmental  effects of  
trade in Afro-Eurasia  from c. 1200 to c. 1450?
Although trade networks enabled the spread of novel agricultural products, 
such as the introduction of certain citrus fruits to the Mediterranean basin, the 
most dramatic environmental consequence of increased commerce was not 
food, but rather disease. Bubonic plague or “Black Death” swept from Central 
Asia; struck in China, India, Persia, and Egypt; and arrived in Europe in 1347. 
The epidemic is estimated to have killed from 75 to 200 million people in 
Eurasia and peaked in Europe from 1347 to 1351. Boccaccio, whose famous 
work The Decameron  was inspired by living through the plague, described the 
horrors he saw.
$JUiculWuUDl(σecWsRf([cKDnJe1eWZRUNs 
Along with luxury goods, spices, textiles, and religions, merchants in some 
places introduced crops where they had not grown before. The new crops often 
had an impact on land use and population growth and distribution. In some 
areas, people found ways to sustain abundant production; in others, overuse of 
the land led to environmental degradation.
Migration of Crops  Few crops had as significant an impact as the quick-
ripening Champa rice , which was introduced to the Champa states by Vietnam, 
a Hindu state, and then offered to the Chinese as tribute. Because of the Hindu 
influence on Champa in present-day central 9ietnam, some scholars believe 
Champa rice may have originated in India. It was drought-resistant, flood-
resistant, and capable of yielding two crops a year. It was widely distributed in 
China to meet the needs of the growing population and in turn contributed to 
the population growth.
It also had an impact on land use. Through terraced farming in the uplands 
and paddies in the lowlands, Champa rice was grown in many parts of China 
where once land was thought unusable for growing rice. Nonetheless, as the 
122 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONpopulation of China grew, people tended to migrate southward to the original 
rice growing region, contributing to the growth of cities.
Indonesian seafarers traveling across the Indian Ocean had introduced 
bananas  to Sub-Saharan Africa. The nutrition-rich food led to a spike in 
population. Many Indonesians settled on the island of Madagascar. Bananas 
allowed the Bantu-speaking peoples (see Prologue) with their metallurgy 
skills and farming techniques to migrate to places where yams—a traditional 
food source—did not easily grow. To grow bananas, farmers increased land for 
cultivation, which enriched diets and led to population growth.
As caliphs conquered lands beyond the Arabian Peninsula, they spread 
Islam, the Arabic language, and the cultivation of cotton, sugar , and citrus 
crops . New foods were also available at the markets along the trade routes. 
The markets of Samarkand, for example, introduced new fruits and vegetables, 
as well as rice and citrus products from Southwest Asia, to Europe. Europeans’ 
demand for sugar would become so high that it became a key factor in the 
massive use of enslaved people in the Americas in the 1500s and after. ( Connect:

This photo was taken in 1911 of a vendor in the central Asian city of Samarkand. In 
the valleys in this region, people have long grown melons, grapes, apples, citrus fruits, 
pomegranates, apricots, peaches, and other fruits. These products were then widely 
distributed by merchants who traveled on the Silk Roads.
123 ENVIRONMENTA L CONSEQ UENCES OF CONNECTI VITY 123Environmental Degradation  Increases in population put pressure on 
resources. For example, overgrazing  outside of Great Zimbabwe was so 
severe that people had to abandon the city in the late 1400s. (See Topic 1.5.) 
In feudal Europe, overuse of farm land and deforestation  led to soil erosion , 
reducing agricultural production. The Little Ice Age (c. 1300–c. 1800) also 
contributed to a decrease in agricultural products. Environmental degradation 
was a factor in the decline of the Mayans in the Americas as well.
Spread of Epidemics through Exchange Networks
While scholars in Dar al-Islam and India were developing advances in medical 
understanding and treatment, no knowledge at the time could have prevented 
the spread of deadly infectious diseases that accompanied trade. The Mongol 
conquests helped to transmit the fleas that carried the bubonic plague , termed 
the Black Death, from southern China to Central Asia, and from there to 
Southeast Asia and Europe. Some historians believe the caravanserai that 
housed people and animals together may have contributed to the spread of the 
disease, since the animals likely carried infected fleas. 
The Black Death had a tremendous impact on Europe, killing one-third 
of the population there in a few years. With fewer workers, agricultural 
production continued its decline. However, the reduced number of workers 
led to a new relationship between workers and those they worked for: each 
person’s labor became more valuable, so workers could demand higher wages. 
This shift helped lay the groundwork for the economic changes that developed 
as feudalism declined.
The Black Death led to similar loss of life in other areas, including North 
Africa, China, and Central Asia. About 25 million Chinese and other Asians 
died between 1332 and 1347. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa were spared 
because there were few trading ports in those regions.

• Moroccan historian Ibn Khaldun wrote about the black plague outbreak 
this way:  “Civilization both in the East and the West was visited by a 
destructive plague which devastated nations and caused populations to 
vanish. It swallowed up many of the good things of civilization and wiped 
them out. . . . Civilization decreased with the decrease of mankind. Cities 
and buildings were laid waste, roads and way signs were obliterated, 
settlements and mansions became empty, dynasties and tribes grew weak. 
The entire inhabited world changed.”
• In The Travels of Ibn Battuta , the great traveler noted that as of 1345, “the 
number that died daily in Damascus [Syria] had been two thousand,” but the 
people were able to defeat the plague through prayer.
• An Italian lawyer, Gabriele de Mussis, recorded: “The whole army was 
affected by a disease which overran the Tartars [Mongols] and killed 
thousands upon thousands every day.” He [charges] that the Mongol 
leader “ordered corpses to be placed in catapults and lobbed into the city 
in hopes that the intolerable stench would kill everyone inside.”
• A French churchman, Gilles li Muisis, notes that a “calamitous disease befell 
the Tartar army, and the mortality was so great and widespread that scarcely 
one in twenty of them remained alive.” However, he depicts the Mongol 
survivors as surprised when the Christians in Kaffa also came down with the 
disease.

CAUSATION
One way to make connections across cultures and eras is to analyze cycles 
of cause and effect. For example, improved agricultural production 
often leads to increased population. Increased population, in turn, 
requires even more agricultural production. Efforts to fulfill agricultural 
and other needs associated with increased population, in turn, may 
lead to pressure on resources, including environmental degradation, 
and the population may decline as a result or be vulnerable to disease 
or conquest. However, with the next improvement in agriculture or 
another economic advancement, the population may grow again, and 
so the cycle continues. Recognizing this somewhat predictable cycle of 
cause and effect can help you make connections by seeing it in action in 
different geographic areas at different times in history.
Describe a similar cycle of cause and effect related to increased 
demand for goods rather than for food. Then, analyze cause-

Essential Question:   What were the similarities  and differences  among the 
various networRs  of e_change  in the period from c. 
1200 to c. 1450?
Calicut was known as the “City of Spices,” a market city where merchants 
traded their goods for pepper and cinnamon from India and a variety of goods 
from other areas as well. In some ways, such as its ability to provide security 
and the diversity of people who patronized the markets, Calicut was like other 
big trading cities along the well-traveled trade routes. In other ways, such as 
the type of currency it used and how the polity, or governmental unit,  made 
money on trade, it differed from trading cities elsewhere. The similarities 
and differences among trading cities were also reflected in the larger trading 
networks. 
Similarities Among Networks of Exchange
Several major trading networks connected people in Africa, Europe, and Asia 
in the years between c. 1200 and c. 1450:
• the Silk Roads through the Gobi Desert and mountain passes in China 
and Central Asia to Southwest Asia and Europe, on which merchants 
tended to specialize in luxury goods 
• the monsoon-dependent trade routes in the Indian Ocean linking East 
Asia with Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Southwest Asia, on which 
merchants exchanged goods too heavy to transport by land
• the trans-Saharan trade routes from North Africa and the Mediterranean 
Basin across the desert to West and East Africa, on which merchants 
traded salt from North Africa with gold from the kingdoms south of  
the desert 
128 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONWhile each exchange network had its unique characteristics, all were similar 
in their origins, purpose, and effects. 
Origins   Interregional trade began well before the common era as agrarian 
cultures consolidated into stable settlements. The trade that flourished between 
c. 1200 and c. 1450 built on the routes these early traders—and conquerors—
first traced. As kingdoms and empires expanded, so did the trade routes they 
controlled and traveled. 
The Postclassical trading networks also needed the stability of established 
states to grow and expand. Stable kingdoms, caliphates, city-states, or empires 
assured merchants that the routes and the merchants themselves would 
be protected—which is why the wealthy merchants in Calicut could walk 
away from their cargoes knowing they would not be stolen. Stable polities 
also supported the technological upgrades that made trade more profitable²
nautical equipment such as the magnetic compass and lateen sail, high-yielding 
strains of crops, and saddles to allow for the carriage of heavy loads of goods. 
Purpose  The trading networks shared an overall economic purpose: to 
exchange what people were able to grow or produce for what they wanted, 
needed, or could use to trade for other items. In other words, their purpose 
was primarily economic. However, as you have read, people exchanged 
much more than just products. Diplomats and missionaries also traveled the 
trade routes, negotiating alliances and proselytizing for converts. Together, 
merchants, diplomats, and missionaries exchanged ways of life as well as 
economic goods. 
Effects   All the exchange networks also experienced similar effects. 
Because of the very nature of a network—which can be described as a fabric 
of cords crossing at regular distances, knotted for strength at the crossings—
the trade routes all gave rise to trading cities, the “knots” that held the network 
together.

129 COMPARISON OF ECONOMIC EXCHANGE 129The growth of trading cities gave rise to another effect of the trade 
networks: centralization. Malacca, for example, grew wealthy from the fees 
levied on ships and cargoes passing through the Strait of Malacca. To prevent 
piracy, Malacca used its wealth in part to develop a strong navy—an endeavor 
that required centralized planning. Trading cities along each of the trade routes 
underwent similar developments, using their wealth to keep the routes and the 
cities safe.  
Another aspect of trade in the cities that encouraged centralization was 
the desire for a standardized currency. Widely accepted currencies sped up 
transactions and enabled merchants to measure the value of products.

131 COMPARISON OF ECONOMIC EXCHANGE The trading networks also had unique currencies and commercial practices. 
For example, at one time silk was not only a commodity but also a currency. 
In places in Southeast Asia, tin ingots were used as a currency standard. West 
African states used cowrie shells as currency. 
In time, however, states shifted to a money economy based on gold and 
other metal coins. To make commerce less bulky, the Chinese invented “flying 
cash” (see Topic 2.1) and established the precursors of banks, including the 
practice of extending credit.
Social Implications of Networks of Exchange
The rising demand for luxury goods spurred efforts to make production more 
efficient than it had been. China went through a period of proto-industrialization 
as it sought to meet the demand for iron, steel, and porcelain. (See Topic 1.1.)  
New business practices, such as partnerships for sharing the risk of investment, 
began to emerge. 
The production of goods such as textiles and porcelain in China and 
spices in South and Southeast Asia increased to meet demands. As the amount 
of goods increased, the volume of trade on maritime trade routes began to 
supersede that of the overland trade routes. Larger ships were needed as well 
as improved navigational knowledge and technology.
Labor  The demand for labor rose along with the growing demand for 
products. The forms of labor from earlier periods continued—free peasant 
farmers, craft workers or artisans in cottage industries, people forced to work 
to pay off debts, and people forced into labor through enslavement. Trade

routes.
Large-scale projects—irrigation canals, military defenses, great 
buildings—called for the work of thousands of organized laborers. Kinship 
ties often played a role in coordinating these large-scale projects. An observer

completing a giant reservoir:

Social and Gender Structures The typical social structures during the 
period between 1200 and 150 were still defined by class or caste, and societies, 
with rare exceptions, remained patriarchies. There were, however, areas where 
women exercised more power and influence. For example, even though the 
vast Mongol Empire was a patriarchy, Mongol women had somewhat more 
freedom than women in most other parts of Afro-Eurasia. Mongol women 
moved about freely and refused the burka from the West and foot binding from 
the East. Women were also often top advisors to the great khan. 
In Europe, women worked as farmers and artisans, and they had their 
own guilds. In Southeast Asia, women were skilled in the practices of the 
marketplace, operating and controlling marketplaces as representatives of 
powerful families. Outside of these limited areas, however, women within 
other major regions still experienced far fewer opportunities and freedoms 
than men in virtually all aspects of life. 
Environmental Processes  The interconnections that spurred so much 
vibrant economic and cultural exchange also led to a steep population decline 
as merchants, diplomats, and missionaries transferred the bubonic plague and 
other infectious diseases along the trade routes. The plague, named the Black 
Death, contributed to the decline of once-great cities, such as Constantinople. 
Most believe that at least a third of Europe’s population died during this 
period. China experienced outbreaks in the 1330s and 1350s, causing tens of 
millions of deaths. 
Changes in trade networks led to cultural diffusion and the development  
of educational centers in cities such as Canton, Samarkand, Timbuktu, 
Cairo, and Venice. Political instability and increased agriculture strained the 
environment. For example, soil erosion from deforestation, or overgrazing, 
forced growing populations to migrate to other areas.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  H O W  BRUTAL WAS  GENGHIS  KHAN ?
Was Genghis Khan a brutal destroyer who murdered millions, or was he a 
great unifier who promoted prosperity by unifying most of Eurasi a" 
The Destroyer  Many historians emphasize that Khan was a 
bloodthirsty tyrant. Military historian Steven R. Ward writes that 
“Overall, the Mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-
fourths of the population of the Iranian Plateau.” Total deaths attributed 
to the Mongols during his rule and the rule of his descendants are in 
the tens of millions. Stories of his massacres of innocent people and of 
using unarmed civilians to protect his own soldiers show him to have 
had little regard for human life. 
The Empire Builder  Other historians focus on Khan’s role as a 
great leader. Mongolian scholars, proud of their countryman, argue that 
charges of brutality have been exaggerated. As historians from Europe 
and the United States focused more on trade and toleration, they saw 
benefits of the Mongol rule, often referring to Pax Mongolica . Genghis 
Khan forged a united China and established a system of Eurasian trade 
that renewed the links between China and Europe that had lapsed. Further, 
the Mongols were open to ideas and tolerant of different religions. Khan 
believed in a meritocracy, and he established one writing system across 
his empire. His rule opened the way for new systems of laws, for trade, 
and for cultural expansion. 
A Man of Energy  One Persian historian takes a position broad 
enough that everyone can agree with: “Genghis was possessed of great 
energy, discernment, genius, and understanding, awe-inspiring, a butcher, 
just, resolute, an over-thrower of enemies, intrepid, sanguinary, and cruel.”

evidence supports one of the perspectives of Genghis Khan. UNIT 2 REVIEW

UNIT 3: LAND-BASED EMPIRES 141
UNIT 3:   Land-Based Empires 
Understand the Context
Great land-based empires existed before 1450 and after 1750. However, 
between these years, several of history’s greatest land-based empires reached 
their peak of wealth and influence. Among these were the Songhai in West 
Africa the Safavids based in Persia the Mughals in northern India the 
Ottomans in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Northern Africa and the 
Manchus in eastern Asia. They were multiethnic states that had direct political 
control over large regions and overland trade routes.
Expansion  Since these empires measured their power in land, they 
frequently warred against neighbors over territory. The Manchus, who 
established the Qing Dynasty in China in 16, were very successful in this. 
By 111, they had tripled the amount of land they controlled. 
Centralization  Land-based empires in this period prospered by 
consolidating their power in a central government. They employed bureaucratic 
elites to enforce laws and military professionals to provide defense. To pay 
for the bureaucrats and soldiers, they collected tributes from weaker states 
and taxes from their citizens. To demonstrate their wealth and power, they 
constructed great palaces, religious buildings, and shrines. 
Belief Systems  Land-based empires were often closely tied with particular 
religious faiths. As a result, political and religious conflicts were intertwined. 
In Europe, Roman Catholics and Protestants fought wars in which millions of 
people died. In Asia, the Safavids, who were Shi’a Muslims, and the Mughals, 
who were Sunni Muslims, were often at war.  
After 1750  Many land-based empires began declining in power in the 18th 
century. The increasing importance of ethnic identities for individuals, ocean 
routes for trade, and economic relationships among businesses undermined 
the unity and influence that land-based empires initially developed.14501550 1650 1750

Gunpowder Empires Expand
What men call sovereignty is a worldly strife and constant war;  
Worship of God is the highest throne, the happiest of all estates.
—Suleiman the 4agniÄcent (1494–15)
Essential Question:   How did certain land-based empires develop and 
e_pand in the period from 1450–1750?
From its origins in China, gunpowder spread via the trade routes and became 
a powerful source of change between 150 and 150. The term Gunpowder 
Empires  refers to large, m ultiethnic  states in Southwest, Central, and South 
Asia that relied on firearms to conquer and control territories. In addition to 
Russia, the Gunpowder Empires included three in which Islam was strong: the 
Ottoman, the Safavid, and the Mughal Empires. Suleiman the Magnificent,  
quoted above, ruled the Ottoman Empire at its height. Although he declared 
religious worship the happiest of all practices, he also personally led Ottoman 
armies in conquering Christian strongholds in Belgrade, Rhodes, and 
Hungary in Southeastern Europe. The Gunpowder Empire societies tended 
to be militaristic, yet all three left splendid artistic and architectural legacies, 
created in part to reflect the legitimacy of their rulers.
The Qing Empire of China also expanded, and although it experienced 
several invasions, it also prospered during long periods of stability. Europe’s 
expansion involved an even wider exchange network than that which spread 
gunpowder: transoceanic connections with the Americas. You will read more 
about this path to empire expansion in Unit .
Armed trade was common in expanding empires during this period. The 
different empires traded with one another. However, they kept troops and 
armaments at the ready in case another empire questioned their right to trade. 
This type of exchange differed from the free markets of later eras.
Europe
The year 150 has traditionally signified the ending of the medieval period 
and the beginning of the early modern period. The mid-100s saw the end 
of a wave of plagues, the conclusion of the Hundred Years’ War between 
144 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONFrance and England see Topic 1.6, and the invention of the Gutenberg 
printing press  followed by an increase in literacy. After the slow political 
and economic development of the Middle Ages, several countries in Europe 
were becoming powerful, wealthy nations. New monarchies began to launch 
overseas explorations and establish colonies around the world. 
The nature of the new monarchies in Europe in the 1500s was the result 
of the desire of certain leaders to centralize power by controlling taxes, the 
army, and many aspects of religion. These new monarchs included the Tudors 
in England, the 9alois in France, and Queen Isabella and .ing Ferdinand 
in Spain. In each area, bureaucracies increased and the power of the middle 
class grew at the expense of lords and the churches. For example, the new 
monarchies moved to curb the private armies of the nobility.
Russia 
Western Europeans were long unsure what to think of Russia: Was Russia 
more European in its outlook and character, or was it more Asian" Russia was 
in a pivotal position for trade. It was able to exchange goods and services with 
other cultures farther east and west. However, Russia remained tightly linked 
to Europe. Its capital²whether .iev, St. Petersburg, or Moscow²was located 
in Europe. Although a product of Mongol influence from Central Asia to the 
east, Russia was also a product of Europe as a result of 9iking invasions and 
trading.
When Ivan IV  ruled 15±158, called Ivan the Terrible, was crowned 
tsar in 15, he immediately set about to expand the Russian border eastward, 
first by taking control of the khanates of .azan, Astrakhan, and Siberia held 
by the descendants of the Golden Horde, the Mongolian conquerors. This 
expansion came to rely more and more upon the use of gunpowder. 
Control of the Volga  Wanting to expand east to control the fur trade, Ivan 
I9 allowed the Stroganovs, major Russian landowners, to hire bands of fierce 
peasant warriors known as Cossacks to fight the local tribes and the Siberian 
khan. The Stroganovs’ forces were successful, gaining control of the 9 olga

7o the 3acific   Russia continued moving east into Siberia after the reign 
of Ivan I9 . Fur traders and militias defeated one indigenous tribe after another. 
Missionaries followed, converting many to the Eastern Orthodox faith, although 
the local shamans, or religious leaders, continued to have influence. By 16, 
the Russians had advanced east as far as the Pacific Ocean. Explorations and 
fur trading expeditions continued across the Pacific to Alaska 11 and down 
the coast of North America to California 181. 
East Asia 
China’s Yuan Dynasty, founded by Mongol invader .ublai .han in 121, was 
overthrown by the  Ming Dynasty  in 168 after less than a century in power. 
Ming rulers managed to stabilize the East Asian region for nearly 00 years. 
During the Ming era, the Portuguese and other Europeans arrived, aiming to 
encroach on the Asian trade network. Then, in 16, the powerful Manchu  
from neighboring Manchuria seized power and established the Qing Dynasty , 
which ruled until 111. During both of these dynasties, Japan and .orea 
experienced parallel developments but with unique aspects.
The Ming Dynasty also expanded the size of China, conquering lands in 
Mongolia and Central Asia. It did not hold them for long, however. In the 
10s, Mongol armies defeated Ming forces and even took the Ming emperor 
prisoner. In reaction to renewed Mongol power, China’s leaders looked to the 
Great Wall of China for protection. The Wall had not been maintained under 
Mongol rule, but under the Ming Dynasty it was restored and expanded to 
help keep out invaders from the north. Connect: Create a chart comparing the 
Ming and Yuan Dynasties. See Topic 2.2.
Emperor Kangxi  One of  China’s longest-reigning emperors, Kangxi 
ruled 1661±122 presided over a period of stability and expansion during 
the Qing Dynasty in China. .angxi sent forces into Taiwan, Mongolia, and 
Central Asia, incorporating those areas into the empire. China also imposed a 
protectorate over Tibet, the mountainous land north of India, a policy reflected 
in China’s control of the region today.
Emperor Qianlong  Another important Qing ruler was Emperor 
Qianlong ruled 16±16, a poet, who was also  knowledgeable in art and 
calligraphy. At the beginning of his reign, the country was well administered 
and government tax collections were at an all-time high. Qianlong initiated 
military campaigns in lands west of China, which led to the annexation of 
;injiang accompanied by the mass killings of the local population. Even 
today, parts of ;injiang remain troubled. The local Muslim population, called 
Uighurs, has never fully become incorporated into the rest of Chinese culture. 
146 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONQianlong also sent armies into Tibet to install the Dalai Lama on the throne 
there. A campaign against the Nepalese was successful, forcing them to submit 
to Chinese rule. However, campaigns against Burma and 9ietnam were 
unsuccessful and costly, resulting in the emptying of the empire’s treasury.
Conflicts with the :est  Needing funds, the Qing Dynasty sold limited 
trading privileges to the European powers but confined them to Guangzhou 
also known as Canton. The British were not satisfied with these limited 
privileges, so they asked for more trading rights in 1. Emperor Qianlong 
responded with a letter to .ing George III stating that the Chinese had no need 
for British manufactured goods. During the later part of Qianlong’s reign, 
the traditionally efficient Chinese bureaucracy became corrupt, levying high 
taxes on the people. In response to these high taxes and a desire to restore 
the Ming Dynasty, a group of peasants organized the White Lotus Rebellion 
16±180. The Qing government suppressed the uprising brutally, killing 
around 100,000 peasants.
Rise of the Islamic Gunpowder Empires
The warrior leaders of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal Empires shared 
many traits besides being Muslims: 
• They descended from Turkic nomads who once lived in Central Asia.
• They spoke a Turkic language.
• They took advantage of power vacuums left by the breakup of Mongol 
khanates.
• They relied on gunpowder weapons, such as artillery and cannons. 
The initial success of the Gunpowder Empires was a result of their own 
military might along with the weakness and corruption of the regimes that 
they replaced. As European nations fought among themselves rather than 
uniting to topple the new powers growing in the east, the Gunpowder Empires 
further expanded. 
The Rule of Tamerlane  The invasion of Central Asia and the Middle 
East by Tamerlane  Timur the Lame, a Mongol-Turkic ruler of the late 1th 
century set the stage for the rise of the Turkic empires. Leading an army partly 
composed of nomadic invaders from the broad steppes of Eurasia, Tamerlane 
moved out from the trading city of Samarkand in modern-day Uzbekistan to 
make ruthless conquests in Persia modern-day Iran and India. The Eurasian 
steppes were also the birthplace of the ghazi ideal ²a model for warrior life 
that blended the cooperative values of nomadic culture with the willingness to 
serve as a holy fighter for Islam. According to some historians, the ghazi ideal 
served as the model for warriors who participated in the rise of the Gunpowder 
Empires, and it was a model that fit Tamerlane well.
Some historians believe that Tamerlane’s violent takeover of areas of 
Central Asia included the massacre of some 100,000 Hindus before the gates 
147 EUROPEAN, EAST ASIAN, AND G UNPOWDER EMPIRES EXPANDof Delhi in India. The pattern of conquest was marked by violence that resulted 
in new dynasties: the Ottomans, the Safavids, and the Mughals. Nonetheless, 
Tamerlane’s rule in Samarkand encouraged learning and the arts²a trend also 
typical of these later empires. For example, Tamerlane championed literature, 
and he himself corresponded with European rulers and wrote his own memoirs. 
Buildings still standing in the city of Samarkand are lasting reminders of his 
interest in architecture and decorative arts. 
While the empire he created largely fell apart except for the area that 
his descendant Babur would take over to create India’s Mughal Dynasty, 
Tamerlane’s invasions were a testament to the significance of gunpowder. 
He used it to build a government dependent upon his military and the use 
of heavy artillery. He also used it to protect land routes on the Silk Roads. 
However, he failed to leave an effective political structure in many of the 
areas he conquered. Without effective government, the expenses of the wars 
eventually ravaged the empire’s economy. 
Tamerlane’s rule casts light on two major forces that had battled each 
other continually from the late 10th century to the 1th century²Mongols 
from the northeast versus Islamic forces from Arabia and the areas around the 
Mediterranean Sea. These forces would clash continuously with the rise and 
fall of the three Asian Gunpowder Empires that are the focus of the rest of this 
chapter.  
The Ottoman Empire
By the 15th century, the Ottoman Empire was already becoming a major 
power. Extending into modern-day Turkey as well as to the Balkan areas of 
Europe and parts of North Africa and Southeast Asia, the Ottoman Empire  was 
the largest and most enduring of the great Islamic empires of this period. Founded 
by the Osman Dynasty in the 100s, the empire lasted until its defeat in 118 by 
the Allies in World War I. Thus a single dynasty controlled the empire for more 
than 600 years.
Mehmed II  Called the Conqueror, Mehmed II ruled 151±181 firmly 
established the empire’s capital after his forces besieged Constantinople once 
the center of the Byzantine Empire in 15. Despite its triple fortifications, 
the city fell as its walls crumbled under the bombardment of Ottoman cannons. 
The Ottomans used a 26-foot bronze cannon and several other cannons from 
15 to 22 feet in length.  Under Mehmed II’s rule, the city²its name changed 
to Istanbul²prospered because of its location. A nexus for trade, the city 
controlled the Bosporus Strait, the only waterway linking the Aegean Sea with 
the Black Sea.
The armies of Mehmed II next seized lands around the western edge of 
the Black Sea. Then they moved into the Balkans in Southeast Europe. To 
counter the power of 9enice, an expanding state on the Adriatic Sea with a 
robust maritime trade, Mehmed strengthened the Ottoman navy and attacked 
various areas of Italy. Although he did not conquer 9enice, he forced the city 
148 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONto pay him a yearly tax. In the early 16th century, the Ottomans added to 
their empire lands in present-day Syria, Israel, Egypt, and Algeria. When the 
Mamluk Dynasty’s power declined, Istanbul became a center of Islam. For 
more on the Mamluk Empire, see Topic 1.2.
Suleiman I  The Ottoman Empire reached its peak under Suleiman I  
ruled 1520±1566. His armies overran Hungary in 1526 and, by 152, were 
hammering at the gates of 9ienna, the main city in Austria. Their attempt to 
take 9ienna failed twice, but the ability of the Ottomans to send troops so far 
into Christian Europe caused great fear there.
In 1522, Suleiman’s navy captured the island of Rhodes now part of 
Greece in the eastern Mediterranean, which had long been a stronghold of 
Christian knights. In the 1550s, the Ottoman navy took control of Tripoli in 
North Africa. The Ottoman Empire would experience a transformation as the 
state adapted to new internal and external pressures. A period of reform would 
follow by the 18th century. Challenges in defending Ottoman territory against 
foreign invasion and occupation led to the Ottoman defeat and dissolution by 
122.
The Safavids
The Safavid dynasty had its origin in the Safavid order of Sufism, established 
in the northern Azerbaijan region Iran. An early Safavid military hero named 
Ismail  conquered most of Persia and pushed into Iraq. Although only 1 or 15 
years old, he soon conquered all of Iran and was proclaimed shah  equivalent 
to king or emperor in 1501.  
The Safavid Empire  had two problems. First, despite being on the Arabian 
Sea part of the Indian Ocean, the empire did not have a real navy. Second, 
the Safavids lacked natural defenses. Nevertheless, the Safavids rose to power 
in the 1500s due to their land-based military might and strong leadership.
Called Abbas the Great, Shah Abbas I ruled 1588±162 presided over 
the Safavid Empire at its height. His troops included soldiers²often Christian 
boys pressed into service²from as far northwest as Georgia in Russia.  Abbas 
imported weaponry from Europe and also relied on Europeans to advise his 
troops about this newly acquired military technology. Slowly, the shahs came to 
control religion as well as politics. Using Shi’a Islam as a unifying force, Shah 
Ismail built a power base that supported his rule and denied legitimacy to any 
Sunni. This strict adherence to Shi’a Islam caused frequent hostilities with the 
Ottoman Empire, a stronghold of Sunni Islam. In 151, Safavid forces were 
stopped by the Ottomans at Tabriz, a city in Persia that became part of the border 
between Sunni and Shi’a societies. The hostility between the two groups lives 
on in present-day Iraq and Iran.
Conflicts between Ottomans and Safavids were not entirely religious, 
however. Another conflict arose over control of overland trade routes. The 
Ottomans used trade embargoes, official bans on trade, consistently against 
the Safavid silk traders as a way to assert dominance over their eastern rival.
149 EUROPEAN, EAST ASIAN, AND G UNPOWDER EMPIRES EXPAND:oPen in the SaIaYiG (PSire  Women are rarely mentioned in local 
Safavid histories however, Safavid women were permitted to participate in 
their societies. While Safavid women were still veiled and restricted in their 
movements, as was traditional in the region, they had access to rights provided 
by Islamic law for inheritance and, in extreme cases, divorce. 
Mughal India
In the 1520s, Babur, a descendant of Tamerlane see Topic 2.2, founded a  
00-year dynasty during a time when India was in disarray. He completed 
conquests in northern India and, under the new Mughal name, formed a 
central government similar to that of Suleiman in Turkey. Akbar , Babur’s 
grandson, achieved grand religious and political goals. 
The Mughal Empire  under Akbar was one of the richest and best-
governed states in the world. Overseas trade flourished during the relatively 
peaceful period Arab traders conducted most of the commerce. Traded goods 
included textiles, tropical foods, spices, and precious stones, all of which 
were often exchanged for gold and silver. Trade within the borders of the 
empire was carried on by merchant castes. Members of the merchant castes 
were allowed to participate in banking and the production of handicrafts. 
Castes, or jatis, are strict social groupings designated at birth. The caste 
system divides Hindu people into four categories: Brahmins, .shatriyas, 
9aishyas, and the Shudras. Outside of the system are the achhoots, or the 
Dalits, the untouchables. The Indian caste system is the basis of educational 
and vocational opportunities for Indian society. 
Mughal India flourished from Babur’s time through the early 18th century. 
Magnificent architectural accomplishments are remaining testaments to the 
wealth and sophistication of the Mughal empire.
Decline of the Gunpowder Empires
The Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal Empires declined as Western Europe grew 
in strength economically and militarily²particularly in terms of sea power. 
Unlike these three Islamic empires, Russia modernized and reorganized its 
army, modeling it after the armies of England, France, and the Netherlands. 
The Islamic empires did not modernize and, as a result, Russia remained 
powerful enough to survive as an independent nation-state, while the other 
Gunpowder Empires fell. 
Decline of the Ottoman Empire  In 151, after Suleiman’s death, a 
European force made up mostly of Spaniards and 9enetians defeated the 
Ottomans in a great naval conflict known as the Battle of Lepanto. After 
the reign of Suleiman, the Ottomans fell victim to weak sultans and strong 
European neighbors. In time, the empire became known as the Sick Man of 
Europe. Successors to Suleiman were often held hostage to “harem politics,” 
the efforts of wives and concubines of the sultan to promote their own children 
150 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONas likely heirs to the throne. In this way, some women became powerful 
behind the scenes. The failed Siege of 9ienna in 168 marked a turning point 
in Ottoman domination in Eastern Europe. British and French involvement 
in the Ottoman territories, Greece’s independence in 1821, and the Russian 
expansion in the 1th century further weakened the Ottoman Empire.
Safavid Decline  The ineffectual leaders who followed Shah Abbas 
combined lavish lifestyles and military spending with falling revenues, resulting 
in a weakened economy. In 122, Safavid forces were not able to quell a 
rebellion by the heavily oppressed Sunni Pashtuns in present-day Afghanistan. 
The Afghan forces went on to sack Isfahan, and their leader, Mahmud, declared 
himself Shah of Persia. While the Safavid Dynasty remained nominally 
in control, the resulting chaos was an impediment to centralization and tax 
collection. Taking advantage of the weakened Safavids, the Ottomans and the 
Russians were able to seize territories. The Safavid Dynasty declined rapidly 
until it was replaced by the =and Dynasty in 160.
Mughal Decline  Shah Jahan’s son and successor, Aurangzeb ruled 1658±
10, inherited an empire weakened by corruption and the failure to keep up 
with the military innovations of external enemies. Nevertheless, Aurangzeb 
hoped to increase the size of the empire and bring all of India under Muslim rule. 
Additionally, he wanted to rid the empire of its Hindu influences.  Nile R.Euphrates R.  Tigris R.   Indus R.

sparked by Aurangzeb’s insistence on an austere and pious Islamic lifestyle and 
an intolerance of minority religions²Sikhs, Hindus, and others. His policies led 
to frequent conflicts and rebellions. 
There were revolts as well among the Hindu and Islamic princes. The empire 
grew increasingly unstable after his death, which allowed the British and French 
to gain more and more economic power in India. The British would take political 
power away from the Mughals in the 1th century.

154 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   E X P L A I N  THE HISTORICAL CONCEPT  
OF EMPIRE
In this topic, you read about the expansion of empires between 150 
and 150, especially in Russia, China, and Southwest, Central, and 
South Asia. Although it may seem obvious what an empire is, historians 
have thought carefully about the concept  of an empire. A concept is a 
general, abstract idea often formed from specific instances.
For example, Paul James and Tom Nairn, editors of Globalization and 
Violence , conceptualize “empire” this way:
“As a general phenomenon, empires extend relations of power 
across territorial spaces over which they have no prior or given legal 
sovereignty, and where, in one or more of the domains of economics, 
politics, and culture, they gain some measure of extensive hegemony 
over those spaces for the purpose of extracting or accruing value.” 
Steven Howe, in his book Empire , argues that an empire typically also 
has diverse ethnic, national, cultural, and religious elements under its 
power. 
If you combine these conceptualizations and then break them down into 
their component parts, you would likely come up with these features of 
empires: 
• extension of power over spaces in which they have no previous or 
legal control
• exertion of major control of economic, political, or cultural a spects 
of subjects
• extraction or accumulation of value as a result of domination
• control of diverse ethnic, national, cultural, and religious elements

The state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth:  
for kings are not  only God’s lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon  
 God’s throne, but even by God himself they are called gods.
—2ing 1ames I (15–125)
Essential Question:   How did rulers in land-based empires legitimize and 
consolidate their power from 1450 to 1750?
By the end of the 16th century, centralization of power by controlling taxes, 
the army, and some aspects of religion coalesced into a system of government 
that led to a powerful monarch in England and absolute monarchy in France. 
In other states, different methods were used to solidify authority: building 
temples, as with the Inca paying the military elite a salary, as with the samurai 
in Japan and forcibly establishing a captive governmental bureaucracy, as 
with the Ottoman devshirme system.
Rulers of empires in the years 150 to 150 developed methods for 
assuring they maintained control of all the regions of their empires. Some of 
the successful methods included using bureaucratic elites to oversee sections 
of the empire and developing a professional military.
Centralizing Control in Europe
England’s .ing James I believed in the divine right of kings , a common claim 
from the Middle Ages that the right to rule was given to a king by God. Under 
this belief, a king was a political and religious authority. As seen in the quote 
above, James believed himself outside of the law and any earthly authority and 
saw any challenge toward him as a challenge to God. 
(nJlanG¶s *entry 2Ificials   In England, the Tudors ruled 185±160 
relied on justices of the peace,  officials selected by the landed gentry to 
“swear that as Justices of the Peace . . . in all articles in the .ing’s Commission 
to you directed, ye shall do equal right to the poor and to the rich after your 
cunning wit, and power, and after the laws and customs of the realm and 
statutes thereof made,” according to their oath of office. In other words, their 
job was to maintain peace in the counties of England, even settling some legal 
matters, and to carry out the monarch’s laws. The number and responsibilities 
156 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONof the justices of the peace increased through the years of Tudor rule, and 
they became among the most important and powerful groups in the kingdom. 
Under Tudor rule, the power of feudal lords weakened. Many seats in the 
House of Commons in Parliament were occupied by justices of the peace. The 
justices of the peace as well as the Parliament, which had been established in 
1265, gave legitimacy to the monarch’s claim to authority. 
Parliament also checked the monarch’s powers. In 168, England’s rulers 
William and Mary signed the English Bill of Rights , which assured individual 
civil liberties. For example, legal process was required before someone could 
be arrested and detained. The Bill of Rights also guaranteed protection against 
tyranny of the monarchy by requiring the agreement of Parliament on matters 
of taxation and raising an army.
Absolutism in France  In contrast to developments in England, the 
French government became more absolute— directed by one source of power, 
the king, with complete authority²in the 1th and 18th centuries. Henry I9 
ruled 158±1610 of the House of 9alois listened to his advisor Jean Bodin, 
who advocated the divine right of the monarchy. Building on these ideas, 
Louis ;III ruled 1610±16 and his minister Cardinal Richelieu  moved to 
even greater centralization of the government and development of the system 
of intendants. These intendants  were royal officials  ²bureaucratic elites²
sent out to the provinces to execute the orders of the central government. 
The intendants themselves were sometimes called tax farmers  because they 
oversaw the collection of various taxes in support of the royal governments. 
The Sun .ing, Louis XIV  ruled 16±115, espoused a theory of 
divine right and was a virtual dictator. His aims were twofold, just as those 
of Richelieu had been: He wanted to hold absolute power and expand French 
borders. Louis declared that he was the state: “L’etat, c’est moi.” He combined 
the lawmaking and the justice system in his own person²he was absolute. 
He kept nobles close to him in his palace at Versailles , making it difficult 
for them to act independently or plot against him. Louis and his successors’ 
refusal to share power eventually weakened the French government.

157 EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATI ONSReigning in Control of the Russian Empire
Social hierarchy in Moscow was almost static²much as it had been in .ievan 
Russia earlier. The noble landowning class, the boyars , stood at the top of 
the social pyramid. Below them were the merchants. Last and most numerous 
were the peasants, who would gradually sink more and more deeply into debt 
and, as a result, into serfdom . Serfs were peasants who received a plot of 
land and protection from a noble. In return, the serfs were bound to that land 
and had little personal freedom. Transfers of land ownership to another noble 
included control over the serfs on that land.
The Efforts of Ivan IV  The boyar class experienced tensions with the 
rulers similar to the tensions between nobles and rulers in Western Europe. 
Boyars of Novgorod had opposed the expansionist policies of Ivan IV , so 
Ivan punished them after his forces defeated Novgorod. Ivan I9 confiscated 
the lands of his boyar opponents and forced them and their families to move to 
Moscow. Like Louis ;I9 , he wanted to keep an eye on the nobility. 
To further control the boyars, Ivan established a paramilitary force loyal 
to him called the oprichnina . Dressed in black and traveling quickly on 
horseback, the members showed fierce loyalty to Ivan. They were drawn from 
lower-level bureaucrats and merchants to assure their loyalty to Ivan rather 
than to the boyars. The oprichnina’s methods would be reflected later in the 
development of the Russian secret police. Connect: Create a table comparing

158 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONPeter the Great  The Romanov Dynasty  took control of Russia in 161 
after a period of turmoil following Ivan’s death in 158. Under the autocratic 
control of the Romanovs, three main groups in Russia had conflicting desires 
and agendas: the Church, bent on conserving traditional values and beliefs 
the boyars, desiring to gain and hold power and members of the tsar’s royal 
family. The rise to power of Peter I , also known as Peter the Great ruled 
1682±125, illustrates these conflicting ambitions. First, to gain full control 
of the throne, Peter had to defeat his half-sister Sophia and her supporters, a 
boyar-led elite military corps called the Streltsy. He consolidated power by 
forcing Sophia into a convent. Later, the Streltsy rebelled against Peter’s reign, 
so he temporarily disbanded them and then integrated them into Russia’s 
regular army.
Peter the Great was known as the Defender of Orthodoxy, participating 
closely in ecclesiastical >church@ affairs. However, Peter would eventually lose 
the support of the Russian clergy over his reforms. Later in his reign, Peter 
reorganized the Russian government by creating provinces first 8 and later 
50 administrative divisions. Provincial officials received a salary, replacing 
the old system of local officials “feeding off the land” getting money through 
bribes, fees, and taxes. Another government reform was the creation of a 
senate, a council to advise government officials when Peter was away .

To ensure their control over large areas, the Ottoman sultans used a selection 
system called devshirme to staff their military and their government. This 
system began in the late 1th century and expanded in the 15th and 16th 
centuries. Through this system, Christian boys who were subjects of the empire 
were recruited by force to serve in the Ottoman government. Boys ages 8 to 20 
were taken each year from conquered Christian lands in Europe.
The system of devshirme developed from an earlier system of slavery 
in the Ottoman Empire. In both systems, enslaved people were considered 
tribute owed to the empire after conquest, which was typically one-fifth of the 
conquered land’s wealth. Since Islamic law prohibited enslavement of “people 
of the book”²Muslims and Jews²Christian boys were forcibly removed 
from their families, especially from Balkan territories. 
The Christian boys were taught various skills in politics, the arts, and the 
military and received a very high level of education. The most famous group, 
called Janissaries , formed elite forces in the Ottoman army. Other boys were 
groomed to become administrators of the newly conquered territories some 
were scribes, tax collectors, and even diplomats. They were indoctrinated to 
be fiercely loyal to the sultan  ²some served as bodyguards. In some ways, 
becoming a Janissary provided a path of upward mobility in the Ottoman 
Empire, even though the Janissaries continued to be called “slaves of the 
state.” Some parents even wanted their sons to be recruited into the service. 
159 EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATI ONSCentralizing Control in East and South Asia
Following the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty, the Ming ruled in 
China from 168±16. The Ming Dynasty in China wanted to erase the 
influence of Mongol rulers of the Yuan Dynasty. To help accomplish this goal, 
the Ming brought back the traditional civil service exam, improved education 
by establishing a national school system, and reestablished the bureaucracy, 
which had fallen into disuse under the Mongols. See Topic 2.2. During the 
Qing Dynasty, in the later part of Qianlong’s reign, the traditionally efficient 
Chinese bureaucracy became corrupt, levying high taxes on the people. The 
Qing government used harsh military control to put down a rebellion against 
these developments and maintain its authority. 
Consolidating Power in Japan  Military leaders called shoguns ruled 
Japan in the emperor’s name from the 12th to the 15th centuries. Yet conflict 
between landholding aristocrats called daimyo  left Japan in disarray. Each 
daimyo had an army of warriors known as samurai ambition to conquer 
more territory and power to rule his fiefdoms as he saw fit. The samurai 
were salaried, paid first in rice and later in gold, which gave them significant 
economic power. Finally, just as gunpowder weapons enabled the rise of new 
empires in Turkey, Persia, and India, gunpowder weapons helped a series of 
three powerful daimyo to gradually unify Japan. Connect : Write a paragraph 
connecting shogun rule with the rule of the daimyo. See Topic 1.1.
The first of these powerful daimyo was Oda Nobunaga. Armed with 
muskets purchased from Portuguese traders, Nobunaga and his samurai took 
over .yoto in 1568. He then began to extend his power, forcing daimyo in the 
lands around .yoto to submit. Nobunaga had unified about one-third of what 
is today Japan when he was assassinated in 1582. 
Nobunaga’s successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, continued expanding the 
territory until most of what we now know as Japan was under his control. 
After his death in 158, the center of power shifted to the city of Edo Tokyo, 
controlled by the daimyo Tokugawa Ieyasu  ruled 1600±1616, who was 
declared shogun in 160. His successors would continue to rule Japan into the 
mid-1th century, in an era known as the Period of Great Peace.
The Tokugawa shogunate  set about reorganizing the governance of Japan 
in order to centralize  control over what was essentially a feudal system. Japan 
was divided into 250 hans, or territories, each of which was controlled by 
a daimyo who had his own army and was fairly independent. However, the 
Tokugawa government required that daimyo maintain residences both in their 
home territory and also in the capital if the daimyo himself was visiting his 
home territory, his family had to stay in Tokyo, essentially as hostages. This 
kept the daimyo under the control of the shogunate, reducing them to landlords 
who managed the hans, rather than independent leaders.
Consolidating Mughal Power in South Asia   Ruling from 1556 to 
1605, Akbar  proved to be the most capable of the Mughal rulers. For the 
first 0 years of his rule, he defeated Hindu armies and extended his empire 
160 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONsouthward and westward. From his capital in Delhi , Akbar established an 
efficient government and a system of fairly administered laws. For example, 
all his people had the right to appeal to him for final judgment in any lawsuit. 
As Akbar’s fame spread, capable men from many parts of Central Asia came 
to serve him. They helped Akbar create a strong, centralized government and 
an effective civil service. Paid government officials called zamindars  were in 
charge of specific duties, such as taxation, construction, and the water supply.
Later, they were given grants of land rather than salaries but were permitted 
to keep a portion of the taxes paid by local peasants, who contributed one-
third of their produce to the government. The system worked well under 
Akbar. Under the rulers who came after him, though, the zamindars began 
to keep more of the taxes that they collected. With this money, they built 
personal armies of soldiers and civilians loyal to them.
Legitimizing Power through Religion and Art
European governments sought to legitimize the authority of the monarch 
through the idea of the divine right of monarchy. For more information 
about the divine right of monarchy, see Topic .. They also built impressive 
structures, such as the Palace of 9ersailles in France, to demonstrate their 
power and glory. Governments in other parts of the world followed similar 
patterns to consolidate and legitimize their authority. See Topic 1. for links 
among religion, grand temples and pyramids, human sacrifice, and political 
power in the Mexica and Incan cultures.
Peter and St. Petersburg  When Peter the Great seized lands on the 
Baltic Sea from Sweden, the conquest gave Russia its own warm-water port 
on the Baltic²St. Petersburg. Peter moved the Russian capital from Moscow 
to St. Petersburg so he could keep watch on the boyars there, who were doing 
their required state service by working in his government. 
The new city became a testament to Peter’s determination to have his own 
capital. Architects laid out streets in a rectangular grid, unlike the irregular 
pattern of Moscow and other cities. Peasants and Swedish prisoners of war 
were forced to work, draining marshes and building streets and government 
structures. In the mid-18th century, workers built the famous Winter Palace. 
It was designed in a European rather than a Byzantine style to show Peter’s 
admiration of Europe and its rulers.
Askia the Great of Songhai  Askia Mohammad I, or Askia the Great , 
came to power in 1. He claimed his predecessor, Sunni Ali, was not a 
faithful Muslim. Like Mansa Musa of Mali, Askia the Great promoted Islam 
throughout his kingdom and made an elaborate pilgrimage to Mecca. Under 
his leadership, Songhai became the largest kingdom in its day in West Africa. 
Askia made Islam Songhai’s official religion in an attempt to unite his empire. 
In addition to legitimizing his rule through promoting Islam, he also supported 
an efficient bureaucracy to bring the empire together.
161 EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATI ONSShah Jahan  Mughal India produced a number of magnificent architectural 
accomplishments, including the Taj Mahal , built by Shah Jahan  ruled 1628±
1658 as a tomb for his wife. Mughal rulers also beautified Delhi and had 
forts built. The craftspeople and builders of Mughal India combined the arts of 
Islam calligraphy, illumination of manuscripts, and ceramics with local arts 
to create magnificent, airy structures with decorative geometric designs. All 
these accomplishments showed the power of the rulers.
Ottoman Architectural and Artistic Achievements  Tremendous 
changes in government and religion took place in Ottoman territory. However, 
the arts, the culture, and the economy showed continuities, though they now 
legitimized the rule of the Ottomans. Constantinople, renamed Istanbul, 
remained the western end of the overland Silk Roads, and the Grand Bazaar 
there continued to be full of foreign imports. Coffeehouses, although banned 
by Islamic law, continued to do a thriving business throughout the towns of the 
empire.

The Islamic Gunpowder Empires built monumental architecture with spiritual significance. The 
Ottomans built the Suleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul top. The Safavids built the Mosque of 
Isfahan lower left. The Mughals built the Taj Mahal, a mausoleum, in Agra. lower right.
162 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONIstanbul grew more beautiful and expanded across both sides of the Strait of 
Bosporus. One famous landmark is the royal residence of the sultans, Topkapi 
Palace . Mehmed II lived 12±181 began construction on this landmark. 
Suleiman I lived 1±1566 ordered many mosques, forts, and other great 
buildings constructed in the cities under his control. For example, he ordered 
the construction in Istanbul of the magnificent Suleymaniye Mosq ue. 
Istanbul remained a center of arts and learning. Poets and scholars 
from across Asia met in coffeehouses and gardens. They discussed works 
by Aristotle and other Greek writers, as well as the works of many Arabic 
scholars. Cultural contributions of the Ottomans included the restoration of 
some of the glorious buildings of Constantinople, most notably the cathedral 
of Saint Sophia which the Ottomans turned into a grand mosque. From the 
time of Mehmed II, who established a workshop for their production, Ottoman 
miniature paintings and illuminated manuscripts became famous. 
French Architecture  The spacious and elegant palace at 9ersailles 
became a political instrument. Louis ;I9 entertained the nobles there and kept 
them from conducting business elsewhere, such as fomenting rebellion in their 
home provinces. Louis ;I9’s grand buildings at 9ersailles helped legitimize 
his power. The palace at 9ersailles, for example, could accommodate hundreds 
of guests. During the rule of Louis ;I9 , some 1,000 employees worked in the 
palace or on the grounds. 
Financing Empires
As in other matters of building and maintaining empires, different methods 
of raising money worked²or fell short²in different empires. In all of the 
world’s empires, raising money to fund the goals of imperial expansion and 
extend state power was a key endeavor.
Taxation in Russia  Peter established new industries owned by the state, 
especially shipyards in St. Petersburg and iron mines in the Ural Mountains. 
He also encouraged private industries such as metallurgy >technology of metal 
products@, woodwork, gunpowder, leather, paper, and mining. He brought 
in Western European naval engineers to build ships according to Western 
models. 
When industrialization failed to bring in the revenue Peter needed for his 
military ventures, he raised taxes and began to compel workers to work in 
the shipyards²a sort of urban extension of serfdom. In 118, the tax on land 
in Russia was replaced by a tax on heads individuals, and peasants became 
more oppressed than ever.
Ottoman and Mughal Taxation  To finance an economy backed by 
a powerful military, the Ottomans levied taxes on the peasants and used 
tax farming  to collect it. The tax farmers²local officials and private tax 
collectors distant from the central government²grew wealthy and corrupt 
from skimming money from the taxes in their areas, as some of the zamindars 
did in the Mughal Empire. Agricultural villages continued to be burdened with 
163 EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATI ONSthe upkeep of officers and troops. This burden of taxes and the military would 
eventually contribute to the economic decline of the empire.
Tax Collection in the Ming Dynasty In Ming China as well as in the 
Ottoman Empire, tax collection was the responsibility of private citizens, in 
this case wealthy families, each seeing to the collection of land taxes in their 
area of the countryside. Land taxes made up the bulk of the taxes collected, 
and the rates tended to be low. Taxes were collected in the form of grains 
and, later, silver. Some grains were stored in local facilities. Others were sent 
on the Grand Canal to military locations. The state also collected taxes on 
salt, wine, and other goods. For many years, the vaults stored a surplus of 
grains. However, after about 1580, wars, extravagant imperial spending, and 
the repression of rebellions left the dynasty in bankruptcy.
Tributes  Empires, including China, also collected tributes from other 
states as a way to demand recognition of their power and authority. Typically 
as a form of wealth, tributes were given as a sign of respect, submission, or 
allegiance. For example, .orea was a tributary state for China. The Mexica had 
extensive tributary arrangements from the people they conquered, although 
most Aztec citizens, merchants, and artisans paid taxes. An Aztec official was 
stationed in each capital to collect tributes from local officials. 
The Songhai Empire also had tributary states. Askia the Great assigned 
governors and officials to preside over tributary states in the Niger 9alley. As 
long as local officials obeyed Songhai policies, they could rule their districts.

specific development across cultures, ask: In what other cultures were 
there similar developments" In what ways were those developments 
similar to the specific development in the culture under study" In what 
ways were those developments different from the specific development 
in the culture under study" As you answer these questions, think about 
origins, purposes, and outcomes.

–Henry of Navarre, 2ing of -rance (ruled 1589–110)
Essential Question:   How did different belief systems endure or change 
during the period from 1450–1750?
Religion, a key factor in the expansion of empires, was a divisive force 
as much as it was a unifying one. Christianity remained a dominant force in 
Europe, b ut its split into several factions during the 16th and 1th centuries led 
to significant historical changes.  French .ing Henry I9 , often known as Henry 
of Navarre, converted to Catholicism in 15 for the sake of solidifying his 
power and ensuring peace, as the quote above suggests. His action demonstrates 
the willingness of monarchs to approach ruling with practicality rather than 
theology. Henry I9 also sanctioned religious toleration of the Huguenots 
French Calvinists. 
Islam, too, experienced a split, and political rivalries between the Ottoman 
and Safavid empires deepened the breach between the Sunni and Shi’a branches 
of the religion. At the same time, Sikhism provided a way to combine Hindu 
and Sufi Muslim beliefs.
Protestant Reformation
The Roman Catholic Church faced many challenges in the European shift 
from feudalism to centralized governments. International in organization and 
influence and boasting a large bureaucracy of its own, the Church was subject 
to corruption. Efforts to curb corruption resulted in numerous Church councils 
and reform movements. However, efforts at reform were unsuccessful.
Theological disagreements began to surface as well. John Wycliffe and 
the Lollards in England in the late 1th century argued that priests were 
unnecessary for salvation. Wycliffe was vilified for translating parts of the 
Bible into the English vernacular to make it available to the mass of believers, 
who neither read nor understood Latin. In the early 1th century, Hussites, 
followers of Jan Hus in Bohemia, were declared heretics for beliefs similar 
to Wycliffe’s. Hus himself was burned at the stake. Huldrych =wingli 
campaigned in Geneva for a religion that would follow the exact teachings 
168 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONof the scriptures  and discard customs that had evolved later. For example, 
he opposed the requirement for celibacy of the clergy because he argued 
that the rule was imposed long after the scriptures were writte n. 
The power of the Church suffered during the so-called Babylonian 
Captivity 10±1, when the papacy was located in France rather 
than in Rome. The Captivity gave French rulers greater influence over the 
Church, even the ability to decide who should be pope. Newly centralizing 
rulers who coveted Church lands and authority began confiscating wealthy 
Catholic monasteries and sometimes established their own churches. In the 
eyes of believers, the Church suffered further when it failed to stop the 
Black Death. Connect: Write a paragraph connecting the Reformation 
with the problems of the medieval Church. See Topic 1.6.
Lutheranism  A monk named Martin Luther  in Wittenberg, a 
German city in the Holy Roman Empire 800±1806, concluded that 
several traditional Church practices violated biblical teachings. He objected 
to the sale of indulgences , which granted a person absolution from the 
punishments for sin, and to simony , the selling of church offices. As a 
result, Luther defiantly challenged the Church by nailing his charges, the  
95 Theses , to a church door. Luther advocated for the theological stance of 
“sola fide,” faith alone, for the basis of salvation for the Christian believer .
The Church reacted harshly. It, and the local political ruler, needed the 
money these practices generated. Luther persisted. In January 1521, Pope 
Leo ; excommunicated Luther. Several German political leaders saw an 
opportunity to free themselves from the power of the pope. They sided with 
Luther. Soon, what had begun as a minor academic debate became a major 
split in the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire. 
Luther was not a political or social revolutionary. When German 
peasants rebelled, he did not support them. But his theological ideas had 
social impact on the clergy as well as on women. Luther taught that women 
could have direct access to God just as men could. Luther’s emphasis 
promoted women’s literacy. He believed that women had significant roles in 
the family, particularly teaching their children to read the Bible. However, 
Protestants generally did not organize convents. As a result, Protestant 
women did not have the opportunity to become leaders in a vital institution 
the way Roman Catholic women did.
Calvinism  The French theologian John Calvin  broke with the Catholic 
Church around 150. In 156, he authored The Institutes of the Christian 
Religion  and helped reform the religious community in Geneva, Switzerland. 
The elect , those predestined  to go to heaven, ran the community, which 
was based on plain living, simple church buildings, and governance by the 
elders of the church. Calvin’s followers in France were called Huguenots. 
Other offshoots of Calvinism included the Reformed Church of Scotland, 
led by John .nox, and the Puritans  in England and later in Boston, who 
wanted to purify the Church of England of Catholic remnants. Historian and 
sociologist Max Weber pointed out that an important socioeconomic impact 
169 EMPIRES: BELIE F SYSTEMS 169of Calvinism is contained in the phrase “Protestant work ethic.” Calvinists 
were encouraged to work hard and reinvest their profits prosperity ostensibly 
showed that God favored their obedience and hard work. Prosperity also 
indicated their position among the elect. Calvinists viewed their work ethic as 
righteous living that elevated them to positions of secular leadership. Together, 
the various reform efforts are known as the Protestant Reformation .

Anglicanism  The last of the three major figures of the Reformation was 
England’s .ing Henry VIII  ruled 150±15. Henry wanted a male heir to 
succeed him. After his wife gave birth to several daughters, Henry asked the 
pope to annul his marriage so he could marry another woman, Anne Boleyn . 
But the pope refused out of worry over the reaction of Charles V , the powerful 
emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Henry, with the approval of the English 
Parliament, set himself up as head of the new Church of England, or  Anglican 
Church ²one that would be free of control by the pope in Rome.
The Orthodox Church and Reforms in Russia
Charles 9 had revitalized the concept of the universal monarchy and spent 
most of his reign defending the integrity of the Holy Roman Empire from the 
Protestant Reformation. Like Charles 9 , Peter the Great of Russia asserted 
his authority as he moved against the Orthodox Church. The Church had long 
been the force unifying the Russian people and the tsars, who claimed to rule 
170 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONby divine right. Peter confirmed his power over the Church by abolishing the 
position of patriarch, the head of the Church, and incorporating the Church 
into the government. In place of the patriarch, he established the Holy Synod , 
composed of clergymen overseen by a secular official who answered to the 
tsar. Peter raised the minimum age for men to become eligible to be monks to 
50, preferring that the young serve first as soldiers. Peter’s reforms were not 
welcomed by many peasants and Old Believers, a sect that opposed earlier 
reforms.
Counter-Reformation or Catholic Reformation
The Roman Catholic Church, all-powerful in Europe since the fall of Rome, 
did not sit quietly by and let the Reformation groups take over. Instead, it 
embarked on a vigorous Counter-Reformation  to fight against the Protestant 
attacks. A three-pronged strategy yielded such gains for the Church that it 
remains the largest Christian denomination in the world:
• The Church increased the use of the Inquisition , which had been 
established in the late 12th century to root out and punish nonbelievers. 
The Inquisition sometimes allowed the use of torture to achieve its 
ends.
• The Jesuits , or Society of Jesus, a religious order founded in 150 
by Ignatius of Loyola, also opposed the spread of Protestantism. The 
Jesuits undertook missionary activity throughout the Spanish Empire as 
well as in Japan and India. 
• The Council of Trent  155±156 corrected some of the worst of the 
Church’s abuses and concentrated on reaffirming the rituals such as 
marriage and other sacraments improving the education of priests. The 
Council also published the Index of Prohibited Books , a list of writings 
that the Church banned, including Protestant copies of the Bible and 
the writings of Copernicus. 
The Counter-Reformation was successful in that Catholicism remained 
predominant in the areas of Western Europe near the Mediterranean Sea. 
Moreover, later colonies of the European powers often followed the lead of 
the home country in religion. Therefore, most of the people in the Spanish, 
Portuguese, and French colonies became Catholic.
Charles 9 abdicated as ruler of the Holy Roman Empire in 1555, 
discouraged by his inability to stop the spread of Lutheranism. He left Spain 
to his son Philip II  and the Holy Roman Empire to his brother Ferdinand. 
Philip II took the Catholic crusade to the Netherlands and ruled its 1 
provinces from 1556 to 1581. He later tried to conquer and convert England. 
In 1588, his Spanish Armada  was defeated by English naval power.
171 EMPIRES: BELIE F SYSTEMSWars of Religion
Europe’s religious divisions led to frequent wars. In 156 and 15, the forces 
of Charles 9 fought the German Lutheran Schmalkaldic League. Conflict 
between Lutherans and the Holy Roman Empire resulted in the 1555 Peace 
of Augsburg , which allowed each German state to choose whether its ruler 
would be Catholic or Lutheran. As a result, churches and inhabitants were 
forced to practice the state religion. People who refused could move to another 
state where their preferred religion was practiced.
France  In France, Catholics and Huguenots fought for nearly half a 
century. Then, in 15, .ing Henry I9 , who had been raised as a Protestant, 
tried to unify the country by becoming a Catholic, reportedly saying that 
“Paris is well worth a Mass.” Five years later, in another step to bring peace, 
Henry issued the Edict of Nantes , which allowed the Huguenots to practice 
their faith. The edict provided religious toleration in France for the next 8 
years. In 1685, Louis ;I9 of France issued the Revocation of the Edict of 
Nantes. As a result, France experienced social and economic effects. For 
example, many skilled craftsmen left France, taking knowledge of important 
industry techniques and styles with them.
7hirty <ears¶ :ar  The final great religious conflict between Catholics 
and Protestants in Europe culminated in the 7hirty <ears¶ :ar 1618±
168, which led to economic catastrophe for most of the continent. The 
Thirty Years’ War was initially the result of religious conflict within the 
Holy Roman Empire it gradually developed into a more general conflict 
involving European powers. Much of the destruction was caused by troops 
who were allowed to loot as part of their compensation. The war resulted 
in widespread famine, starvation, and disease. 
The war culminated in the 3eace oI :estShalia , which allowed each area 
of the Holy Roman Empire to select one of three religious options: Roman 
Catholicism, Lutheranism, or Calvinism. After this settlement, France, Spain, 
and Italy were predominantly Catholic. Northern Europe was either Lutheran 
or Calvinist. England was Protestant with a state church. 
Allowing rulers of various areas of the Holy Roman Empire to choose 
a denomination had important political effects. It gave the countries and 
duchies much more autonomy than they previously had. Consequently, 
the states of Prussia now part of Germany and Austria began to assert 
themselves, although they still formally belonged to the Holy Roman Empire. 
Prussia, after suffering tremendous destruction during the Thirty Years’ War, 
developed a strong military to protect itself. The Prussian military tradition 
would become a key factor in European politics into the 20th century .

Islamic Religious Schisms
As in the Holy Roman Empire, religion and the state were closely tied in 
Islamic empires. Islam continued to be an enduring belief system, spreading 
its sphere of influence despite factions that developed within it.
Ottoman Empire  Until 15, much of the area had been controlled by the 
Byzantine Empire and followed the Eastern Orthodox religion. After the siege 
of Constantinople, the area became Ottoman and the dominant religion became 
Islam. A sultan replaced the emperor, and the Byzantine Empire’s Justinian Law 
was replaced by shariah . This is a strict Islamic legal system that deals with all 
aspects of life, such as criminal justice, marital laws, and is sues of inheritance. 
The Safavids  Using Shi’a Islam as a unifying force, Shah Ismail built a 
power base that supported his rule and denied legitimacy to any Sunni. This 
strict adherence to Shi’a Islam caused frequent hostilities within the Ottoman 
Empire.  
Mughal Toleration and Prosperity  Akbar tolerated all religions. He 
gave money or land to Hindus and Muslims. He also gave money for a Catholic 
church in Goa, on India’s southwest coast. He provided land grants for the 
relatively new religion of Sikhism , which developed from Hinduism and may 
have been influenced by the Islamic mysticism known as Sufism. See Topics  
1.2 and 1.. Sikhism, a monotheistic faith that recognized the rights of other 
faiths to exist, became the fifth most popular religion in the world by the 21st 
century. Akbar tried to ease tensions between Hindus and Muslims. He gave 
Hindus positions in his government²zamindars of high and low positions 
could be Hindu²and married Hindu wives. He exempted Hindus from poll 
taxes paid by non-Muslims in the empire. Because he enjoyed religious 
discussions, Akbar invited Catholic priests to Delhi to explain Christianity to 
him. 
Regarded as one of the world’s outstanding rulers, Akbar encouraged 
learning, art, architecture, and literature. He tried and failed to prohibit child 
marriages and sati, the ritual in which widows killed themselves by jumping 
on the funeral pyres of their husbands. He died in 1605 without successfully 
converting his Hindu and Islamic subjects to the religion c alled Din-i Ilahi , or 
“divine faith,” which he had promoted to reconcile Hinduism and Islam.

In the early 1600s, scientific thinking gained popularity in northern Europe as 
trends in Renaissance ideas, curiosity, investigation, and discovery spread. In a 
period of religious schisms, scientific thought represented a very different kind 
of thinking²one based on reason rather than on faith²that would set in motion 
a monumental historical change. In 1620, English scientist and philosopher 
Francis Bacon developed an early scientific method called empiricism , which 
insisted upon the collection of data to back up a hypothesis. Bacon challenged 
traditional ideas that had been accepted for centuries and replace them with 
ones that could be demonstrated with evidence.
Scientific thinking advanced through the correspondence of leading scholars 
with one another, even during the religious wars, and by the establishment 
of a Royal Academy of Science in France and England. Sir Isaac Newton, 
combining Galileo’s laws of terrestrial motion and Johannes .epler’s laws 
of planetary motion, published a work on gravitational force called Principia 
168. The ideas in Principia influenced science and mathematics and helped 
lead to a new vision of the world. Many intellectuals thought that science 
showed that the world was ordered and rational and that natural laws applied 
to the rational and orderly progress of governments and society. This thinking 
is a key to the Enlightenment see Topic 5.1.

made him a fine soldier and very skilled, and his men so dexterous that they 
are little behind our men in Europe. He has introduced into his militia the

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“Let no one think that this Commandment entirely forbids the arts of 
painting, engraving, or sculpture. The Scriptures inform us that God Himself 
commanded to be made images of Cherubim >a category of angel@, and also 
the brazen serpent. The interpretation, therefore, at which we must arrive, is 
that images are prohibited only inasmuch as they are used as deities to receive 
adoration, and so to injure the true worship of God. . . .
He >the pastor@ will also inform the unlettered . . . of the use of images, that 
they are intended to instruct in the history of the Old and New Testaments, 
and to revive from time to time their memory that thus, moved by the 
contemplation of heavenly things, we may be the more ardently inflamed to 
adore and love God Himself. He should, also, point out that the images of the 
Saints are placed in churches, not only to be honored, but also that they may 
admonish us by their examples to imitate their lives and virtues.”

Essential Question:   By what methods did empires increase their societal 
and cultural influence from c. 1450–c. 1750?
Building and maintaining large land-based  empires is a major theme in 
the period c. 1450 ±c. 1750 . These  empires grew as they incorporated lands 
they conquered. The ir rulers implemented policies to solidify or legitimize 
their rule over a diverse population. However, the conquered often did not 
totally assimilate to the life and culture of their conquerors. In some cases the 
conquered influenced the conquerors, helping to shape a blended culture.  The 
interconnection of hemispheres also led to blended cultures.

Suleiman I besieged the Habsburg-controlled city of Esztergom in 15 with the 
help of French artillery. The figure at the far left is a Janissary. Suleiman is on 
horseback.
178 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONNot all empires were able to maintain their authority. For example, the 
Gunpowder Empires declined, unable to compete with European trading 
companies, especially the British, and unable to resolve conflicts of heirs 
motivated by harem politics see Topic .1. Other factors in the decline 
included weak or corrupt leadership and failure to keep up with developments 
in military and naval technology. The expensive armies each empire needed to 
maintain control placed harsh financial burdens on the peasants and villages 
in the form of taxes and other obligations. Religious conflicts also divided and 
weakened the Gunpowder Empires. 
A deep religious schism divided Muslims and Hindus in Mughal India, 
just as a schism divided Sunni Ottomans and Shi’a Safavids and set the stage 
for conflict between the present-day countries of Iraq and Iran. Connect: 
Write a paragraph comparing the decline of Mughal India with the decline of 
the Mongol Empire. See Topic 2.1.
Military Might
The armies of these land-based empires were well trained, well organized, well 
equipped, and well led. Empires in Eurasia all relied on gunpowder weapons, 
including large cannons, in support of more traditional cavalry and infantry 
units. In the Americas, the fierceness of both the Aztec and Incan warriors 
allowed them to intimidate and conquer neighboring territories. 
Soldiers  In some cases, the rulers of land-based empires developed an 
elite group of soldiers to use in solidifying their control over their territories. 
For instance, both the Ottoman sultan and Safavid shah used enslaved soldiers 
to offset the power of troops who had more loyalty to their tribe or local 
governor than to the sultan or shah. The Janissaries in the Ottoman Empire 
helped to preserve the power of the Ottoman sultan and the Ghulams helped to 
protect the Safavid shah from rival clans. Both the Janissaries and the Ghulams 
were often recruited from minority religious or ethnic groups found within 
the empires. The Janissaries were often enslaved people taken from Christian 
areas of the Ottoman Empire, while the Ghulams came from the Georgian, 
Armenian, or Circassian populations within the Safavid Empire. The system 
of taking people as part of a “blood” tax in the Ottoman Empire this was 
known as devshirme or tribute was not limited to the Ottomans or Safavids. 
Aztecs also required enslaved people or prisoners as part of the tribute offered 
by conquered states. 
:arIare These strong militaries did not prevent conflict among the land-
based empires. The Ottoman Empire and Safavid Empire went to war over the 
territorial claims each had at its border. However, religion also played a role as 
an underlying cause of this conflict. The Ottoman Empire was a predominantly 
Sunni Muslim state, while the Safavids were mainly Shi’a. Each believed the 
other to practice a heretical type of Islam and was willing to go to war over 
this split. Religion was not as important a factor in the conflict between the 
Safavids and the Mughals as it was in the Ottoman-Safavid War. Instead, 
179 COMPARIS ON IN LAND-BASED EMPIRES 179control over resources and trade routes in present-day Afghanistan was at the 
core of the war between these two land-based empires.
Two Muslim powers conflicted when Morocco invaded the Songhai 
Empire in 151. Moroccan forces sacked the capital of Gao and ended the 
empire. However, Morocco was unable to hold onto all the Songhai territory.
Centralized Bureaucracy 
Controlling a large area with such diverse populations required land-based 
empires to establish an organized and centralized bureaucracy. Recruiting 
bureaucratic elites took several forms. In the Ming and Manchu dynasties of 
China, the civil service examination system was used to assess the abilities of 
the members of the scholar-gentry who wished to enter government service. In 
the Ottoman Empire, the devshirme system provided the sultan with a ready-
made pool of civil servants strictly loyal to him, while in the Safavid Empire, 
the shah would enlist a class of bureaucrats from the Persian population of the 
empire, known as “the men of the pen.”

In the Songhai Empire, the mansa , a Mandika word meaning “sultan,” 
employed bureaucrats from the scholarly class educated in the schools, or 
madrasas, of Timbuktu. While the Incas did not use a dedicated scholarly 
class to rule their empire as the Ming and Manchus did, they did organize 
their empire into a federal system of provinces headed by nobles loyal to the 
emperor. Further, these nobles oversaw a very organized political structure 
that was divided on the basis of a decimal system.
180 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONDespite its many similarities to other land empires, the Aztec Empire 
was less centralized and bureaucratic than the other land empires. The Aztec 
created a tributary empire and had little to no direct control over the territory 
within the region of Mesoamerica. It kept control over this region through 
force, fear, and intimidation rather than through a centralized bureaucracy.

A portrayal of Aztec warriors from the Florentine Codex, written between 150 and 15.
Taxation  Some form of taxation or revenue collection was necessary to 
support the bureaucracy and military of the land-based empires of this period. 
Taxation took many forms in these empires:
• Mughal zamindar tax collection:  Mughal emperors appointed tax 
officers or zamindars to collect taxes from the peasant class based on 
land and production.
• Ottoman tax farming:  Rather than employing government tax 
collectors, the Ottoman sultans appointed “tax farmers” to pay an 
annual fixed sum of money for an area to the central government and 
then recoup the outlay by collecting money or salable goods from the 
residents of the area. Many Janissaries were paid their salaries in this 
manner by collecting more money than they paid out to the central 
government.
• Aztec tribute lists:  As the Aztecs or Mexica formed a tributary 
empire, the main source of revenue that supported the Aztec noble 
class and military came from yearly offerings or tributes from the 
surrounding areas. The lists included whichever local product was 
made or valued but could also include a demand for people, many of 
whom became human sacrifices in Aztec religious rituals.
• Ming collection of “hard currency:”  The Ming Empire, like its 
predecessors, issued paper currency as a means to facilitate trade 
and tax collection however the use of paper money led to rampant 
counterfeiting and hyperinflation. The Ming then ordered that all taxes 
should be paid in the form of rice, and later silver coins, known as 
“hard currency.”
181 COMPARIS ON IN LAND-BASED EMPIRES Striving for Legitimacy
While the diversity of the populations of the land-based empires was beneficial 
to the economic and political strength of the empires, ruling over populations 
that included many ethnicities, religions, and tribal ties was challenging. 
Therefore many rulers turned to other than political means to unite their 
subjects in their loyalty to the state. Rulers used religion, art, and monumental 
architecture to legitimize their rule. Akbar attempted a syncretic approach to 
religion in the Mughal Empire, but he had little success in that area.
Sources of Legitimacy Examples
Religion • Rulers in Islamic empires used references to the title 
“caliph,” or successor to the Prophet.
• European monarchs claim to ¸divine right¹ that gave 
the monarch the mandate to rule by the Christian God.
• Conversion to Islam of Songhai rulers and noble class 
provides a religious and legal structure to the empire.
• Aztec (Mexica) use human sacrifice in religious rituals.
Art • Portraits of the Qing emperors and other high oɉcials
• Miniature paintings in the Ottoman Empire
• -inancial support of artists by European rulers

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   WHY DID THE ISLAMI C GUNPOWDER 
EMPIRES  RISE  AND  DECLINE ?
The term “Gunpowder Empires” was coined by Marshall G. S. Hodgson in the 10s 
to refer to the large land empires of Southwestern and South Asia that flourished the 
from 150 to 150  The Venture of Islam: The Gunpowder Empires and Modern 
Times . The term is often used to describe the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals. 
Trade and the Rise of Empires  .enneth Pomeranz and Steven Topik, in their 
2005 book The World That Trade Created , described the empires as part of the growing 
global economy. These authors, taking economic and social perspectives, used coffee 
as one example of the international character of consumer goods: “Coffee’s role in 
sociability and prestige in Europe was enhanced by the arrival of emissaries of the 
Ottoman sultan in France and Austria in 1665±1666, who poured the exotic liquor for 
their aristocratic European guests during extravagant soirees.”
Reasons for Decline  Historians have given various reasons for their declines, 
but most fall into three categories: 1 ineffectiveness 2 intolerance of minorities 
and  failure to modernize. One reviewer summarized historian 9ladimir Minorsky’s 
reasons for the decline of the Safavid Empire: 
a. decline of theocratic ideology
b. opposition between old and new elements in the military class
c.  disturbance in equilibrium among the service classes, which lost interest in 
the cause they were supporting
d. the “shadow government” represented by the harem 
e. degeneration of the dynasty as a result of its insular nature
Military :eaNness  William McNeill pointed out that rulers and military 
administrators did not try to keep up with “subsequent European innovations in 
military and naval matters, leaving them woefully exposed to attack.” McNeill noted 
that the Ottomans’ guns were able to defeat their Islamic rivals, the Safavids, because 
“until about 1600, the Ottoman army remained technically and in every way in the 
very forefront of military proficiency.” Nevertheless, after the time of Suleiman, 
leaders did not themselves lead soldiers in battle, and military discipline declined just 
as efficiency and technology began to lag behind Western Europe.
Tolerance and Intolerance  Amy Chua, Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers 
Rise to Global Dominance—and Why They Fall , suggested a different reason for 
the eventual failure of the Gunpowder Empires. Her thesis was that intolerance 
ultimately became an obstacle to retaining great power. She suggested that empires 
were successful in holding their power when they were at their most religiously and 
ethnically tolerant. This thesis can help explain why the Ottoman Empire, with its 
relative tolerance, outlived the more intolerant Safavid and Mu ghal Empires.

our care for the general good, become more and more prosperous. For 
this end we have always tried to maintain internal order, to defend the 
state against invasion, and in every possible way to improve and to 
extend trade. With this purpose we have been compelled to make some 
necessary and salutary changes in the administration, in order that our

The tsar labored at the reform of fashions, or, more properly speaking, of 
dress. Until that time the Russians had always worn long beards, which 
they cherished and preserved with much care, allowing them to hang 
down on their bosoms, without even cutting the moustache. With these 
long beards they wore the hair very short, except the ecclesiastics, who, 
to distinguish themselves, wore it very long. The tsar, in order to reform 
that custom, ordered that gentlemen, merchants, and other subjects, 
except priests and peasants, should each pay a tax of one hundred rubles 
a year if they wished to keep their beards the commoners had to pay one 
kopek each. Officials were stationed at the gates of the towns to collect 
that tax, which the Russians regarded as an enormous sin on the part of 
the tsar and as a thing which tended to the abolition of their religion.
These insinuations, which came from the priests, occasioned the 
publication of many pamphlets in Moscow, where for that reason alone 
the tsar was regarded as a tyrant and a pagan and there were many 
old Russians who, after having their beards shaved off, saved them 
preciously, in order to have them placed in their coffins, fearing that they 
would not be allowed to enter heaven without their beards. As for the 
young men, they followed the new custom with the more readiness as it 
made them appear more agreeable to the fair sex.

from c. 1450 to c. 1750
Understand the Context
The voyage by Christopher Columbus in 1492 that connected the Eastern and 
Western hemispheres led to the first global trade networks. They provided the 
framework for historical events for the following centuries. 
Establishment of Maritime Empires   Between 150 and 150, European 
states, starting with the Portuguese and Spanish, sought a transoceanic route 
to Asia. Europeans established trading post empires in the Indian Ocean that 
inadvertently brought them into contact with the Americas. 
Global Exchanges  Trans-Atlantic trade linked the Americas, Europe, 
and Africa for the first time. European colonists who wanted sugar and other 
crops to sell in the global market developed plantations in the Americas. Their 
desire for laborers fueled the trade in enslaved Africans. Trans-Pacific trade 
flourished as well. Silver mined in Latin America was the major commodity. 
Over time, the transfer of crops, animals, and disease between the Eastern 
and Western hemispheres, known as the Columbian Exchange, altered life 
everywhere. The introduction of potatoes, corn, and tomatoes to Europe led to 
population growth. The introduction of deadly pathogens, such as small pox 
and measles, devastated the populations of the Americas. 
Change and Continuity  Within the context of increasing European 
influence, regional commerce and established states in Afro-Eurasia continued 
to flourish. The Mughal, Ottoman, and Qing Empires expanded, creating 
ethnically diverse states. Across the globe, peasant and artisan labor intensified 
as the demand for goods and food increased. These developments set the stage 
for the revolutions that defined the period after 150. 14501550 165017501492

TECHNOLOGICA L INNOVATIONS 191
4.1
Technological Innovations 
The sailors, moreover, as they sail over the sea, when in cloudy weather they 
can no longer profit by the light of the sun, or when the world is wrapped up in 
the darkness of the shades of night, and they are ignorant to what point of the 
compass their ship’s course is directed, they touch the magnet with a needle, 
which (the needle) is whirled round in a circle until, when its motion ceases,  
its point looks direct to the north.  
—Alexander Neckham (1157-1217)
Essential Question:   How did cross-cultural interactions spread  
technology and facilitate changes in trade and  
travel from 1450 to 1750?
Although land-based empires were important during this period, various 
inventions allowed Europeans to venture long distances on the ocean. The 
magnetic compass, originally created in China for fortune telling, helped 
steer a ship in the right direction, as described by Alexander Neckham. The 
astrolabe, improved by Muslim navigators in the 12th century, let sailors find 
out how far north or south they were from the equator. The caravel, a small, 
three-masted sailing ship developed by the Portuguese in the 15th century, 
allowed sailors to survive storms at sea better than earlier-designed ships. 
Cartography , or mapmaking, and knowledge of current and wind patterns 
also improved navigation.
Demographic pressures pushed Europeans into exploration and trade. As 
the population grew, not all workers in Europe could find work or even food. 
Not all sons of the wealthy could own land because primogeniture laws  gave 
all of each estate to the eldest son. In the early 1th century, religious minorities 
searched for a place to settle where people were tolerant of their dissent. All of 
these groups, as well as those just longing for adventure and glory, were eager 
to settle in new areas. Those who left their homelands in search of work, food, 
land, tolerance, and adventure were part of a global shift in demographics.
Developments of Transoceanic Travel and Trade
Europe was never totally isolated from East and South Asia. The Indian Ocean 
trade routes had long brought silk, spices, and tea to the Mediterranean by 
way of the Red Sea. Islamic traders had long known of land routes from China 
to the cities of Baghdad and Constantinople and from there to Rome. Then, 
192 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONin the 16th century, more and more Europeans became active in the Indian 
Ocean, with hopes of finding wealth and new converts as their twin motives. 
However, Europeans faced competition from Middle Eastern traders based in 
kingdoms such as Oman. For example, the Portuguese set up forts in Oman 
but were repeatedly challenged by attempts to remove them. The Omani-
European rivalry  was one reason for Christopher Columbus’s search for a 
new route to India. 
The voyages by Columbus connected people across the Atlantic Ocean. 
European traders became go-betweens linking Afro-Eurasia and the Americas. 
• From the Americas, they purchased sugar, tobacco, and rum.
• From Africa, they purchased enslaved people.
• From Asia, they purchased silk, spices, and rhubarb.
This extensive trade transformed Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, France, and 
Holland into maritime empires , ones based on sea travel. 
Much of this trade was carried out by men. However, in Southeast Asia, 
Europeans conducted most of their business with women, who traditionally 
handled markets and money-changing services in those cultures.
Classical, Islamic, and Asian Technology
Western European countries such as Portugal, Spain, and England were 
developing their naval technology. They were aware of traditions of sailing 
that went back to the classical Greeks, such as using the stars to navigate. 
They combined this knowledge with new ideas developed by Islamic and 
Asian sailors and scholars, which they learned about because of the cross-
cultural interactions resulting from trade networks. Al-Andalus, in what is 
now Spain, was a place where Islamic ideas diffused into Europe.
The leading European figure in this development was Portuguese ruler 
Prince Henry the Navigator. While he never sailed far enough out to sea to 
lose sight of land, he strongly supported exploration. He financed expeditions 
along Africa’s Atlantic Coast and around the Cape of Good Hope. With his 
backing, Portugal explored African coastal communities and kingdoms before 
other European powers. 
Advances in Ideas  As scholars gathered knowledge, they improved the 
safety of sailing on the ocean. For example, Newton’s discovery of gravitation 
increased knowledge of the tides. As a result, sailors could reliably predict 
when the depth of water near a shore would be decreasing, thereby exposing 
dangerous rocks. As people kept increasingly accurate records on the direction 
and intensity of winds, sailors could sail with greater confidence.
Improvements in cartography also improved navigation. An astronomical 
chart is any map of the stars and galaxies. Mariners relied on these maps 
to guide ships’ direction, especially before the introduction of the compass, 
using the skies to help them determine their location. Ancient astronomers 
in Babylonia and Mesopotamia had created star charts as early as the 2nd 
193 TECHNOLOGICA L INNOVATIONS millennium B.C.E. Charts by Chinese astronomers date back to the 5th century 
B.C.E. Charts were also used widely by classical Greek astronomers. Using 
telescopes to help create astronomical charts began in 160, and the practice 
was widely used to map the stars by the end of the 1th century. Astronomers 
typically divided the charts into grids to help locate specific constellations and 
astronomical objects.
Advances in Equipment  Several developments in the equipment used on 
ships made sailing safer and faster than ever. Ships moved adroitly, aided by a 
new type of rudder, another idea imported from China. The astrolabe, improved 
by Muslim navigators in the 12th century, allowed sailors to determine how far 
north or south they were from the equator. 
The compass is the primary direction-finding device used in navigation. It 
works either with magnets or a gyroscope, which is a wheel or disk mounted to 
spin rapidly around an axis in various directions. Other compasses determine 
the location of the sun or a specific star. The magnetic compass, originally 
invented in China, allowed sailors to steer a ship in the right direction. It is 
the oldest and most familiar. It was discovered by mariners in both China and 
Europe in the 12th century. This type of compass works as Earth itself acts as 
an enormous bar magnet. Earth’s magnetic field is almost parallel to the north-
south axis of the globe, which means that freely moving magnets, such as those 
in a compass, take on the same orientation. 
The lateen sail , or a ship sail in the shape of a triangle, was a pivotal piece 
of technology. Used by Arab sailors and in the Indian Ocean, it significantly 
affected medieval navigation and trade. The ancient square sails that preceded 
the lateen allowed sailing only in a single direction and had to be used with 
the wind. The lateen, however, could catch the wind on either side of the ship, 
allowing it to travel in different directions. When used with the square sail, 
the lateen allowed sailors to travel successfully into large bodies of water, 
including oceans, for the first time, thus expanding trade rout es.

Lateen sails are still used on 
modern sailboats.
194 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONNew types of ships also improved trade. By adjusting the ratio of length to 
width of a ship, adding or reducing the number of masts, and using different 
types of sails, builders could adapt ships to improve their efficiency. (Connect:

Long-Term Results  The long-term result of combining navigational 
techniques invented in Europe with those from other areas of the world was a 
rapid expansion of exploration and global trade. About the only part of the Afro-
Eurasia world not affected by the rapid increase in global trade was Polynesia, 
since it was far removed from trading routes. 
The introduction of gunpowder, another Chinese invention, aided Europeans 
in their conquests abroad. Soon enough, however, sea pirates also used the new 
technology, particularly the Dutch pirates known as Sea Beggars. 
In North Africa and in the trading cities along Africa’s east coast, Islam 
spread rapidly as a result of the growth of the Abbasid Empire, centered in 
Baghdad, and the activities of Muslim merchants. Interactions among various 
cultures inside and outside of Africa brought extensive trade and new technology 
to the continent.
Navigational techniques continued to spread throughout the 1th century. 
Russia’s Tsar Peter the Great visited Western Europe in 16 to observe military 
and naval technology. His interest in European technology led him to hire 
technicians from Germany and elsewhere to help build Russia’s military and 
naval power.

“After the year 1500 there was no pepper to be had at Calicut that was not 
dyed red with blood.”
 9 oltaire, 156
“Gunpowder weapons were not new. The Chinese invented gunpowder and 
they made the first true guns in the tenth century, primarily for defensive 
purposes. The Mongols improved these Chinese weapons into a more 
effective offensive force, to blow open city gates. By 121, these weapons 
had reached Europe. Early modern Europeans, Turks, Mughals, and Chinese 
owed their strength in part to improvements in gunpowder weaponry. 
Combined with better military organization and seagoing capability, 
advanced weaponry inevitably affected political and social systems. 
As they spread throughout Eurasia and North Africa, gunpowder weapons 
changed warfare. Europeans learned how to make particularly deadly 
weapons, improving the technology in part because they had easier access 
to metals.”

Exploration: Causes and Events
You can never cross the ocean unless you have  
the courage to lose sight of the shore
—Christopher Columbus (1451-1506)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the state-
sponsored expansion of maritime exploration?
Thanks in part to improved navigation techniques, Italian cities with ports 
on the Mediterranean had a monopoly on European trade with Asia. By 
controlling access to the trade routes, the Italians controlled prices of Asian 
imports to Europe, driving Spain and Portugal, and later France, England, and 
the Netherlands, into the search for new routes to Asia. Explorers hoped to find 
riches overseas, especially gold and silver. In addition to these economic and 
political reasons, explorers were interested in converting others to Christianity. 
Also, technological breakthroughs in sailing and navigation made bold new 
voyages possible.
Christopher Columbus , quoted above and credited with “discovering the 
New World,” was fortunate in 12 to gain the support of the Spanish monarchs, 
Queen Isabella and .ing Ferdinand, for his voyages across the Atlantic. His 
journeys helped increase the interest in discovery, and the English, French, and 
Dutch supported later exploration.
The Role of States in Maritime Exploration
European states were seeking ways to expand their authority and control of 
resources in the era of empire-building. Conquests brought new wealth to 
states through the collection of taxes and through new trading opportunities. 
In time it also brought great material wealth, especially in silver, to European 
states. Rivalries among European states stoked efforts to expand before 
another power might claim a territory. Religion was also a motivating force 
for exploration and expansion. Many Europeans believed that it was their 
Christian duty to seek out people in other lands to convert them. 
For all these reasons, states were centrally involved in maritime exploration. 
9 oyages such as those Columbus undertook were expensive, and without the 
financial support of a state, they would most likely have been too expensive 
200 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONfor explorers and even most merchants to be able to afford. Since religion was 
tightly woven into the government of most European states, preserving and 
spreading a state’s religion became another reason for state involvement. 
Also, in the 1th century, Europeans generally measured the wealth of 
a country in how much gold and silver it had accumulated. For this reason, 
countries set policies designed to sell as many goods as they could to other 
countries²in order to maximize the amount of gold and silver coming into the 
country²and to buy as few as possible from other countries²to minimize the 
flow of precious metals out of the country. This theory, known as mercantilism , 
required heavy government involvement. 
Expansion of European Maritime Exploration
In no nation were the interests of the state and the interest of explorers 
as closely tied as they were in Portugal, which led the way in European 
exploration as it had in maritime innovations. See Topic 2.. 
Portuguese in Africa and India  The small kingdom of Portugal, bounded 
on the east by the Spanish kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, could expand only 
overseas. Three people led its exploration:
• Prince Henry the Navigator  1±160 became the first European 
monarch to sponsor seafaring expeditions, to search for an all-water 
route to the east as well as for African gold. Under him, Portugal began 
importing enslaved Africans by sea, replacing the overland slave trade. 
• Bartholomew Diaz  sailed around the southern tip of Africa, the Cape 
of Good Hope, in 188, into waters his crew did not know. Diaz feared 
a mutiny if he continued pushing eastward, so he returned home.
•  Vasco Da Gama  sailed farther east than Diaz, landing in India in 
18. There he claimed territory as part of Portugal’s empire. The 
Portuguese ports in India were a key step in expanding Portugal’ s trade 
in the Indian Ocean and with points farther east.
Portuguese in Southeast and East Asia  Early in the 16th century, the 
ruthless Portuguese admiral Afonso de Albuquerque won a short but bloody 
battle with Arab traders and set up a factory at Malacca in present-day 
Indonesia. He had previously served as governor of Portuguese India 150±
1515, sending strings of Indians’ ears home to Portugal as evidence of his 
conquests.

He’s final voyage in the 10s. See Topic 2.. However, less than a century 
later, in 151, the outside world arrived on China’s doorstep in the form of 
Portuguese traders. At that time, Portugal’s superior ships and weapons were 
unmatched among the Europeans. As a result of this advantage, the Portuguese 
had already won control of both the African and Indian coasts. They had won a 
decisive victory over a Turkish-Egyptian-9enetian fleet at Diu, India, in 150. 
201 EXPL ORATION: CA USES AN D EVENTS 201Initial Portuguese visits had little impact on Chinese society. But the 
traders were followed by Roman Catholic missionaries, mainly Franciscans 
and Dominicans, who worked to gain converts among the Chinese people.
The Jesuits soon followed and tried to win over the Chinese court elite. 
Scientific and technical knowledge were the keys to success at the court. Jesuit 
missionaries in Macau, such as Matteo Ricci an Italian, arrived 1582 and 
Adam Schall von Bell a German, arrived 161, impressed the Chinese with 
their learning. However, they failed to win many converts among the hostile 
scholar-gentry, who considered them barbaric.
Trading Post Empire  To ensure control of trade, the Portuguese had 
constructed a series of forts stretching from Hormuz on the Persian Gulf built 
in 150 to Goa in western India built in 1510 to Malacca on the Malay 
Peninsula built in 1511. The aims of the fort construction were to establish 
a monopoly complete control over a market over the spice trade in the area 
and to license all vessels trading between Malacca and Hormuz. The forts gave 
Portugal a global trading post empire , one based on small outposts, rather 
than control of large territories. The Portuguese also restricted Indian Ocean 
trade to those who were willing to buy permits.
Portuguese Vulnerability   The Portuguese succeeded in global trade for 
several decades, but Portugal was a small nation, lacking the workers and the 
ships necessary for the enforcement of a large trade empire. Many Portuguese 
merchants ignored their government and traded independently. Corruption 
among government officials also hampered the trading empire. By the 1th 
century, Dutch and English rivals were challenging the Portuguese in East 
Asia, including islands that are today part of Malaysia and Ind onesia.
The Dutch captured Malacca and built a fort at Batavia in Java in 1620. 
From Batavia, the Dutch attempted to monopolize the spice trade. As a result, 
the English focused on India, pushing the Portuguese out of South Asia.
In the early 16th century, the Portuguese also travelled to Japan to trade, 
followed by Christian missionaries in 15. They formed large Catholic 
settlements until the 1600s, when Japanese rulers outlawed Catholicism and 
expelled the missionaries. 
Spanish in the Philippines  Portuguese explorers such as 9asco da 
Gama were the first Western Europeans to reach the Indian Ocean by sea 
by going around the southern tip of Africa. Spanish ships, however, became 
the first to circumnavigate the globe when the government sponsored the 
voyage of Ferdinand Magellan . He died on the voyage in the Philippine 
Islands in 1522, but one of the ships in his fleet made it around the world, 
proving that the earth could be circumnavigated. 
Spain annexed the Philippines in 1521 when Magellan’s fleet arrived 
there. The Spanish returned in 1565 and started a long campaign to conquer the 
Filipinos, who put up fierce resistance. Manila became a Spanish commercial 
center in the area, attracting Chinese merchants and others. Because of the 
Portuguese and Spanish occupations, many Filipinos became Christians.
202 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe Lure of Riches
Columbus and other European explorers sought a new route to Asia and hoped 
to find gold, silver, and other valuable resources. The Spanish found so little of 
value in their first two decades of contact that they considered stopping further 
exploration. The English, after sponsoring voyages in the 10s, made little 
attempt to explore or settle for almost a century.
However, European interest in the Americas was rekindled when the Spanish 
came into contact with the two major empires in the region, the Aztecs in 
Mesoamerica and the Incas in South America. These empires had the gold and silver 
that made exploration, conquest, and settlement profitable. In addition, Europeans 
soon realized that, by using enslaved Native Americans and later enslaved Africans, 
they could grow wealthy by raising sugar, tobacco, and other valuable crops. 
7raGe $cross the 3acific  China was a particularly enthusiastic consumer of 
this silver from the Western Hemisphere. Silver, for example, made its way from 
what is now Mexico across the Pacific Ocean to East Asia in heavily armed 
Spanish ships known as galleons  that made stops in the Philippines. At the trading 
post in Manila, Europeans exchanged silver for luxury goods such as silk and 
spices, and even for gold bullion. The impressive Manila galleons allowed the 
silver trade to flourish. Indeed, the Chinese government soon began using silver 
as its main form of currency. By the early 1th century, silver had become a 
dominant force in the global economic system.

203 EXPL ORATION: CA USES AN D EVENTSSpain’s rivals in Europe also explored and claimed regions in the Americas. 
French, English, and Dutch explorers all looked for a northwest passage —a 
route through or around North America that would lead to East Asia and the 
precious trade in spices and luxury goods. 
French Exploration  In the 1500s and 1600s, the French government 
sponsored expeditions in search of a northwest passage. In 155, for example, 
French explorer Jacques Cartier  sailed from the Atlantic Ocean into the St. 
Lawrence River at today’s northern U.S. border. He did not find a new route 
to Asia, but he did claim part of what is now Canada for France. Eventually, 
explorers such as Cartier and Samuel de Champlain  explored 160±1616 
realized there were valuable goods and rich resources available in the Americas, 
so there was no need to go beyond to Asia.
Like the Spanish, the French hoped to find gold. Instead, they found a land 
rich in furs and other natural resources. In 1608, they established a town and 
trading post that they named Quebec . French traders and priests spread across 
the continent. The traders searched for furs the priests wanted to convert 
Native Americans to Christianity. The missionaries sometimes set up schools 
among the indigenous peoples. In the 1680s, a French trader known as La 
Salle explored the Great Lakes and followed the Mississippi River south to its 
mouth at the Gulf of Mexico. He claimed this vast region for France.
Unlike the Spanish²or the English who were colonizing the East Coast of 
what is now the United States²the French rarely settled permanently. Instead 
of demanding land, they traded for the furs trapped by Native Americans. For 
this reason, the French had better relations with natives than did the Spanish or 
English colonists and their settlements also grew more slowly. For example, 
by 15, the European population of New France , the French colony in 
North America, was only 0,000. The English colonies included one million 
Europeans. 
English Exploration  In 1, the English king sent an explorer named 
John Cabot  to America to look for a northwest passage. Cabot claimed lands 
from Newfoundland south to the Chesapeake Bay. The English, however, 
did not have enough sea power to defend themselves against Spanish naval 
forces²although English pirates called “sea dogs” sometimes attacked 
Spanish ships. Then in 1588, the English surprisingly defeated and destroyed 
all but one third of the Spanish Armada. With that victory, England declared 
itself a major naval power and began competing for lands and resources in the 
Americas.
At about the same time the French were founding Quebec, the English 
were establishing a colony in a land called 9irginia. In 160, about one 
hundred English colonists traveled approximately 60 miles inland from the 
coast, where they built a settlement, Jamestown , on the James River. Both the 
settlement and the river were named for the ruling English monarch, James  I. 
Jamestown was England’s first successful colony in the Americas, and one 
of the earliest colonies in what would become the United States. The first 
colonies in the present-day United States were Spanish settlements in Florida 
and New Mexico.

Dutch Exploration  In 160, the Dutch sent Henry Hudson  to explore 
the East Coast of North America. Among other feats, he sailed up what became 
known as the Hudson River to see if it led to Asia. He was disappointed in 
finding no northwest passage. He and other explorers would continue to search 
for such a route. Though it would travel through a chilly region, it offered the 
possibility of being only half the distance of a route that went around South 
America.
Though Hudson did not find a northwest passage, his explorations proved 
valuable to the Dutch. Based on his voyage, the Dutch claimed the Hudson 
River 9alley and the island of Manhattan. On the tip of this island, they settled 
a community called New Amsterdam , which today is known as New York 
City. Like many port towns, New Amsterdam prospered because it was located 
where a major river flowed into the ocean. 
205 EXPL ORATION: CA USES AN D EVENTSNew Amsterdam became an important node in the Dutch transatlantic trade 
network. Dutch merchants bought furs from trappers who lived and worked in 
the forest lands as far north as Canada. They purchased crops from lands to 
the south, particularly tobacco from 9irginia planters. They sent these goods 
and others to the Netherlands in exchange for manufactured goods that they 
could sell throughout colonial North America Connect: Explain how one of

Historians of exploration might well focus a specialized study on the 
search for a northwest passage²on the details of each effort to find 
one and the outcome of the exploration. In a similar way, economic 
historians might well focus a specialized study on the expansion of trade 
networks as a global economy began to develop. However, to appreciate 
the interconnections of historical developments, historians would relate 
the exploratory and the economic developments, looking for ways in 
which developments in one field of study influenced developments in 
the other field. For example, the explorers failed in their mission to find a 
northwest passage, but they found instead that there were goods to trade 
on the land they traveled through, and they explored new territories that 
proved rich with trading possibilities. These findings, in turn, led to the 
desire for more exploration that would lead to new participants in the 
global trade network.

Columbian Exchange
We are crushed to the ground; we lie in ruins.  
;here is nothing but grief and suќering in 4exico and ;latelolco,  
where once we saw beauty and ]alor
—from “Flowers and Songs of Sorrow,” anonymous  
Aztec poet, (c. 1521–1540)
Essential Question:   What were the causes of the Columbian Exchange and 
its effects on the Eastern and Western Hemispheres?  
As the excerpt from the poem above suggests, initial contact and the 
subsequent conquest and colonization of the Americas proved disastrous for the 
native peoples. Overpowered by superior weapons and decimated by disease, 
many native populations declined, dissipated, or were forced to submit to new 
rulers and a new religion.
Although European conquest seriously damaged entire native societies and 
their ways of life, eventually new ways of life developed out of the interaction 
of three broad traditions of culture: indigenous American, European, and 
African. In the process, the Eastern and Western Hemispheres became linked 
in a new way, sharing disease, foods, and animals. For the role Christopher 
Columbus played in establishing the link, these interactions became known as 
the Columbian Exchange .
The Columbian Exchange had far-reaching effects beyond dramatic 
changes in population and biodiversity. It also contributed to a changing 
global economy, sometimes with unintended consequences. For example, 
Spain successfully mined silver in the Americas. However, this silver sparked 
inflation in Spain, which contributed to the downfall of the Spanish Empire.
Diseases and Population Catastrophe
Until the arrival of Columbus, the peoples of the Western and Eastern 
Hemispheres had been almost completely isolated from each other. For that 
reason, the indigenous people of the Americas had no exposure²and therefore 
no immunity²to the germs and diseases brought by Europeans. Although 
European horses, gunpowder, and metal weapons helped conquer indigenous 
Americans, disease was responsible for the majority of deaths. 
Spanish soldiers, called conquistadores , such as Francisco Pizarro and 
210 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONHernin Cortps, brought smallpox  with them. Smallpox pathogens are spread 
through the respiratory system. When Europeans, who were largely immune 
after millennia of exposure in Afro-Eurasia, had face-to-face contact with 
indigenous populations, they infected these populations with the deadly 
disease. 
As colonists began to settle in the Americas, so did insects, rats, and 
other disease-carrying animals. Measles, influenza, and malaria, in addition to 
smallpox, also killed many native peoples of the Americas. 
The indigenous population of the Americas fell by more than 50  percent 
through disease alone in less than a century. Some American lands lost up to 
0 percent of their original populations. It was one of the greatest population 
disasters in human history.
Source:  Wikimedia Commons
Deadly diseases such as smallpox that came from Europe spread rapidly 
in the Americas.
Animals and Foods
Germ and disease transmissions were only one part of the Columbian 
Exchange. Another major component of the exchange was the sharing of new 
crops and livestock in both directions. Before the exchange began around 1500, 
Mesoamerican peoples consumed very little meat. Although contemporary 
Mexican food sold in the United States is reliant on pork, beef, and cheese, the 
indigenous people of Mexico knew nothing of pigs or cows until Europeans 
introduced them. These animals, along with Mediterranean foods such as 
wheat  and grapes, were introduced to the Western Hemisphere and eventually 
became staples of the American diet. 
Another domesticated animal the Europeans brought to the Americas, the 
horse , transformed the culture of the American Indians living in the Plains 
region. With the arrival of the horse, Indians could hunt buffalo on horseback 
so efficiently²and over a larger region²that they had a surplus of food. That 
211 COLUMBIAN E XCHANGE 211efficiency gave them more time for other pursuits, such as art and spirituality. 
However, competition and even armed conflict among tribes increased, with 
those having the most horses having the most power. 
At the same time, European explorers took back Mesoamerican maize  
corn, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, peppers, and cacao  to their home countries, 
where people started to grow them. Potatoes became so popular in Europe that 
they are often thought of as being native to certain regions, such as Ireland. The 
introduction of these vegetable crops caused tremendous population growth in 
Europe in the 16th and 1th centuries.
Cash Crops and Forced Labor
People themselves also became part of the exchange. The coerced arrival 
of enslaved Africans to the Americas brought biological and demographic 
changes. For example, Africans brought okra and rice with them to the 
Americas. Tobacco and cacao produced on American plantations with forced 
labor were sold to consumers in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. 
Even though slave traders kidnapped millions of Africans from their 
homelands, populations actually grew in Africa during the 16th and 1th 
centuries. That population growth happened because of the nutritious foods 
that were introduced to the continent. Yams and manioc, for example, were 
brought to Africa from Brazil. 
The Lure of Sugar  While Spain and Spanish America profited from 
silver, the Portuguese empire focused its endeavors on agriculture. Brazil, the 
center of the Portuguese-American empire, with its tropical climate and vast 
tracts of land, was perfect for sugarcane  cultivation. As disease had decimated 
the indigenous population, however, there were not enough laborers available 
to do the cultivation. Moreover, many of the people who were forced to labor 
in the sugar fields escaped to the uncharted Brazilian jungle. In response, the 
Portuguese began to import enslaved people from Africa, especially from the 
.ongo .ingdom and cities on the Swahili coast.
Slavery  Sugar’s profitability in European markets dramatically increased 
the number of Africans captured and sold through the transatlantic slave 
trade . Sugar cultivation in Brazil demanded the constant importation of African 
labor. African laborers were so numerous in Brazil that their descendants 
became the majority population of the region. Slave importers sold more than 
0 percent of enslaved Africans to the Caribbean and South America. Only 
about 6 percent went to British North America. Until the mid-1800s, more 
Africans than Europeans went to the Americas.
Enslaved people often died from backbreaking working conditions, poor 
nutrition, lack of adequate shelter, and tropical heat and the diseases that 
accompanied such heat. Sugar plantations processed so much sugar that they 
were referred to as engenhos , which means “engines” in Portuguese. Because 
of the engenhos’ horrible working conditions, plantation owners lost from 5 
to 10 percent of their labor force per year. Slavery is discussed in more detail 
in the Topic ..
212 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONGrowing Cash Crops  The Spanish noticed Portugal’s success with 
plantation agriculture and returned to the Caribbean to pursue cash crop  
cultivation, such as sugar and tobacco. Cash crops are grown for sale rather 
than subsistence. Soon, sugar eclipsed silver as the main moneymaker for 
the European empires. (Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the economic 
practices of Spain in the Americas and Portugal in South, Southwest, and 
Southeast Asia. See Topic .2.
African Presence in the Americas
African cultures were not completely lost once captives arrived in the 
Americas. In fact, during the African Diaspora  (dispersion of Africans out 
of Africa, enslaved Africans retained some aspects of their cultures. 
Languages  With a few exceptions, Africans were not able to transplant 
their languages to the Americas. The captives were forced away from their 
communities, and they soon found themselves on ships among captives from 
all across West Africa and, on some slave ships, from across East Africa as 
well. 
Since captives were taken from myriad African cultural groups, most did 
not share a common language. Understandably, they found it difficult, if not 
impossible, to communicate en route. Because of their linguistic isolation 
on the ships and in the Americas, most Africans lost their languages after a 
generation. In spite of this forced isolation from their cultures, West Africans 
managed to combine European colonizers’ languages English, Spanish, 
French, or Portuguese, for example with parts of their West African 
languages and grammatical patterns to create new languages known broadly 
as creole . 
Because the Caribbean islands had a larger concentration of enslaved 
Africans than did North America, creole languages dominate there even 
today. In the United States, which had a smaller percentage of Africans in 
comparison to the total population, few examples of creole languages exist. 
One notable exception is the Gullah or Geechee language of coastal South 
Carolina and Georgia, in places where enslaved people once composed 5 
percent of the population.
Music  Africans brought their music with them. The syncopated rhythms 
and percussion they used influenced later styles. These include  gospel, blues, 
jazz, rock and roll, hip-hop, rap, samba, reggae, and country music. 
One reason many African descendants maintained their musical 
traditions was because enslaved Africans in America used them as a means 
of survival. They sang tunes from home to help them endure long workdays 
as well as to communicate with other Africans, such as when planning an 
escape. They blended European Christian music with their own religious 
songs, known today as Negro spirituals²essential elements of American 
folk music history. Enslaved people also invented the banjo, which is very 
similar to stringed instruments found in West Africa.
213 COLUMBIAN E XCHANGEFood  In addition to rice and okra, Africans brought their knowledge of 
how to prepare these foods. The dish known as gumbo , popular in the southern 
United States, has roots in African cooking. With influences on language, 
music, food, and much more, African culture has had a profound and lasting 
impact on life in the Americas.

Environmental and Demographic Impact
Contact between Afro-Eurasia and the Americas brought dramatic changes 
to both. Most changes resulted from the Columbian Exchange. In addition, 
though, Europeans used agricultural land more intensively than did American 
Indians. For example, colonists cut down trees to clear areas for planting 
crops, and they created large fields that they cultivated year after year. As 
a result, deforestation and soil depletion became problems in the Americas. 
In addition, Europeans often lived in more densely populated communities 
than did American Indians. This increased the strain on water resources and 
created more concentrated areas of pollution.

 —Anonymous West African griot (storyteller) song
Essential Question:   How were the empires of European states established  
between 1450 to 1750, and what economic and labor 
systems fueled them?
European nations, driven largely by political, religious, and economic 
rivalries, established new maritime empires and administered trading posts in 
Asia and Africa and colonies in the Americas. Asian trade frequently exchanged 
silver and gold for luxury goods such as silk and spices, while newly developed 
colonial economies in the Americas often depended on agriculture. 
American plantations relied on existing labor systems and also introduced 
new labor systems. Among these were indentured servitude , arrangements 
through which servants contracted to work for a specified period of 
years in exchange for passage. Another was chattel slavery , a system in 
which individuals were considered as property to be bought and sold. The 
appalling shock of free people being seized and enslaved is captured in the 
griot storyteller song of the West African Wolof people. The growth of 
the plantation economy increased the demand for enslaved Africans in the 
Americas, leading to significant demographic, social, and cultural changes.
State-Building and Empire Expansion
The explorations of European states see Topic .2 were the foundation of 
maritime empires. States claimed lands and established the basis of an empire 
in the areas they explored. 
219 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS Trading Posts in Africa and Asia
Certain regions of East and West Africa were the targets of European conquest 
during the late 15th century. Portuguese ruler Prince Henry the Navigator was 
keenly interested in navigational technology. See Topic .2. He financed 
expeditions along Africa’s Atlantic Coast and around the Cape of Good Hope, 
exploring African coastal communities before other European powers. 
With the cooperation of local rulers, first Portuguese and then other 
European traders set up trading posts along Africa’s coasts. Some local rulers 
traded enslaved people to the Europeans in exchange for gunpowder and 
cannons, giving those coastal governments a military advantage when battling 
neighboring villages. Some African city-states grew wealthy by selling 
enslaved Africans to Europeans. In particular, the .ingdom of Dahomey grew 
stronger because it raided other villages to enslave people, and sold them to 
European merchants. 
African States  In central West Africa, Portuguese explorers, traders, and 
missionaries made inroads into the .ongo and Benin kingdoms. Artwork from 
these societies bears signs of European as well as African cultural influences. As 
early as the 16th century, Benin artisans incorporated images of the European 
“intruder” into their carvings and sculptures. Yet the expansion of maritime 
trading networks supported the growth of some African states, including the 
Asante  Empire and the Kingdom of the Kongo . Their participation in trade 
led to an increase in their influence.
In 18, Portuguese explorer 9asco da Gama see Topic .1 invaded the 
Swahili city-states of East Africa, most of which were thriving commercial 
centers in the Indian Ocean trade. The Portuguese took over trade in .ilwa, 
Mombasa, and other city-states by sending heavily armed ships and building 
fortresses. This takeover threw the region into a devastating decline.
Japan  Just as European states were expanding their trade networks, Japan 
was sharply restricting its networks. Japan had tolerated the first Portuguese 
and Dutch traders and missionaries in the mid-16th century. Thousands of 
Japanese converted to Christianity. Some Christians, intolerant of other faiths, 
destroyed Buddhist shrines. In response, in 158, the Japanese government 
banned Christian worship services. Over the next 0 years, Japan took 
additional steps to persecute Christians and limit foreign influences. By 
the 160s, the government had expelled nearly all foreigners, banned most 
foreign books, and prohibited Japanese people from traveling ab road. 
For more than two centuries, Japan was partially isolated from the rest of 
the world. They allowed some Dutch merchants to live on a small island in 
Nagasaki harbor, in almost total seclusion. In addition, Japan continued some 
trade with the Chinese, mostly carried out by regional lords who were far from 
the capital city with easy access by sea to .orea, Taiwan, and Okinawa. The 
Japanese thought that they were through with the “uncouth” Europeans. 
However, Europeans and Americans would return in the mid-1th century.
China  After the voyages of =heng He in the 15th century, the Ming 
220 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONDynasty  tried to limit outside influence on China by restricting trade. The 
Ming prohibited private foreign trade, destroyed some dockyards, limited 
the size of ships that could be built, and began reconstructing the Great Wall. 
These changes were part of a broader pattern of conservatism under the Ming 
to undo the influence of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty that ruled China before 
them. For example, the Ming reemphasized the importance of Confucianism 
and reinvigorated the traditional exam system. Many of the limits on trade 
were eventually reversed, and China resumed its important role in global trade. 
European Rivalries on Five Continents
European rivalries fueled by political, economic, and religious motives  shaped 
the expansion of empires. Several powers established trading posts in India: 
• The British East India Company had begun a commercial relationship 
with the Mughal Empire in the 1th century. 
• Portugal controlled a coastal trading post in the southwestern state of 
Goa.
• France controlled Pondicherry, a city in the southeastern state of Tamil 
Nadu. 
During the mid-18th century, France and Great Britain, along with their 
respective allies, competed for power on five continents in the Seven Years’ 
War. Britain’s victory in that war in 16 drove the French out of India. The 
Portuguese remained in India until driven out in the mid-20th century .
British in India  At first, British trading posts in India were typical of those 
established by Europeans in India and elsewhere. The East India Company 
EIC established small forts on the coasts that focused solely on making a 
profit through trade. Limited by the power of India’s Mughal Empire, the EIC 
posts controlled very little territory.
However, the EIC then began to expand. It took advantage of the tensions 
between Muslims and Hindus in India and began to increase its political power 
through treaties with local rulers. With the help of European-trained Indian 
private forces called sepoys, the East India Company moved inland, spreading 
its influence. Ultimately, Britain intervened in India politically and militarily 
to such an extent that it controlled much of the subcontinent.
The British Global Network  The British also set up trading posts in West 
Africa, where the Asante Empire limited their impact. Trading posts in Africa, 
India, and elsewhere paved the way for globalization. Each post became a node, 
an intersection of multiple points serving as a trade center for goods from many 
parts of the world.
Europeans in the Americas
Before the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century, the Aztec Empire  in 
Mexico and the Inca Empire  in South America each included 10 million to 15 
million people. However, the spread of European diseases caused their populations 
to plummet. Both empires collapsed quickly when attacked by Spa nish forces.
221 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS In Mexico, helped by groups that the Aztecs had conquered, Cortps’s forces 
overthrew the Aztec by 1521 and established the colony of New Spain . The 
Spaniards melted down the Aztecs’ treasures and sent the gold back home. They 
destroyed Tenochtitlin and built their own capital, Mexico City , on its ruins.
In the Andes of South America, Francisco Pizarro  and his crew attacked 
the Inca and captured their ruler, Atahualpa . Pizarro offered to release 
Atahualpa if the Inca would fill a large room with gold. The Inca complied. 
However, in 15 the Spanish killed Atahualpa anyway. By 152, the Spaniards 
had completed their conquest of the Inca Empire.
Spain Versus Portugal  In the Treaty of Tordesillas  of 1, Spain and 
Portugal divided the Americas between them. Spain reserved all lands to the 
west of a meridian that went through eastern South America. Portugal reserved 
all lands east of this line. This arrangement put Brazil under Portugal’s rule, 
while Spain claimed the rest of the Americas .

222 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn addition to establishing colonies in Mesoamerica and South America, 
Spain explored other parts of North America north of present-day Mexico. The 
explorer Pedro Menpndez de Avilps established a fort in St. Augustine on the 
east coast of Florida in 1565, which became the oldest continuous settlement 
in what later became the United States. Spain would not be able to control all 
of North America, however, because the French, British, and Dutch later made 
claims and settlements there.
France Versus Britain  France and Britain continued to vie for dominance 
in North America. As British settlers moved into former Dutch territory in 
upper New York, they began to form ties with the powerful Iroquois, who had 
been in conflict with the French over trade issues for decades. The British 
hoped that the Iroquois could frustrate French trade interests. Over time, the 
Iroquois began to realize that the British posed more of a threat than the French. 
In a shift of alliances, the Iroquois and French signed a peace treaty known as 
the Great Peace of Montreal in 101. In the same war in which Britain drove 
France out of India, the British drove France out of Canada as well. The North  
American portion of this war is sometimes called the French and Indian War. 
Continuity and Change in Economic Systems
Although the intensification of trade and the increasing influence of Europeans 
brought some disruption to the Indian Ocean trading networks, on the whole, 
the system absorbed the changes and continued its familiar ways of doing 
business. Merchants in the Indian Ocean networks were used to paying taxes 
and fees to states controlling sea lanes and ports and operated often through

223 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS religious and ethnic ties. They did not use arms to protect their trade, and if the 
fees in one trading center became too high, they were free to move elsewhere. 
Europeans in the Indian Ocean Trade  The Portuguese, however, 
arrived with superior naval forces, religious zeal, and a determination to profit 
from the increasingly diverse products being traded, both from Asia to Europe 
and also within Asia. In addition to porcelain and silk from China, cloth from 
Gujarati weavers in western India, agricultural goods from Java, and spices 
from many places created an abundant market for trade and profit. In contrast 
to the ethnic and religious trading ties developed over hundreds of years, the 
Portuguese used their military superiority to take control of trade, creating a 
string of armed trading posts along the trade routes of the Indian Ocean. In 
150, for example, the Portuguese had a decisive victory in the Battle of Diu  in 
the Arabian Sea over the combined forces of Gujaratis, the Mamluks of Egypt, 
and the =amorin of Calicut with the support of 9enice, Portugal’s European 
competitor.  
Despite the differences between the traditional trading networks and those 
controlled by European powers, merchants in the Indian Ocean trade networks 
continued as before in many ways²paying for the right to use certain ports or 
passageways and developing trade links through traditional networks. 
Spain and Gold in the Americas  The Western European search for profit 
began with Columbus. On his first voyage, he was convinced that gold was 
plentiful on Hispaniola , the name he gave the island now occupied by Haiti 
and the Dominican Republic. But gold was sparse in the Caribbean. Desiring 
to return home with something valuable, Columbus and his crew kidnapped 
Tainos, indigenous peoples, and took them, enslaved, to Spain. 
In the early 1500s, the Spanish established a system called the encomienda  
to gain access to gold and other resources of the Americas. Encomenderos , or 
landowners, compelled indigenous people to work for them in exchange for 
food and shelter, as landowners required of serfs in Europe’s manorial system. 
This coercive labor system was notorious for its brutality. 
The Spanish crown often granted land to conquistadores  as a reward 
for their efforts. The  hacienda system  arose when landowners developed 
agriculture on their lands²wheat, fruit, vegetables, and sugar. They used 
coerced labor to work the fields. Most conquistadores were men and many had 
children with native women. This made the Spanish colonies unlike British 
colonies. 
Silver  While gold did not yield riches for Spanish conquistadores, the 
discovery of silver  in Mexico and Peru revived economic fortunes²for both 
individual explorers and Spain. The use of mercury to separate silver from 
its ore increased the profitability of silver mining. By the end of the 16th 
century, the cities of =acatecas, in Mexico, and especially Potost, in the Andes 
Mountains in modern-day Bolivia, became thriving centers of silver mining. 
For this industry to flourish, Spanish prospectors needed labor. The 
indigenous populations would do all but the most dangerous work in the 
mines. In response, Spanish authorities in Peru transformed the traditional 
224 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIncan mit’a system of labor obligation, in which young men were required to 
devote a certain amount of labor to public works projects, into a coerced labor 
system. 9illages were compelled to send a percentage of their male population 
to do the dangerous work in the mines for a paltry wage.
Silver and Mercantilism  The silver trade not only made individual 
Spanish prospectors wealthy, it also strengthened the Spanish economy. 
European powers at the time were adopting mercantilism , an economic 
system that increased government control of the economy through high tariffs 
and the establishment of colonies , claimed lands settled by immigrants from 
the home country. In the case of Spain, the main purpose of the colonies in the 
Americas was to supply as much gold and silver as possible. 
Another way to increase national wealth, according to the mercantilist 
system, was for a colonizing country to export more than it imported. A 
percentage of overseas silver production went directly to the Spanish crown. 
The empire used this wealth to build up the military and establish foreign trade. 
Continuity and Change in Labor Systems

225 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS During this era, Europeans sought sources of inexpensive labor in the 
Americas. Western European countries such as Portugal, Spain, and England 
were developing their naval technology, but Portugal was ahead of the others. 
In West Africa during the latter part of the 100s, Portuguese trading fleets 
arrived in the .ingdom of the .ongo seeking enslaved people. Initially they 
took the enslaved Africans back to Europe to work as domestic servants. 
Slavery existed in Africa²including the extensive enslavement of 
women as household workers²well before Europeans sought labor for 
their investments in the Americas. For example, in many societies, the entire 
community shared the land. In order to establish positions of wealth and power, 
individuals not only showcased the property they owned, but also showcased 
the enslaved people they owned. 
Europeans were also not the first foreigners to seek out African labor. Arab 
merchants during the Postclassical Era 600±150 often bought enslaved 
people during their travels to the Swahili Coast of East Africa. However, it 
was the Atlantic slave trade that wreaked the most havoc on African societies. 
Connect: Compose a graphic organizer comparing slavery during Sub-Saharan 
Africa’s early colonial period with slavery from 600 to 150. See Topic 2..  
Why Africans?  Several factors converged to make Africa a target for slave 
raids by Europeans after 150. Slavery in Latin America and the Caribbean 
began toward the end of the 16th century, when European conquistadores 
sought fortunes in gold, silver, and sugar. Land was plentiful, but labor to make 
the land profitable was scarce.
Europeans initially forced indigenous people to do the hard labor of mining 
and farming, but European diseases wiped out large portions of these coerced 
laborers. The enslaved indigenous people who survived often escaped bondage 
because, compared to Europeans, they were more familiar with the territory, 
had social networks that could protect them, and could easily camouflage 
themselves within the native population. Repeated efforts to enslave Native 
Americans failed, although other efforts to coerce labor did have some success.
Labor for Plantations  In North America, plantation owners recruited 
European indentured servants  who would come to work, mostly to grow 
tobacco, for a specified period in exchange for passage, room, and board. 
However, most of these people were not used to the backbreaking agricultural 
working conditions and the climate of the Americas. In addition, indentured 
servants were required to work for only about seven years. If they survived 
their indenture, they became free laborers. Thus, landowners did not think of 
indigenous captives and European indentured servants as ideal workers.
Transport of Enslaved Africans to the Americas  Capturing Africans 
for slavery was invariably violent. When African leaders along the coast 
realized that their kingdoms could economically benefit from the slave trade, 
they invaded neighboring societies in a quest for enslaved people to take back 
to the coast. At times, African rulers were also willing to hand over individuals 
from the lower rungs of their own societies, such as prisoners of war, servants, 
or criminals. 
226 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONHowever, .ing Afonso of .ongo understood that slave raids were not 
easily controllable. Though he had initially allowed slave trading in his 
kingdom, he had no intention of giving up his society’s elite to slavery, nor did 
he want .ongo to be depopulated. .ing Afonso also saw that his authority 
was undermined because his subjects were able to trade enslaved people for 
European goods without his involvement. Before the Europeans came, he had 
been able to control all trade in his domain.
The Horrors of the Journey  Captive Africans, swept away from their 
families, were taken to holding pens in West Africa known as barracoons, or 
“slave castles.” The modern country of Ghana has preserved these “Points of 
No Return,” where thousands upon thousands of Africans saw their homeland 
for the last time. Today, people can visit one such holding prison²the so-called 
House of Slaves on Ile de Gorpe Gorpe Island, on the coast of Senegal.
From these holding pens, slave traders next crammed their captives into 
the dank cargo section of a ship, providing them little water, food, or even 
room for movement. The grueling journey across the Atlantic was known as 
the Middle Passage , because it was the middle part of the captives’ journey. 
Many captured Africans attempted rebellions at sea, but most uprisings were 
crushed.  
During the journey to the Americas, which usually took about six weeks, 
up to half of a ship’s captives might die. Over the hundreds of years of the 
Atlantic slave trade, from the early 1500s to the mid-1th century, 10 to 
15 percent of all African captives perished before reaching the Americas.

Demographic, Social, and Cultural Changes  The growth of the 
planation economy and the expansion of slavery in the Americas led to 
significant changes that affected not only countless individual lives but also 
broad patterns of history. The physical migration of captives had significant 
impact on the demographics of both their African homes and the countries of 
their captivity. The exportation of enslaved people that was required to keep 
the population continuing in the country of captivity caused a century-long 
decline in population in African home countries. 
In addition to physical migration, slavery resulted in a migration of status, 
from free person to enslaved, setting up social classes that remain influential 
in post-slavery countries. Further, it disrupted family organization, since 
families were often separated, and more men than women were taken captive. 
Polygyny having more than one wife became more common. With people 
treated as commodities, as chattel slavery, social and family groupings were 
determined more by supply and demand than by the familial bonds of kinship. 
Each region in which slavery was introduced was affected in a unique 
way. However, in all of them, people with African roots helped shape and 
enrich the language and culture of the societies into which they were brought. 
The mixing of ethnic groups resulted in new groups of multiracial people, 
such as mestizos and mulattos.
The Indian Ocean Slave Trade  While most Africans who were enslaved 
and transported to the Americas came from west and central Africa, there 
was a long-running slave trade in the eastern part of the continent. By routes 
overland or in the Indian Ocean, enslaved East Africans were sold to buyers 
in northern Africa, the Middle East, and India. Many were transported to 
the islands off the southeast coast of Africa, such as Madagascar. The trade 
reached its peak in the 18th and 1th centuries.
228 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEnslaved people taken in the Indian Ocean trade suffered different fates 
from those taken across the Atlantic. People from the Indian Ocean region 
were more likely to work in seaports as laborers in the shipping industry and 
as household servants. Some worked as sailors or even soldiers. Living in 
towns or cities, they had some opportunity to develop communities and to 
work alongside free laborers. Those who ended up in Islamic communities 
had certain rights, such as the right to marry. As a result of the Indian Ocean 
slave trade, African words, musical styles, and customs can be found in Oman, 
India, and elsewhere.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“The widespread use of slavery was a systematic Spanish adaptation on 
the north Mexican frontier wherever nomadic Indians were encountered. 
Almost at the very moment that the New Laws 152 made slavery illegal 
in Mesoamerican Mexico, the Mixtyn War 151-152 in Nueva Galicia 
provided the initial reason for retaining the practice legally on the frontier 
for generations. The discovery of silver at =acatecas sealed the fate of 
Spanish-Indian relations not only on the Gran Chichimeca, but throughout 
most of the North. The inevitable resistance by hunter-gatherers to Spanish 
domination, the shortage of labor, and the semiautonomous political power 
wielded by provincial and local authorities insured the survival of slavery and 
encomienda in northern New Spain into the eighteenth century.”

SOURCES
One way to determine the accuracy of historical sources is to identify 
their purpose. However, their stated purpose is not necessarily their 
real purpose. Identifying their intended audience can help pin down the 
purpose of sources. 
Spanish historian, reformer, and later Dominican Friar Bartolomp de 
las Casas c. 18±1566 wrote what he referred to as eyewitness accounts 
of the suffering the Spaniards inflicted on the indigenous people. The 
following passage is from A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies  
published in Seville in 1552. Las Casas had used his observations to help 
pass the so-called New Laws in 152, which outlawed forcing indigenous 
people into slavery and attempted to ban the system of encomienda.
“In the Year 150, the Spaniards sailed to the Islands of St. John 
and Jamaica . . . with the same purpose and design they proposed 
to themselves in the Isle of Hispaniola, perpetrating innumerable 
Robberies and 9illanies as before whereunto they added unheard 
of Cruelties . . . . and Finally by afflicting and harassing them with 
un-exampled Oppressions and torments in the Mines, they spoiled and 
unpeopled this Contrey >country@ of these Innocents. These two Isles 
containing six hundred thousand at least, though at this day there are 
scarce two hundred men to be found in either of them, the remainder 
perishing without the knowledge of Christian Faith or Sacrament.”
Answer the following questions to help understand how the inten ded 
audience can reveal an author’s purpose. 
1. For what audience did Las Casas write these accounts" What does 
that audience suggest about his purpose for writing" 
2. Suppose these accounts had been written by a visitor from a 
competing European power eager to remove the Spanish from 
the Americas and take over the land for itself. What might be that 
author’s audience and purpose"
3. Read the historical perspectives on the brutality of the Spanis h on

Essential Question:   What economic strategies did maritime empires use 
to increase their power, and how did the developing 
empires affect political, economic,  religious,  and 
cultural dynamics?
Maritime sea-based empires transformed commerce from local, small-
scale trading, mostly based on barter, to large-scale international trade using 
gold and silver. These empires employed new economic models, such as joint-
stock companies, through which investors financed trade by buying shares in 
corporations such as the East India Company, supporting increased trade in 
Asia. New ocean trade routes were opened, aiding the rise of this extended 
global economy. The Atlantic trading system involved the movement of 
labor²including enslaved people²and the mixing of African, American, 
and European cultures and peoples, with all groups contributing to a cultural 
synthesis. Silver, sugar, and slavery were the keys to the development of these 
mercantilist empires.
Economic Strategies
In the 1th century, Europeans generally measured the wealth of a country in 
how much gold and silver it had in its coffers. To achieve this wealth, countries 
used economic strategies designed to sell as many goods as they could to other 
countries in order to obtain maximum amounts of gold and silver. To keep 
their wealth, countries would also spend as little of their precious metals as 
possible on goods from other countries. 
The accumulation of capital , material wealth available to produce more 
wealth, in Western Europe grew as entrepreneurs entered long-distance 
markets. Capital changed hands from entrepreneurs to laborers, putting 
laborers in a better position to become consumers²and even investors, as the 
above quote suggests. Despite restrictions by the Church, lending money at 
high rates of interest became commonplace. Actual wealth also increased with 
gold and silver from the Western Hemisphere.
233 MARITIME EM PIRES DEVELOPCommercial Revolution   
The transformation to a trade-based economy using gold and silver is known as 
the Commercial Revolution . The Commercial Revolution affected all regions 
of the world and resulted from four key factors: the development of European 
overseas colonies the opening of new ocean trade routes population growth 
and inflation, caused partly by the pressure of the increasing population and 
partly by the increased amount of gold and silver that was mined and put in 
circulation. The high rate of inflation, or general rise in prices, in the 16th and 
early 1th century is called the Price Revolution .
Aiding the rise of this extended global economy was the formation of 
joint-stock companies , owned by investors who bought stock or shares in 
them. People invested capital in such companies and shared both the profits 
and the risks of exploration and trading ventures. Offering limited liability , 
the principle that an investor was not responsible for a company’s debts or 
other liabilities beyond the amount of an investment, made investing safer .  
The developing European middle class had capital to invest from 
successful businesses in their home countries. They also had money with which 
to purchase imported luxuries. The Dutch, English, and French all developed 
joint-stock companies in the 1th century, including the British  East India 
Company  in 1600 and the Dutch East India Company  in 1602. In Spain and 
Portugal, however, the government did most of the investing itself through 
grants to certain explorers. Joint-stock companies were a driving force behind 
the development of maritime empires as they allowed continued exploration 
as well as ventures to colonize and develop the resources of distant lands with 
limited risk to investors. 
Commerce and Finance  The Dutch were long the commercial 
middlemen of Europe, having set up and maintained trade routes to Latin 
America, North America, South Africa, and Indonesia. Dutch ships were faster 
and lighter than those of their 
rivals for most of the 1th 
century, giving them an early 
trade advantage. The Dutch  
East India Company was also 
highly successful as a joint-stock 
company. It made enormous 
profits in the Spice Islands and 
Southeast Asia.

234 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONPioneers in finance, the Dutch had a stock exchange as early as 1602.  
By 160, the Bank of Amsterdam traded currency internationally. The Dutch 
standard of living was the highest in Europe as such goods as diamonds, 
linen, pottery, and tulip bulbs passed through the hands of Dutch traders.
France and England were not so fortunate. Early in the 18th century, both 
fell victim to speculative financial schemes. .nown as financial bubbles, the 
schemes were based on the sale of shares to investors who were promised a 
certain return on their investment. After a frenzy of buying that drove up the 
price of shares, the bubble burst and investors lost huge amounts of money, 
sending many into bankruptcy and inflicting wide damage to the economy .
Triangular Trade  The Europeans’ desire for enslaved workers in the 
Americas coupled with Portugal’s “discovery” of West Africa meant that Africa 
became the source for new labor. Enslaved Africans became part of a complex 
Atlantic trading system known as the triangular trade , because voyages often 
had three segments. A ship might carry European manufactured goods such 
as firearms to West Africa, and from there transport enslaved Africans to the 
Americas, and then load up with sugar or tobacco to take to Europe. Sugar was 
the most profitable good from the Americas. By the 100s, Caribbean sugar 
production and rum made from sugar were financing fortunes in Britain, and 
to a lesser extent, in France and the Netherlands.

235 MARITIME EM PIRES DEVELOPRivalries for the Indian Ocean Trade
After Europeans stumbled on the Americas, trade over the Atlantic Ocean 
became significant. However, states continued to vie for control of trade 
routes on the Indian Ocean as well. The Portuguese soundly defeated a 
combined Muslim and 9enetian force in a naval battle in the Arabian Sea 
in 150 see Topic . over controlling trade. They met a different fate, 
though, when they tried to conquer Moroccan forces in a battle on land in 
158. 
Its coffers depleted after the victory, Morocco looked inland to capture 
the riches of the Songhai .ingdom, despite the prohibition of waging war on 
another Muslim state. With thousands of soldiers, camels, and horses, as well 
as eight cannons and other firearms, Moroccan forces traveled months to reach 
Songhai. In 150, in a battle near Gao, the Songhai²despite their greater 
number of fighters²were overcome by the force of firearms. The empire 
crumbled. The Spanish and Portuguese soon overtook much of this territory.
Change and Continuities in Trade Networks
The trading networks involved a new global circulation of goods, wealth, and 
labor. Silver from the Spanish colonies in the Americas flowed to Asia, where  
Asians were eager to exchange their goods²silks, porcelain, steel products²
for silver. Asian goods were eagerly purchased in the Atlantic markets. 
New Monopolies  One way these patterns of trade were maintained was 
through monopolies  chartered by European rulers. Monopolies granted certain 
merchants²usually through a joint-stock company²or the government itself 
the exclusive right to trade. For example, the Spanish government established 
a monopoly first over all the domestic tobacco grown and then over all the 
tobacco grown in its American colonies. The profits from this monopoly 
greatly enriched the Spanish government. The income from tobacco in Spain 
made up about one-third of total revenues. 
Ongoing Regional Markets  At the same time, traditional regional 
markets continued to flourish in Afro-Eurasia. However, improved shipping 
offered merchants the opportunity to increase their volume of products. The 
increasing output of peasant and artisan labor²wool and linen from Western 
Europe, cotton from India, and silk from China²exchanged hands in port 
cities with global connections. 
(σecWsRfWKe$WlDnWic6lDYe7UDGe
The Atlantic slave trade greatly weakened several West African kingdoms, 
such as .ongo. The loss of so many people slowed population growth. Trade 
competition led to violence among their societies, but also made African 
slave-raiding kingdoms economically dependent on goods from Europe. 
Such societies were slow to develop more complex economies in which they 
produced their own goods. Thus, the slave trade set the stage for European 
conquest and imperialism of the late 1th century. See Topic 6.2.
236 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEconomically, African societies that conducted slave raids, such as the 
Dahomey  and the Oyo, became richer from selling their captives to Europeans. 
This trade also had political effects, because when a society such as the Dahomey 
exchanged enslaved people for guns, its raiders easily took advantage of rival 
societies that had no firearms. Without firearms, neighboring groups could not 
fight off  slave raids, so raiding societies became even richer and more fortified 
with firearms. Intergroup warfare thus became more common and bloodier as 
a result of the slave trade.
Slavery and Gender  Those most affected by the slave trade were the 
peoples and civilizations of West Africa in present-day Ghana and Benin, from 
which most Africans were kidnapped or sold. Gender distributions in those 
regions became severely imbalanced, because more than two-thirds of those 
taken were males. The resulting predominance of women prompted a rise in 
polygyny  the taking of more than one wife and forced women to assume 
duties that had traditionally been men’s jobs. 
Impact of New Foods  While the Atlantic trading system weakened 
Africa in many ways, it also ultimately spurred population growth through 
an improved diet. The Columbian Exchange introduced new crops to the 
continent, such as the American crops maize, peanuts, and manioc also known 
as yucca or cassava, which became staples in the African diet.
Political and Cultural Changes for Indigenous Peoples
Earlier land-based empires, such as those of the Romans, Muslims, and 
Mongols, all grappled with how to deal with conquered people’s traditions 
and cultures. These empires either allowed traditions to exist or they tried 
to graft their ways onto those of their subjects. European empires in the 
Americas stood in stark contrast to these land-based empires. The Spanish and 
Portuguese empires managed to erase the basic social structures and many of 
the cultural traditions of the indigenous Americans within a century of when 
the first European explorers arrived. Europeans’ actions nearly depopulated 
the Americas. 
Political Changes: Colonial Administration  Indigenous political 
structures in Latin America were soon replaced by Spanish and Portuguese 
colonial administrations. Spanish royalty appointed viceroys  to act as 
administrators and representatives of the Spanish crown. To keep these viceroys 
from operating independently of the crown, Spain established audiencias , or 
royal courts, to which Spanish settlers could appeal viceroys’ decisions or 
policies. Slow transportation and communication networks between Europe 
and the Americas, however, made it difficult for the Spanish crown to exercise 
direct control over New Spain. As a result, the Spanish throne did not focus on 
colonial affairs in the Western Hemisphere.
Cultural Changes  The indigenous peoples of the Americas lost a great 
deal of their culture and history at the hands of conquerors. Conquistadors, 
such as Cortps in Mexico, ordered the burning of native books, which were 
237 MARITIME EM PIRES DEVELOPthought to be unholy. Thus, very few original accounts written in Nahuatl, the 
language of the Aztec, exist today.
The scarcity of firsthand accounts from indigenous peoples has shaped 
how historians view this period. For example, because the Spanish burned 
nearly all Aztec documents, most of the information about the Aztec comes 
from documents that were written by Spanish conquistadores and priests after 
the conquest. The authors’ biases and lack of familiarity with Nahuatl limits 
the value of these sources. However, some sources are considered reliable. 
For example, in 155, a Spanish priest named Bernardino de Sahag~n began 
compiling the Florentine Codex, one of the most widely cited sources about 
Aztec life before conquest. A codex is a type of book.
Spanish and Portuguese conquerors transplanted their own languages and 
religion into the Americas. The remnants of this cultural interaction are present 
today. Although indigenous languages thrive in certain regions²in Guatemala 
and in the mountains of Mexico, for example²Spanish predominates through 
much of Latin America, and Brazilians overwhelmingly speak Portuguese.
By 150, those born in America of Spanish origin, or creoles , enjoyed 
political dominance in New Spain. They soon began clamoring for independence 
from the Spanish throne. Connect: Create a two-column chart comparing the

The increase and intensity of newly established global connections between  
hemispheres extended the reach of existing religions. In some areas, the new 
connections contributed to the development of syncretic belief systems and 
practices. In other areas, the connections contributed to religious conflicts. 
Syncretic Belief Systems in the Americas
African religions in the Americas provide powerful examples of religious 
syncretism,  or the combining of different religious beliefs and practices. 
Africans melded aspects of Christianity, usually Roman Catholicism, with 
their West African religious traditions, such as drumming, dancing, and a 
belief in spirits that could take over and act through a person:
• Santería means “the way of the saints.” Originally an African faith, it 
became popular in Cuba and then traveled throughout Latin America 
and to North America.
• Vodun means “spirit” or “deity.” This belief system originated with 
African peoples of Dahomey, .ongo, and Yoruba who were enslaved 
and living in Saint-Domingue, which is now Haiti.
• Candomblé means “dance to honor the gods.” It is a combination 
of Yoruba, Fon, and Bantu beliefs from different parts of Africa. It 
developed in Brazil.
238 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEnslaved Africans in the United States also laid the roots for the African 
American church, a hybrid of Christianity and African spiritual traditions that 
remains one of the oldest and most stable institutions in African American 
communities.
Islam  About 1 in 10 of the enslaved Africans practiced Islam. While some 
of the men who sailed with Columbus may have been Muslims, these enslaved 
Africans became the first significant presence of Islam in the Americas.
Religion in Latin America  Several Catholic religious orders in Europe, 
such as the Dominicans, Jesuits, and Franciscans, sent missionaries to Latin 
America to convert people to Christianity. The missionaries were so successful 
that today most Latin Americans are Roman Catholic Christians. In recent 
decades, Protestant denominations have begun to gain members. 
Numerous examples of religious syncretism originated in the Spanish 
colonies. Catholic saints’ days that coincided with days honored by indigenous 
people were especially celebrated. In Mexico, a cult developed around the 
dark-complexioned Virgin of Guadalupe , who was revered for her ability to 
perform miracles. 
Global Interactions and Religious Conflicts
Syncretic religions also developed in Afro-Eurasia as global interactions 
intensified. Sufism, for example, with its focus on personal salvation, helped 
spread Islam and may have influenced Sikhism, which blended Muslim and 
Hindu belief systems. The Mughal leader Akbar see Topic .2 tried to 
mediate conflicts between Muslims and Hindus under his control.
Religion also played a role in conflicts as global interactions increased. 
The split between Sunni and Shi’a Muslims worsened conflicts between the 
Ottoman and Safavid empires. See Topic .1. The split between Catholicism 
and Protestantism, and between official state religions such as Anglicanism 
and other Protestant sects, helped drive the settlement of North America as 
people sought freedom to worship as they saw fit.

Essential Question:   How did the development of state power result in 
external and internal challenges in the period between 
1450 and 1750?
As empires developed and changed, many social, political, and economic 
groups resisted state expansion through a variety of challenges to state power. 
Some of these revolts occurred in the home of the empire. For example, the 
Fronde  civil disturbances in France between 168 and 165 attempted to curb 
growing royal power. 
Other disturbances took place within colonies. For instance, Metacom’s 
War  165±168, also called .ing Philip’s War, was in part a result of English 
colonists using underhanded tactics such as that described in the quote above 
in their continuing pressure to control Native American lands. Several powers 
sought to create empires in the 16th and 1th centuries. They fought with one 
another and with indigenous peoples. 
Resistance to Portugal in Africa
By the 1th century, the Dutch and the English had pushed the Portuguese out 
of South Asia. See Topic 1.. The Portuguese looked to Africa, where it had 
carried out slave raids since the 15th century, to build a colony. In 162, Ana 
Nzinga  became ruler of Ndongo  in south-central Africa present-day Angola. 
In addition to the slave raids by Portugal, other African peoples were attacking 
Ndongo. In exchange for protection from neighboring powers and an end to 
Portugal’s raids, Nzinga became an ally of Portugal. Nzinga was baptized 
as Christian, with the governor of the Portuguese colony as her godfather. 
However, the alliance broke down. Nzinga and her people fled west, taking 
over the state of Matamba . She then incited a rebellion in Ndongo, allied 
with the Dutch, and offered freedom in Matamba to enslaved Africans. Nzinga 
ruled for decades, building Matamba into an economically strong state.
244 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONLocal Resistance in Russia
In contrast to the Portuguese empire, pressures on state power came from 
within Russia, not outside of it. While conditions had improved for serfs see 
Topic 1.6 in Western Europe by the 1th century, the same was not true for the 
serfs in Russia. Wars during the 1th and 15th centuries weakened the central 
government and increased the power of the nobility. 
As demand for grain increased, nobles imposed harsh conditions on 
serfs. But Russian serfs had long been oppressed. First the Mongols and later 
the Russian princes collected heavy tribute and taxes for services such as 
protection or to support the government’s army from the peasants. As a result, 
the peasants’ debts increased, and over time more peasants lost their lands and 
were forced into serfdom. 
Serfdom, Power, and Control  The practice of serfdom benefitted the 
government because it kept the peasants under control, regulated by the 
nobility. Serfdom also benefitted the landowners because it provided free 
labor. Although townspeople were also controlled and not permitted to move 
their businesses freely to other cities, the serfs were practically enslaved, their 
labor bought and sold along with the lands of their owners.
As Russian territory expanded west to the Baltic and east to Siberia, the 
institution of serfdom expanded with it. An agricultural state, Russia kept serfs 
tied to the land long after the practice had ended, practically if not legally, in

245 INTERNA L AND EXTERNA L CHALLENGES TO STATE POWER 245Western Europe. For example, Elizabeth I freed the last remaining serfs in 
England in 15. In contrast, a law of 16 chained Russian serfs to the lands 
where they were born and ensured their service to their landlords, who could 
buy and sell them and administer punishments. The village communes, called 
mirs, also controlled even the small landholders among the peasants. 
Cossacks and Peasant Rebellions  Southwest of Moscow, near the Black 
Sea, peasants who were skilled fighters lived on the grassy, treeless steppes . 
Many were runaway serfs who lived in small groups, influenced by the ways 
of the neighboring nomadic descendants of the Mongols. These fierce Cossack 
warriors were sometimes at odds with the central, autocratic government of 
the tsars. However, these fiercely independent warriors could also be hired as 
mercenaries to defend “Mother Russia” against Swedish, Tartar, and Ottoman 
forces. The Cossacks were thus important in Russia’s expansion to the Ural 
Mountains and farther east into Siberia.
A Cossack known as Yemelyan Pugachev  began a peasant rebellion 
against Catherine the Great in 1 for giving the nobility power over the serfs 
on their lands in exchange for political loyalty, leaving the peasants without ties 
or recourse to the state. Falsely claiming to be Catherine’s murdered husband, 
Peter III, Pugachev gathered a following of discontented peasants, people 
from different ethnic groups, and fellow Cossacks. At one point, these groups 
controlled the territory between the 9 olga River and the Urals. Within a year, 
though, the Russian army captured Pugachev and the Russian government 
executed him. The Pugachev Rebellion  caused Catherine to increase her 
oppression of the peasants in return for the support of the nobles to help her 
avoid future revolts.
Rebellion in South Asia
In the 16th and 1th centuries, the Mughal empire controlled much of what is 
now India and Pakistan. See Topic .1. The Mughals centralized government 
and spread Persian art and culture as well as Islam. However, much of the 
population remained Hindu. The Maratha²a Hindu warrior group²fought 
the Mughals in a series of battles from 1680±10. They created the Hindu 
Maratha Empire.  It lasted until 1818, effectively ending the Mughal rule of 
India.
Revolts in the Spanish Empire 
Spain also experienced rebellions within its territories. The Pueblo Revolt  
took place in 1680 against the Spanish in what is now New Mexico. The 
Pueblo and Apache, two indigenous groups, fought colonizers who were 
trying to force religious conversions. The indigenous people killed about 00 
Spaniards, drove the rest out of the area, and destroyed churches. The Spanish

Although Spain colonized much of the Caribbean, England’s power there 
grew stronger. England defeated Spanish colonists and took control of much 
of Jamaica in 1655. Enslaved people in the Caribbean and former Spanish 
territories in the Americas fought to gain freedom in what were known as 
Maroon wars 128±10 and 15±16. 
Maroons were descendants of Africas who had escaped slavery in Jamaica. 
They escaped their owners and formed independent settlements. Queen 
Nanny , herself had escaped slavery, united all the maroons of the island. 
Jamaicans later recognized her as a national hero.
Slave revolts were common in the Americas, especially in those locations 
where enslaved Africans outnumbered free Europeans. The first recorded slave 
revolt in what is now the United States was the Gloucester County Rebellion  
in 9irginia in 166. In this rebellion, enslaved Africans and white indentured 
servants conspired together to demand their freedom from the governor. 
Authorities found out about their plot, ambushed them, and arrested them. 
Metacom’s War, discussed earlier in this topic, was the final major effort 
of the indigenous people to drive the British from New England. The war 
spread throughout New England and resulted in the destruction of 12 towns. 
Some Native American groups, including the Mohegan  and Pequot , sided 
with the English. Although Native American peoples continued to live in the 
region, the war ended with the subjugation of the Wampanoag people to the 
English colonists. 
Struggles for power took place within England as well. In 1685, James II  
became king. James was Catholic, and his anti-Protestant measures enraged 
many English people. A group of nobles invited William of Orange , who was 
James’s nephew and son-in-law, to invade England with an army and become 
the new king. He agreed, landing in England in 1688. James fled to France. In 
168, William and his wife Mary II  James’s daughter began their joint rule 
of England. Both William and Mary were Protestant, and the English throne 
remained in Protestant hands after that.
English people called this revolt the Glorious Revolution  or the Bloodless 
Revolution. It strengthened the power of Parliament, which passed a law 
forbidding Catholics to rule England. That revolution took place without much 
violence, but religious tensions continued in England and throughout much 
of the world. Connect: Create a graphic organizer of the rebellions that were

249 INTERNA L AND EXTERNA L CHALLENGES TO STATE POWER SHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 was one of the most significant events in New 
Mexico history. But 1680 was not the first time New Mexico’s Pueblos had 
attempted to rebel against the Spanish government. Beginning with the 
Acoma Revolt of 15, Spanish intolerance of Pueblo religious practices 
and a persistent abuse of Pueblo labor had prompted several revolts against 
the Spanish in the seventeenth century. These uprisings, however, were 
discovered and ruthlessly crushed before they could grow into broader 
action. . . . 
The Spanish remained at El Paso until 162. For a while it appeared that 
the revolt had indeed succeeded. Popay and the other Pueblo leaders began 
a systematic eradication of all signs of Christianity and Spanish material 
culture. Everyone was to bathe in a ritual which washed away any trace 
of baptism, and Christian marriages were invalidated until reconfirmed by 
native tradition. . . . 
But it was easier to order the eradication of all vestiges of the Spanish 
presence than to accomplish it. Many items of material culture which had 
been introduced by the Spanish²iron tools, sheep, cattle, and fruit trees, 
for example²had become an integral part of Pueblo life. A few individuals, 
deeply influenced by the teachings of the Franciscans, rescued and hid the 
sacred objects of their adopted religion to await the eventual return of the 
Spanish friars.”

Understanding the internal and external challenges to state power from 
150 to 150 requires understanding the broader context in which they 
developed. This understanding should go beyond simple identification, 
such as “The context in which internal and external challenges to state 
power took place was the widespread expansion of empires.” Instead, 
work to explain how or why the context specifically relates to the 
internal and external challenges to state power. That is, ask, “What 
specifically about the context sheds light on the challenges"” To answer 
that question, complete the following activities.
First, review the four features of the historical concept of em pire 
outlined on the last page of Topic .1. For each bullet point, explain 
in a sentence or two how that context relates to the internal o r  
external challenges to state power you read about in this topic . 
Next, copy the timeline on page 18 on separate paper, leaving 
plenty of room between dates. Then review this topic, adding into 
the timeline the rebellions, revolts, and wars that arose as ch allenges

Changing Social Hierarchies
>e    order the said 1ews and 1ewesses of our kingdoms to depart and  
ne]er to return or come back to them or to any of them 
 —Ferdinand and Isabella, Edict of the Expulsion of the Jews, 1492
Essential Question:   How were social categories, roles, and practices 
maintained or changed from 1450 to 1750?
As societies faced rebellions from outside and within, social hierarchies 
began to develop and transform. In Europe, the treatment of Jews showed 
that majorities treated non-majority ethnic groups in different ways. Jews had 
been expelled from England 120, France 1, and, as stated above, Spain 
12. The Ottoman Empire, however, provided a safe haven for Jews fleeing 
discrimination in Europe.
Throughout the world, civilizations developed distinctive social hierarchies. 
Different groups²including royalty, nobility, landowners, scholars, and 
soldiers²sought power and influence. In some societies, merchants and 
artisans began to form a middle class. And peasants, serfs, poor people, and 
enslaved people often struggled to stay alive. 
Many states created policies that discriminated against some groups 
based on religion, ethnicity, or social class. For example, Huguenots²French 
Protestants in the predominantly Catholic country²suffered great persecution, 
and many fled to other European countries or to colonies. States also supported 
the formation of elite classes, including the boyars in Russia and the nobility in 
Europe. These elites both supported ruling power and challenged it.
Social Classes and Minorities in Gunpowder Empires
Tension between the military elite and absolutist rulers existed in three Islamic 
empires: the Ottoman Turkey, the Safavids Iran, and the Mughals India. 
They are called gunpowder empires because they succeeded militarily by using 
guns and cannons when they first became widely available. See Topic .1.
Ottoman Society  The Ottoman social system was built around a warrior 
aristocracy that soon began to compete for positions in the bureaucracy with 
the ulama , who were scholars and experts in Islamic law. Within the military, 
the Janissaries gained power and prestige. See Topic .2. Ultimately, the 
Janissaries tried to mount coups against the sultans. 
252 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONAs sultans became increasingly ineffective and incapable, strong advisors 
called viziers  gained influential positions in government, where they spoke for 
the sultan. However, the sultan still had considerable powers. These included 
timar,  a system in which the sultan granted land or tax revenues to those he 
favored. The sultan also used timar to reward soldiers and keep them loyal.
Treatment of Religious Minorities  One reason for the success of the 
Ottoman Empire was its relative tolerance toward Jews and Christians. After 
the Spanish monarch exiled Jews from his kingdom in 12, Sultan Mehmed 
II invited them to settle in Istanbul. Many did. Some Jews became court 
physicians and diplomats. Others contributed to the literary community and 
might have brought the printing press to the Ottoman Empire. While they 
were allowed to worship, they did not have full equality:
• They were permitted to live only in specified areas of the cities. 
• They paid a tax called a jizya that was required of all non-Muslims in 
the empire. 
• They could not hold top positions in the empire, which were reserved 
for Muslims. 
Religious Toleration in the Mughal Empire  The Mughal Empire in 
what is now India began in 1526. Probably its greatest emperor was Akbar 
the Great  ruled 1556±1605, remembered for his military successes and his 
administrative achievements. To help keep his huge, fractious empire together, 
Akbar, like Ottoman rulers, was tolerant of all religions. He ended the jizya 
tax. He gave grants of land and money to Hindus and Muslims, provided funds 
to build a Catholic church, and supported Sikhism. For more on Akbar’s 
religious toleration, see Topic ..
Women in the Ottoman Empire  Women also played social and political 
roles at court. Many wives and concubines of the sultan tried to promote 
their own children as likely heirs to the throne. This practice led to “harem 
politics,” a reference to the harem , a residence where a powerful man’s wives 
and concubines lived. 
One woman, Roxelana , became unusually powerful in the Ottoman 
Empire. When she was a young girl, Crimean raiders stole Roxelana from 
her home in Eastern Europe and sold her into slavery in the Ottoman Empire. 
She was forced to convert to Islam and entered the harem of Suleiman the 
Magnificent, sultan of the empire. Suleiman was notable for his military and 
administrative skill. Suleiman married Roxelana, which was highly unusual. 
She went from being enslaved to commissioning ambitious public works 
projects. 
Roxelana’s son succeeded Suleiman. During the son’s reign, viziers 
complained about a “sultanate of the women.” They believed members of the 
harem had too much influence on politics. Roxelana’s rise showed that it was 
possible²though rare²for people at this time to attain a different social class.Source : Titian, La Sultana Rossa,  c. 1550. John and Mable Ringling Museum

Roxelana became famous for her power as an Ottoman leader.
253 CHANGING SOCIA L HIERARC HIES253Other Social Classes  Merchants and artisans formed a small middle 
class in the empire. Below the middle class were the peasants, who were 
usually poor—particularly because they had to pay tribute to the government 
to help support the 
Ottoman armies. Below 
the peasants were the 
enslaved. They came from 
many areas as the Ottoman 
armies penetrated Central 
and Eastern Europe, 
capturing prisoners of war 
in Ukraine and elsewhere. 
Barbary pirates , those 
who plied the seas near 
North Africa along the 
Barbary Coast (named 
for the Berbers who 
lived there captured 
other Europeans in the 
Mediterranean and then 
sold them to the sultan 
or other high-ranking 
officials. Some people 
were impressed , or 
forced into service, in the 
navy as enslaved galley 
workers. As many as 
one million people were 
impressed between the 16th and 1th centuries.

China’s Qing Dynasty  lasted from 16 until 112. Under this dynasty, the 
Manchu  people from Manchuria ruled over the majority Han Chinese and 
other ethnic groups. Like the Mongols some 00 years earlier, the Manchu 
were ethnically and culturally distinct from the people they ruled. However, 
they were less tolerant than the Mongol leaders, and they resolved to make 
their culture dominant in China. 
Like the Mongols, the Qing put their own people in the top positions of 
government. Also like the Mongols, the Qing maintained continuity with some 
traditional Chinese practices. For example, they maintained the Chinese civil 
service exams and bureaucracy. They recruited Han Chinese to work under or 
alongside Manchus. In time, some²but not all²Chinese came to accept the 
Qing Dynasty as legitimate rulers of China.

254 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONto wear Hanfu, or traditional Han clothing, all men were required to wear their 
hair in queues , the braided pigtail style of the Manchu. This policy was a test 
of loyalty for the Manchu, but it was also a humiliating reminder of the way 
Qing authority challenged traditional Confucian values. A man who refused to 
wear his hair in a queue could be executed. 
The Qing used Han Chinese defectors to carry out massacres against 
Han who refused to assimilate to Qing practices. These defectors played 
a massive role in the Qing conquest of China. Han Chinese General 
Li Chengdong , for example, orchestrated three separate massacres in the 
city of Jaiding within one month. By the end of those four weeks, there 
was hardly a person left alive in the city. Later, Han Chinese defector 
Liu Liangzuo  massacred the entire population of Jiangyin, killing between 
,000 and 100,000 people.
European Hierarchies
Like states in South and East Asia, European states also had a social 
hierarchy. In Europe the top level was royalty²members of a royal family. 
The aristocracy or nobility was the next highest level. Nobles were usually 
wealthy landowners. Nearly every state in Europe had laws that recognized 
a class of nobles and granted them special privileges. The nobility made up a 
small minority of the population but owned most of the land. They maintained 
their power through a system in which lands and titles passed down from one 
generation to the next through a system of inheritance.
The Nobility Makes Gains  In the Netherlands and England, the nobility 
held power and took an active part in the government. Dutch landowners 
provided the stable support for local provincial government. In England, large 
landowners controlled Parliament. However, the landowners had to contend 
with radical religious sects and the middle class, which were two growing 
segments of the social order.
The Nobility Faces Losses  Nobles struggled for power with royalty, the 
emerging middle class of merchants and skilled workers, the priestly class, and 
the common people. A failed uprising in France in the mid-1600s convinced 
Louis XIV  that he must keep power from the common people and the nobility. 
The nobility also faced criticism from writers and thinkers of the time. The 
English statesman Thomas More wrote this about the nobility: “Living in 
idleness and luxury without doing society any good no longer satisfies them 
they have to do positive evil.”
Power of Royalty over Nobility  Gunpowder, cannons, and other 
technological advances allowed rulers to destroy nobles’ fortresses and seize 
their lands. Many rulers believed they deserved absolute power. Louis ;I9 is 
famous for saying, “I am the state.” However, Frederick of Prussia saw things 
differently. He declared, “I am the first servant of the state.” (Connect: Trace 
the changes in social hierarchy from feudal Europe to the 1th century. See 
Topic 1.6.  
255 CHANGING SOCIA L HIERARC HIESGrowing Acceptance of Jews  Jews began to have a larger role in 
many countries starting in the 1th century. Their expulsion from Spain, by 
Ferdinand and Isabella, was particularly significant because so many Jews 
lived there. Many resettled in areas around the Mediterranean Sea, in northern 
Africa or the Middle East. Since the Hebrew word for Spain is Sepharad,  Jews 
who trace their heritage back to Spain became known as Sephardic Jews . In 
contrast, Jews from central and eastern Europe became known as Ashkenazi 
Jews . Jewish scholars once used the term Ashkenazi to refer to Germany. 
Under the influence of the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment, 
prejudices against Jews declined somewhat. Jews began to move more freely 
in Europe. They became particularly important in banking and commerce. 
The Netherlands was especially tolerant of religious dissent, and the Jewish 
minority faced less discrimination there than in most of Europe. Many Jews 
hoped the centuries of discrimination they had confronted were over . 
Russian Social Classes
Moscow
s social hierarchy continued that of .ievan Rus in the 11th century. 
The noble landowning class, the boyars , topped the social pyramid. Below 
them were the merchants. Last and most numerous were the peasants, who 
gradually sank into debt and. They became serfs,  peasants who received a plot 
of land and protection from a noble. In return, they were bound to that land 
and had little personal freedom. If the noble sold their land, control of the serfs 
went with it. Though not technically enslaved, serfs led very hard lives.
The boyar class experienced tensions with the rulers similar to the tensions 
between nobles and rulers in Western Europe. Boyars of Novgorod opposed the 
expansionist policies of Ivan IV , known as “Ivan the Terrible” for murdering 
his own son, among other crimes. After Ivan
s forces defeated Novgorod, Ivan 
confiscated the lands of his boyar opponents. He forced them and their families 
to move to Moscow, where he could keep them under surveillance.
Political and Economic Elites in the Americas
Social structures in the Americas changed drastically during this period 
because of the arrival of Europeans, the importation of African slave labor, and 
outbreaks of disease that killed tens of millions. The combination of European 
settlers, imported Africans, and the conquered indigenous populations led to 
the development of a new social hierarchy based on race and ancestry. Skin 
color became a signifier of power and status in many parts of the Americas 
and, in fact, in all European colonies. Racial and ethnic background defined 
social status in a formal way in the Spanish and Portuguese empires in the 
Western Hemisphere for centuries following the Europeans’ arrival.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“Nowadays, some 185 years after most of the Latin American nations 
obtained their independence, none of the Latin governments consider race 
to be an issue. All of these governments are firmly convinced that the racial 
caste system of colonial times has totally disappeared. This firmly held 
conviction is, however, not shared by academics and ordinary citizens who 
have noticed the distinct racial stratification of the Latin American societies. 
For these dissenters, the prevailing racial economic hierarchy and the easily 
uncovered attitudes that consider the dark-skinned unattractive and inferior 
clearly indicate that the racial caste system continues to operate.
Today’s racial caste system is, of course, not nearly as rigid as it was in 
colonial times. But the fact that it has survived 185 years of social, economic, 
and political advances implies that this system is deeply embedded in the 
Latin societies. Hence, it must have relevant social, economic, and political 
effects.”

259 CHANGING SOCIA L HIERARC HIESTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:  EXPLAIN THE PURPOSES  OF EVIDENCE
Evidence in an argument can serve a variety of purposes. Its most common 
purpose is to support the claim at the heart of an argument. Specific facts 
or examples that demonstrate the truth of a more general assertion in the 
thesis fulfill this purpose. Evidence can also modify a claim by providing 
facts, examples, or reasoning that show that parts of the claim are true but 
that other parts are not. Evidence can also refute, or disprove, a claim. 
Evidence that serves this purpose provides facts, examples, or reasoning 
that support an alternative or opposing claim. 
Consider the claim in bold type below in this argument: When 
.ing Ferdinand expelled the Jews from Spain in 12, he provided for a 
three-month period for them to ready themselves for departure. The .ing 
promised that the state would “take and receive them under our Security, 
protection, and royal safeguard” and “that during the said time, no one 
shall harm them, nor injure them, no wrong shall be done to them against 
justice.” Although the King’s promises sound respectful of the Jews’ 
rights to safety, the very act of expulsion marked them as inferior 
and exposed them to relentless harms.  
The statements below are from an account written by an Italian Jew in 
15 Internet Jewish History Source Book. For each statement,  deter -
mine whether it could best be used to support, modify, or refute the claim 
above.
1. “ When the edict of expulsion became known. . .  vessels came 
from Genoa to the Spanish harbors to carry away the Jews. The 
crews of these vessels. . . acted maliciously and meanly toward 
the Jews, robbed them, and delivered some of them to the famous 
pirate of that time who was called the Corsair of Genoa. To those 
who escaped and arrived at Genoa the people of the city showed 
themselves merciless, and oppressed and robbed them, and the 
cruelty of their wicked hearts went so far that they took the i nfants 
from the mothers. . . . .”
2. “ One hundred and twenty thousand >Jews@ went to Portugal, 
according to a compact which a prominent man. . . had made with 
the .ing of Portugal >who@ allowed them to stay in his country 
six months. . . . >A@fter the six months had elapsed he made sl aves 
of all >who@ remained in his country, and banished seven hundred 
children to a remote island to settle it, and all of them died. ”“
3. “ Many ships with Jews, especially from Sicily, went to the city 
of Naples on the coast. The .ing of this country was friendly 
to the Jews, received them all, and was merciful towards them, 
and he helped them with money. The Jews that were at Naples 
supplied them with food .  . . and sent around to the other parts of 
260 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONItaly to collect money to sustain them. . . . >But@ all this wa s not 
enough. Some of them died by famine, others sold their children  to 
Christians to sustain their life. Finally, a plague broke out among 
them, spread to Naples, and very many of them died, so that the 
living wearied of burying the dead.”

Essential Question:   How did economic developments from 1450 to 1750 
affect social structures  over time?
By 150, most of the world was integrated within a system of economic, 
political, and cultural connections. Better technology enabled the Eastern and 
Western hemispheres to connect. Meanwhile, Western European maritime 
powers created trading empires in the Indian Ocean trading network and in the 
Americas. Religions and other cultural practices continued to spread as a result 
of these interactions, but they also were transformed as new or syncretic forms 
developed. Coercive labor systems continued to exist in this newly connected 
world. However, new forms developed as new economic systems sought to 
exploit natural resources and to generate wealth for Western European nations.
Transoceanic Travel and Trade
The most significant change to the global economy in this period was the 
integration of the Western Hemisphere into the global trading network. This 
change resulted from Western European states wanting to find a sea route to 
Asia. They borrowed and developed technology that made ocean travel easier:
• astronomical charts
• astrolabe
• compass
• magnetic compass
• lateen sail 
• carrack
• caravel
• fluyt
262 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe result was the Columbian Exchange: a biological exchange of crops, 
animals, people, and diseases between the Eastern and Western Hemisphere. 
The Columbian Exchange had wide-ranging effects on both hemispheres.
The Atlantic System  The Columbian Exchange also caused the 
development of a transoceanic trading network called the Atlantic System. 
The Atlantic System was made up of the regions of Western Europe, Western 
Africa, and the Americas and involved the movement of goods and people 
among those regions. Columbian Exchange forever changed who grew what 
foods where and how they grew them. It also unleashed deadly diseases 
on populations that had no immunity to them. In addition, it led to massive 
migrations, many of them forced, and new social structures.
As people migrated or were forced to migrate within the Atlantic System, 
cultural changes occurred. For instance, religion spread and often created 
syncretic belief systems and practices.

Economic Changes
European transoceanic voyages resulted in the integration of the Western 
Hemisphere within the global trading network. This integration had profound 
effects on the global economy. Maritime trading empires emerged, led by the 
Portuguese and followed by the Dutch and the English. As a result, Europeans 
established trading ports and cities along the coasts of Africa and the Indian 
Ocean. This brought Europeans into contact²and often into conflict²with 
existing merchant networks. 
One consequence of this contact and conflict was that Europeans came to 
dominate global trade at the expense of Arab, Indian, and Chinese merchants. 
263 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE FROM C. 1450 TO C. 1750 263Europeans, then, made considerable profits from transporting the goods from 
one region to another. Connect: Identify the differences between the Atlantic 
System and trade on the Indian Ocean. See Topic 2..  
Colonies in the Americas  In contrast to the trading empires in the Indian 
Ocean, Spain created an empire in the Americas. Soon Portugal, England, 
France, and the Netherlands established colonies there. The discovery of large  
deposits of silver in Spain’s colonies helped further integrate Europeans into 
the global economy. Asian markets and merchants, especially in China, desired 
silver. Shipments of silver to Asia from the Americas became a regular feature 
of the global trade network and helped finance the increasing volume of trade 
between Asia and Europe. Some experts estimate that the amount of silver in 
the global economy tripled in the 16th century.
Mercantilism and Capitalism  European rulers soon came to see the 
benefits of encouraging the expansion of trade, as the wealth that could be 
amassed was considerable. To ensure they participated in wealth accumulation 
from trade, many European monarchs devised mercantilist economic policies 
that would provide the ruler with a steady stream of income. While expanded 
international trade continued to be an important goal of European monarchs, 
mercantilism eventually gave way to capitalism as the predominant economic 
system in the new global economy. Investors formed joint-stock companies, 
also called chartered companies, so they could share the risks and rewards of 
global trading opportunities. 
(σecWsRfWKe1eZ*lREDl(cRnRPy
The new global flow of goods and profits produced some significant benefits. 
The flow of wealth into Europe helped to expand the middle class and provided 
the capital that would lead to the Industrial Revolution. However, the huge 
amounts of gold and silver flowing into Spain and China from the Americas 
also produced negative economic effects. In particular, the increase in the 
quantity of money in circulation caused inflation.

264 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONAs a result of the activities of European merchants, regional markets in 
Europe, Africa, and Asia continued to prosper. Funding for the arts increased 
as merchants and governments used their rising profits and revenue to sponsor 
artists and authors. Some rulers used their sponsorship of the arts to produce 
art and architecture that helped to legitimize their rule. Other art symbolized 
the growing importance of global trade.
'ePDnGfRU/DERU,nWensiðes
The new global economy also brought about significant disruptions. The 
Columbian Exchange and the Atlantic System caused a demographic 
shift in Africa as the Atlantic slave trade intensified. Slavers captured and 
sold millions of African men. These African men ended up on American 
plantations, producing cash crops that included sugar, cotton, and tobacco. 
As a result, some African communities experienced a gender imbalance. 
Africa’s population declined because of the Atlantic slave trade. Eventually, 
the population increased as people grew new crops, such as manioc.
Traditional forced labor systems, such as serfdom, continued in areas 
of Afro-Eurasia. However, other coerced labor systems developed in the 
Americas as a result of the Columbian Exchange and the Atlantic System, 
in addition to the chattel slavery of the Atlantic slave trade. Many European 
settlers first arrived in the Americas as indentured servants, contracted to work 
for a period of time before they were free to pursue other jobs or occupations. 
The encomienda and hacienda systems, as well as the adoption of the Inca 
mit’a system, are examples of other coerced labor systems in the Spanish 
American colonies. 
New Social Structures  As Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans 
coexisted in the new American colonies, the social structures of the Americas 
changed. New social systems appeared that were based on racial or ethnic 
identity. This division led to a rigid and hierarchial society, with white 
Europeans or Americans of European descent possessing the majority of wealth 
and political power. A new subculture appeared that consisted of people who 
were of mixed European and African heritage. Societal conflicts eventually led 
to revolutions.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   HOW HARSH WERE THE SPANIS H?
After the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, Spanish conquistadors 
created a vast colonial empire in the Americas. In 1552, the Dominican friar 
Bartolomp de Las Casas described the greed, ruthlessness, and cruelty that 
Spanish officials inflicted on native populations. Ever since, historians have 
debated the accuracy of his observations. 
Origins of the Black Legend  Writing in 11, Spanish historian 
Juliin Judertas labeled this belief in the evils of Spanish rule as the Black 
Legend. He argued that during the 16th and 1th centuries, other Europeans 
were jealous of Spanish wealth and power. As a result, they were prepared 
to believe the worst about Spain’s rule. Judertas suggested that historians 
focused so much on cruelty that they ignored the positive achievements of 
Spanish colonialism. 
Debating the Black Legend  Besides jealousy, another factor affecting 
how historians viewed Spain was religion. During the centuries of struggle 
between Protestants and Catholics, the Black Legend fit with the negative 
views many Protestants had toward Catholics. In the United States, where 
Protestants dominated the writing of history in the 1th century, acceptance 
of the Black Legend was common. 
In the first half of the 20th century, many Spanish historians shared the 
perspective of Judertas. Their works reflected the intense national pride that 
many Spaniards felt about their past. In defending Spanish colonization, 
they developed what their critics called a White Legend to counter the Black 
Legend. 
Emphasis on Reform  One American historian active in the debate over 
Spanish colonization was Lewis Hanke. He argued against the Black Legend 
by trying to show that Las Casas was just one of many Spanish reformers. 
Through the efforts of these reformers, Hanke argued, the Spanish empire 
was “one of the greatest attempts the world has seen to make Christian 
precepts >rules@ prevail in the relations between peoples.” 
Defenders of the Black Legend thought Hanke had exaggerated the 
strength of Las Casas and the reformers, thereby making the Spanish look 
better than they were. Others emphasized that despite any attempts at reform, 
what actually happened was extraordinarily harsh.
The Global Context  In recent years, historians taking a more global 
approach to history have compared colonial empires more systematically than 
did previous historians. While they have noted differences among Europeans 
in the Americas, they have found widespread examples of brutality. Whether 
the Spanish were any worse than other Europeans remains hard to determine.

After analyzing the task and developing questions you need to answer 
to complete it see page 18, the next step in writing a long essay 
is to gather and organize your evidence. Gathering evidence  relies 
on recall²how much you remember from your reading and other 
studies. Organizing evidence  requires the skills of seeing patterns and 
connections and using historical reasoning. 
Suppose you are answering this long essay question: “Develop an 
argument that evaluates the extent to which continuity or change over 
time characterized the participation of China in the expanding global 
trade networks from 150 to 150.” Gather the evidence by writing down 
everything you know about China’s role in global trade networks between 
150 and 150. Answer the questions you developed in the application 
activity on page 18. Your essay might include the following: 
• Emperor .angxi relaxed the limits on foreigners, opening 
Chinese ports to European merchants and missionaries.
• China exported silk, porcelain, spice, and tea and imported little.
• Confucian philosophy preferred farmers who produced food 
over merchants who transferred food from one person to 
another.
• Confucian philosophers respected the Jesuits.
• China regarded its culture as superior to those of other countries.
• With the Silk Roads and Indian Ocean trade networks pouring 
gold and silver into China for their goods, the Chinese felt 
wealthy and in no need of foreign commodities.
After writing everything you can remember, organize your evidence. 
Review your notes, looking for patterns related to the task. Which pieces 
of evidence represent a continuity" Which represent a change" Make a 
simple chart to place the evidence in the correct category. Then evaluate 
the extent to which change outweighed continuity or vice versa. 
Application: On a separate sheet of paper, expand on the evidence 
you recall about China’s participation in global trade networks between

UNIT 5:   Revolutions from  
c. 1750 to c. 1900
Understand the Context
Between 1750 and 1900, people continued becoming more integrated into a 
global trade network. New technology, from machinery for spinning thread 
to locomotives to telegraphs to steel mills, fostered closer integration. The 
increased use of machinery in producing goods, a shift known as the Industrial 
Revolution, caused manufacturing output to skyrocket. It began in Great 
Britain and affected all of the world by 2000. The Industrial Revolution set the 
stage for dramatic changes in international relations, politics, and demography.
Foreign Power  As global trade increased, industrializing countries 
protected the access of their businesses to resources for manufacturing and 
to markets for selling goods by establishing control over overseas lands. 
However, these lands often rebelled against foreign domination. Among the 
first to rebel were the United States and Haiti in the 18th century .
A New Type of Country  Industrialization provided the background for 
reorganizing states. Before the 1800s, most people lived in large multi-ethnic 
empires or small homogenous kingdoms. After 1800, people increasingly 
lived in nation-states, a country in which everyone shared the same culture, 
and everyone who shared a culture lived in the same country. Breaking up 
empires and combining kingdoms to create nation-states frequently led to war.
Movements of People  Industrialization was also the context for massive 
human migrations. As demand for labor shifted, millions moved in search of 
work. For example, many Europeans voluntarily resettled in the Americas 
and Australia. South Asians were coerced into taking jobs in southern Africa. 
Millions of Africans were enslaved and taken forcibly to the Americas. These 
movements diversified communities across the world.

THE ENLIG HTENMENT 275
2755.1
The Enlightenment
Except our own thoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power.
—René Descartes (1596 -1650)
Essential Question:   How did the Enlightenment shape the intellectual and 
ideological thinRing that affected reform and revolution 
after 1750?
As empires expanded and trade routes led to more interactions, intellectuals 
in the 1th and 18th centuries such as Descartes began to emphasize reason 
over tradition and individualism over community values. These shifts were 
called the Enlightenment.  The ideals of this movement, such as individualism, 
freedom, and self-determination, challenged the roles of monarchs and church 
leaders and planted the seeds of revolution in the United States, France, and 
around the world.
An Age of New Ideas
Growing out of the Scientific Revolution and the humanism of the Renaissance, 
Enlightenment thought was optimistic. Many writers believed that applying 
reason to natural laws would result in progress. While not denying the existence 
of God, they emphasized human accomplishments in understanding the natural 
world. Such beliefs led to the conclusion that natural laws governed the social 
and political spheres as well. While traditional religion did not disappear, it 
became less pervasive.
New ideas emerged about how to improve society. Schools of thought 
including socialism  and liberalism  arose, giving rise to the period being called 
“the Age of Isms.” Opposing socialism and liberalism were the currents of 
conservatism , particularly popular among the European ruling class.  (All of 
these “isms” are defined later in this topic.
The clash between new ideas and old political structures led to revolutions 
that often had two aims: independence from imperial powers and constitutional 
representation. The breakup of empires and the emergence of new forms of 
government often followed. These developed out of the concept of nationalism , 
a feeling of intense loyalty to others who share one’s language and culture. The 
idea that people who share a culture should also live in an independent nation-
state threatened to destroy all of Europe’s multiethnic empires.
276 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONNew Ideas and Their Roots
In the 17th century, Francis Bacon  emphasized empirical methods of scientific 
inquiry. Empiricism  is the belief that knowledge comes from sensed  
experience, from what you observe through your experience, including through 
experiments. Rather than relying on reasoning about principles provided by 
tradition or religion, Bacon based his conclusions on his observation of natural 
data.
Hobbes and Locke  In the same century, philosophers Thomas Hobbes 
(author of Leviathan , 1651 and John Locke (author of Two Treatises of 
Government, 160  viewed political life as the result of a social contract . 
Hobbes argued that people’s natural state was to live in a bleak world in which 
life was “nasty, brutish, and short.” However, by agreeing to a social contract, 
they gave up some rights to a strong central government in return for law and 
order. 
Locke, on the other hand, argued that the social contract implied the right, 
even the responsibility, of citizens to revolt against unjust government. Locke 
thought that people had natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of property. 
Another of Locke’s influential ideas is found in  An Essay Concerning Human 
Understanding 160, in which he proposed that a child was born with a 
mind like a “blank slate” ( tabula rasa  waiting to be filled with knowledge. 
In a world in which most people believed that an individual’s intelligence, 
personality, and fate were heavily determined by their ancestry, Locke’s 
emphasis on environment and education in shaping people was radical.
The Philosophes  In the 18th century, a new group of thinkers and writers 
who came to be called the philosophes  explored social, political, and economic 
theories in new ways. In doing so, they popularized concepts that they felt 
followed rationally upon those of the scientific thinkers of the 1th century. 
Taking their name from the French word  philosophe “philosopher” , these 
writers included Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin  Franklin from America, 
Adam Smith from Scotland, and several French thinkers
Of particular importance to writers of the new constitutions in France and 
America in the 18th and 1th centuries were the ideas of Baron Montesquieu . 
His famous work The Spirit of Laws 18 praised the British government’s 
use of checks on power because it had a Parliament. Montesquieu thus 
influenced the American system, which adopted his ideas by separating its 
executive branch the president from its legislative branch Congress and 
both from its third branch the federal judiciary. 
Francois-Marie Arouet, pen name Voltaire , is perhaps best known for his 
social satire Candide  162. He was famous during his lifetime for his wit and 
for his advocacy of civil liberties. Exiled for three years due to a conflict with 
a member of the French aristocracy, V oltaire lived in England long enough 
to develop an appreciation for its constitutional monarchy and a regard for 
civil rights. He brought these ideas back to France, where he campaigned for 
277 THE ENLIG HTENMENTreligious liberty and judicial reform. His correspondence with heads of state 
such as Catherine the Great of Russia and Frederick the Great of Prussia and 
his extensive writings, including articles in Diderot’s Encyclopedia,  are still 
quoted today. His idea of religious liberty influenced the U.S. Constitution.
A contemporary of V oltaire was the writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau , who 
expanded on the idea of the social contract as it had passed down through the 
work of Hobbes and Locke. One of Rousseau’s early works was Emile, or On 
Education  162 in which he laid out his ideas on child-rearing and education. 
A later work, The Social Contract  162, presented the concept of the General 
Will of a population and the obligation of a sovereign to carry out that General 
Will. An optimist who believed that society could improve, Rousseau inspired 
many revolutionaries of the late 18th century.
Adam Smith  One of the most influential thinkers of the Enlightenment 
was Adam Smith . In his book The Wealth of Nations 16, Smith responded 
to mercantilism by calling for freer trade. While Smith did support some 
government regulations and saw the benefits of taxes, he generally advocated 
for laissez-faire, a 
French phrase for “leave 
alone.” This approach 
meant that governments 
should reduce their 
intervention in economic 
decisions. Smith believed 
that if businesses and 
consumers were allowed 
to make choices in 
their own interests, the 
“invisible hand” of the 
market would guide them 
to make choices beneficial 
for society. His ideas 
provided a foundation for 
capitalism,  an economic 
system in which the 
means of production, 
such as factories and 
natural resources, are 
privately owned and are 
operated for profit. (Connect: Create a chart or Venn diagram that compares 
and contrasts mercantilism and the free market. See Topics . and .5.
Deism  The Enlightenment’s emphasis on reason led some thinkers 
to reexamine the relationship of humans to God. Some adopted Deism , the 
belief that a divinity simply set natural laws in motion. Deists compared the 
divinity to a watchmaker who makes a watch but does not interfere in its day-
to-day workings. Deists believed these laws could be best understood through

278 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONscientific inquiry rather than study of the Bible. Despite their unorthodox 
ideas, many Deists viewed regular church attendance as an important social 
obligation and a way people received moral guidance. 
Thomas Paine , never one to shrink from conflict, was militant in his 
defense of Deism in the book The Age of Reason 1. Paine’s previous work, 
Common Sense  16, made him popular in America for advocating liberty 
from Britain, but his anti-church writings damaged much of his popularity .

The Age of New Ideas Continues
In Europe and America, Enlightenment thinkers reacted to the social ills 
caused by increasing urbanization and industrialization. Poverty in the cities 
increased. Poor workers lived in slums without proper sanitation and without 
political representation. Various writers proposed solutions to the observable 
problems. Some wanted more government regulations and programs, and 
many Christians called for greater private charity. But some conservatives 
blamed the poor themselves and called on them to change. Conservatism is a 
belief in traditional institutions, favoring reliance on practical experience over 
ideological theories, such as that of human perfectability.
Utopian Socialism  The economic and political theory of socialism  refers 
to a system of public or direct worker ownership of the means of production 
such as the mills to make cloth or the machinery and land needed to mine 
coal. Various branches of socialism developed in the 19th century, providing 
alternative visions of the social and economic future. Those who felt that society 
could be channeled in positive directions by setting up ideal communities were 
often called utopian socialists :
279 THE ENLIG HTENMENT• Henri de Saint-Simon,  of France, believed that scientists and 
engineers, working together with businesses, could operate clean, 
efficient, beautiful places to work that produced things useful to 
society. He also advocated for public works that would provide 
employment. He proposed building the Suez Canal in Egypt, a project 
that the French government later undertook and which opened in 186.
• Charles Fourier  identified some 810 passions that, when encouraged, 
would make work more enjoyable and workers less tired. Like other 
utopian socialists, Fourier believed that a fundamental principle of 
utopia was harmonious living in communities rather than the class 
struggle that was basic to the thinking of Karl Marx.
• Robert Owen  was born in Great Britain. He established intentional 
communities—small societies governed by the principles of utopian 
socialism²in New Lanark, Scotland, and New Harmony, Indiana. He 
believed in education for children who worked, communal ownership 
of property, and community rules to govern work, education, and 
leisure time.
In the later 19th century, socialist groups such as the Fabian Society 
formed in England. The Fabians were gradual socialists: they favored 
reforming society by parliamentary means. Writers H. G. Wells, Virginia 
Woolf, and George Bernard Shaw were prominent Fabians.  By the mid-20th 
century, socialist principles would influence most of Western Europe. 
Classical Liberalism  Others advocated classical liberalism , a belief 
in natural rights, constitutional government, laissez-faire economics, and 
reduced spending on armies and established churches.  Most classical liberals 
were professionals, writers, or academics. In Britain they pursued changes in 
Parliament to reflect changing population patterns so that new industrial cities 
would have equal parliamentary representation. Classical liberals backed the 
Reform Bills of 182, 186, and 188, all of which broadened male suf frage. 
Feminism  This period saw the emergence of the movement for women’s 
rights and equality based on Enlightenment ideas. The French writer Olympe 
de Gouges fought for these rights in the era of the French Revolution. In 
18, France had adopted the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the 
Male Citizen,” a pioneering document in the history of human rights. In 
1791, de Gouges published a “Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the 
Female Citizen,” to point out that women’s rights had not been addressed. 
In 1792 in England, the pioneering writer Mary Wollstonecraft  published 
A Vindication of the Rights of Women. In it, she argued that females should 
receive the same education as males. Universal education, she argued, would 
prepare women to participate in political and professional society, enabling 
them to support themselves rather than relying on men. Wollstonecraft’s 
ultimate goal was for women to gain the same rights and abilities as men 
through the application of reason. Women won the full right to vote in 128.
280 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn 188 in Seneca Falls, New York, activists gathered to promote women’s 
rights and suffrage the ability to vote. In the convention’s “Declaration of 
Sentiments,” organizers Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton declared, 
“All men and women are created equal.” They demanded women deserved the 
right to vote and hold office, hold property and manage their own incomes, and 
be the legal guardians of their children. The Seneca Falls Convention was a 
landmark in the history of the women’s rights movement.
Abolitionism  Reform movements to provide rights and equality extended 
to freedom for enslaved people and the end of serfdom. Abolitionism , the 
movement to end the Atlantic slave trade and free all enslaved people, gained 
followers in the 18th century. Slave trading was banned earlier than slavery 
itself. The first states to ban the slave trade were with Denmark in 180, 
Great Britain in 180, and the United States in 1808. In most countries, the 
slave system depended on a steady supply of new enslaved people in order 
to function. As a result, as soon as the slave trade stopped, slavery began to 
decline. In most parts of the Americas, slavery was abolished within 0 years 
of the end of the slave trade. The United States was the rare country where 
numbers increased after the importation of enslaved people ended. The last 
country in the Americas to end slavery was Brazil, in 1888. 
The End of Serfdom  Serfdom in Europe had been declining as the 
economy changed from agrarian to industrial. Peasant revolts pushed leaders 
toward reform. Queen Elizabeth I abolished serfdom in 1574. The French 
government abolished all feudal rights of the nobility in 18. Alexander II

281 THE ENLIG HTENMENTof Russia abolished serfdom in 1861. The Russian emancipation of 2 million 
serfs was the largest single emancipation of people in bondage in human 
history. 
Zionism  Yet another “ism” in the late 1th century was the emergence of 
Zionism —the desire of Jews to reestablish an independent homeland where 
their ancestors had lived in the Middle East. After centuries of battling anti-
Semitism , hostility toward Jews, and pogroms—violent attacks against Jewish 
communities—many European Jews had concluded that living in peace and 
security was not a realistic hope. To be safe, Jews needed to control their own 
land. Leading the movement was an Austro-Hungarian Jew,  Theodor Herzl . 
Support for =ionism increased after a scandal in France known as the 
Dreyfus Affair . In 18, Alfred Dreyfus, a military officer who was Jewish, 
was convicted of treason against the French government. However, the 
conviction had been based on forged documents by people promoting anti-
Semitism. Dreyfus was ultimately pardoned after time in prison, but the case 
illustrated how widespread anti-Semitism was in France, one of the countries 
where Jews seemed least oppressed. 
=ionists faced many obstacles. The land they wanted was controlled by 
the Ottoman Empire, and Palestinian Arabs were already living in the region. 
Both the Ottomans and the Palestinians were predominantly Muslim, which 
added a religious aspect to the conflict. However, the =ionist movement grew 
in strength until 18, when the modern country of Israel was founded.

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:  DESCRI BE AN ARGUMENT 
The Enlightenment was a time of lively debate and argument centered 
on the human capacity to reason—a key aspect of argument itself. 
Arguments can use reason in a variety of ways. For example, deductive 
reasoning, sometimes called “top-down reasoning,” builds an argument 
from a general proposition All men are mortal to a more specific 
premise Socrates is a man and finally to a conclusion that must be true 
if the other premises are true Therefore, Socrates is mortal. Inductive, 
or “bottom up” reasoning, in contrast, uses specific facts to form an 
uncertain generalization (Chicago has never received snow on any day in 
August, so it’s likely that no future August day will see snow. Arguments 
284 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONcan also use reasoning by analogy, a form of inductive reasoning, to 
assert that two things known to be alike in some ways are likely similar 
in other unknown ways (Human mammals experience a wide range of 
emotions, so it is likely nonhuman mammals experience a similar range. 
Most arguments use several different kinds of reasoning to develop their 
ideas fully. Knowing how to describe the structure of an argument and the 
types of reasoning can help you evaluate the strength of its conclusions.

read the e[cerpt from the dedicatory letter for 0ary :ollstonecraft¶s 
A Vindication of the Rights of Women  that responds to 7alleyrand¶s 
position. Describe the argument and types of reasoning in each 
excerpt, and give reasons for your description.  
“Let us bring up women, not to aspire to advantages which the Constitution 
denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees 
them . . . Men are destined to live on the stage of the world. A public 
education suits them. . . . The paternal home is better for the education of 
women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, 
than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.” —Talleyrand  
“Contending for the rights of women, my main argument is built on this 
simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become 
the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge . . . . If 
children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, 
their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an 
orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering 
the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation 
of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations. . . .>I@ 
earnestly wish to see woman placed in a station in which she would 
advance, instead of retarding, the progress of those glorious principles 
that give a substance to morality. My opinion, indeed, respecting the 
rights and duties of woman, seems to flow so naturally from these 
simple principles, that I think it scarcely possible, but that some of the 
enlarged minds who formed your admirable constitution, will coincide 
with me.” ²Mary Wollstonecraft 12
REFLECT ON THE TOPIC ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. In one to three paragraphs, explain how the Enlightenment shaped the 
ideological and intellectual thinking that affected reform and revolution 
in the period after 1750.
NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONS 285
5.2
Nationalism and Revolutions
Every nation gets the government it deserves.
—1oseph de 4aistre (1753-1821)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the various 
revolutions in the period from 1750 to 1900, including 
influences of the Enlightenment and emerging 
nationalism?
The age of new ideas led to political and philosophical conflicts. Like the 
English statesman Edmund Burke, the French thinker Joseph de Maistre was 
a conservative who went against the tide of Enlightenment thinking. In the 
view of conservative thinkers such as Burke and Maistre, revolutions were 
bloody, disruptive, and unlikely to yield positive results. However, try as 
conservatives might to quell revolutionary change, the desire of common 
people for constitutional government and democratic practices erupted in 
revolutions throughout the 19th century. And many nations did, indeed, get a 
new form of government that responded to the new wave of thinking with its 
key ideals: progress, reason, and natural law.
The American Revolution
The ideals that inspired the American Revolution had their roots in European 
Enlightenment philosophy. The economic ideas of the physiocrats also played 
a part in the American Revolution, providing a defense of free market ideas 
in opposition to English mercantilism. Additionally, the American colonists 
had become increasingly independent politically. Colonial legislatures were 
making decisions usually made by Parliament. Moreover, great distances 
separated the colonists from Parliament and the king in London. With economic 
and political desires for independence grew a new social spirit. 
Declaration of Independence  On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of 
Independence expressed the philosophy behind the colonists’ fight against 
British rule. In the document, Thomas Jefferson picked up the phrase 
“unalienable rights” from John Locke. For Jefferson, these rights were to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In the war that followed, the colonists 
triumphed in 18 with crucial help from Britain’s long-time enemy, France.
286 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe New Zealand Wars
New =ealand had been occupied by Polynesian people, the Maori, since at least 
the mid-1200s. In the period between their arrival and the arrival of Europeans 
the Maori developed a rich culture. The people were divided into individual 
tribes, or iwi, who sometimes engaged in warfare. After colonization by the 
British, made official by annexation of New =ealand in 180, English control 
over Maori affairs increased, as did pressure for their land. These issues resulted 
in a series of wars between the Maori and British collectively known as the 
New =ealand Wars. Though the Maori tribes fought together, developing a 
sense of Maori nationalism, by 182, the British had won. 
The French Revolution
In France in the 180s, revolutionary ideals took on their own spin, summarized 
in the slogan liberté, égalité, et fraternité liberty, equality, and fraternity. 
These ideas, which struck many people as radical, were popularized throughout 
Europe in the writings of the philosophes . 
Economic Woes  However, additional causes led to the French Revolution. 
France had long spent more than it was taking in, partly to finance a series of 
wars. Among this spending was the economic aid that France supplied the 
Americans in their revolution. To address its financial situation, the French 
government called a meeting of the Estates-General in spring 18. Three 
sectors of society, or estates, made up the Estates-General: the clergy religious 
officials, the nobility, and the commoners. However, inequality in voting 
caused the commoners who made up  percent of French society to break 
away and form a new body, the National Assembly. 
The Revolution Begins  In the early days of the French Revolution, 
moderates such as Marquis de Lafayette seemed to be on the point of establishing 
a constitutional monarchy. The National Assembly began meeting in Paris, but 
then the King threatened to arrest the leaders. Angry crowds rioted in Paris and 
elsewhere in France. On July 1, 18, a crowd in Paris stormed the Bastille , 
a former prison that symbolized the abuses of the monarchy and the corrupt 
aristocracy. In the French countryside, peasants rose up against nobles, even 
burning some manor houses. Some royal officials fled France. The king was 
forced to accept a new government with a National Assembly in charge.
The date July 1, 18, became French Independence Day. The most 
permanent changes were enacted early in the Revolution—the abolition 
of feudalism and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man , a 
statement declaring basic human rights. Louis XVI and the nobility refused 
to accept the limited monarchy, which led to dissatisfaction among radical 
groups such as the Jacobins and inspired the establishment of the First French 
Republic in 1792. The Reign of Terror , a period during which the government 
executed thousands of opponents of the revolution, including the king and 
queen, sprang from the Jacobins. After a period of turmoil and war, the brilliant 
general Napoleon Bonaparte became emperor of France in 180.
287 NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONS 287The Haitian Revolution 
At the end of the 18th century, revolutionary forces were also at work in the 
rich French sugar and coffee colony of Haiti  on the western third of the island 
of St. Domingue, also known as Hispaniola. Enslaved Africans began the 
rebellion by killing their masters and burning their homes. They were soon 
joined by Maroons,  individuals who had already escaped slavery in Haiti. 
The examples of the recent American and French revolutions led formerly 
enslaved Toussaint L’Ouverture  to join the revolts in 11 and then to lead 
a general rebellion against slavery. Besides being well-read in Enlightenment 
thought, L’Ouverture proved to be a capable general. His army of enslaved 
Africans and Maroons established an independent government and played the 
French, Spanish, and British against each other. 
Haiti  In 1801, after taking control of the territory that would become the 
independent country of Haiti, L’Ouverture produced a constitution that granted 
equality and citizenship to all residents. He also declared himself governor 
for life. Haiti next enacted land reform: plantations were divided up, with the 
lands being distributed among formerly enslaved and free black people.
L’Ouverture worked with the French but they betrayed and imprisoned 
him. He died in France in 180. But he had cemented the abolition of slavery 
in Haiti, which he set on the road to independence from France.
In 180, L’Ouverture’s successor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, orchestrated 
a Haitian declaration of permanent independence. Thus, Haiti became the 
first country in Latin America to 
win its independence and the first 
black-led country in the Western 
Hemisphere. It was also the only 
country to become permanently 
independent as a result of a slave 
uprising.
Comparing the Haitian and 
French Revolutions  Both the 
Haitian and French revolutions 
grew out of the Enlightenment’s 
insistence that men had natural 
rights as citizens, and that legal 
restraints were limiting the 
freedom of people by forcing 
them into various estates (social 
classes. However, in the case of 
the Haitians, the restraints were 
more severe—the rebellion was 
led by people who had no rights 
at all.

288 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONCreole Revolutions in Latin America
On the Latin American mainland, revolutionary ideals were taken up by 
creoles . Born of European ancestry in the Americas, the creoles were well 
educated and aware of the ideas behind the revolutions in North America and 
France. They considered themselves superior to the mestizos , who were born 
of European and Indian parents. Colonists who were born in Spain or Portugal, 
known as peninsulares , felt superior to everyone. At the bottom of the social 
ladder were the enslaved Africans the indigenous population, and mulattoes , 
those of African and either European or indigenous ancestry. Some of these 
social distinctions remain today.
There were many reasons for discontent in the colonies, each of which 
encouraged some people to desire independence from Spain:
• Many creoles were wealthy owners of estates, mines, or businesses. 
They opposed Spain’s mercantilism, which required colonists to buy 
manufactured goods only from Spain and sell products only to Spain. 
• Creoles wanted more political power. They resented that Spain tended 
to give important government jobs in the colonies to peninsulares. 
• Mestizos wanted political power and a share of the wealth of the 
colonies. Many had jobs in the towns or worked in the mines or on the 
estates of the peninsulares and creoles.
The Bolívar Revolutions  In many parts of South America, the desire for 
independence from Spain grew among the creole class. Fearing the masses, 
the creoles refused the support of mestizos, indigenous people, and mulattos 
people of mixed African and European heritage. The creoles had seen 
the result in Haiti of a slave uprising as well as the excesses of the French 
Revolution during the Reign of Terror. Some creoles, such as Simón Bolívar , 
continued to push for Enlightenment ideals in Latin America. He promoted 
independence of areas that became Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. 
Boltvar was born in 9enezuela in 18 to a family whose ancestors had 
been village aristocrats in Spain. The family had grown very wealthy in 
Venezuela, and Bolívar had access to this wealth for his revolutionary causes. 
After considerable military success in Latin America fighting the Spanish, his 
forces achieved the formation of a large area that he called Gran Colombia. 
He hoped it would become a federation similar to the United States, one based 
on Enlightenment ideals. He described himself as a liberal who believed in a 
free market and the abolition of slavery. Bolívar’s goals and concerns for Latin 
America are outlined in his “Jamaica Letter” 1815: “Generous souls always 
interest themselves in the fate of a people who strive to recover the rights to 
which the Creator and Nature have entitled them, and one must be wedded to 
error and passion not to harbor this noble sentiment.”
The new nations of Latin America suffered from the long wars of 
independence. Armies loyal to their generals led to the rise of the caudillos—
strong, local leaders with regional power bases. These men intervened in 
289 NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONSnational politics to make or break governments. Sometimes the caudillos 
defended the interests of the regional elites and sometimes of the indigenous 
population and the peasants, but in general they disregarded representative 
forms of government and the rule of law.
Results of the Creole Revolutions  Although the constitutions of the 
newly independent countries in Latin America legally ended slavery and 
some social distinctions, governments were often conservative.  The first 
constitution of Peru, for example, forbade voting by those who could not read 
or write in Spanish, which effectively denied most indigenous people the vote 
until the constitution was changed in 1860.  The creoles formed powerful and 
conservative upper class, as they had before the wars of colonial independence. 
Women gained little from the revolutions in Latin America. They were still 
unable to vote or enter into contracts. Most women received little education 
until late in the nineteenth century, and most remained submissive to men. 
One notable exception was Manuela Sienz 1±1856, who was the lover 
of Simyn Boltvar. She actively participated in fighting alongside Boltvar, for 
example, in 1822 in a battle near Quito, Ecuador. An excellent rider as well 
as courageous fighter, she rose to the rank of colonel. On one occasion, she 
saved Bolívar’s life, for which she received the nickname “Liberator of the 
Liberator.” (Connect: In a brief paragraph or outline, trace the connections 
between creole elites and revolutions in Latin America. See Topic .5 
Later Challenges to Spanish Colonialism  Spain’s grip on parts of its 
empire lasted throughout the 19th century. In the Caribbean, Puerto Rico 
and Cuba were among its final colonial holdings. Both islands saw uprisings 
against Spanish rule beginning in the year 1868. 
While many individuals and organizations contributed to the spirit of 
revolution in Puerto Rico, the role of Lola Rodríguez de Tió  was unique. 
A recognized poet during an era of little educational opportunity for women, 
Rodrtguez de Tiy became famous for her eloquent critiques of Spain’s 
exploitive rule over Puerto Rico. Her home became a meeting place for 
political thinkers and revolutionaries. At such meetings, she began to read 
lyrics to a revolutionary song, “La Boriquexa,” which encouraged her fellow 
Puerto Ricans, “Awake from your sleep, for it’s time to fight” 
The 1868 uprising forced Rodrtguez de Tiy into exile in 9enezuela. She 
was allowed to return in 1885, but her critical writings again ended in exile²
this time in Cuba. Once there, she wrote and worked for Cuban independence, 
earning her exile from there, too, to New York. She returned to Cuba in 18 
and spent her remaining years as a campaigner for social justice there.
Revolt in the Philippines
The Philippines, too, remained a Spanish colony throughout the 1th century. 
Educational opportunities, even for well-to-do Filipinos, were limited and 
controlled by religious authorities. As a result, many young men (often creoles 
and mestizos from wealthy families traveled to Europe, especially Madrid 
290 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONand Barcelona, to attend universities. An atmosphere of nationalist fervor and 
republicanism, inspired by Enlightenment thinking, existed in 1880s Europe, 
and these Filipino students embraced it. 
José Rizal became the most prominent of these young agitators, all of 
whom contributed to magazines, pamphlets, and other publications advocating 
for greater autonomy for the Philippines. Called the Propaganda Movement , 
it did not call for revolution or independence. But Spanish authorities viewed 
its members with suspicion. Rizal’s arrest in 182 and execution in 186 
shocked Filipinos and helped spur the first nationalist movement with the 
organization and strength to truly challenge Spanish rule. A serious military 
upheaval, the Philippine Revolution, began in 186.

As nationalism spread beyond Europe, people often created an identity under 
one government where none had existed before. Nationalism increased in 
France and in other areas of Europe and in the Americas. More than in the past, 
people felt a common bond with others who spoke their language, shared their 
history, and followed their customs. Nationalism thrived in France and beyond 
its borders in areas conquered by Napoleon, particularly those in the Germanic 
areas of the declining Holy Roman Empire. Nationalism was a unifying force 
that not only threatened large empires, but it also drove efforts to unite people 
who shared a culture into one political state. 
,talian 8nification  Count di  Cavour, the prime minister of Piedmont-
Sardinia, led the drive to unite the entire Italian Peninsula  under the only 
native dynasty, the House of Savoy. At the time, the region was divided among 
a patchwork of kingdoms and city-states, and most people spoke regional 
languages rather than Italian. Cavour himself spoke French better than he spoke 
Italian. Like other classical liberals, he believed in natural rights, progress, and 
constitutional monarchy. But he also believed in the practical politics of reality, 
which came to be called realpolitik . Thus, he did not hesitate to advance the 
cause of Italian unity through manipulation. In 1858, he maneuvered Napoleon 
III of France into a war with Austria, hoping to weaken Austrian influence on 
the Italian Peninsula. Napoleon III backed out of the war after winning two 
important battles, partly because he feared the wrath of the Pope, who did not 
want his Papal States to be controlled by a central Italian government. 
Nevertheless, it was too late to stop the revolutionary fervor, and soon 
several areas voted by plebiscite, or popular referendum, to join Piedmont the 
.ingdom of Sardinia. To aid the unification effort, Cavour adopted the radical 
romantic revolutionary philosophy of Giuseppe Mazzini , who had been 
agitating for Italian resurgence ( Risorgimento  since early in the nineteenth 
century. Cavour also allied with the Red Shirts military force led by Giuseppe 
Garibaldi , which was fighting farther south in the .ingdom of Naples. 
*erPan 8nification  In Germany, nationalist movements had already 
strengthened as a result of opposition to French occupation of German states 
291 NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONSunder Napoleon Bonaparte. Following the Congress of Vienna, which settled 
the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, revolutions occurred in a number of European 
states, including Prussia and Austria. The revolutions of 188 were the result 
of both nationalism especially a desire for independence and liberalism  
a desire for representation under constitutions that recognized civil liberties.
Prussian leader Otto von Bismarck , who like Cavour favored realpolitik,  
used nationalist feelings to engineer three wars to bring about German 
unification. Bismarck manipulated Austria into participating in two wars, the 
first with Prussia against Denmark 186  and the second between Prussia 
and Austria Seven Weeks’ War of 1866. After winning both wars, Bismarck 
manipulated France into declaring war against Prussia. His armies beat the 
French soundly in the Franco-Prussian War 180. In each of these three wars, 
Prussia gained territory. In 181, Bismarck founded the new German Empire, 
made up of many territories gained from the wars, including Alsace-Lorraine, 
an area long part of France on the border between France and the new Germany.
Global Consequences  By 181, two new powers, Italy and Germany,  
were on the international stage in an environment of competing alliances. 
Balance of power would be achieved briefly through these alliances, but 
extreme nationalism would lead to World War I.
Unification did not solve all Italian troubles . Poverty in Italy, more in the 
south than in the north, led to considerable emigration in the late nineteenth 
century²particularly to the United States and to Argentina, where the 
constitution of 185 specifically encouraged immigration , the movement of 
people into the country from other countries.

292 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONBalkan Nationalism  The Ottoman Empire had been the dominant force in 
southeastern Europe for centuries. But for many reasons, the 17th century saw 
the beginning of its long, slow decline. A failed attempt to conquer 9ienna in 
168 signaled the beginning of successful efforts by Austria and Russia to roll 
back Ottoman dominance in the Balkans. It was largely due to the increasing 
involvement and contact with Western European ideas and powers that Balkan 
nationalism developed. 
In Greece, which by 1800 had been under Ottoman control for more than 50 
years, increased contact with Western ideas meant exposure to Enlightenment 
principles. It also meant exposure to the reverence with which Greece and 
its ancient culture were viewed across Europe. Together, these developments 
helped reawaken Greek cultural pride and stoke the fires of Greek nationalism. 
A protracted civil war against Ottoman forces brought some success. However, 
it took the intervention of a British, French, and Russian fleet, which destroyed 
an Ottoman fleet in 182, to help assure Greek independence. 
Events in other Balkan regions, such as Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania, 
followed a similar, but by no means identical, course. The waning of Ottoman 
control led to greater freedom and an influx of new ideas, including nationalism. 
People began to rally around important cultural markers, such as language, 
folk traditions, shared history, and religion. Later, outside powers, such as 
Russia or Austria, aided in achieving independence.

This painting by Panagiotis =ografos shows the Ottoman seige of the Acropolis. Aided by British, French, 
and Russian forces, the Greeks won their independence by 182. 
293 NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONSOttoman Nationalism  The 180s and 1880s saw the development in 
the Ottoman state of Ottomanism —a movement that aimed to create a more 
modern, unified state. Officials sought to do this by minimizing the ethnic, 
linguistic, and religious differences across the empire. Taking control of 
local schools and mandating a standard curriculum was a major part of this 
drive. But the effects of nationalism were not limited to Balkan territories 
and Ottoman officials. Ethnic and religious groups within the Ottoman 
Empire had nationalist urges of their own, and they viewed Ottomanism with 
suspicion. Ironically, this attempt to create a more unified state actually served 
to highlight and intensify subject people’s feelings of difference and promote 
their desire for independence.
The Future of Nationalism  While nationalism continues to shape how 
people view themselves and their political allegiances, some signs suggest 
that nationalism might be starting to decline. In Europe, many countries 
have agreed to use the same currency, to allow people to travel freely across 
borders, and to coordinate public policies. These changes might reflect a shift 
away from nationalism and toward a larger political grouping. Like city-states 
and empires, nations might someday give way to other forms of political 
organization.

head; . . . and the important business of making a pin is, in

—Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations  (177)
Essential Question:   What factors contributed to and characterized 
industrialization in the period from 1750 to 1900?
In addition to new ideas, new technologies were reshaping societies.  
These technologies led to a dramatic change in society and economies. 
This change was so dramatic that it is called the Industrial Revolution.  
The rigid structure of early factory work described by Adam Smith, 
Scottish economist and philosopher, is one of the most enduring images of 
the Industrial Revolution. Industrialization,  the increased mechanization 
of production, and the social changes that accompanied this shift, had their 
roots in several influences. Among these were the Columbian Exchange 
and rise of maritime trading empires, increased agricultural productivity, 
and greater individual accumulation of capital. As the Industrial Revolution 
spread from Great Britain to Europe and North America, and then to the 
world, it reshaped society, increasing world population, shifting people 
from farm to city, and expanding the production and consumption of goods.
Agricultural Improvements
Just before the Industrial Revolution, in the early 1700s, an agricultural 
revolution  resulted in increased productivity. Crop rotation  (rotating 
different crops in and out of a field each year and the seed drill  (a 
device that efficiently places seeds in a designated spot in the ground 
both increased food production. Also, the introduction of the potato from 
South America contributed more calories to people’s diets. As nations 
industrialized, their populations grew because more food was available to 
more people. And because of improved medical care, infant mortality rates 
declined and people lived longer. With these demographic changes, more 
people were available to work in factories and to provide a market for 
manufactured goods. 
298 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONPreindustrial Societies
During the early 18th century, most British families lived in rural areas, grew 
most of their food, and made most of their clothes. For centuries, wool and flax 
had been raised domestically, and people spun fabrics they needed. 
However, one result of the commercial revolution and the establishment 
of maritime empires see Topic .5 was that Indian cotton became available 
in Britain, and before long it was in high demand. Wool and flax could not be 
produced quickly enough or in a large enough quantity to compete with cotton 
imports. To compete with Indian cotton, investors in Britain began to build 
their nation’s own cotton cloth industry. Using imported raw cotton produced 
by slave labor in the Americas, the British developed the cottage industry  
system, also known as the putting-out system, in which merchants provided 
raw cotton to women who spun it into finished cloth in their own homes. 
Home spinning was hard work and pay was low, but cottage industries 
gave women weavers some independence. While working in their own 
homes, they were also close to children. But cottage industry production was 
slow. Investors demanded faster production, spurring the development of 
technologies and machinery that turned out cloth in more efficient ways. 
Growth of Technology
By the mid-eighteenth century, the spinning jenny  and the  water frame  
reduced the time needed to spin yarn and weave cloth. The spinning jenny, 
invented by James Hargreaves  in the 1760s, allowed a weaver to spin more 
than one thread at a time. The water frame, patented by Richard Arkwright  
in 1769, used waterpower to drive the spinning wheel. The water frame was 
more efficient than a single person’s labor, and this mechanization doomed the 
household textile cottage industry, as textile production was moved to factories 
big enough to house these bulky machines. Arkwright was thus considered the 
father of the factory system .
Interchangeable Parts  In 18, inventor Eli Whitney  created a system 
of interchangeable parts  for manufacturing firearms for the U.S. military. 
In Whitney’s system, if a particular component of a machine were to break, 
the broken component could easily be replaced with a new, identical part. 
Entrepreneurs adapted this method of making firearms to the manufacture of 
other products. The system of interchangeable parts was a pivotal contribution 
to industrial technology. 
Whitney’s system directly led to the division of labor. Factory owners no 
longer had to rely on skilled laborers to craft every component of a product. 
Instead, with specialization of labor, each worker could focus on one type 
of task. For example, one worker might cast a part, and then another worker 
would install the part on the finished product. In the early 20th century, Henry 
Ford expanded the concept of the division of labor, developing the moving 
assembly line  to manufacture his Model T automobiles. (Connect: Compare 
the technological improvements of Islamic and Asian states with those in the 
Western world during the Industrial Revolution. See Topic .1.
299 INDUSTRI AL REVOL UTION BEGINS 299Britain’s Industrial Advantages
Britain had many environmental and geographic advantages that made it a 
leader in industrialization. Located on the Atlantic Ocean with its many 
seaways , the country was well placed to import raw materials  and export 
finished goods. 
Mineral Resources  Britain also had the geographic luck of being located 
atop immense coal deposits. Coal was vital to industrialization because when 
burned it could power the steam engine. The burning of this fossil fuel, an 
energy source derived from plant and animal remains, was also essential in 
the process of separating iron from its ore. Iron production (and later steel 
production allowed the building of larger bridges, taller buildings, and stronger 
ships. Coal mining became the major industry of northern and western Britain, 
including South Wales, Yorkshire, and Lancashire. When the United States 
industrialized, coal-mining areas developed in West 9irginia, Pennsylvania, 
and Kentucky. 
Resources from the Colonies  As a colonizing power, Britain also had 
access to resources available in its colonies, including timber for ships. Largely 
because of the wealth they accumulated during the trans-Atlantic slave trade,

300 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONenough British capitalists had excess capital  (money available to invest in 
businesses. Without this capital, private entrepreneurs could not have created 
new commercial ventures.
Abundant Rivers  Britain, the northeastern United States, and other 
regions also had a natural network of rivers supplemented by publicly funded 
canals and harbors. These water routes made transport of raw materials and 
finished products inexpensive.
Strong Fleets  Britain also had the world’s strongest fleet of ships, 
including naval ships for defense and commercial ships for trade. These ships 
brought agricultural products to Britain to be used to make finished products 
for consumers. 
Protection of Private Property  A vital factor that aided industrialization 
in Britain was the legal protection of private property. Entrepreneurs needed 
the assurance that the business they created and built up would not be taken 
away, either by other businesspeople or by the government. Not all nations 
offered these legal guarantees.
Growing Population and Urbanization  The increases in agricultural 
production caused two shifts in society. As farmers grew more food, they could 
support more people. As they grew it more efficiently, society needed a smaller 
percentage of the population working in agriculture.
This growing population in rural areas did not remain there. Migration was 
sometimes the best of bad options. English towns had traditionally allowed 
farmers to cultivate land or tend sheep on government property known as “the 
commons.” However, this custom ended with the enclosure movement  as 
the government fenced off the commons to give exclusive use of it to people 
who paid for the privilege or who purchased the land. Many farmers became 
landless and destitute. The enclosure movement was thus instrumental in a 
wave of demographic change—forcing small farmers to move from rural areas 
to urban areas such as Manchester  and Liverpool.  The people who moved 
then became the workforce for the new and growing industries.

that follows.
“The advances which gave this great economic change the name Industrial 
Revolution occurred in Great Britain, yet it would be contrary to the facts 
to regard the mechanization of industrial processes as strictly an English 
experience. . . . England was the leading innovator of methods for rendering 
raw materials more useful to man, but it by no means had a monopoly of 
inventions. A Frenchman, Antoine Lavoisier, discovered the chemical nature 
of combustion. . . . An American, Eli Whitney, invented the cotton gin. And 
a German, Justus von Liebig, determined the chief chemical components of 
plants and thus laid the basis for a chemical fertilizer industry.”

Industrialization Spreads
No exertions of the masters or workmen could have answered the demands  
of trade without the introduction of spinning machines.
 —1ohn AiRen, A +escription of the Country . . . Around 4anchester, 1795
Essential Question:   How did different types and locations of production 
develop and change over time?
Although the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, it soon spread 
elsewhere. The British cottage industry system for the production of cotton, in 
which merchants provided raw cotton to be spun into cloth in workers’ homes, 
was supplanted by the industrialization of cotton manufacture in factories. 
Cotton became an increasingly valuable commodity in the world economy as 
industrialized Britain, with higher productivity, was able to replace Indian and 
Middle Eastern goods. After Britain industrialized, Belgium and then France 
and Germany followed, and eventually Russia and Japan became industrialized. 
These countries possessed many of the characteristics that allowed Britain to 
industrialize, including capital, natural resources, and water transportation.
Spread of Industrialization
After Britain industrialized, Belgium, and then France and Germany followed. 
Like Britain, these countries possessed capital, natural resources, and water 
transportation. The United States, Japan, and Russia also transformed as 
industrialization spread.
France and Germany  Despite some favorable factors for industrialization, 
France had sparsely populated urban centers, which limited the amount of 
labor available for factories. Also, the French Revolution 18±1 and 
subsequent wars involving France and its neighbors consumed both the 
attention and the capital of France’s elites. These factors delayed the Industrial 
Revolution in France.
Germany was politically fragmented into numerous small states, which 
delayed its industrialization. However, once Germany unified in 181, it 
quickly became a leading producer of steel and coal. 
The United States  The United States began its industrial revolution in 
the 1th century. By 100, the United States was a leading industrial force 
305 INDUSTRI ALIZATION S PREADSin the world. Human capital  the workforce was a key factor in U.S. 
success. Political upheaval and widespread poverty brought a large number of 
immigrants to the United States from Europe and East Asia. These immigrants, 
as well as migrants from rural areas in the United States, provided the labor 
force to work in the factories.

Sugar Caribbean Islands, Brazil Britain (refined sugar)

Cotton United States Britain (textiles)
Russia  Russia also began to industrialize, focusing particularly on 
railroads and exports. By 100, Russia had more than 6,000 miles of railroad 
connecting its commercial and industrial areas. The Trans-Siberian Railroad 
stretched from Moscow to the Pacific Ocean, allowing Russia to trade easily 
with countries in East Asia, such as China and Japan. The Russian coal, iron, 
and steel industries developed with the railroad, mostly in the 180s. By 
1900, Russia had become the fourth largest producer of steel in the world. 
However, the economy remained overwhelmingly agricultural until after the 
Communists seized power in 1917. 
Japan  The first country in Asia to industrialize was the one that had 
the least contact with Europe since the 1th century: Japan. In the mid-1th 
century, Japan went through a process of defensive modernization. That is, it 
consciously adapted technology and institutions developed in Europe and the 
United States in order protect its traditional culture. By learning from the West, 
Japan built up its military and economic strength so it could maintain its own 
domestic traditions. In the last four decades of the 19th century, Japan emerged 
as a leading world power. For more details on Japan, see Topic 5.6. 
Shifts in Manufacturing
While Middle Eastern and Asian countries continued to produce manufactured 
goods, these regions’ share in global manufacturing declined.
Shipbuilding in India and Southeast Asia Shipbuilding initially 
saw a resurgence in India at the end of the 17th century, largely due to the 
political alliances formed between India and western countries. However, 
Indian shipbuilding ultimately suffered as a result of British officials’ 
306 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONmismanagement of resources and ineffective leadership during the period 
of British colonization in the late 1th and 18th centuries. In 180, Britain 
designated ships of the British East India Company as the Indian Navy. The 
Indian Navy was disbanded by 186, however, when Britain’s Royal Navy 
took complete control of the Indian Ocean.
Iron Works in India British colonial rule in India also affected the 
country’s mineral production. During the period of company rule— British 
East India Company control over parts of the Indian subcontinent from 1757 
to 1858²steep British tariffs led to the decline of India’s ability to mine and 
work metals. The British also began to close mines completely, especially 
after the Rebellion of 185, because they perceived that the mines were being 
used to extract lead for ammunition.
The ongoing fear of another uprising led to the Arms Act of 188, which 
restricted not only access to minerals, but also to the subsequent production 
of firearms. British colonizers limited India’s ability to mine and work metals 
in areas such as the mineral-rich state of Rajasthan. By the early 1th century, 
most of the mines in Rajasthan were abandoned and the mining industry was 
extinct.
Even though British colonial rule ended in 18, mining and metalworking 
remained practically nonexistent in India until the early 20th century. Lack 
of technological innovation after so many years of abandoned mines led 
to a relatively crude, labor-intensive method of mining, which created the 
false impression that India’s mineral resources were inaccessible. (Connect: 
Identify the similarities in how Britain treated its colonies in South Asia and 
its colonies in the Americas. See Topic .8.
Textile Production in India and Egypt  India and Egypt were both among 
the first to engage in the production and trade of textiles. Just as it stifled 
the production of ships and iron, British colonization also affected textile 
production in India. As the textile industry flourished in India, it undermined 
the British textile mills in Britain, specifically in Lancaster. The owners of the 
Lancaster textile mills pressured the British government in India to impose an 
“equalizing” five percent tax on all textiles produced at the more than 80 mills 
operating in Bombay, thus undermining their profitability.
Egypt’s textile industry, too, experienced difficulties as a result of Europe’s 
worldwide economic reach. In the 18th century, Egypt exported carpets, silks, 
and other textiles to Europe. By the mid-1th century, however, the huge 
growth in European textile production had changed matters. Egypt had lost 
not only its export market in textiles, but much of its domestic market as well.

307 INDUSTRI ALIZATION S PREADSMULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS  
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“The economic relations of Russia with western Europe are fully comparable 
to the relations of colonial countries with their metropolises. The latter 
consider their colonies as advantageous markets in which they can freely sell 
the products of their labor and of their industry and from which they can draw 
with a powerful hand the raw materials necessary for them. This is the basis 
of the economic power of the governments of western Europe, and chiefly for 
that end do they guard their existing colonies or acquire new ones. Russia was, 
and to a considerable extent still is, such a hospitable colony for all industrially 
developed states, generously providing them with the cheap products of her 
soil and buying dearly the products of their labor. 
But there is a radical difference between Russia and a colony: Russia is an 
independent and strong power. She has the right and the strength not to want to 
be the eternal handmaiden of states which are more developed economically. 
She should know the price of her raw materials and of the natural riches hidden 
in the womb of her abundant territories, and she is conscious of the great, not 
yet fully displayed, capacity for work among her people. She is proud of her 
great might, by which she jealously guards not only the political but also the 
economic independence of her empire. She wants to be a metropolis herself. 
On the basis of the people’s labor, liberated from the bonds of serfdom, there 
began to grow our own national economy, which bids fair to become a reliable 
counterweight to the domination of foreign industry.”

Technology in the Industrial Age
Railroad iron is a magician’s rod, in its power  
to evoke the sleeping energies of  land and water. 
—9alph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)
Essential Question:   How did technology shape economic production 
during the period from 1750 to 1900?
As the Industrial Revolution spread, it became increasingly important 
economically. Although he later came to be troubled by the role of technology, 
Ralph Waldo Emerson initially saw the innovations of the industrial age 
as a delightful way to mold nature in the service of humankind. The steam 
engine and then the internal combustion engine, powering railroads, ships, and 
factories, increased access to resources and increased the distribution of goods 
those resources helped produce.
The next technological wave, known as the second industrial revolution, 
came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and involved chemicals, steel, 
precision machinery, and electronics. Electrification lit the streets, and the 
telephone and radio made world-wide, instantaneous communication a reality.
The Coal Revolution 
The new machinery of the Industrial Revolution benefitted from a new power 
source, one more mobile than the streams that had powered the first factories 
with their water power. The version of the steam engine  made by James Watt 
in 1765 provided an inexpensive way to harness coal power to create steam, 
which in turn generated energy for machinery in textile factories. Within 50 
years, steam was producing power for steam powered trains. 
Water Transportation  Steamships revolutionized sailing. The use of 
coal made energy production mobile and dependable. Instead of being fixed in 
one place as a river was, coal-powered steam engines could be built anywhere 
and could be used on ships and trains. Further, unlike the wind, engines could 
be turned on by people when needed and turned off when not. As a result, 
ocean-going ships and boats on lakes were no longer dependent on winds for 
power. On rivers, steam-powered ships were able to travel quickly upstream 
on rivers, up to five miles per hour, instead of having to sail up or be towed by 
311 TECHNOLOG Y IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGEpeople and animals along the shore. Over time, steam-powered ships replaced 
sailing ships in worldwide travel. As a result, coaling stations , especially at 
critical points on trade routes, such as Cape Colony in South Africa and various 
islands in the Pacific, became important refueling points.

312 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIron In addition to powering steam engines, coal made possible the 
mass production of iron. Throughout the 100s and into the early 1800s, 
improved processes helped iron producers increase outputs. One of these was 
the introduction of coke, a refined form of coal that made possible the use of 
much larger iron producing furnaces. Cast iron was strong but brittle, making 
it difficult to stretch and shape. But in 1, Englishman Henry Cort patented 
the process for making the less strong but much more workable wrought iron. 
Each was a valuable component in transportation and industry, but greater 
improvements were still to come.
A Second Industrial Revolution
The United States, Great Britain, and Germany were key players in what is 
known as the second industrial revolution , which occurred in the late 19th 
and early 20th centuries. The innovations of the first industrial revolution were 
in textiles, steam power, and iron. The developments of the second industrial 
revolution were in steel , chemicals, precision machinery, and electronics. 
Steel Production  The mass production of steel, an alloy of iron and 
carbon, became possible with the introduction of the Bessemer Process in 
1856. This process involved blasting the molten metal with air as a means of 
removing impurities as well as helping keep the metal from solidifying. Over 
the years, Bessemer’s innovation was refined and improved, allowing steel to 
become the strong and versatile backbone of the industrial society. 
Oil In the mid-1800s, the first commercial oil wells were drilled, tapping 
into a vast new resource of energy. Petroleum, like coal, is a fossil fuel, an 
energy source derived from plant and animal remains. At first, the most 
important product from petroleum was kerosene, which was used for lighting 
and heaters. In 18, inventors developed chemical techniques to extract 
kerosene from petroleum. 
These techniques led to other developments, such as precision machinery 
and the internal combustion engine, which in turn led to automobile and airplane 
technologies. When automobiles were introduced in the early 1900s, gasoline 
as fuel became a more important product from petroleum than kerosene.
Electricity  The harnessing of electrical power had to wait for the 
development of an effective electrical generator. In 1882 in London, the first 
public power station began production. Electrification led to street lighting and 
electric street trains in the 180s. 
Communications  The development of electricity and electronics over the 
years helped lead to important developments in communication technology. 
Inventors had been working with the idea of transmitting sound by electrical 
means since the early 19th century. Finally, a patent for the telephone was issued 
to Alexander Graham Bell  in 186. Early phone systems were notoriously 
low in quality, but Thomas Edison’s 1886 design of a refined voice transmitter 
made telephone use more practical.
313 TECHNOLOG Y IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGERadio developed after the experiments of Italian physicist Gugliemo 
Marconi . In 1901, he was able to send and receive a radio signal across the 
Atlantic Ocean. After further refinements and inventions, radio become a form 
of popular mass media with an impact unlike any previously seen.
Global Trade and Migration
Railroads, steamships, and a new invention called the telegraph made 
exploration, development, and communication possible. The telegraph 
allowed immediate communication. The construction of railroads, including 
the Transcontinental Railroad  that connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans 
when it was completed in 186, facilitated U.S. industrial growth. Like the 
canals, the railroads were heavily subsidized by public funds. The vast natural 
resources of the United States timber, coal, iron, and oil, for example and 
the ability to transport them efficiently contributed to the development of the 
United States as an industrial nation. 
The desire for capital , money available to invest in a business, was a 
driving force domestically and abroad. Products of industrialization, such as 
the railroad, steamship, and the telegraph, directly linked farmers, miners, 
manufacturers, customers, and investors globally for the first time in history .
With the development of the railroad and steamships, such countries as 
Great Britain, Germany, and the United States intensified industrialization, 
increasing the need for resources. Industrialized countries sought to protect 
their access to resources and markets by establishing colonies. 
Whereas earlier trade and migration often centered on coastal cities, 
railroads, steamships, and the telegraph also opened up to exploration and 
development the interior regions around the globe. Access to these areas 
increased trade and migration. (Connect: Write a paragraph describing how 
the Silk Roads set the stage for the industrial developments of the 1800s. See

INDUSTRIALIZATION : GO=ERNMENT ’S ROLE317
5.6
Industrialization: 
Government’s  Role
It is our purpose to select from the various institutions prevailing among 
enlightened nations such as are best suited to our present conditions,  
and adapt them in gradual reforms and improvements of our policy  
and customs so as to be upon an equality with them.
—Emperor 4eiji. letter to President <lysses .rant,1871
Essential Question:   What economic strategies did different states and 
empires adopt, and what were the causes and effects 
of those strategies? 
As Western domination and technology spread, they met with varying degrees 
of acceptance in different nations. Each country experienced competing 
pressures between preservation of traditional values and modernization. 
Egypt and some other countries early adopted policies that encouraged the 
use of industrialized innovations, such as the steam engine, to boost textile 
productivity. Others, such as China, had weakened central governments under 
European ascendency that were unable to promote industrialization effectively.
The Ottoman Empire  The Ottoman Empire, although bordering Europe, 
had not adopted Western technology or Enlightenment ideas. Moreover, 
rampant corruption led to rapid decline, and ethnic nationalism among the 
empire’s diverse population led to widespread unrest. The empire earned the 
nickname “the sick man of Europe.” Europeans, particularly Russians, saw 
opportunities to expand their own empires at the expense of the weakening 
Ottomans. Though they feared the results of a power vacuum from a total 
collapse of the Ottoman Empire, they dismantled it after World War I. A 
smaller nation-state, the Republic of Turkey, and several independent countries 
replaced the former empire.
China  China suffered two great humiliations at the hands of Europeans 
in the 1th century: the Opium War and the split into “spheres of influence.” 
In the 20th century, China shook off foreign domination and briefly became 
a republic. However, its traumatic 19th century left a central government too 
weak to promote industrialization effectively for decades. See Topic 6.5.
Japan  In Japan, in contrast, the central government grew stronger in its 
struggle to maintain independence and territorial integrity in the face of Western 
318 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONchallenges. As the quote at the beginning of this chapter from Emperor Meiji’s 
letter to President Grant indicates, Japan actively sought Western innovations 
that it felt would help make it the equal of Western countries. 
Ottoman Industrialization 
Suffering from problems of overexpansion and failure to modernize, the 
Ottoman Empire underwent palace coups, declining trade, and weakening 
leadership in the 1800s. The empire no longer covered the grand areas of 
Suleiman the Magnificent, who had taken his army to the gates of 9ienna in 
1529. 
The Rise of Muhammad Ali  One part of the Ottoman Empire where the 
sultan ruled in name but had little power was Egypt. In fact, the Mamluks , 
formerly enslaved Turks who formed a military class, had ruled there for some 
600 years. In 1801, the sultan sent an Ottoman army to retake Egypt. In the 
conflict with the Mamluks, an Albanian Ottoman officer, Muhammad Ali , 
rose to prominence, and local leaders selected him to be the new governor of 
Egypt. The sultan lacked the power to do anything but agree.
Because of his power, Ali was able to act somewhat independently of the 
sultan. He joined the sultan’s military campaigns when it benefited him, and 
also undertook several campaigns without the sultan’s permission, including 
in the Sudan and Syria. He also began his own reforms in Egypt.  He began by 
making over the country’s military on a European model. He also established 
schools, sent military officers to be educated in France, and started an official 
newspaper²the first in the Islamic world.

319 INDUSTRIALIZATION : GO=ERNMENT ’S ROLE319As part of his reform of the Egyptian economy, Ali taxed the peasants at 
such a high rate that they were forced to give up their lands to the state. The 
government could then control the valuable cotton production and make money 
on the export of cotton and other agricultural products. Secularizing religious 
lands put more agricultural produce in the hands of the government, resulting 
in large profits during the period of the Napoleonic wars 1±1815, when 
prices for wheat were high in Europe.
Muhammad Ali also pushed Egypt to industrialize. He had textile factories 
built to compete with those of the French and British. In Cairo, he had factories 
built to produce armaments. In Alexandria, he set up facilities to build ships so 
that Egypt could have its own navy. The city of Cairo had dozens of small shops 
turning out locks, bolts of cloth, and other parts for uniforms and weaponry. 
Ali is called the first great modern ruler of Egypt partly because of his vision 
of state-sponsored industrialization.
Japan and the Meiji Restoration
Japan’s transition to a modern, industrialized country took less than half a 
century to accomplish. No country made such a rapid change.
A Challenge to Isolation  Between 1600 and 185, Japan had very little 
contact with the rest of the world. However, the rising imperial powers in the 
world were not content to let Japan keep to itself. The great powers of Europe, 
such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Russia, all wanted to sell goods in 
Japan. Further, in the age of coal-powered ships, trading states wanted to be 
able to refuel in Japan as they sailed to and from China and other parts of East 
Asia. 
Japan Confronts Foreigners  In 185, a naval squad led by Commodore 
Matthew Perry  in 185 sailed into Yedo and Tokyo Bay, asking for trade 
privileges. The next year, Perry returned with even more ships, demanding 
that the Japanese engage in trade with the United States. Faced with the power 
of the U.S. warships, the Japanese gave in to U.S. demands. Soon they yielded 
to similar demands by other foreign states. 
The arrival of Perry, and the threat he posed, caused Japanese leaders to 
realize the danger they and their culture were in. They had seen how even 
a large, traditionally powerful country such as China had been humiliated 
by Westerners. They had watched as the British had gone to war to force 
the Chinese to accept opium imports. While some Japanese argued that the 
country could defend itself, many reformers feared it could not. They argued 
that the country should adopt enough Western technology and methods so it 
could protect its traditional culture. To accomplish this goal, they overthrew 
the shogun and restored power to the emperor in 1868, an event know as the 
Meiji Restoration.
Reforms by the Meiji State  Japan systematically visited Europe and the 
United States and invited experts to Japan in order to study Western institutions. 
Then, Japan adopted reforms based on what it admired:
320 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITION• It formally abolished feudalism in 1868 by the Charter Oath .
• It established a constitutional monarchy based on the Prussian model in 
which the emperor ruled through a subordinate political leader.
• It established equality before the law and abolished cruel punishments.
• It reorganized the military based on the Prussian army, building a new 
navy and instituting conscription.
• It created a new school system that expanded educational opportunities, 
particularly in technical fields.
• It built railroads and roads. 
• It subsidized industrialization, particularly in the key industries of tea, 
silk, weaponry, shipbuilding, and a rice wine called sake.
The government financed all of these reforms with a high agricultural tax. 
The taxes proved a good investment because they stimulated rapid economic 
growth. The government’s ability to collect increased taxes also provided 
revenue for the bureaucracy, now centered in Tokyo. 
However, in replicating the methods of Western countries, the Japanese 
also replicated some of industrial society’s problems. For example, accounts 
of abuse and exploitation of female Japanese mill workers are similar to the 
experiences that British female mill workers had recorded decades earlier.

321 INDUSTRIALIZATION : GO=ERNMENT ’S ROLEThe Role of Private Investments  While the relationship between 
industry and centralized government was key to modernization in Japan, 
private investment from overseas also became important. Once new industries 
were flourishing, they were sometimes sold to zaibatsu , powerful Japanese 
family business organizations like the conglomerates in the United States. 
The prospect of attracting investors encouraged innovation in technology. For 
example, a carpenter founded a company in 1906 called Toyoda Loom Works 
that made an automatic loom . The company prospered, modified its name, 
and grew into today’s Toyota Motor Company.

Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“Generally speaking, the strength or weakness of a country is dependent on the 
wealth or poverty of its people, and the people’s wealth or poverty derives from 
the amount of available products. The diligence of the people is a major factor 
in determining the amount of products available, but in the final analysis, it 
can all be traced to the guidance and encouragement given by the government 
and its officials. . . . Your subject respectfully recommends that a clear-cut plan 
be established . . . to determine the priorities under which industries may be 
encouraged. . . . If the people are adequately wealthy, it follows naturally that 
the country will become strong and wealthy. . . . If so, it will not be difficult for 
us to compete effectively against major powers.”

323 INDUSTRIALIZATION : GO=ERNMENT ’S ROLESHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. 
“It was cotton production, especially, that characterized the beginnings of 
Egypt’s integration into the global capitalist system. Cotton was an important 
part of the British Industrial Revolution, as textile mills in Lancashire 
and elsewhere came to symbolize the changes that occurred as a society 
transitioned from a feudal mode of production to a capitalist one. Egypt’s 
initial role in this chain of developments was to supply cotton to British textile 
mills, especially when the American Civil War cut off supplies of cotton from 
the southern United States Beckert, 200, p. 105. 
. . . Many of the major changes in Egyptian agriculture, and in rural Egyptian 
society more broadly, can be traced to the development of the global capitalist 
system. As the British promoted cotton cultivation in Egypt, large estates took 
over land that had supplied the means of subsistence for peasants under pre-
capitalist modes of production. The result was that µthe great majority of the 
peasantry was by the end of the nineteenth century either landless or land-
poor, while a new class of large landowners—an agrarian bourgeoisie—had 
emerged’ Beinin and Lockman, 18, p. 8. This agrarian bourgeoisie assumed 
much of the power in rural Egypt, yet the influx of foreign capital during this 
development of agricultural production in Egypt meant that the foreigners who 
controlled the capital also held much of the power over Egypt as a whole.”

A Identify ONE way in which cotton production changed the 
economic or social structure of Egypt in the period 1750–1900.

political or economic policies of Egypt and China in the period 
1750 –1900. 
C Explain ONE historical situation in the period 1750–1900, other 
than the one illustrated in the passage, in which states in Asia or

324 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   IDENTIF Y DIFFERING  PATTERNS  
OF IN DUSTRI ALIZATION
As historians make connections between cultures and eras, they look 
for not only consistent patterns but also for divergent ones. For instance, 
the pattern in France and Germany was consistent: these countries 
realized their need to follow Britain’s charge towards industrializing 
production in order to strengthen their economic presence. This 
trend towards industrializing reveals their interest in gaining a global 
economic presence, perhaps even economic dominance. The states you 
read about in this topic, however, did not follow that pattern.  
Review the information in this topic and identify a pattern of 
industrializing shared by the Ottomans and Japanese. In a few para 

European states both socially and economically.

Economic Developments 
and Innovations
Man is an animal that makes bargains: no other animal does this  
- no dog exchanges bones with another. 
—Adam Smith (1723-1790)
Essential Question:   How did the development of economic systems, 
ideologies, and institutions contribute to change 
between 1750 and 1900?
Industrialization and modernization led to new philosophies and business 
structures. In the Wealth of Nations 16, Adam Smith, arguing that humans 
are naturally transactional, provided a foundational text in support of capitalism 
and the establishment of private entrepreneurship and shaped the economics 
and politics of the industrial age and the centuries to follow. Mercantilism, 
a system of economic protectionism, was replaced by a laissez-faire “leave 
alone” in French policy that promoted minimal governmental involvement in 
commerce and encouraged countries to reduce tariffs on trade.
These economic ideas were reflected in, and supported by, emerging 
transnational institutions, including banks such as the Hong .ong and Shanghai 
Banking Corporation HSBC and manufacturers such as Unilever. As trade 
increased, so did the availability, affordability, and variety of consumer goods.
(σecWsRn%usiness2UJDni]DWiRn
New ways of organizing businesses arose during the Industrial Revolution. 
Some manufacturers formed giant corporations  in order to minimize risk. A 
corporation is a business chartered by a government as a legal entity owned 
by stockholders  (individuals who buy partial ownership directly from the 
company when it is formed or later through a  stock market . Stockholders 
might receive sums of money, known as dividends, from a corporation when 
it makes a profit. If a corporation experiences a loss or goes bankrupt, the 
stockholders are not liable for the losses. The most that stockholders can lose 
is what they paid for the stock in the first place.
Markets with One Seller  Some corporations became so powerful that 
they could form a monopoly , control of a specific business and elimination of 
all competition. For example, Alfred Krupp of Essen, Germany, ran a gigantic 
company that used the Bessemer process , a more efficient way to produce 
steel, gaining a monopoly in the German steel industry. In the United States, 
John D. Rockefeller created a monopoly in the oil industry.
326 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONCompanies Working Across Boundaries  British-born Cecil Rhodes , 
founder of De Beers Diamonds, was an especially enthusiastic investor in a 
railroad project that was to stretch from Cape Town, in modern-day South 
Africa, to Cairo, Egypt. Connecting all of the British-held colonies with a 
transportation network could make governance easier and aid in conducting 
a war, if necessary. The project was never completed because Britain never 
gained control over all the land on which such a railroad was to be built. 
The overwhelming majority of railway workers in Africa were natives who 
were paid far lower wages than their European counterparts. Thus, railroad 
technology was a means of extracting as many resources as possible from 
subject lands while paying colonial laborers as little as possible.
De Beers was one of many transnational  companies—those that operated 
across national boundaries—that emerged in the 19th century. For example, 
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation , a British-owned bank 
opened in its colony of Hong .ong in 1865, focused on finance, corporate 
investments, and global banking. The Unilever Corporation , a British and 
Dutch venture, focused on household goods²most famously, soap. By 180 
it had soap factories in Australia, Switzerland, the United States, and beyond. 
Unilever sourced the palm oil for its soaps first from British West Africa 
and later the Belgian Congo, where it operated huge plantations. Because 
these companies were transnational, they gained wealth and influence on 
a scale rarely approached before. (Connect: Defend or refute the claim—  
mercantilism was necessary for the eventual growth of transnational 
companies. See Topic ..  
Corporations  A sole proprietorship is a business owned by a single 
person, and a partnership is a small group of people who make all business 
decisions. A corporation differs from these two other major forms of business 
ownership in that a corporation is a more flexible structure for large-scale 
economic activity. It replaced the traditional system of a single entrepreneur 
engaging in high-risk business endeavors with a system of larger companies, 
collectively engaging in lower-risk efforts. By spreading risk, investments 
became much safer and more attractive.
Four Features of a Corporation

and be sued, may make contracts, and may hold property.
0nKeÄnite D\rHtion The life of the corporation may extend beyond the participation 
of any of its incorporators.
327 ECONOMIC DEVELO PMENTS AND INNOV ATIONS 327Despite critics’ charges that corporations undermined individual 
responsibility, they became a common form of business organization. They 
eventually dominated many areas of business, from banking to manufacturing 
to providing services. With their growth, corporations gained great economic 
and political power. For example, the decision by a corporation about where 
to build a new factory could create thousands of new jobs for a community . 
Banking and Finance  Another way to reduce risk was through insurance, 
especially marine insurance. Lloyd’s of London, with beginnings in a coffee 
house where merchants and sailors went for the most reliable shipping news, 
helped establish the insurance industry. The number of banks rose as merchants 
and entrepreneurs looked for a reliable place to deposit money and to borrow it 
when needed to build a factory or hire workers for a new enterprise. 
(σecWRn0Dss&ulWuUe 
A culture of consumerism  as well as of leisure developed among the working 
and middle classes of society in Great Britain, and for some people, living 
standards rose.  Consumption needed to keep up with production, so producers 
began to advertise heavily, particularly to the middle class whose members 
had some disposable income, money that can be spent on nonessential goods. 
Leisure activities such as biking and boating became popular during the 
late 1800s. In the 1880s, the penny-farthing bicycle below left was replaced 
by the newer safety bicycle below right. The older style featured one large 
wheel and one small one. This allowed riders to travel fast, but the danger of 
falling over was high. The newer style, by using a chain connecting different 
sized gears on the wheels, could go the same speed, but with less risk.

328 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONCompanies encouraged their workers to participate in athletics, because 
they believed that sports rewarded virtues such as self-discipline and playing 
by the rules. The sales of athletic equipment also generated business for those 
who made everything from soccer` balls to sports stadiums.
Perhaps because workers spent most of their waking hours in a bleak 
industrial environment, material goods and leisure entertainment became 
important escapes. In Europe, soccer known there as football, became 
popular, while baseball dominated sports in the United States. Particular sports 
developed along class lines: tennis and golf in England, for example, were 
played by the upper classes, while certain types of rugby were played only by 
the lower classes.
The commercialization of the demand for public culture was also seen in 
the construction of music halls and public parks, particularly during the second 
half of the 19th century. Both the halls and the parks were built to accommodate 
a wide range of social classes. One aim of this mingling of classes was for the 
lower classes to see more civilized, rational behavior so that they would be 
encouraged to emulate it. The manner in which one class may have ultimately 
influenced the other is difficult to quantify, yet the enduring presence of such 
public mingling places remains intact.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“It is especially difficult to explain why consumers chose to use the increasing 
incomes which they had at their disposal for consumption rather than for 
saving or investment. Some historians suggest that consumption increased 
because consumers shared an almost instinctive desire to enjoy a higher 
standard of living and improve their material and psychological well-being. 
Others believe that consumers consumed in order to emulate those around 
them; as Perkin suggests, ‘If consumer demand was the key to the Industrial 
Revolution, social emulation was the key to consumer demand. By the 
eighteenth century nearly everyone in England and the Scottish Lowlands 
received a money income, and nearly everyone was prepared to spend a 
large part of it in  keeping up with the Joneses .’ Other historians maintain 
that consumers were manipulated by the machinations of advertisers and 
other commercial interests. According to Royle, ‘The lubricant to make 
the consumer society of the late twentieth century function smoothly was 
advertising, which was made all the easier with the advent of television.’ ”

Using reasoning processes of comparison, causation, andor continuity 
and change, historians can explore and explain relationships between 
different historical developments. For example, they can explain the 
relationship between the historical development of state-building and 
the historical development of global trading networks by asking such 
questions as:
• How were these developments the same, and how were they 
different? 
• What caused each development, and what were the effects? Did 
one development cause the other? 
• What degree of change did the development bring about? In other 
words, to what extent was continuity preserved or disrupted?

Reactions to the

—4ary Harris ¸4other¹ 1ones, (1837-1930)
Essential Question:   What conditions led to calls for change in industrial 
societies, and what were the effects of those efforts?
The harsh conditions of industrial life provoked resistance and calls for 
reform. “Mother” Jones, a labor organizer, described the severe deprivations 
of the coal miners working underground all day, and other activists told of 
the horrors of factory work. Philosophers such as John Stuart Mill sought to 
address this growing inhumanity of the industrial era through social reforms 
Others, such as the utopian socialists, argued for completely changing a 
system they considered to be basically flawed. Workers formed trade unions to 
advocate for higher pay and safer working conditions. Various ideologies and 
political movements emerged, some promoting alternative visions of society. 
The Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin, China, and Japan also 
instituted reforms to promote industrialization. In response, in each, faced 
reactions against the results of economic change. 
Labor Unions
Dangerous and unsanitary working conditions, low wages, and long hours 
were common in factory work in the 19th century. A committee of Britain’s 
Parliament released a study called the Sadler Report in 18. The report 
described these conditions. It made many people in Britain, particularly in 
Parliament, aware of the need for reforms. 
Workers also responded to low pay and harsh conditions. They began to 
form  labor unions  —organizations of workers that advocated for the right to 
bargain with employers and put the resulting agreements in a contract. For 
most of the 19th century, unions in Great Britain had to organize in secret 
because the government treated them as enemies of trade. However, by the 
20th century, unions became more acceptable and membership increased. 
333 REACTIONS TO T HE INDUSTRI AL ECONOM Y Unions improved workers’ lives by winning minimum wage laws, limits on 
the number of hours worked, overtime pay, and the establishment of a five-day 
work week.
Voting Rights  Unions sparked a larger movement for empowerment 
among the working class. In 182, 186, and 188, the British parliament 
passed reform bills to expand the pool of men who could vote, thereby giving 
more representation to British cities. The acts reduced property ownership 
qualifications as a requirement for voting. These reforms laid the foundation 
for expansion of the franchise right to vote to all men in 118. British women 
would not gain equal suffrage voting rights until 128.
Child Labor  Along with unions, social activists and reformers hoped 
to improve the living conditions of the least powerful in society. Reformers’ 
achievements especially benefited children. A law in 18 declared that 
children under the age of 10 were banned from working in the coal mines. 
In 1881, education became mandatory for British children between the ages 
of 5 and 10. This focus on education, as opposed to work for monetary gain, 
permanently redefined the role of children in urban society.
The Intellectual Reaction 
As trade and production became increasingly global, the ideas of early 
economists such as Adam Smith see Topic 5.1 were taken in new directions. 
While Smith wrote in an age of individual entrepreneurs and small businesses, 
people of the 1th century witnessed the rise of large-scale transnational 
businesses. This shift caused people to think about society in new ways. For 
example, utopian socialists tried to create new communities to demonstrate 
alternatives to capitalism. 
John Stuart Mill  Some economists, clergy, and intellectuals criticized  
laissez-faire capitalism as inhumane to workers. One of these was a British  
philosopher, John Stuart Mill 1806±18. He championed legal reforms 
to allow labor unions, limit child labor, and ensure safe working conditions 
in factories. While his ideas were controversial in his time, many of them 
eventually become widely adopted in industrial societies.
Mill’s philosophy was called utilitarianism.  Rather than state a set of 
timeless moral rules, as many religions or ethicists did, utilitarianism  sought 
“the greatest good for the greatest number of people.” Unlike utopian socialists, 
who wanted to replace capitalism, utilitarians wanted to address the growing 
problems they saw with it. They viewed themselves as moderate, rational 
advocates of gradual reform.
334 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONKarl Marx
While most reformers wanted to fix what they considered problems with 
capitalism, some people wanted more extensive changes. Karl Marx  1818±
188 was a German scholar and writer who argued for socialism. Unlike 
utopian socialists, whom he scorned because he thought they wanted to escape 
problems rather than confront them, he wanted to look at how the world 
actually operated. He called his approach to economics “scientific socialism.” 
In 188, .arl Marx and his wealthy supporter Friedrich Engels  published 
a pamphlet (now called the  Communist Manifesto  that summarized their 
critique of capitalism. According to Marx, capitalism was an advance on 
feudalism because it produced tremendous wealth, but that it also produced 
needless poverty and misery. This contradiction between wealth and poverty 
occurred because capitalism divided society into two basic classes. 
• The proletariat  was essentially the working class, working in factories 
and mines, often for little compensation. 
• The bourgeoisie  included the middle class and investors who owned 
machinery and factories where workers produced goods. 
Marx said that market competition drove the bourgeoisie to exploit the 
proletariat for the sake of higher profits. Because the bourgeoisie owned the 
means of production , such as machines, factories, mines, and land, they 
received most of the wealth produced. The proletariat, who did the physical 
and dangerous work, received very little, just enough to survive. Marx exhorted 
the proletariat to recognize their shared interest as a class and take control of 
the means of production and share the wealth they created fairly. 
For Marx, socialism would replace capitalism. It, then, would later be 
replaced by a final stage of economic development, communism , in which all 
class distinctions would end. (Connect: Create a chart comparing utopian and 
Marxist thought. See Topic 5.1.
Ottoman Response to Industrialization
In the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was no longer at the peak of its political 
power. However, it maintained some economic power. Sultan Mahmud II  
ruled 1808±18 reformed the Ottoman system. In 1826, he abolished the 
corps of Janissaries, which had opposed him, and developed a new artillery 
unit trained by Europeans. When the Istanbul Janissaries revolted, he had 
them massacred. The abolition of the feudal system in 181 marked the final 
defeat of the Janissaries’ power. Military officers were no longer able to collect 
taxes directly from the populace for their salaries. Instead, tax collections 
went directly to the central government, which paid military personnel, thus 
ensuring their loyalty.
335 REACTIONS TO T HE INDUSTRI AL ECONOM Y Mahmud’s reforms also included building roads and setting up a postal 
service. To fight the power of popular religious charities, he set up a government 
directory of charities. To operate the central administration of government,  
Mahmud II created European-style ministries.
Reorganization  Reforms after Mahmud during the years 18±186 
are called Tanzimat  reorganization and include the following changes:
• The sultans in this period worked to root out long-standing and 
widespread corruption in the central government.
• Education had long been under the control of the ulama, the educated 
class of Muslim scholars. Now the sultans created a secular system of 
primary and secondary schools. Secular colleges were also gradually 
set up, one for each special purpose: military, engineering, translation, 
civil service, and so on.
• The sultans codified Ottoman laws and created new ones, including a 
commercial code 1850 and a penal code 1858. These codes made it 
easier for foreigners to do business in the empire. 
• In 1856, the sultan issued an edict known as the Hatt-i Humayun 
Ottoman Reform Edict that updated the legal system, declaring 
equality for all men in education, government appointments, and 
justice regardless of religion or ethnicity. The new legal system also 
regulated the millets , which were separate legal courts established by 
different religious communities, each using its own set of religious 
laws. Christians in the Balkans protested the new regulations because 
they felt that their autonomy was being threatened. Muslims, on 
the other hand, protested the reforms because they conflicted with 
traditional values and practice.
Although not achieving religious equality, the Tanzimat reforms continued 
to have wide effects in areas such as the military and education. These effects 
continued even when succeeding sultans blocked other reforms. 
Ottoman Economy and Society  The reforms under Mahmud II and the 
Tanzimat occurred during a period of economic change in Turkey. After the 
Napoleonic wars ended in 1815, prices for food and other crops declined in the 
Ottoman Empire. However, a global economy was in place, built partially on 
the flow of wealth into the Mediterranean from European colonial expansion 
in the Americas. Ottoman workers were increasingly paid in cash rather than 
in goods. Financial enterprises such as banking increased. These economic 
changes occurred along with the slow spread of industrialization. The growth 
of industry affected men and women differently. For example, most new 
industrial jobs went to men.
Legal reforms also benefited men more than women. Traditionally, under 
shariah, women had been allowed to hold money, to gain from inheritance, 
and to receive some education. The reforms of Mahmud II made the law more 
secular, and ended the right of women to distribute their property or cash 
through trusts to family members. 
336 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONAlthough women had indirect control of their property, the new 
nonreligious courts ended even these limited rights. Many reforms had no 
effect on women. Since women were excluded from the army, the professions, 
higher education, and commerce, reforms in these areas did not affect them 
directly. The Tanzimat reforms of 18 did not even mention women.
Opposition to Reform  When Sultan Abdulhamid took power in 186, 
he supported the efforts at internal reforms. He accepted a new constitution 
for the Ottoman Empire and he continued to emphasize primary education and 
secularization of the law. A few girls were allowed to attend girls’ secondary 
schools by the beginning of the 20th century.
However, fearful of any “seditious” reform, the sultan and the central 
government maintained tight control over the empire. Abdulhamid eventually 
drove the advocates for reform, known as “Young Turks” into exile. Further, 
his government whipped up anger against minority groups, particularly 
Armenians and Assyrian Christians. Between 18 and 186, between 
100,000 and 250,000 Armenians were killed throughout several provinces in 
what has become known as the Hamidian massacres. For this bloodshed, he 
received the nickname the Red Sultan.

Like other powers, China under the Qing Dynasty felt pressure to modernize. 
Its major reform effort of the late 1th century was known as the Self-
Strengthening Movement . It developed as a way for the government to face 
the internal and external problems confronting China. Government officials 
hoped to strengthen China in its competition with foreign powers by advancing 
its military technology and readiness and by training Chinese artisans in the 
manufacture of items for shipyards and arsenals. French and British advisors 
helped Chinese reform efforts. A stable government capable of collecting 
revenue allowed China to repay debts and participate in trade. For the Chinese, 
their existence as an independent state depended upon economic solvency. 
Reform in the name of modernization seemed inevitable. 
As another step toward reform, the Chinese government set up its own 
diplomatic corps and a customs service to help collect taxes on imports and 
exports. The government’s strategy was to graft some modern ideas and 
technology onto Chinese tradition rather than to create major change.
Demand for reform increased after China’s defeat in the Sino-Japanese 
War 18±185. People formed clubs to call for change. One club, led by a 
civil servant named .ang Youwei, was able to meet with Emperor Guangxu . 
Kang convinced the ruler to support a set of sweeping reforms known as the 
Hundred Days of Reform . The reforms included the abolition of the outdated 
civil service exam, the elimination of corruption, and the establishment of 
Western-style industrial, commercial, and medical systems. 
Cixi’s Initial Conservatism  However, the emperor’s aunt and adopted 
mother and the most powerful political figure in the country, Empress 
337 REACTIONS TO T HE INDUSTRI AL ECONOM Y Dowager Cixi , was a conservative. At first, she opposed the reforms and 
wanted to protect traditional social and governmental systems. In a coup d’état, 
Cixi imprisoned the emperor and immediately repealed his reform edicts. 
She feared the influence of foreigners, so she resisted any new technology 
that would extend their reach into her country. For example, she stopped the 
extension of railroad lines and telegraph networks into the Chinese interior.
Reform of the Civil Service  However, toward the end of Cixi’s rule, she 
came to recognize the problems with the civil service system. It was designed 
according to Confucian ideals of respect for rank and hierarchy as well as values 
of civic participation and action. By the 19th century, though, the wealthy were 
using the civil servants to get favors. Revenue dropped off for the government 
as a result of bribes going into the pockets of corrupt civil servants. Moreover, 
non-qualified persons were purchasing civil service posts. China abandoned 
nearly 2,500 years of tradition, one that had yielded an educated bureaucracy of 
scholar-gentry. In spite of this concession, the empress’s overall conservatism 
caused her to fail to cope with demands of modernity in China.
China and Foreign Powers  Unlike Turkey, where Europeans had 
little to gain from either passage or opposition to progressive reforms, in 
China, Europeans encouraged change. When reforms were met with the 
conservatism of Empress Cixi and the 1900 Boxer Rebellion against foreign 
influence see Topic 6.2, the Chinese government, including its provincial 
governors, continued to modernize, with some help from American and 
European advisors. Weakened by internal rebellion and fearing encroachment 
from Japan, China had to accept territorial “protection” from Western powers, 
who in return demanded trade concessions. 
In 111, the Chinese chose to become a republic. See Topic .1. In 
addition, they resisted being swallowed up by their external enemies. China’s 
attempts to preserve its territorial integrity benefited from the efforts of 
the United States to maintain stability in Asia by preventing Japan from 
encroaching farther on its territory after the Russo-Japanese War of 105. 
U.S. efforts were exemplified by the Treaty of Portsmouth, which settled the 
war and was negotiated with the help of President Theodore Roosevelt. 
Resistance to Reform in Japan
Just as China ended its long-standing civil service system, the Japanese also 
ended a traditional system of exercising authority. In 181, Japan gave samurai 
a final lump-sum payment and legally dissolved their position. They were no 
longer fighting men and were not allowed to carry their swords. The bushido , 
their code of conduct, was now a personal matter, no longer officially condoned 
by the government.
Some samurai adjusted to the change by serving the government as 
genros , or elder statesmen. Others, particularly those from the provinces of 
Satsuma and Choshu, resisted the change. They defended their right to dress 
and wear their hair in traditional ways and to enjoy relative autonomy from 
338 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONthe centralized government. The last battle between the samurai shogunate 
forces and those loyal to the emperor occurred in the 180s. Dismayed by 
defeat, the samurai became the main victims of Japan’s rapid modernization. 
Ironically, some of their leaders were the same people who had supported the 
Meiji Restoration in the 1860s. 
Rise and Decline of Liberalization  Some reforms in Japan worked better 
than others. The new schools quickly improved literacy rates, the economy 
rapidly industrialized, and the country began to develop traits of democracy 
such as a free press, strong labor unions, and respect for individual liberties. 
However, by the 120s, army officers again began to dominate the government.
Limits to Reform  
Turkey, China, and Japan each followed its own path in responding to 
industrialization in the 19th century. Of the three, Turkey began to make 
changes earliest. However, Sultan Abdulhamid, though he supported reforms 
at first, became more conservative during his time as ruler. China began to 
make changes only later in the century. In contrast to Abdulhamid, China’s 
Cixi started as skeptical of reform but became more liberal during her reign. 
Japan responded to industrialization with dramatic, rapid changes beginning 
with the Meiji Restoration in 1868. However, the speed and depth of its 
reforms prompted a backlash from conservative members of society.

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:   EXPLAIN THE HISTORIC AL SITUATION   
OF A SOURCE 
Knowing the historical situation of a source—including the other 
contemporaneous opinions swirling about a topic—helps situate the 
source in a spectrum of viewpoints. 
In 18, Samuel Laing, a British politician, wrote a paper called 
“The Causes of, and Remedies for, the Existing Distress of the Country,” 
in reaction to evidence “that as wealth increases, poverty increases in a 
faster ratio.” He proposed systematic, government sponsored emigration 
as one solution to the problem. 
5ead the e[cerpts Eelow from /aing¶s paper and then answer the 
questions that follow to help explain its historical situation. 
“The truth appears to be, that while emigration is advocated simply 
as a matter of profit and loss, and regarded as a cheap and convenient 
mode of shoving misery out of sight, it is not calculated to answer 
the selfish ends of its promoters. But if it were taken up in a spirit of 
charity, and as part and parcel of a comprehensive scheme for raising 
the condition of the poorer classes, and prosecuted by the government 
and society from a sense of duty rather than of self-interest, there seems 
every ground for hoping that emigration might become an instrument 
of great good, not only to the colonies, but to the mother country. If 
the owners of estates, for instance, where the agricultural population 
is clearly redundant, were, with a disinterested view to the good of 
their dependants, to assist them in emigrating, and if the government 
was, under proper guarantees, and with proper discrimination, to 
cooperate in the enterprise, there seems no doubt that much practical 
good might be accomplished. Colonies . . . might be planted in the 
North American settlements with every prospect of success; indeed 
with the certainty that those who, if they had remained at home, 
would have been squalid paupers, will, in a few years, become a 
body of respectable freeholders, and an important acquisition to their 
adopted country. By the same process the condition of those at home 
might be greatly ameliorated, provided active steps were taken by 
the landlord to eradicate the evils which had led to the multiplication 
342 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONof a pauper population. A great writer has said, “Do the duty that 
lies nearest to thee, and already, in so doing, thy next duty will have 
become clearer.” . . . Every step taken in advance with a good motive 
and in a right direction, clears away a thousand difficulties. When it 
is clearly seen that a measure will benefit human beings, and injure 
nothing but abstract theories, let the government strike boldly in, and 
the theories will soon veer round and prove that what has been done 
is right. . . .  Do not let the government risk the certain good that 
is effected under the present system by any hazardous experiment 
unsanctioned by experience; but, on the other hand, do not let them 
sink spellbound under the influence of theories of laissez faire , and 
omit opportunities of doing practical good where it is in their power. 
Let them leave the principle of self-interest to do all the good it can, 
but remember that it can never be a substitute for the higher principles 
of duty and charity, and that emigration, like any other expedient for 
the relief of society, must be conducted in a disinterested spirit of 
enlightened benevolence, in order to accomplish its object.”

Society and the Industrial Age
Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for the well-housed and fed  
to draw round the bright fire and thank .od they were at home" and for  
the homeless, starving wretch to lay him down and die. 
—Charles +icRens, 6liver Twist (1839)
Essential Question:   How did industrialization cause change in e_isting 
social hierarchies and standards of living?
Industrialization affected not only governments and economies but also 
people’s everyday lives. Dickens illustrated the sharp contrasts in the industrial 
age between the emerging middle class, who enjoyed the benefits of the new 
prosperity, and the urban poor, who were ill-treated. Young children worked 
in factories. Women experienced substantial changes in their lifestyle. Poor  
women took jobs in domestic service and the textile industries, spending less 
time at home. Middle-class women, with no economic responsibilities, felt 
limited by household roles. The middle classes also started spending their free 
time seeking entertainment in theaters, concert halls, and sports facilities. 
(σecWsRn8UEDn$UeDs 
For the first half of the 1th century, urban areas grew rapidly and with little 
planning by governments. This development left a damaging ecological 
footprint and created inhumane living conditions for the cities’ poorest 
residents, members of the working class. Working families crowded into 
shoddily constructed tenement  apartment buildings, often owned by factory 
owners themselves. Tenements were often located in urban slums  (areas 
of cities where low-income families were forced to live, where industrial 
by-products such as polluted water supplies and open sewers were common. 
In conditions like these, disease, including the much-feared cholera, 
spread quickly. So did other public health menaces, such as fire and crime 
and violence. Over time, municipalities created police and fire departments, 
and several public health acts were passed to implement sanitation reform 
by creating better drainage and sewage systems, supplying cleaner water, 
removing rubbish, and building standards to reduce accidents and fire.  
Eventually, industrialization led to increased living standards for many. 
While life could be very hard for poor and working class people, the growing 
middle class had increased access to goods, housing, culture, and education. 
344 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe wealth and opportunities of the middle class were among the reasons 
people continued to stream into cities from rural areas. People living in poverty 
on farms or in villages hoped to find a better life in an urban center. Many did.
Effects on Class Structure  As industrialization spread, new classes of 
society emerged in Britain. At the bottom rungs of the social hierarchy were 
those who labored in factories and coal mines. They were known as the 
working class . Though they helped construct goods rapidly, the technology of 
interchangeable parts and the factory system’s division of labor had deprived 
workers of the experience of crafting a complete product. In comparison to 
the artisans of earlier generations, workers needed fewer skills, so managers 
viewed them as easily replaceable. Competition for jobs kept wages low.

the second industrial revolution. See Topic ..

Industrialization created new jobs in factories upper and offices lower that pulled people from rural 
areas into urban areas, a process that continues around the world today.
345 SOCIET Y AND THE INDUSTRI AL AGE345While industrialization created low-skilled jobs, it also required those who 
managed the production of goods to have education and sophisticated skills. 
A new middle class emerged, consisting of factory and office managers, small 
business owners, and professionals. They were white-collar  workers, those 
held by office workers. Most were literate and considered middle class.
At the top of the new class hierarchy were the industrialists and owners of 
large corporations. These so-called captains of industry soon overshadowed 
the landed aristocracy as the power brokers and leaders of modern society.
Farm Work Versus Factory Work  Before industrialization, family 
members worked in close proximity to one another. Whether women spun 
fabric in their own homes or landless workers farmed the fields of a landlord, 
parents and children usually spent their working hours close to each other. 
Industrialization disrupted this pattern. Industrial machinery was used in large 
factories, making it impossible to work from home. Thus, individuals had to 
leave their families and neighborhoods for a long workday in order to earn 
enough money to survive. 
In a factory, work schedules were nothing like they were on a farm or 
in a cottage industry. The shrill sounds of the factory whistle told workers 
when they could take a break, which was obviously a culture shock to former-
farmers who had previously completed tasks according to their own needs and 
schedules. Considering that workers commonly spent 14 hours a day, six days 
a week in a factory, exhaustion was common. Some of these exhausted workers 
operated dangerous heavy machinery. Injuries and death were common.
Effects on Children  The low wages of factory workers forced them to 
send their children to work also. In the early decades of industrialization, 
children as young as five worked in textile mills. Because of their small size 
and nimble fingers, children could climb into equipment to make repairs or into 
tight spots in mines. However, the dust from the textile machinery damaged 
their lungs just as much as it did to adults’ lungs. 
Children who worked in coal mines faced even more dangerous conditions 
than those in mills:
• They labored in oppressive heat, carting heavy loads of coal.
• Coal dust was even more unhealthy to breathe than factory dust.
• Mine collapses and floods loomed as constant threats to life.
Effect on Women’s Lives  The Industrial Revolution affected women in 
different ways, depending on their class position. Because their families needed 
the money, working-class women worked in coal mines until the practice of 
hiring women for coal mining was declared illegal in Britain in the 180s and 
were the primary laborers in textile factories. Factory owners preferred to hire 
women because they could pay them half of what they paid men.
Middle-class women were spared factory work, yet in many ways they 
lived more limited lives than working-class women. Middle-class men had to 
346 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONleave the house and work at an office to provide for their families. If a wife 
stayed at home, it was an indication that her husband was capable of being the 
family’s sole provider. Being a housewife thus became a status symbol. 
By the late 1800s, advertising and consumer culture contributed to a “cult 
of domesticity” that idealized the female homemaker. Advertising encouraged 
women to buy household products that would supposedly make the home a 
husband’s place of respite from a harsh modern world. Pamphlets instructed 
middle-class women on how to care for the home, raise children, and behave 
in polite society and urged them to be pious, submissive, pure, and domestic. 
For working-class women the cult of domesticity was even more taxing, as 
they had to manage the household, care for their children, and work full time. 
Industrialization also spurred feminism. When men left a community to 
take a job, their absence opened up new opportunities for the women who 
remained home. One political sign of this feminism came in 188 at Seneca 
Falls, New York, when 00 people met to call for equality for women.
Effects on the Environment  The Industrial Revolution was powered by 
fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Although burning coal 
produced more energy than burning wood, the effects were extremely harmful. 
Industrial towns during the late 19th century were choked by toxic air pollution 
produced by coal-burning factories. Smog smoke and fog from factories led 
to deadly respiratory problems. Water became polluted, also, as the new 
industries dumped their waste into streams, rivers, and lakes. Cholera, typhoid, 
and other diseases ravaged neighborhoods. 
Source:  John Leech, 3unch, July , 1858.
Before London built a system of public sanitation, the Thames 
River, the source of the city’s drinking water, was filled with 
sewage and industrial pollution. The river spread deadly diseases 
throughout the city.
347 SOCIET Y AND THE INDUSTRI AL AGEIndustrial Revolution’s Legacy
The Industrial Revolution brought about profound changes. Mass production  
made goods cheaper, more abundant, and more easily accessible to a greater 
number of people than ever before. Growth of factories attracted people to 
move, both from rural areas to cities and from agrarian countries to industrial 
ones. Both low-skilled workers and high-skilled professionals moved to take 
advantage of new opportunities provided by industrialization. 
However, the natural by-products of industrial production polluted air 
and water supplies. Industry forever changed the nature of work and the lives 
of workers. Working populations became concentrated in urban centers, as 
opposed to being spread among rural areas. The workplace shifted from homes 
to factories, dramatically altering family life. The Industrial Revolution created 
a new²and many said unequal²working relationship between workers and 
owners. More crowding and more poverty brought more crime.
Global inequalities also increased because of industrialization. States that 
industrialized early desired more raw materials to power their production. They 
searched the world for items such as cotton and rubber. By exploiting overseas 
natural resources, they undercut early industrialization in Egypt, China, and 
India, and ushered in a second wave of colonization.

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that 
follows. 
“Five Points was the most notorious neighborhood in nineteenth-century 
America. Beginning in about 1820, overlapping waves of Irish, Italian, 
and Chinese immigrants flooded this district in what is now New York’s 
Chinatown. Significant numbers of Germans, African Americans, and Eastern 
European Jews settled there as well. All but forgotten today, the densely 
populated enclave was once renowned for jam-packed, filthy tenements, 
garbage-covered streets, prostitution, gambling, violence, drunkenness, and 
abject poverty. . . . 
Few historians devoted much attention to Five Points in the early years of 
the twentieth century. Academic historians concerned themselves primarily 
with politics and law. Slums, immigrants, and crime²none of these subjects 
seemed important enough to merit scholarly analysis.”

Continuity and Change  
in the Industrial Age
Capital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power.
—-riedrich Engels and 2arl 4ar_, The Communist Manifesto (1848)
Essential Question:   How did the Industrial 9evolution demonstrate both 
continuity and change? 
The Industrial Revolution, an era that began in the late 18th century, produced 
economic, social, cultural, political, and environmental changes not seen 
since the first Agricultural Revolution, more than 10,000 years before. The 
Industrial Revolution changed how goods were produced, how people earned 
their living, and how businesses were structured. The Industrial Revolution 
also caused sweeping social changes. 
An expansion of the middle class in industrial economies occurred. A 
working class, dependent on factory jobs, emerged. The role of women was 
transformed, as they made up a significant portion of the factory work force. 
Politically, the Enlightenment proved to be a long-lasting and influential 
intellectual movement that influenced events during the Industrial Revolution. 
The effects of the Industrial Revolution inspired the works of economic 
and political philosophers like Adam Smith and .arl Marx. The Industrial 
Revolution altered life locally as well as globally. Rivalries among nations, 
which had existed previously, continued into and throughout this era leading 
to political and economic conflict. Additionally, rigid social orders, based on 
economic or ethnic status, continued within industrial economies. 
Economic Continuities and Changes
The Industrial Revolution transformed the production and consumption of 
goods. In Western Europe, access to abundant natural resources, transoceanic 
trade routes, and  financial capital combined with an increasing population 
resulted in a leadership role in industrialization. The Scientific Revolution, 
begun in the previous era and influenced by scientific knowledge transferred to 
the West from the Islamic world, helped to bring about inventions that would 
lead to the establishment of the factory system and the mass production of 
goods. However, the invention of the machines used to mass produce goods 
352 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONmeant a change from the era of skilled artisans working at their own pace 
to craft unique and well-built products. With automation, many factory jobs 
required only unskilled labor working on an assembly line doing repetitive 
tasks to produce identical goods. As a result, many consumer goods were now 
more readily available, more affordable, and in greater variety than ever before.
Industrialization Around the World  New methods of industrial 
production associated with the Industrial Revolutions spread and changed the 
economies of other areas of the world outside of Western Europe. As a result, the 
United States, Russia, and Japan experienced increased industrial production 
and built more railroads. In the cases of Japan and Egypt, industrialization was 
encouraged through state sponsored efforts to modernize their economies with 
varying degrees of success. However, the industrial economies of Western 
Europe and the United States continued to dominate the global economy while 
the manufacturing output of Middle Eastern and Asian economies declined.

Sources of Raw Materials  Some regions of the world continued to 
produce minerals, crops, and other resources as they had done in previous eras. 
Latin America and Africa were important sources of minerals and metals used 
in industrial processes. Cotton from Egypt, South Asia, and the Caribbean was 
grown and exported to Great Britain and other European countries. Southeast 
Asian areas continued to be sources for spices but also for rubber, tin, and 
timber. 
New sources of raw materials were also made possible by the invention 
of the steam ship and steam locomotive. Maritime trade was made faster and 
cheaper due to steam power, and railroads built in interior regions helped to 
access and exploit previously untapped natural resources. Other inventions 
such as the telegraph helped to improve communication across these far flung 
and sometimes remote areas. These and other technological innovations made 
the movement of goods and people easier and cheaper and led to an increase 
in global trade.
Western Europe  Western Europe began to change from a mercantilist 
economic system designed to make a country wealthy through tightly regulated 
trade to a capitalist system in which private companies were freer to pursue 
their own profits. Philosopher and political economist Adam Smith believed 
that the private pursuit of profit would result in general prosperity . 
353 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGE 353While industrialization and capitalism produced great wealth overall, many 
people had hard, short lives. In response to this suffering, many reformers 
argued for changes. One of these was the German philosopher Karl Marx. 
He argued that the working class, whom he called the proletariat, were being 
exploited by the capital class, or bourgeoisie. He called for workers to unite 
and take control of the means of production, a change that would revolutionize 
society.
Social Continuities and Changes
Industrialization caused significant changes to social structures of Western 
Europe and, later, the United States. Prior to industrialization, the population 
of Western Europe was primarily rural and involved in farming. As factories 
were built in urban centers in greater numbers, mainly due to a new steam 
engine design invented by James Watt, agricultural workers soon migrated to 
find employment in these industrial cities. 
Physical Labor  As the Industrial Revolution spread, the need for factory 
labor increased. An industrial working class emerged. Members of this class 
were paid low wages, worked long hours in poor conditions, lived in squalid 
housing, and resided in crowded and polluted parts of the new industrial cities. 
Much of their daily lives revolved around their jobs in the factories. This was 
a change from the agricultural economy of the previous era, when farmers 
and farm laborers could more or less set their own work schedule based on 
the seasons. In response to their working and living conditions, the working 
class formed worker associations, or labor unions, that used labor strikes and 
collective bargaining to win concessions on wages, working conditions, and 
hours from the factory owners.
2Ifice /aEor  Along with the emergence of the industrial working class, 
the Industrial Revolution also changed the size and make-up of the middle class. 
In pre-industrial society, the middle class was often made up of professionals 
such as doctors and lawyers as well as local merchants or shopkeepers. As 
industrialization occurred, while these pre-industrial occupations continued 
to be part of the middle class, other occupations were added to it, including 
the middle-management of factories, banks, insurance companies, shipping 
agents, and, of course, trading companies.

Source:  Adapted from World Bank data.
354 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe Wealthy  The Industrial Revolution also transformed social 
hierarchies in the period from 1750 to 1900. Wealthy owners of industrial 
companies who made money from investments rather than from land overtook 
the aristocracy in wealth and prestige. These capitalists soon made up the 
highest of the upper class in industrial societies. 
Gender and Industrialization  The role of women changed significantly 
during the Industrial Revolution. In an agricultural economy, women provided 
labor at critical times during the planting and harvesting season but were rarely 
paid for their labor. In a proto-industrial system, women were able to earn 
some extra money in the manufacturing of textiles. 
Despite these activities, women were still mainly supported by the labor 
and income of their male family members. This pattern began to change with 
the Industrial Revolution. Due to the low wages paid by the factories, all family 
needed to work. Hence, a woman’s income was just as important to the welfare 
of the family as a man’s. Despite the importance of female labor, women were 
often paid less than men for the same work and denied high-wage jobs.
Political Continuities and Changes
As during the Enlightenment, philosophers living through the Industrial 
Revolution era developed new political ideas about the individual and 
government. During the Industrial Revolution, most people had little to no 
formal voice in government such as the right to vote, but they demanded the 
ability to exercise their “natural rights.” Among these were the rights to petition, 
protest, and rebel against their governments. Sometimes these protests were 
based on nationalism and the right of people to choose their own governments. 
However, political movements of the Industrial Revolution were almost 
always connected to the interests of the growing middle and working classes. 
For example, labor leaders advocated formation of international unions so that 
workers in various countries could unite to demand higher wages. But the 
vast majority of the protests were for the right to vote and to end aristocratic 
privileges. A series of uprising throughout European cities in 188, known as 
the Revolution of 188, were a sign of the growing interest in more pluralistic, 
more democratic governments :
• In Paris , protesters called for greater freedom of the press. 
• In Berlin, people wanted a parliament to check the monarch’s power. 
• In cities in Hungary, people demanded freedom from Austrian control. 
People wanted not just general natural rights, but specific rights recognized by 
their government.
Voting Rights  As the number of wealthy capitalists and the middle class 
grew, more frequent calls for greater political participation were made. As 
a result, some political reforms were enacted that included the extension of 
voting rights to city dwellers, non-landowners, and, eventually, to the working 
355 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGE class. However, the voting franchise was extended to male voters only. 
Women would not gain the right to vote in Western industrial countries until 
the early 20th century. Sometimes voting rights were extended through the 
legislative process, as in Great Britain. However, in other instances, protests 
and revolutions forced governments to enact political reforms. 
One factor in all of these political reforms was the size and influence of the 
middle class. In countries where the middle class was large and economically 
significant, democracy emerged. However, in regions where the middle class 
was small or insignificant, dictatorships remained in place. 
Source:  Public Domain
The economic changes of industrial capitalism countered the laborer’s vision of social 
equality, citizenship, and independence. As two distinct classes developed, the rich and the 
poor, advocating for equal rights became a movement that spanned the 1th century.
Protections for Workers  Reforms that began in one country often 
spread. For example, Otto V on Bismarck’s social reforms spread throughout 
Europe and eventually the world. All industrializing nations grappled with the 
new challenges that factory life introduced. Among these nations, Germany 
implemented the most comprehensive set of social reforms to protect 
industrial workers. Under the leadership of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, 
Germany started workers’ accident compensation insurance, unemployment 
insurance, and old age pensions for employees. Bismarck was concerned 
that if his government did not address these problems, socialists and more 
radical citizens would demand stronger government action. 
356 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITION
Another effect of the expansion of voting rights was the emergence of 
political parties that represented the working class. These “labor parties” 
advocated for minimum wages, shorter work days, paid sick and holiday 
leave, better working conditions, and health and unemployment insurance.

UNIT 5 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  DID OTTOM AN REFORMS  SUCCEE D?
The industrial era was a period of massive political, economic, and 
social upheaval. Historians have argued over how effectively the 
Ottomans adapted to these changes. 
A Long, Slow Decline  Historians in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries, living in a period when Turkish power was low, generally 
viewed the Ottoman Empire as the “sick man of Europe.” Some mark 
its fall as beginning with its failure to conquer 9ienna in 168. In 
his widely used college textbook, $ +istory of the 0odern :orld 
first published in 150, R. R. Palmer stated that the long slide of 
the 1th-century Ottoman Empire put the empire “behind modern 
industrial nations in its scientific, mechanical, material, humanitarian, 
and administrative achievements.” Its reforms did little to stop the 
slide.
Strength Through Reforms  Recent historians, living in a period 
of increasing Turkish influence in the Middle East, have seen more 
vigor in the Ottomans than did previous scholars. They have credited 
1th-century reforms with providing a stable foundation for the 
success of the Republic of Turkey, established in 12. For example, 
the historian Donald Quataert argued that the Ottomans stabilized 
the economy and gave Europeans more confidence to invest in 
railroads, ports, and public utilities. These projects provided a modern 
infrastructure for the empire, although at the loss of some autonomy 
for the Ottoman government.
While acknowledging the difficulties that capitulations caused, 
Suraiya Faroqhi emphasized that “more recent studies prove that 
Ottoman commerce and artisan production were more varied than they 
might appear at first glance.” Justin McCarthy called the changes in 
the Ottoman system “neither small nor cosmetic,” pointing to “human 
rights, a constitution, Christians in high office, a parliament, the 
middle class in charge of the state, and the power of Islam eroded” as 
evidence of progress on multiple fronts. McCarthy further suggested 
that the empire fell not because of lack of successful reforms or the 
failure to modernize but because of the military power of its rivals.
Develop an Argument:  Evaluate the extent to which historical 
evidence supports one of the perspectives on Ottoman reform.

WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  DEVELO P A THESIS
The thesis statement must 1 assert a historically defensible claim, 2 lay 
out a line of reasoning, and  directly address the topic and focus of the 
task.  
Historically Defensible Claim  A  t h e s i s ,  o r  c l a i m ,  i s  a  n o n f a c t u a l  
statement asserted to be true. It is a statement about which people can 
disagree because it requires an explanation or evaluation. A historically 
defensible claim is one that can be supported with sound historical evidence. 
For example, Marx forwarded the claim that the materials and modes of 
production rather than philosophical ideas shape social structures. He used 
examples from history of the influence of changing production methods²
hunter-gatherer, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, and communism²as 
evidence to defend his claim.
Line of Reasoning  A thesis or claim also conveys a line of reasoning for 
the argument that will be used to explain the relationships among pieces of 
evidence. In Marx’s thesis, for example, the line of reasoning is causation  
the modes of production cause the structure of social relations. Other lines of 
reasoning include comparison and continuitychange. Each line of reasoning 
needs to be embedded in a strong thesis statement. Here are two examples:
&omparison thesis statement  Social relations fundamentally differed  
under the production methods of the feudal system and the production 
methods of capitalism.
&ontinuitychange thesis statement  W h i l e  s o c i a l  r e l a t i o n s  c h a n g e d  
as the purposes and modes of production changed, the resulting social 
structures continued to have an underprivileged class, a continuity with 
long-lasting effects. 
Topic and Focus of Task A strong thesis or claim directly addresses 
the topic and focus of the task. It must be limited to the time and geography 
stated in the long essay question. 
Part of the task will be to “evaluate the extent to which . . . . .” In this 
context, “extent” means degree, scale, magnitude, scope, size, or level. To 
determine extent, you need to carefully analyze and evaluate the similarities 
or differences, continuities or changes, or causes and effects, depending on 
the task you are given. Which were most important, significant, influential, 
long-lasting, or in other ways largest in scope" And, just as important, what 
are your reasons and evidence for evaluating the extent as you did? 
/ong (ssay 4uestion Develop an argument that evaluates the extent 
to which the course of state-sponsored industrialization in Egypt under 
Muhammad Ali and in Japan under the Meiji regime between 150 and 
1900 was similar or different. 
 359
7hesis that clearly addresses the topic and tasN  Between 1750 and 
100, the governments of both Muhammad Ali in Egypt and the Meiji 
regime in Japan employed state-sponsored programs of industrialization 
to help them create a European-style military, but a difference in the nature 
and purpose of each program’s products led to significantly differing 
courses. (Note that the word significantly begins to address extent.
Application: Read the following long essay question and a thesis

The position of women in Japan is apparently unlike that of the sex in 
all other parts of the East, and approaches more nearly their European 
condition. The Japanese women are subjected to no jealous seclusion, 
hold a fair station in society, and share in all the innocent recreations of 
their fathers and husbands. The minds of the women are cultivated with 
as much care as those of men; and amongst the most admired Japanese 
historians, moralists, and poets are found several female names. But, 
though permitted thus to enjoy and adorn society, they are, on the other 
hand, >kept in@ complete dependence on their husbands, sons, or other 
relatives. They have no legal rights, and their evidence is not admitted in 
a court . . . At home, the wife is the mistress of the family; but in other 
respects she is treated rather as a toy for her husband’s amusement, than 
as the rational, confidential partner of his life.

When I encountered silk workers I was even more shocked than I had been 
by the situation of weaving workers.… At busy times they go straight to 
work on rising in the morning, and not infrequently work through until 
12:00 at night. The food is six parts barley to four parts rice. The sleeping 
quarters resemble pigsties, so squalid are they. What I found especially 
shocking is that in some districts, when business is slack, the workers are 
sent out into service for a fixed period, with the employer taking all their 
earnings… Many of the girls coming to the silk districts pass through the 
hands of recruiting agents. In some cases they may be there for two to 
three years and never even know the name of the neighboring town. The 
local residents think of those who have entered the ranks of the factory 
girls in the same manner as tea house girls, bordering on degradation.  If 
one had to take pity on just one group among all these workers, it must be 
first and foremost the silk workers.Enrollment in Japanese Primary Schools

de Sagasta, 186.
Every day we see men with unscrewed-on heads who have no love for order 
nor true affection for their families, who spend their lives on gambling and 
rambling around cold-bloodedly, they leave their children on the street, 
because their wives, whose sphere of action is reduced only to love and 
suffering, do not know how to oppose forcefully the squandering nor how 
to stop in time the abuses from their husbands nor save in this way the 
interests of their children. 
Emancipation protects women from this catastrophe. A woman, 
educated in the management of business, even if she does not make a 
profession of it, knows how to prevent or remedy the problem once it 
has occurred. She does not go through the pain of seeing her children 
begging for bread from door to door, because she has a thousand resources 
to satisfy their needs honorably. She goes to work, and thus she raises 
her children without the need for others’ support that could lead her to 
corruption and to spend a miserable and humiliating life. Love can dry 
tears and sweeten the bitterness of life, but it cannot satisfy hunger nor 
cover nakedness. Love cannot be developed on a sublime and heroic level 
unless one is prepared to work, to put sentiment into practice. 
Emancipation, conceding to women great rights, instills in them a 
great heart that takes them closer to the true perfection to which men can 
aspire here on earth. A woman who, to her physical beauty and spirituality, 
adds education and the ability to act for good in her vast sphere, is the 
ideal type imagined by Christianity, and she is going to carry out progress 
in this century.

Industrialization from  
c. 1750 to c. 1900
Understand the Context
Technological change provided the framework for the historical changes 
between 1750 and 1900. Industrial growth fostered a wider exchange of 
commodities, the expansion of overseas empires, and new patterns of migration. 
Imperialism  Competition among industrializing states increased the 
desire for colonies. Some states strengthened control over existing colonies, 
as the British did in India. Empires expanded into new regions, evident in 
the rapid European colonization of Africa. Economic imperialism emerged 
in parts of Latin American and Asia. Europeans used Social Darwinism and 
religious ideologies to justify their control of others. In general, the Portuguese 
and Spanish declined, the British and French and Russia expanded, and the 
United States and Japan emerged as new empires. 
Resistance to Imperialism  In response to imperialism, anticolonial 
movements developed as part of a larger trend of emerging nationalism. 
Resistance to imperialism took many forms, including rebellion, the 
establishment of peripheral states, and religiously influenced responses. These 
movements set the stage for decolonization in the 20th century.
Migration  New means of transportation and the pull of economic 
opportunity spurred long-distance migration and a larger trend of global 
urbanization. Although many people chose to migrate, coerced migration 
was also common, as slavery and indentured servitude continued to play a 
significant role in the global economy. Increased migration changed the 
demographics and cultures of both sending and receiving societies. 17501850 180019001780

Rationales for Imperialism
Take up the White Man’s Burden—  
Send forth the best ye breed—  
Go bind your sons to exile  
To serve your captives’ need;  
To wait in heavy harness,  
6n fluttered folk and wild·  
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,  
Half-devil and half-child.
—Rudyard Kipling, “The White Man’s Burden,” 1899
Essential Question:   What ideologies contributed to the development of 
imperialism between 1750 and 1900?
Rudyard Kipling was an English writer who spent his youth in British 
colonial India. The speaker in his poem urged the whites of Western countries 
to establish colonies for the good of the “inferior” people of the word. Whether 
Kipling actually supported this idea is not clear, but his poem was used to justify 
it. Proponents justified European colonization using a variety of explanations, 
from a belief in nationalism, a desire for economic wealth, a sense of religious 
duty, and a belief they were biologically superior. These various motives for 
establishing overseas empires—a policy called imperialism —would lead to 
conflicts in Asia and a scramble to colonize Africa. See Topic 6.2.
Nationalist Motives for Imperialism
In Western Europe, revolutions, the rise of nationalism, and the creation of 
nation-states characterized much of the 1800s. With a strong sense of identity 
and loyalty to a state, many world powers boldly asserted authority over other 
territories. Building an empire in Asia or Africa was one way for a country to 
assert its national identity in the global arena. Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, 
and the Netherlands would long possess overseas colonies.
European Nationalism  After losing its American colonies, Britain looked 
for new lands to open to settlement. In 188 the first British settlers arrived in 
the colony of New South Wales on the east coast of the island continent of New 
368 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONHolland²today’s Australia. See Topic 6.2. Britain was also expanding its 
influence in South Asia, gradually taking control of India from the East India 
Company. By 1857 Britain controlled the entire Indian subcontinent. Ceylon 
Sri Lanka, Burma Myanmar, the Malay States which included Singapore, 
and parts of Borneo in Southeast Asia were also under British control.
France compensated for its humiliating defeat by Prussia in the Franco-
Prussian War 180±181 by expanding its overseas territories. It had already 
occupied Algeria in Northern Africa, New Caledonia and other islands in the 
South Pacific, Senegal in Western Africa, and Indochina in Southeast Asia.
Italy and Germany were newly unified states in the late-1th century. 
Each wanted colonies not only for economic and strategic reasons but also 
for prestige. However, neither began acquiring an empire until the mid-1880s.
While Spain had led the quest for colonies in the first wave of imperialism 
during the 16th and 1th centuries, its power was greatly diminished by the 
19th century. It did not play a dominant role in this second wave of imperialism.
Japan in East Asia  Japan asserted its nationalist pride through incursions 
into Korea. This irritated China, a country that had exerted a strong presence 
in .orea for centuries. The conflict grew into the Sino-Japanese War  18±
185. Japan’s victory gave it control of .orea. Japan also seized Taiwan, 
which was known as Formosa  from the time of Portuguese colonization in the 
16th century until the end of World War II. Connect: Identify three events of 
the late 19th and early 20th centuries that encouraged the growth of Japanese 
nationalism. See Topic 5.8.  
Cultural and Religious Motives for Imperialism
The Kipling quotation that opens this topic epitomized the condescending 
attitudes shared by imperialism’s proponents. Referring to colonized peoples 
as children reflected how colonizers saw themselves as benevolent protectors 
on a “civilizing mission” rather than invaders. 
Racial Ideologies and the Misuse of Science  The attitudes of whites 
toward others were a form of racism. Colonial powers generally believed 
that they were inherently superior to those they subjugated. Pseudoscientists, 
people who present theories as science that are actually incompatible with the 
scientific method, strengthened these attitudes. They claimed to have proof 
of the intellectual and physical inferiority of nonwhite races. Phrenologists , 
people who studied skull sizes and shapes, believed that a smaller skull size 
proved the mental feebleness of Africans, indigenous Americans, and Asians. 
These ideas have been proven false.
Legitimate science was also subverted to support imperialism. British 
scientist Charles Darwin’s  19th-century theory of evolution by natural 
selection stated that over millions of years, biological competition had “weeded 
out” the weaker species in nature and that the “fittest” species were the ones 
that survived. Some thinkers adapted Darwin’s theory of biological evolution 
to society, creating the theory known as Social Darwinism. While Darwin 
369 RATIONALES FOR IM PERIALISMhimself was not a Social Darwinist, advocates used the “survival of the fittest” 
theory to argue that the spread of European and U.S. power proved the 
biological superiority of whites. Writers and politicians then used Social 
Darwinism to justify further imperialism by powerful countries.
Cultural Ideologies  Based on technological superiority over indigenous 
societies, colonial powers felt justified in superimposing aspects of their 
own cultures on their colonies. For administrative purposes, many colonies 
combined into a single colony peoples from several cultures who often spoke 
different languages and had different customs. Colonizers introduced their 
own language, which helped to unify these often diverse colonies. They also 
introduced their political, educational, and religious institutions and exerted 
other cultural influences on architecture and recreational activities. Expressing 
the belief of many, Congregationalist minister Josiah Strong wrote in 1885, “Is 
there room for reasonable doubt that [the Anglo-Saxon] race . . . is destined 
to dispossess many weaker races, assimilate others, and mold the remainder, 
until, in a very true and important sense, it has Anglo-Saxonized mankind?”  
Religious Motives  Missionaries were among the most tireless “civilizing” 
influences. Like the Spanish and Portuguese Catholic missionaries who 
combined conquest and evangelism during the Age of Discovery, British

and Feejee Islands, and Through the Colonies of New Zealand, New South Wales  188.
The image of a New Zealand village reflects how Europeans viewed native village people as simple. 
370 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONProtestant missionaries of the 18th and 19th centuries also participated 
in colonization. Critics charged that missionaries supported imperialism 
by persuading people to give up their traditional beliefs, such as ancestor 
veneration, and adopt the faith of most Europeans, Christianity. This change 
in religion could pave the way for others who were more focused on economic 
gain. In response, missionaries pointed out that they commonly combined 
religious and humanitarian efforts:
• Missionaries often set up schools for instruction in religion that also 
taught secular subjects, which prepared students to become teachers, 
lawyers, and other professionals. 
• Many missionaries provided improved medicines and medical care. 
• Some missionaries, most famously David Livingstone  from Scotland, 
worked in Sub-Saharan Africa to end the illegal slave trade. 
Economic Motives for Imperialism 
Some people believe the ideological motivations were more accurately 
justifications for pursuing economic motives. Seeking ways to maximize 
profits, companies chartered by the British, French, and Dutch governments 
signed commercial treaties with local rulers in India, East Africa, and the East 
Indies. These treaties gave the Europeans the right to establish trading posts and 
forts to protect their interests. Originally, these companies formed primarily 
for the spice trade. Many companies had quasi-governmental powers, raising 
armies and conquering territory to form colonies. 
As the Industrial Revolution transformed European economies, the desire 
for the sources for raw materials and markets for manufactured goods provided 
by colonies enticed imperial powers to increase their expansion. Imperial 
powers often competed with one another over the best potential resources, 
markets, and trade as demands for low-wage labor, access to markets, and 
control of natural resources increased.
East India Company  The English monarch granted the  East India 
Company  EIC a royal charter in 1600 giving it a monopoly on England’s 
trade with India. After driving the Portuguese out of India, the company traded 
primarily in cotton and silk, indigo, and spices. 
Eventually, the EIC expanded its activities from the Persian Gulf to East 
Asia. By the beginning of the 18th century, it had become the major agent of 
British imperialism in India, and after 18 it became the British government’s 
managing agency in India. Starting in 1620, the EIC engaged in the slave trade, 
and during the 19th century it illegally exported opium to China in exchange 
for tea. The East India Company is often referred to as the English East India 
Company or, after 1707, the British East India Company to distinguish it from 
the Dutch East India Company.
371 RATIONALES FOR IM PERIALISMDutch East India Company  In 1602 the Dutch government gave the 
Dutch East India Company  9ereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, or 
VOC  a monopoly on trade between the Cape of Good Hope at the southern 
tip of Africa and the Straits of Magellan at the southern tip of South America. 
The 9OC concentrated on the islands around Java, replacing the Portuguese 
who had controlled the region. Corruption and debt led the government to take 
control of the company’s possessions in 1799, creating the Dutch East Indies 
today’s Indonesia.
The “New Imperialism”  After the Industrial Revolution and the 
Napoleonic Wars, Britain was the leading economic power throughout the 
first half of the 1th century and already had a sizable colonial empire. Its 
colonies provided raw materials such as cotton, wool, jute, vegetable oils, and 
rubber for its factories, as well as foodstuffs such as wheat, tea, coffee, cocoa, 
meat, and butter for its growing cities. Its colonies—especially settler colonies 
such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa—also provided markets for 
British manufactured goods.
As the Second Industrial Revolution progressed, other nations began 
to challenge Britain’s economic lead. They looked to Asia, Africa, and the 
Pacific to expand their markets, provide raw materials for their factories, and 
food for their growing urban populations.Source:  Getty Images

372 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS 
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“The English in India had always been somewhat more detached from the 
indigenous environment than the Dutch in Indonesia. After the 1780s, their 
isolation gradually intensified and became obvious with the decline in status 
of Eurasian Anglo-Indians. . . . The club became the center of British social 
life in India and the other Asian colonies during the 9ictorian era. In clubs, one 
could feel like a gentleman among other gentlemen while being served by a 
native staff. . . . The large clubs of Calcutta remained closed to Indians until 
16. This type of color bar was especially disturbing because it excluded 
from social recognition the very people who had carried their self-Anglicizing 
[becoming more like the British] the furthest and loyally supported British 
rule. . . . 
In most regions of Africa . . . the Europeans saw themselves as foreign 
rulers separated from the African cultures by an abyss. . . . A process of great 
symptomatic significance was the rejection of the highly educated West 
Africans who had worked with the early mission. They had envisioned the 
colonial takeover as an opportunity for a joint European-African effort to 
modernize and civilize Africa. Instead, they were now, as ‘white Negroes,’ 
despised by all.”

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that 
follows. 
“Gentlemen, we must speak more loudly and more honestly! We must say 
openly that indeed the higher races have a right over the lower races. . . . 
I repeat, that the superior races have a right because they have a duty. 
They have the duty to civilize the inferior races. . . . In the history of 
earlier centuries these duties, gentlemen, have often been misunderstood; 
and certainly when the Spanish soldiers and explorers introduced slavery 
into Central America, they did not fulfill their duty as men of a higher  
race. . . . But, in our time, I maintain that European nations acquit themselves 
with generosity, with grandeur, and with sincerity of this superior civilizing 
duty. I say that French colonial policy, the policy of colonial expansion, the 
policy that has taken us under the Empire [the Second Empire, of Napoleon 
III], to Saigon, to Indochina [French Southeast Asia], that has led us to Tunisia, 
to Madagascar±I say that this policy of colonial expansion was inspired  
by . . . the fact that a navy such as ours cannot do without safe harbors, 
defenses, supply centers on the high seas . . . . Are you unaware of this? Look 
at a map of the world.” 
Jules Ferry, speech on French colonial expansion, 188
A Identify ONE motive Ferry offers for imperial expansion in the 
period 150±100 other than an economic motive.

arguments of the period 150±100.
C Explain ONE way in which the French Revolution influenced 
French imperialism in the period 150±100.
2. Answer all parts of the question that follows.

development of imperialism between 1750 and 1900.
STATE E XPANSION 375
6.2
State Expansion
You must singularly insist on their total submission and obedience, avoid 
developing the spirits in the schools, teach students to read and not to reason.
—King Leopold II (1835–1909), Letter to Christian Missionaries, 1883
Essential Question:   By what processes did state power shift in various 
parts of the world between 1750 and 1900?
King Leopold II of Belgium wanted the Belgian government to conquer 
colonies in a large swath of central Africa—the Congo Basin. The government 
was ambivalent, so Leopold established a private colony himself. However, 
the Belgian Parliament found the king’s rule so abusive that in 1908 it took 
control of the region away from him. Similarly, the Dutch government revoked 
the charter of the Dutch East India Company for abusing its power to make 
treaties, build forts, and maintain armed forces in Southeast Asia. While these 
unusual shifts of power were taking place, other European governments, as 
well as the United States, Russia, and Japan, continued territorial expansion 
through conquest and settlement.
Imperialism in Africa
Europe had a long-standing relationship with Africa because of the slave trade. 
Although most European countries had declared the importation of Africans 
as slave labor illegal by the early 1800s, Europeans continued to export guns, 
alcohol, and other manufactured goods to Africa and import African natural 
resources, such as palm oil, gold, and ivory. England desired palm oil in 
particular because it kept the machinery in its textile factories from becoming 
rusty. In the last part of the 19th century, European tastes for African diamonds 
and ivory kept European empires thriving throughout the African continent. 
Connect: Write a paragraph connecting late 1th century imperialism with the 
African slave trade. See Topic ..
Expanding Beyond Trading Posts  For most of the 1800s, European 
presence in Africa was restricted to trading posts, with a few exceptions. The 
French seized Algeria in 1830, declaring they wanted to prevent pirate attacks. 
Dutch immigrants had lived in South Africa since the 1600s and British 
colonists became more numerous starting in the early 1800s. In the second 
376 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONhalf of the 1800s, European nations expanded their presence in Africa with the 
help of better military technology. For example, the discovery of quinine,  a 
medicine that treats the tropical disease malaria, reduced the danger of living 
in warm, humid regions. The steamship assisted the early trips of individual 
explorers and business owners.
British Control of Egypt  Europeans had long dreamed of dramatically 
shortening the water route to Asia by building a canal connecting the Red Sea 
with the Mediterranean Sea. A 100-mile-long canal could save a trip around 
the entire continent of Africa. This feat was finally accomplished in 186 when 
the Suez Canal was completed. A French company managed the project, but 
most of the labor was performed by as many as 1.5 million Egyptians. Many of 
them were corvée laborers,  unpaid workers who were forced to work on the 
project as a form of taxation. Thousands died in the course of ten years. When 
unrest in the region threatened British commercial interests and the operation 
of the canal in 1882, Britain seized control of Egypt away from the Ottoman 
Empire.
British West Africa  Great Britain established several colonies in West 
Africa before the mid-19th century. In these colonies, Britain spread Western 
education, the English language, and Christianity:
• Sierra Leone  was established in 1787. It was a home for freed people 
from throughout the British Empire who had been enslaved. 
• Gambia was established in 1816. It, and Sierra Leone, were used as 
bases to try to stop the export of enslaved people from the region. 
• Lagos became a crown colony in 1861 and served as a base for the 
annexation of much of the rest of what is now Nigeria. 
• Britain acquired parts of what is now Ghana in stages. For example, the 
Gold Coast  became a crown colony in 18, but the Asante Empire to 
the north did not come under British control until 1901.
Britain used both diplomacy and warfare to expand its empire. For 
example, in 1873, Britain signed a treaty with King Jaja of Opobo in present-
day Nigeria—an area rich in  palm oil—recognizing him as ruler and agreeing 
to trade terms favorable to both sides. Other African rulers agreed to similar 
diplomatic treaties with foreign powers, believing they were protecting their 
sovereignty and trade rights. However, as European competition increased for 
control of African lands, the treaties came to be meaningless and warfare was 
the inevitable result as Africans resisted takeover but met with overpowering 
military strength.
The French in Africa  France drove the Ottomans out of Algeria in 1830. 
By 1870 Algeria had become a settler colony , attracting Spanish, Italian, and 
Maltese as well as French immigrants. In the 180s the French also established 
trading posts in Guinea, the Ivory Coast, and Niger to compete with British 
West African colonies.
377 STATE E XPANSION 377The European Scramble for Africa  
Tensions mounted among industrialized European nations as they competed 
for natural resources in Africa. Leaders feared that the “Scramble for Africa,” 
the competing efforts of Europeans to colonize Africa, would lead to war.
Berlin Conference  Unlike many German leaders who had imperial 
ambitions, Otto von Bismarck had little interest in colonies. However, he 
did want to keep peace in Europe. So in 188±1885, he hosted the Berlin 
Conference, a meeting of European powers to provide for the orderly 
colonization of Africa. No Africans were invited to the conference. European 
powers peaceably agreed to colonial boundaries and to the free movement of 
goods on Africa’s major rivers such as the Niger River and the Congo River.
In most of the continent, Europeans established colonial borders that were 
merely artificial lines that meant little to the people who lived within them. 
These borders divided long-unified societies into different colonies and united 
longtime rival groups into the same colonies. When these colonies became 
independent states in the later 20th century, these borders became the cause of 
extensive warfare by making national unity very difficult.
South Africa and the Boer Wars  During the Napoleonic Wars  
1±1815, the British replaced the Dutch in the Cape Colony  in the southern 
tip of Africa. The British introduced the use of English but allowed people to 
use the Dutch language as well. Many of the Dutch-speaking Afrikaners , the 
descendants of 17th-century Dutch settlers, moved east of the Cape Colony, 
where they came into conflict with indigenous groups, including the =ulus, 
with whom they fought several wars.
Throughout the 19th century, the British and Afrikaners continued to 
fight over land. This conflict came to a boil in the Boer Wars  1880±1881, 
18±102. These conflicts were bloody and brutal. In the end, the British 
army drove the Afrikaners and the Africans from their lands, forcing many into 
refugee camps. These settlements, which were segregated by race, came to be 
known as concentration camps . Medical care and sanitation were very poor, 
and food rations were so meager that many of the interned died of starvation. 
Once news arrived in Britain about the wretched conditions of the camps, 
activists tried to improve the lives of displaced refugees. However, while 
white camps received some attention, conditions in black camps remained 
terrible. Of the 100,000 blacks interned in concentration camps, nearly 15,000 
perished. 
By the end of the Boer Wars, the British had absorbed the settler colonies 
of British and Afrikaner peoples and the black Africans in the southern tip of 
Africa into its empire. Millions of Afrikaner and black African farmers had 
been displaced onto poor land, making it hard for them to earn a decent living.  
Congo  By 1875, Western European nations were poised to penetrate 
Africa’s interior. King Leopold II  of Belgium ruled 1865±10 oversaw the 
invasion and pacification of the Congo in central Africa in order to persuade 
the Belgian government to support colonial expansion. Unlike other European 
378 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONrulers, .ing Leopold owned the colony personally, using colonial officials 
against indigenous Congolese and a ruthless system of economic exploitation 
that allowed him to keep the profits made by the Congo Free State , which 
totaled some 220 million francs 1.1 billion in today’s dollars. 
9isitors to the colony reported on the brutal conditions for the laborers who 
were forced to harvest ivory and rubber. For example, Leopold’s agents severed 
the hands of Congolese workers in order to terrorize others into submission. 
Workers who could not meet their quotas were beaten or killed, while others 
were worked to death. Although the term slavery  was not commonly used 
when describing imperial activities, laborers in the Congo often received no 
payment for their backbreaking work, and their spouses were held captive so 
that the workers would not run away. As many as 8 million people perished 
under King Leopold’s reign of terror in the Congo. In 1908, Belgium took over 
control of the Congo as a regular colony, and conditions improved. Connect:

379 STATE E XPANSIONIndependent Countries  By 1900, the only African countries unclaimed 
by Europeans were Abyssinia  modern-day Ethiopia and Liberia,  a country 
founded by formerly enslaved people from the United States. Because 
Liberia had a dependent relationship with the United States, it was not fully 
independent. Italy attempted to conquer Abyssinia in 1895, but the native 
forces were too strong for the Italians.
Imperialism in South Asia
Portugal, France, and England competed for control of India’s spices, gems, 
and trade with regions to the east. Portugal established a coastal trading port 
on the southwestern coast, in Goa, in the early 16th century. However, it 
never extended its control inland. France established trading ports in the 17th 
century. However, its loss to Britain in the global conflict known as the Seven 
Years’ War  156±16 drove the French out of India. 
England’s East India Company  EIC, steadily encroached on the land 
of the weak Mughal Empire. Eventually, Britain controlled the entire Indian 
subcontinent, from Pakistan in the west to Kashmir in the north to Bengal in 
the east to the island of Ceylon  Sri Lanka in the south. At first, the EIC’s 
small forces of British soldiers protected the firm’s employees. As the British 
crept into India’s interior, they began recruiting native Indian soldiers, called 
sepoys, to join the British colonial army. However, as explained in the next 
topic, the sepoys ignited an unsuccessful rebellion against the British in 1857. 
Imperialism in East Asia
China did not experience imperialism in the same way that South Asia or 
Africa did. It maintained its own government throughout a period of European 
economic domination. As a result of superior military strength, European 
nations carved out sSheres oI influence  within China over which they had 
exclusive trading rights and access to natural resources. See Topic 6.5.  
Internal problems within the Qing government, such as the Taiping Rebellion , 
made it easier for foreign countries to dominate the economic affairs of China. 
During the Taiping Rebellion, which began in 1850, failed civil servant 
applicant Hong Xiuquan and starving peasants, workers, and miners attempted 
to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. With the help of some warlords along with 
French and British intervention, the Qings prevailed in 186.
In the midst of the war, adding to China’s internal problems, the Yellow 
River Huang He changed course, flooding farmland in some areas and leaving 
others open to drought. With agricultural lands devastated, famine followed 
during which many Chinese starved to death. Adding to the troubles, the 
bubonic plague broke out at this time. By the end of the fighting, the rebellion 
was probably responsible for the deaths of more than 20 million people, more 
than half of whom were civilians.
Between 1899 and 1901, an anti-imperialist group called the Boxers—
named because many of their members practiced martial arts, which were 
380 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONknown as Chinese boxing—was attacking Chinese Christians and Western 
missionaries. The Empress Dowager Cixi see Topic 5.8 encouraged the 
Boxers and in 1900 ordered that all foreigners be killed. However, most of 
the estimated 100,000 people who were killed were Chinese Christians. Only 
about 200±250 foreigners died during the Boxer Rebellion . The empress and 
the Qing court suffered a humiliating defeat that undermined their legitimacy. 
Western powers and influence continued to erode Chinese sovereignty in 
subsequent years.
Japan  Industrialized countries outside of Europe also desired colonies. 
Japan had sharply limited its contact with other countries since the early 
1600s. In 185, United States Commodore Matthew Perry came to Japan in 
large warships to secure a treaty that opened Japanese ports to trade. In the 
following decade, Japan overthrew its traditional government in an uprising 
called the Meiji Restoration and began to rapidly industrialize, hoping it could 
become strong enough to protect its distinctive culture. As part of this change, 
Japan began to look outward for territorial gains. An island nation with few 
natural resources and little arable land, it sought lands and natural resources to 
fuel its own growth. 
Partly to relieve population pressures in rural areas and partly to gain 
knowledge of foreign places, Japan’s government began to encourage 
agricultural workers to take seasonal contract work on Hawaii, Guam, and 
other locations. Through a  Colonization Society  established in 1893, leaders 
began plans to establish colonies in Mexico and Latin America. Japan set up 
an empire in East Asia that included parts of China, Korea, Southeast Asia, and 
Pacific islands that lasted from the 180s until the end of World War II.
Imperialism in Southeast Asia
Portugal and Spain originally controlled European trade with Southeast Asia. 
After 1600, the power shifted and the English and Dutch supplanted them.
The Dutch in Southeast Asia  Dutch imperialism in Southeast Asia 
began with a private company, just as English imperialism in South Asia had. 
In 161 the Dutch seized control of the Spice Islands now part of Indonesia, 
so called because they produced spices such as cloves and nutmeg that were in 
great demand in Europe. The Dutch East India Company  VOC  took over 
the spice trade from the Portuguese, setting up several trading posts on the 
archipelago. Although the trade was very profitable for the 9OC, corruption 
caused the company to go bankrupt by 1800. Once the 9OC folded, the Dutch 
government itself took control of the Dutch East Indies . By the mid-19th 
century, the islands were producing cash crops to support the Dutch economy.
Plantations produced tea, rubber, and sugar for export purposes, a situation 
that limited rice cultivation and eventually created enormous hardships  for 
Indonesian farmers who relied on rice to survive. Although criticism of this 
agricultural policy forced the Dutch government to implement humanitarian 
reforms, the reforms failed to meet the needs of the Indonesian people.
381 STATE E XPANSIONThe French in Southeast Asia  The French government also wanted an 
imperial presence in Asia. After it defeated China in the Sino-French War of 
188±1885, France gained control of northern 9ietnam. France later pressured 
Siam to cede control of the territory of modern-day Laos to the French. By the 
180s, France controlled Cambodia, Laos, and all of modern-day 9ietnam. 
Together, these nations became known as French  Indochina . French motives 
for imperialism were like those of the Dutch—a desire for cash crops. Soon 
rubber plantations dotted the landscape of Cambodia and 9ietnam.
The British in Southeast Asia  British influence in Southeast Asia began 
when the East India Company acquired the island of Penang off the northwest 
coast of the Malay Peninsula in 186. In 182, the British founded the port of 
Singapore. Chinese immigrants soon made it the most important seaport in 
Southeast Asia. Eventually, Britain controlled all of the Malay Peninsula, 
Burma Myanmar, and northern Borneo. British investors were originally 
attracted by the region’s mineral wealth, especially tin and gold. In addition, 
Britain promoted the planting of cash crops such as pepper, tobacco, palm oil, 
and rubber. By the end of the 19th century, Malaya  was the world’s greatest 
producer of natural rubber.
Siam  Only one Southeast Asian nation, Siam —modern-day Thailand—
managed to escape the clutches of 19th-century European imperialism. Siam’s 
monarchs deftly handled diplomatic relations with the British and French, 
whose colonies bordered Siam. The Siamese government also instituted a 
series of modernizing reforms, similar to 
Japan’s Meiji reforms. The government 
began to industrialize by building 
railroads, and it set up Western-
style schools in order to create an 
educated populace who could 
fill the ranks of an efficient 
government bureaucracy.
Australia and New 
Zealand
After the loss of its American 
colonies, Britain began to 
consider the possibility of 
establishing various kinds of 
settlements in Australia , finally 
deciding to locate a penal 
colony  there. In 188 the first 
convicts, along with some free 
settlers, arrived in Australia, and 
the east coast became known as 
New South Wales. In the 1820s,

dia Commons
On the royal coat of arms for Siam, the kingdom 
was represented by a three-headed elephant.
382 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONBritain took possession of the entire continent. For decades, the chief economic 
activity of the colony was to house convicts. The discovery that Australia was 
well-suited to producing fine wool provided a new industry, and in the 180s 
larger numbers of free settlers began to arrive. The discovery of copper in 182 
and gold in 1851 helped spur growth.
When Britain annexed the settler colony of New Zealand  in 1839, it was 
made a part of New South Wales. Two years later, after the Treaty of Waitangi  
guaranteeing that the rights of the original Maori  inhabitants would be 
protected by the British crown, it became a separate colony. Nevertheless, open 
war broke out as European settlers encroached on Maori lands. The Australian 
gold rushes provided a market for foodstuffs raised by New Zealand farmers, 
both European and Maori. For many years, sheep grazing and dairy farming 
provided the base for the colony’s economy.

During the 19th century, the United States continued taking land from 
indigenous peoples, as Europeans had done since Columbus arrived. One 
notorious episode was the forced relocation of Eastern Woodlands peoples from 
the Southeast to a new Indian Territory  in what is now Oklahoma. So many 
Native Americans died from exposure, malnutrition, disease, and exhaustion 
that this forced migration became known as the Trail of Tears .
In 182, President James Monroe issued the Monroe Doctrine , which 
stated that European nations should not intervene in the affairs of the countries 
in the Western Hemisphere. Implied in the doctrine was a desire to be an 
imperial power in the Americas. This desire played out in the U.S. war with 
Mexico 185±188, through which the United States gained vast territories in 
the Southwest from Mexico.
Expansion on Land  White Americans believed that they had a Manifest 
Destiny ²a natural and inevitable right to expand to the Pacific Ocean. The 
United States bought Alaska from Russia in 186. Two years later, in 186, the 
completion of a transcontinental railway spurred development of the American 
West. As white settlers moved westward to take advantage of offers of free land, 
Native Americans were forced onto reservations. By 1893, the U.S. Bureau of 
the Census declared that the western frontier was now closed.
Expansion Overseas  The United States turned its focus to lands overseas. 
The United States was not a global power for most of the 19th century. The 
Second Industrial Revolution brought newfound prosperity to the young 
republic. Economic considerations, as well as feelings of nationalism and 
cultural superiority, drove Americans’ desire for territorial conquest. A group 
of American planters overthrew Hawaii’s constitutional monarchy in 1895, but 
the islands did not become a U.S. territory until 1900. In the meantime, the U.S. 
victory in the Spanish-American War  in 1898 brought Guam, Cuba, Puerto 
Rico, and the Philippines under U.S. control. President Theodore Roosevelt, a 
proponent of Social Darwinism, was especially eager to expand U.S. influence 
383 STATE E XPANSIONthroughout the Western Hemisphere. The 10 Roosevelt Corollary to the 
Monroe Doctrine stated that if countries in Latin America demonstrated 
“instability,” the United States would intervene. It did several times. For 
example, in 10 Roosevelt sent U.S. troops to occupy a Caribbean island 
nation, the Dominican Republic, until it repaid its foreign debts.

Russian Expansion
Empress Catherine II “the Great” set out to expand the Russian Empire in 
all directions during her reign 162±16, annexing about half of Poland as 
well as territory won from the Ottoman Empire. Her grandson, Alexander I, 
annexed Finland, Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and part of Armenia during 
his reign 1815±1825. 
Beginning in the 10s, Russian merchants sponsored voyages to Alaska. 
In 1808 the Russian-American Company, which was similar to the British and 
Dutch East India companies, established permanent headquarters in Novo-
Arkhangelsk modern-day Sitka. From there they explored the west coast of 
384 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONNorth America. In 1811, they selected the site for a settlement at Fort Ross in 
California. They abandoned Fort Ross in 18 and in 186 sold Alaska to the 
United States, ending Russian plans to make the North Pacific a Russian sea.
Russia continued to push into Central Asia during the 19th century, 
leading to an intense rivalry between the Russian and British empires as they 
competed unsuccessfully for dominance in Afghanistan—a rivalry that came 
to be known as the Great Game . Russia also succeeded in annexing lands 
from China, most notably a large portion of Manchuria.

declared their independence and maintain it, and whose independence we 
have, on great consideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could 
not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in 
any other manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light than 
as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States.”

—Túpac Amaru II, c. 1780
Essential Question:   How and why did internal and e_ternal factors influence 
state building between 1750 and 1900?
In response to European imperialism, nationalist movements emerged 
throughout South America, Africa, and Asia. Often the movements’ leaders, 
such as T~pac Amaru II in Peru, had European style educations. Many had 
developed a deep understanding of such Enlightenment ideals as natural 
rights, sovereignty, and nationalism. Some worked in official posts in colonial 
government. Some colonial elites used the education that imperialism provided 
them to drive out their conquerors in the 20th century. Anti-imperial resistance 
often created new states. 
Nationalist Movements in the Balkans
At its most powerful, the Ottoman Empire stretched deep into Europe. However, 
by the early 19th century, it was losing its hold on its remaining European 
territories in the Balkan Peninsula . Inspired by the French Revolution, ethnic 
nationalism emerged as the peoples of the Balkans sought independence. The 
growing ethnic tensions in the region set the stage for World War I.
Serbia 1815 and Greece 182 won independence only after long wars. 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Bulgaria all rebelled against 
Ottoman rule. In 1877, Serbia and Russia came to their aid in what was to be 
the last and most important Russo-Turkish War. After the war ended in 1878, 
the Treaty of Berlin freed Bulgaria, Romania, and Montenegro but placed 
Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Austria-Hungary.
389 INDIGENOUS RESPONSES TO STATE E XPANSIONResistance and Rebellion in the Americas
In North America, following the British victory over the French in the French 
and Indian War, the British issued the Proclamation of 1763.  This act reserved 
all the land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River for 
Native Americans²the first time a European government had recognized the 
territorial rights of indigenous peoples. However, the British colonists resented 
this interference in colonial affairs. After winning independence, citizens of the 
new United States soon overran the Ohio and Illinois river valleys, displacing 
Native Americans.
Cherokee Nation  After 1800, the Cherokee assimilated to white settler 
culture, adopting colonial methods of farming, weaving, and building. They 
developed a syllabic alphabet for writing their language. Within a short time, 
almost the entire tribe was literate, and the Cherokee Phoenix  became the 
first Native American newspaper in the United States. The Cherokee nation  
adopted a constitution based on the U.S. Constitution. 
But assimilation did not save the Cherokee from white Americans’ greed. 
After the discovery of gold in 1829 on Cherokee land in Georgia, attempts 
began to force the Cherokee off their land. After Congress passed the Indian 
Removal Act  of 1830, the Cherokee and other Southeast Native American 
tribes were forced to relocate to what is now Oklahoma. U.S. expansionism 
continued, affecting many Native American peoples.
Ghost Dance  In the northwestern United States around 186, prophet-
dreamers among the Northern Paiute Indians announced that the dead would 
soon come back and drive out the whites, restoring the lands and traditions of 
Native Americans. The Ghost Dance  rituals of dances and songs were meant 
to hasten this event. The Ghost Dance spread from the Sierra Nevada to the 
Missouri River and from northern Texas to the Canadian border. It reached the 
Sioux by 1890, coinciding with the Sioux revolts. Sioux warriors wore “ghost 
shirts.” However, the Ghost Dance resistance movement fell at the Wounded 
.nee Massacre in 180, marking the end of the Indian Wars.
Túpac Amaru II  José Gabriel Condorcanqui was a cacique  hereditary 
chief in southern Peru. He was descended from the last Inca ruler, T~pac 
Amaru, and took the name Túpac Amaru II . Born around 10, he continued 
to identify with his Inca heritage in spite of having received a formal Jesuit 
education. In 1780 he arrested and executed a colonial administrator, charging 
him with cruelty. This action led to the last general Indian revolt against Spain, 
which at first was supported by some criollos  Spaniards born in America. The 
revolt spread throughout southern Peru and into Bolivia and Argentina before 
T~pac Amaru II and his family were captured in March 181. They were taken 
to Cuzco, the former capital of the Inca empire. There Túpac Amaru II was 
forced to watch as his wife and sons were executed before he was tortured and 
executed himself.
390 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONFrench Intervention in Mexico  In 186 a group of Mexican conservatives 
conspired with Emperor Napoleon III of France to overthrow the liberal 
government of Benito Juárez , a full-blooded =apotec. Mexico owned France 
money, and Napoleon III wanted to further his imperialist ambitions. He 
offered to make a European noble, Archduke Maximilian, the emperor of 
Mexico. Maximilian was crowned on June 10, 186. After three more years of 
war, Mexicans forced the French to withdraw from Mexico. Maximilian was 
executed on June 1, 186, and Juirez resumed the presidency.
South Asian Movements
By the mid-19th century, sepoys,  Indian soldiers under British employ, made up 
the majority of the British armed forces in colonial India. Most were Hindus or 
Muslims. In 185, the British began using rifle cartridges that had been greased 
with a mixture of the fat of cows and pigs. Hindus, who view the cow as sacred, 
and Muslims, who refuse to slaughter pigs, were both furious. Both were 
convinced that the British were trying to convert them to Christianity. Their 
violent uprising, known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 or the Sepoy Mutiny, 
spread throughout cities in northern India. The British crushed the rebellion, 
killing thousands, but the event marked the emergence of Indian nationalism.
After the Indian Rebellion, Britain also exiled the Mughal emperor for his 
involvement in the rebellion and ended the Mughal Empire. In its place, the 
British government took a more active role in ruling India. From 1858 until 
India won independence in 1, the British Raj, the colonial government, 
took its orders directly from the British government in London.
Under the Raj, many Indians attended British universities. In 1885, several 
British-educated Indians established the Indian National Congress. Though 
begun as a forum for airing grievances to the colonial government, it quickly 
began to call for self-rule. Connect: Compare the motives and outcomes of the 
Haitian Revolution with those of the Indian Rebellion of 185. See Topic 5.2.

The first meeting of the Indian National Congress in 1885 was dominated by 
Hindu representatives. As a result, many Indian Muslims were suspicious of it.
391 INDIGENOUS RESPONSES TO STATE E XPANSIONSoutheast Asian Resistance
By the 1880s, the only independent country remaining in Southeast Asia was 
Siam Thailand. The rest of the region was under the control of the Spanish, 
Dutch, British, and French.
Vietnam  From the beginning of French colonialism in the region, many 
9ietnamese resisted. By 188, when 12-year-old Ham Nghi became emperor, 
his top advisers were vocal critics of the French. The French soon tried to 
assert their control by raiding the royal palace, but the young emperor had been 
removed for safety. Ham Nghi’s supporters continued to resist French rule until 
he was captured in 1888 and exiled to Algeria. The resistance continued until 
1895 under Phan Dinh Phung, who became a hero to future revolutionaries in 
the 9ietnamese resistance movement.
Philippine Resistance  The Philippines  came under Spanish control in 
the 16th century, but there was no public education there until 186. However, 
wealthy Filipinos sent their sons to Europe to study. One of those young 
men, José Rizal , started a reform movement called Liga Filipina Philippine 
League in 182. Though the Liga was loyal to Spain, the Spanish feared 
it. They promptly arrested and executed Rizal, an action that shocked many 
Filipinos.
There had been numerous rebellions throughout the history of Spanish rule, 
but now, for the first time, Filipinos had nationalist ambitions and the education 
needed to carry them out. In 186 several revolts broke out in provinces around 
Manila, marking the beginning of the Philippine Revolution . The Spanish-
American War  broke out in 1898, and after a decisive American victory in the 
Battle of Manila Bay, exiled Filipino revolutionaries returned. Based on U.S.  
sympathy for Philippine independence, the rebels expected freedom.
However, the Treaty of Paris  ending the war merely transferred control 
of the Philippines from Spain to the United States. By the time the treaty was 
ratified in February 18, hostilities had broken out in what was to be known 
as the Philippine-American War . The war ended in a U.S. victory in 1902. An 
estimated 20,000 Filipino troops were killed, and more than 200,000 civilians 
died as a result of the war. Of the ,00 Americans who lost their lives, nearly 
two-thirds of them died of disease. Organized resistance continued until 106, 
but the Philippines remained a U.S. possession until 16. 
Resistance in Australia and New Zealand
The Aboriginal  people have been in Australia for an estimated 50,000 years 
and have the oldest continuous culture on Earth. At the time of European 
settlement, there may have been as many as 1 million people in 500 clans, 
speaking 700 languages. 
Australia  In 1788, the British began sending convicts and soldiers to 
establish colonies in New South Wales. The government instructed the settlers  
392 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONto treat the indigenous inhabitants kindly. However, the colonial government 
did not recognize indigenous land ownership. Further, because the indigenous 
inhabitants were not considered British subjects, they were not protected by 
law. Thousands of Aboriginal people were killed as they tried to defend their 
territory and resources from European settlers.
New Zealand  Compared to the Aboriginals in Australia, New Zealand’s 
Maori  were newcomers, having arrived from Polynesia in the 1th century. 
Under the 180 Treaty of Waitangi , Britain had promised to protect the 
property rights of the Maori. Within a short time, the Maori became alarmed 
by British settlement patterns, and the first of a series of Maori Wars broke 
out. The British were eventually able to overcome the Maori in 186. Relations 
deteriorated again in the 1850s as the Maori became reluctant to sell more 
land to settlers, fearing for their future. Ignoring the promise of the Treaty 
of Waitangi, the government attempted to pressure the Maori to sell land, 
sending troops in 1861 to dislodge the Maori from the property in question. 
Another decade of fighting ensued. The war ended in an uneasy peace in 
182, but by 100 the Maori had lost most of their land.
African Resistance
Organized African resistance to imperialism developed later than Indian 
resistance. One reason for this difference in timing is that European powers 
had been in India much longer than they had been in Africa. In addition, British 
colonial governments in India were partially run by Indians, while colonial 
governments in Africa were largely run by military officials from Europe. 
However, by the end of the World War I 11±118, Western-educated 
Africans had a shared identity and nationalism known as Pan-Africanism .
Sokoto Caliphate  In West Africa in the 18th century, rulers often mixed 
Islamic and traditional religious practices. In 180, a group of Muslim 
intellectuals led by Usman dan Fodio  15±181 started a drive to purify 
Islam among the Hausa tribes of the region. He created a caliphate with its 
seat at the new town of Sokoto. The Sokoto Caliphate  established the slave 
trade as a means of economic growth at a time when the British were trying 
to stop it. The British navy attempted to intercept the ships of the Sokoto 
Caliphate, free the enslaved people, and relocate them in their colony Sierra 
Leone. The Sokoto Caliphate was the largest African empire since the 16th 
century. It was finally subdued in 10 when the British made it part of their 
colony of Nigeria.
South Africa  From 1811 to 1858, the British fought the native Xhosa  
people, who did not want to be ruled by Europeans, whether Dutch or English. 
In 1856±185, in the region east of the Cape Colony, some of the cattle of 
the local Xhosa were getting sick and dying, perhaps from diseases caught 
from the cattle of the British settlers. The Xhosa began to kill their cattle 
and destroy their crops in the belief that these actions would cause spirits to 
remove the British settlers from their lands. Some 00,000 head of ;hosa 
393 INDIGENOUS RESPONSES TO STATE E XPANSIONcattle may have been killed. The immediate result of the Xhosa Cattle Killing 
Movement  was famine and the deaths of thousands of people. However, the 
British were not driven out of the area.
In the 1870s, the British fought the Zulu Kingdom, located on the South 
African coast of the Indian Ocean, which had become a well-organized and 
centralized state. At first, this Anglo-Zulu War went in favor of the Zulus, but 
eventually the British defeated them, and their lands became part of the British 
colony of South Africa.
Samory Touré’s War  In West Africa in 1868, Mande chieftain Samory 
Touré  180±100 led a group of warriors to establish a powerful kingdom in 
Guinea, extending it until the early 1880s. He opposed French attempts to 
annex West Africa, first fighting them in 188. The French finally succeeded 
but offered Samory their protection. When he was unable to extend his 
kingdom to the east, he again went to war with the French in 1891. After his 
forces were ejected, he tried to reestablish his kingdom in the upper Ivory 
Coast. The French finally captured him in 188 and sent him into exile.

394 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMahdist Revolt  In East Africa in 1881, a Sudanese Islamic cleric, 
Muhammad Ahmad  18±1885, declared himself the Mahdi , or “guided 
one,” who would restore the glory of Islam. The Sudanese had resented 
Egyptian rule for decades, and the arrival of the British in 1873 only fueled 
their resentment. Ahmad turned the political movement into a religious one, 
forming an army to fight against Egypt. By 1882, the Mahdist army had taken 
control of the area around the capital, Khartoum. The next year, a joint British-
Egyptian military expedition launched a counterattack against the Mahdists. 
The Mahdists finally overran the British-Egyptian forces in January 1885. 
After Ahmad’s death in June of that year, the Mahdist movement disintegrated, 
weakened by infighting among rival leaders. The British returned to Sudan  in 
186, and finally defeated the Mahdists in September 188.
Yaa Asantewaa War  Beginning in 1823, the British made several attempts 
to subjugate the Asante Empire  in present-day Ghana in West Africa. The first 
four were unsuccessful. The fifth and final war is known as the Yaa Asantewaa 
War or the War of the Golden Stool. It began in March 100, when the British 
governor of the Gold Coast demanded the Golden Stool, a symbol of national 
unity. Yaa Asantewaa  180±121, a mighty warrior queen, led a rebellion 
against the British. It was the last African war led by a woman, and it resulted 
in the deaths of 2,000 Asante and 1,000 British. The death toll was higher 
than in the first four wars combined. The war ended in September 100 with 
a British victory. Yaa Asantewaa was exiled, and Asante as Ashanti became 
part of the Gold Coast colony.

SOURCES
Perspective, or point of view, is a powerful filter of experience. Historical 
accounts from varying perspectives require historians to understand 
the significance of the point of view and use that understanding to 
determine how useful a source is, and for what purpose. For example, 
firsthand indigenous responses to state expansion between 150 
and 1900 provide historians with a perspective of the people whose 
lands and cultures were being taken over. At the same time, accounts 
of colonization solely through the lens of the colonizers would also 
provide a limited perspective. As the final word on what happened, each 
type of source has limitations. For this reason, historians are able to 
present a more accurate picture of the past when they examine sources 
with varying points of views and appreciate the significance of those 
perspectives.

Global Economic Development
Peruvian guano [bird droppings] has become so desirable an article to the

article to be imported into the country at a reasonable price. 
—U.S. President Millard Fillmore, December 2, 1850
Essential Question:   How did environmental factors contribute to the global 
economy between 1750 and 1900?
Economics was among the most influential of the several motives driving 
imperialism. Britain industrialized rapidly during the 1700s and 1800s. In 
order to feed industries’ desires for raw materials, such as cotton, copper, 
and rubber, Europe looked to Asia and Africa. American agriculture, as 
noted by President Fillmore, looked to South America for fertilizer. The 
people of these continents were also potential consumers of European 
and American manufactured goods. Finally, colonial peoples provided 
the labor for large-scale projects, such as building railroads or telegraph 
lines. Colonial workers were paid meager wages for difficult and dangerous 
labor. In short, natural resources, new markets, and low-wage labor drove 
economic imperialism.
Technological Developments
The Industrial Revolution did not just take place in factories. It affected 
transportation and communication as well. 
Railroads  Before the introduction of railroads , transportation from the 
interiors of colonies to coastal ports was by water or by roads. Most colonies 
had few roads, and those that existed were usually poorly maintained and 
often unusable during rainy seasons. Transportation by water was limited to 
coastal areas and river basins. The introduction of railroads lowered the cost of 
transporting raw materials for shipment to Europe. At the same time, railroads 
helped open up colonial markets for manufactured goods.
Europeans often pointed to their railroad projects as evidence that 
imperialism helped the peoples of Asia and Africa. However, providing new 
transportation technology to the colonies primarily served the interests of the 
399 GLOBAL ECONOMIC DE=ELOPMENTcolonizers. In India, the British built a complex railway network that stretched 
from the interior to the coasts in order to ship raw materials out of the country 
easily.
British-born Cecil Rhodes 185±102, founder of De Beers Diamonds, 
was an especially enthusiastic investor in a railroad project that was to stretch 
from Cape Town, in the Cape Colony of South Africa, to Cairo, Egypt. 
Connecting all of the British-held colonies with a transportation network could 
make governance easier and aid in mobilizing for war, if necessary. The project 
was never completed because Britain never gained control over all the land 
on which it was to be built. The overwhelming majority of railway workers 
in Africa were natives who were paid far lower wages than their European 
counterparts. Thus, railroad technology was a means of extracting as many 
resources as possible from subject lands while paying colonial laborers as little 
as possible.
Steamships  Because they required huge quantities of coal as fuel, early 
steamships  could travel only limited distances. However, steamboats could 
transport people, mail, and goods on navigable rivers such as the Ganges in 
South Asia and the Congo in Africa. After the development of more efficient 
steam engines in 1870, steamships became practical for long distances. In 
the 1870s, the development of compression refrigeration equipment made it 
possible to ship perishables such as meat and dairy products across oceans. 
Telegraph  Invented in 1832, the electric telegraph  transformed 
communications. Instead of taking days, weeks, or even months, news could 
travel instantaneously. Telegraph service was introduced in India in 1850, just 
five years after it started in Britain. Telegraph lines often followed railroad 
routes. Submarine underwater telegraph cables soon crossed oceans. In 1866 
the first permanent transatlantic cable was laid between the United States and 
England. Telegraph service between England and Australia was introduced 
in 182, and in 18 service between Portugal and Brazil allowed instant 
communication between Europe and South America.
Agricultural Products
When Europeans arrived in Asia and Africa, they found mainly agricultural 
economies, with most people raising enough food to live on—subsistence 
farming—with perhaps a little left over to sell. Subsistence farming is still 
common throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of Latin 
America. Under control of imperialist powers, subsistence farmers abandoned 
their traditional ways and grew cash crops  instead. These were crops such 
as tea, cotton, sugar, oil palms, rubber, and coffee that were grown for their 
commercial value rather than for use by those who grew them. Imperial 
demands for cash crops had a damaging effect on subject nations. As cash 
crops replaced food crops, food prices rose.
400 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe growing European middle classes created a demand for meat. Cattle 
ranches in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay produced beef for export. Sheep 
herders in Australia and New Zealand exported lamb and mutton. New 
technology allowed meat to be shipped over long distances. Meat could 
be processed and canned in packing plants or shipped fresh or frozen in 
refrigerated steamships.
Guano , bat and seabird excrement, is rich in nitrates and phosphates. 
These make it an excellent natural fertilizer. Because of the dry climate in Peru 
and Chile, vast quantities of guano had accumulated before people began 
mining it in the 1th century. Between 180 and 1880, millions of tons of 
guano were dug by hand and loaded onto ships for export, often by indentured 
Chinese or Polynesian laborers.
Source:  American Museum of Natural History
Guano mining in the central Chincha Islands, off the coast of Peru, c. 1860.
401 GLOBAL ECONOMIC DE=ELOPMENTRaw Materials
The demand for raw materials that could be processed into manufactured 
goods and shipped away—often back to the providers of raw materials—
turned colonies into export economies.  Imperial attention focused on the 
tropical climates that were conducive to the presence of raw materials, unlike 
some imperial countries.
Cotton  Britain’s Parliament banned Indian cotton  textiles in 1721 
because they competed with the native wool industry. Soon after, cotton from 
Britain’s southern colonies in America shifted production. The colonies would 
provide the raw materials, and England would manufacture textiles. During 
the Industrial Revolution, Britain’s great textile mills got 80 percent of their 
cotton from the United States.
When the American Civil War erupted, northern warships blockaded 
Confederate ports, cutting off the supply of cotton. As a result, farmers all 
over the world, from Australia to the West Indies, replaced food production 
with cotton to make up for the shortage. Cotton farmers in India were able 
to benefit from the shortages caused by the Civil War, but Egypt benefited 
most. Egypt had already developed a fine long-staple variety of cotton and 
ramped up production. By the end of the 19th century, 93 percent of Egypt’s 
export revenue came from cotton. Raw cotton production from Egypt and 
India supported the manufacturing of textiles that Britain exported all over the 
world.
Rubber  Natural rubber  is made from the latex sap of trees or vines. 
It softens when warm and hardens when cold. In 1839, Charles Goodyear 
developed a process known as vulcanization that eliminated these problems 
and helped create the modern rubber industry. Rubber was used to produce 
tires for bicycles and eventually automobiles, hoses, gaskets, waterproof 
clothing, and shoe soles, among other items.
Rubber trees are native to the Amazon rainforest of South America, where 
they grew wild but widely dispersed. Latex could also be extracted from vines 
native to Central Africa, though they were destroyed in the process. Each source 
provided about half the world’s rubber supply, but they soon were inadequate 
to meet the demand as rubber became an important industrial material. In both 
sources, “rubber barons” forced indigenous people into virtual slavery. In some 
cases, companies mutilated or killed workers who failed to meet their quotas.
In 186, the British India Office obtained rubber tree seeds from Brazil. 
After being propagated in England, the seedlings were sent to Ceylon Sri 
Lanka and Singapore. Before long, thousands of acres of forest were cleared 
to make room for rubber plantations in Malaya, Indochina, the Dutch East 
Indies, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
Palm Oil  The machinery in Europe’s factories required constant 
lubrication to keep it working, creating a demand for palm oil , which was 
402 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONalso used for candle making. The oil palm originated in West Africa, where it 
was used as a staple food product for 5,000 years. Palm oil was so valued that 
it was used in place of money in many African cultures. Palm oil became an 
important cash crop in West Africa, where prisoners of tribal war were often 
enslaved to help with the palm oil crops. European colonists established oil 
palm plantations in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.
Ivory  The tusks of elephants provide the product ivory . Most of the ivory 
trade was with Africa, since both male and female African elephants have large 
tusks, which average six feet in length. Ivory was prized for its beauty and 
durability. It was used primarily for piano keys, billiard balls, knife handles, 
and ornamental carvings. In the mid-19th century, the European scramble for 
ivory preceded the scramble for colonies. The Ivory Coast C{te d’Ivoire got 
its name from the fact that the French originally set up trading posts there for 
the acquisition of ivory and the purchase of enslaved people.
Minerals  Some of the most valuable products were mineral ores used in 
manufacturing. They came from around the world:
• Mexico produced silver. 
• Chile produced copper , which was used for telegraph cables and 
electrical power lines. 
• Northern Rhodesia now =ambia and the Belgian Congo produced 
copper. 
• Bolivia, Nigeria, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies produced tin, 
which helped meet the growing demand for food products in tin cans.
• Australia and South Africa, as well as parts of West Africa and Alaska, 
produced large deposits of gold.
Diamonds  Because of his frail health, Cecil Rhodes was sent to South 
Africa in 1870 to join a brother on a cotton farm. In 1871 the brothers joined 
the diamond  rush and went to Kimberley, the center of mining activity. After 
completing a degree at Oxford University, Rhodes acquired some of the De 
Beers mining claims and formed the De Beers Mining Company  in 1880. By 
1891, De Beers accounted for 90 percent of the world’s diamond production. 
Rhodes also had a large stake in the world’s largest gold fields, which were 
discovered in 1886 on South Africa’s Witwatersrand. Connect: Analyze 
Africa’s changes in trade from the trans-Saharan trade, including the effects of 
the slave trade, through the industrial era. See Topics 2. and ..
By the age of 29, when Rhodes was elected to the Cape Parliament, he 
was the most powerful man in Southern Africa. He sought to expand to the 
north, into Bechuanaland Botswana and what became known as Rhodesia 
and is now Zimbabwe and Zambia, with the dream of building a railroad from 
Cape Town to Cairo—and claiming all the land along the route for the British 
Empire. In 1890, Rhodes became the prime minister of the Cape Colony where 
his racist policies paved the way for the apartheid , or racial segregation, that 
plagued South Africa during the 20th century.
403 GLOBAL ECONOMIC DE=ELOPMENTGlobal Consequences
Industrialization was accompanied by the need to find raw materials that could 
be turned into finished products to be sold globally²often bought with the 
profits from raw materials. As urban populations grew, the demand for food 
was increasingly met by imports made possible by new technology such as 
refrigeration. As the industrialized nations grew wealthier, stock exchanges 
developed, allowing more people to invest their capital, and the need to protect 
global markets and investments grew rapidly.
Consequences of Commercial Extraction  Farmers were allowed to 
raise only cash crops, such as sugar, cocoa, or groundnuts, at the expense of 
other agricultural products. This use of land led to monocultures,  or a lack 
of agricultural diversity, particularly in developing nations. Large areas were 
often cleared of forests to make room for farming, which took its toll on both 
biodiversity and the climate. Cash crops such as cotton rapidly depleted the 
soul’s natural fertility. Moreover, crop diseases and pests spread more easily 
when there was only one crop planted in an area. 
Today, many former colonies have been unable to rediversify their land 
use because the development of monocultures has badly damaged croplands. 
As a result, they often must import basic agricultural goods in order to feed 
their people.

“Fermented drinks such as alcohol also have the benefits of killing parasites 
and bringing liquid calories to the diet, but by the start of the 18th century beer 
production was eating up nearly half of the wheat harvest in Britain. There was

from which only the hides were exported to Great Britain and part of the 
meat, as jerky, to Brazil and Cuba. There was a shifting rural population that 
worked on the large estates and lived largely on the parts of beef carcasses 
that could not be marketed abroad. Often the landowners were also the

Economic Imperialism
Let us ask, where is your conscience? I have heard that the smoking of opium 
is very strictly forbidden by your country; that is because the harm caused by 
opium is clearly understood. Since it is not permitted to do harm to your own 
country, then even less should you let it be passed on to the harm of other 
countries – how much less to China! 
—Lin Zexu, Chinese Commissioner in Canton,  
letter to British Queen Victoria, January 15, 1840
Essential Question:   What economic factors contributed to the imperialism 
in the global economy between 1750 and 1900? 
For centuries, India was the world’s leading supplier of finished cotton 
textiles. By the late 18th century, the Industrial Revolution and a new source of 
cotton from America had allowed Britain to flood the market with inexpensive 
textiles, pushing independent Indian textile artisans out of business. By the 
late 19th century, India was producing only raw cotton for Britain, not cotton 
textiles. After Britain’s textile factories processed India’s cotton, the colonial 
government sold some of its factory-made or “finished” textiles back to the 
Indian subcontinent at inflated prices.
Another critical raw material for Britain was the drug opium. The poppies 
from which it is obtained grew easily on South Asia’s fertile lands, and selling 
it to the Chinese became very profitable for Britain. The Chinese, as Lin =exu 
expressed in the letter to Queen 9ictoria, objected to the export of opium to 
their country, and the conflict resulted in the first Opium War. The Chinese 
paid a heavy price for their attempt to curtail the opium trade and ended up 
losing much trading independence.
The Rise of Economic Imperialism
The agricultural influence and power of raw materials shifted away from Asia 
and Latin America to industrialized states such as Britain, the United States, 
France, Japan, and Germany between the late 19th century and the beginning 
of the 20th century. Economic imperialism , a situation in which foreign 
business interests have great economic power or influence, developed as 
businesses took advantage of natural resources beyond their borders. People, 
raw materials, and refined materials were the main resources exploited. Cash 
crops and mineral resources were produced on a large scale. As in the colonial 
408 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONera of the 15th to the 18th centuries, colonial powers served their own economic 
interests by turning colonies into export economies that produced goods not for 
domestic use but to be sent to colonial powers to sell for profit. 
Economic Imperialism in Asia
England’s defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 created an opening for the 
British and Dutch to take over the spice trade in Asia from the Spanish and 
Portuguese, who formerly had a monopoly on it.
India  The English East India Company  formed in 1600 to engage in the 
lucrative spice trade. However, the company soon ran into opposition from the 
Dutch. By the mid-1600s cotton and silk textiles from India had replaced spices 
as the East India Company’s major import, and by the 1700s the company 
dominated the world textile trade. Indian weavers learned to create fabrics with 
patterns that would appeal to European tastes. With the Industrial Revolution, 
India began supplying raw cotton to the textile mills of Britain, and the demand 
for finished Indian textiles decreased.
Dutch East Indies  The Dutch East India Company  had a monopoly on 
trade with the Dutch East Indies in present-day Indonesia, where the Spice 
Islands  were located. By the second half of the 18th century, it had switched its 
focus from shipping to agricultural production. The Dutch government revoked 
the company’s charter in 1799 and took direct control of the Dutch East Indies. 
In 1830, the Dutch government introduced the Culture System , which forced 
farmers to choose between growing cash crops for export or performing corvée 
labor , compulsory unpaid work. Under this system, villagers either had to set 
aside one-fifth of their rice fields for such export crops as sugar, coffee, or 
indigo, or work in a government field for 66 days if they had no land. If the 
crops failed, the villagers were held responsible for the loss. The practice was 
finally abolished in 180.
China  Chinese goods such as porcelain, silk, and tea were in great demand 
in Great Britain. However, the Chinese were not interested in British goods, 
and in this trade imbalance, British silver reserves became very low. To make 
up for this shortfall, the East India Company began forcing farmers in India 
to grow opium , an addictive drug that also relieves pain and reduces stress. 
The company then sold it for silver in China, where millions of people became 
addicted to the illegal drug. The company then used its profits to buy tea and 
other goods.
The Chinese emperor criminalized the use of opium in 1729. However, the 
ban had little effect. The Chinese objection to the importation of this drug led to 
the first Opium War 18±182. The Chinese government seized the British 
opium warehoused in the port of Canton Guangzhou. War broke out when 
British warships destroyed a Chinese blockade keeping ships from Canton, 
the only port China allowed to trade with foreigners. The British attacked 
and occupied Canton and engaged in several other successful battles, finally 
capturing Nanking Nanjing. 
409 ECONOMIC IM PERIALISM 409The conflict between Britain and China revealed the fate of nonindustrialized 
nations. China had not anticipated the power that industrialized nations were 
gaining or the shift in the balance of power that was taking place. Industrialized 
nations in Europe would begin to dominate and defeat states that lacked the 
military technology needed to stand against British steamships and weaponry.
The resulting Treaty of Nanking  required China to open up four additional 
ports to foreigners, cede the island of Hong Kong to Britain, and pay damages. 
It also forced the Chinese to allow free trade, which the British took to include 
trade in opium.
Neither Britain nor China was completely satisfied with the Treaty of 
Nanking. The British wanted the use of opium legalized, while the Chinese 
were unhappy about the concessions they had been forced to make. Hostilities 
erupted in October 1856 after Chinese officers boarded a British trading ship, 
searched it, lowered the flag, and arrested some Chinese sailors. The French 
joined the British in what came to be known as the second Opium War 1856±
1860. The Treaty of Tientsin Tianjin following that war allowed foreign 
envoys to reside in Beijing, opened several new ports to Western trade and 
residence, and allowed freedom of movement for Christian missionaries. After 
additional negotiations, opium was legalized, and China ceded to Britain the 
southern portion of Kowloon Peninsula, which was adjacent to Hong Kong. 
Connect: Compare how Western states and the Qing Dynasty treated the 
Chinese population. See Topic ..
SSheres oI ,nfluence Japan, France, Germany, Russia, and the United 
States sought the same trading privileges that Britain attained after winning 
the Opium Wars. By the end of the century, these nations began forcing China 
to give them exclusive trading rights in areas known as sSheres oI influence . 
It was at this time that the Open Door policy, proposed by the United States, 
allowed for a system of trade in China to be open to all countries equally in 
order to keep any one power from total control of China. See the map on the 
next page.
Economic Imperialism in Africa
Before colonization, most farming in Africa was to raise food crops. After 
colonization, land that had been devoted to growing food was converted to 
cash crop production to provide raw materials for European industries and 
goods for European markets. In exchange, the Africans received cotton textiles, 
canned food, and alcoholic beverages. This unequal trade structure made the 
colonies economically dependent on the imperial powers.
Reliance on a single cash crop, one grown to be sold, in a country or 
region left many Africans vulnerable during periods of drought, economic 
decline, or falling world prices. Food production declined as farmers chose to 
plant cash crops such as cotton, which would increase the value of their land. 
Food shortages, even famines, could arise because the most arable land was 
devoted to growing crops for export.
410 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEgypt  had embraced cotton as a cash crop before the American Civil War 
and more than doubled production between 1861 and 186. By the end of the 
century, cotton accounted for 93 percent of Egypt’s exports. It was also the 
leading cash crop in Sudan , where the Plantation Syndicate, a group of British 
weaving companies, dictated land use to farmers. When the British colonized 
Uganda , they encouraged cotton as a cash crop there as well, and it soon 
replaced enslaved people and ivory as the chief export.
In Kenya , most native peoples were herders. Groups like the Kikuyu 
were moved to reserves with poor soil and bad climates. In the fertile Rift 
9alley, the colonial government gave the land to white settlers, forcing most 
Africans to relocate. Those who remained were forced to provide cheap 
labor for white farmers. African farmers were also forbidden to participate 
in export of any cash crops, and prohibited from growing some cash crops, 
such as coffee and tea.PACIFIC

411 ECONOMIC IM PERIALISMAfter missionaries introduced it to the area in the 1880s, cocoa became the 
major cash crop on the Gold Coast.  This region soon became the largest cocoa 
producer in the world. Cocoa was also an important cash crop in the Ivory 
Coast, Nigeria, and the Portuguese colonies of São Tomé and Angola.
Palm oil, palm kernels, and peanuts also called groundnuts were already 
major exports from West Africa before colonization. It was a valuable raw 
material because it was used as a lubricant for the machines of the industrial 
revolution in Europe.
Slavery in Africa  Slavery was outlawed in British colonies in 1833, but it 
persisted elsewhere in Africa. The French army often used enslaved people as 
payment for its African soldiers, and French colonial administrators relied on 
enslaved people for many of their staff. It was not until 1912 that slave raiding 
and trading was suppressed in most of Africa. Slavery was not abolished by 
law throughout Africa until the first quarter of the 20th century.
Slave labor was used to produce many of the cash crops, especially oil 
palms which produced palm kernels as well as palm oil, coffee, and cocoa. 
Some companies felt a moral responsibility to oppose the use of enslaved 
people in the production of the raw materials they used. For example, cash 
crop production in French-ruled colonies in Africa came about as a result of the 
end of the slave trade in the French Empire in 188, along with the economic 
transformations brought about in France by the Industrial Revolution. Quaker-
owned Cadbury’s, for example, stopped buying slave-grown cocoa from 
Portuguese African colonies in 1908 after the slave trade was exposed.

412 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEconomic Imperialism in Latin America
In the second half of the 19th century, Latin America was subjected to imperialist 
aggression from both Europe and the United States. The “new imperialism” 
was concerned with a world capitalist economy as the industrialized nations of 
Europe and the United States sought raw materials, low-wage labor, and new 
markets for their goods. The emerging middle classes of Latin America were 
hungry for the latest European news and fashions.
Britain replaced Spain as Latin America’s major trading partner. Companies 
based in Britain became the largest investors in Latin America, followed by 
ones from France and Germany. Europeans invested over 10 billion in Latin 
America between 180 and 11, primarily in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil. 
Role of the United States  The United States was not yet as established 
a world power as Britain or France. However, the Second Industrial 
Revolution brought newfound prosperity to the young republic. U.S. corporate 
investments came later and were concentrated at first in Mexico and Cuba. 
These investments supported infrastructure and industry, especially railways, 
shipping, and the emerging banking and financial sectors. They also financed 
mining, guano, and meat processing and packing plants. In 182, the Monroe 
Doctrine, the U.S. policy of opposing European colonialism in the Americas, 
told the world that Latin America was in the U.S. sphere of influence.
Investments in Argentina  In the late 19th century, Britain had invested 
more in Argentina  than in its own colony of India. As much as 10 percent of 
British foreign investment was in Argentina. British investors, entrepreneurs, 
and business leaders helped turn Argentina into the richest country in Latin 
America and one of the dozen richest in the world by the outbreak of World War 
I. They improved breeding stock and developed large-scale farming throughout 
the grassy plains, known as the Pampas . They also financed infrastructure and 
building projects, such as the railroad and telegraph systems. Because of its 
location on the shallow Rio de la Plata, Buenos Aires needed to build a new 
port to facilitate passenger service and the massive import and export of goods 
and services. The British financed and designed the new port, Puerto Madera.
Mining in Chile  Spain colonized the region of present-day Chile between 
150 and 1818. Chile’s economic development was initially dependent on the 
export of agricultural produce. The wealth of these raw materials brought 
dependency on Spain and tension among neighboring states. Copper would 
come to dominate Chile’s exports. The mining sector in Chile would come to 
be one of the pillars of the Chilean economy, making up for more than one- 
third of government income. 
Rubber Industry in Brazil  Brazil once had a booming rubber industry. 
However, it declined after people began growing rubber in Malaysia at a lower 
cost. The shift of rubber production demonstrated how trade was organized to 
the advantage of companies based in Europe and the United States. Economic 
competition brought prosperity to some regions, but it was always fragile.
413 ECONOMIC IM PERIALISMCentral America and the Caribbean  Foreign investors often used their 
governments to act as “strong men” to help them achieve the ends they wanted. 
The United Fruit Company was an American corporation that traded in tropical 
fruit, primarily bananas, grown on Latin American plantations and sold in the 
United States and in Europe. The United Fruit Company allied itself with large 
landowners to pressure governments to maintain conditions that would be 
favorable for the U.S. company. In a short story, the writer O. Henry coined the 
term “ banana republics ” to describe small Central American countries under 
the economic power of foreign-based corporations. The banana republics were 
politically unstable states with an economy dependent upon the exportation of 
a limited-resource product, such as bananas or minerals. 
Patterns of imperial control over territories and transportation networks 
in Central America, the Caribbean coast of Colombia, Ecuador, and the West 
Indies continued as companies sought political dominance to gain monopolies 
over natural resources. 
Economic Imperialism in Hawaii
The power of investments to transform and dominate small or weak states 
could also be seen in the Pacific islands. A group of American businesses 
and sugar planters in Hawaii went so far as to overthrow the constitutional 
monarchy in 1893, hoping that the islands would be annexed by the United 
States. In 1898, Hawaii became a territory of the United States.
Contextualizing Economic Imperialism
The Industrial Revolution developed the demand for raw materials and the 
technological ability through steamships, railroads, and military weapons to 
control other territories. These set the stage for economic imperialism.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“It was at this moment that the East India Company EIC ceased to be a 
conventional corporation, trading and silks and spices, and became something 
much more unusual. Within a few years, 250 company clerks backed by the 
military force of 20,000 locally recruited Indian soldiers had become the 
effective rulers of Bengal. An international corporation was transforming 
itself into an aggressive colonial power. . . .
We still talk about the British conquering India, but that phrase disguises a 
more sinister reality. It was not the British government that seized India at 
the end of the 18th century, but a dangerously unregulated private company 
headquartered in one small office, five windows wide, in London, and 
managed in India by an unstable sociopath—[Robert] Clive.
In many ways the EIC was a model of corporate efficiency: 100 years into its 
history, it had only 5 permanent employees in its head office. Nevertheless, 
that skeleton staff executed a corporate coup unparalleled in history: the 
military conquest, subjugation and plunder of vast tracts of southern Asia. 
It almost certainly remains the supreme act of corporate violence in world 
history. For all the power wielded today by the world’s largest corporations—
whether ExxonMobil, Walmart or Google²they are tame beasts compared 
with the ravaging territorial appetites of the [militarized] East India Company. 
Yet if history shows anything, it is that in the intimate dance between the 
power of the state and that of the corporation, while the latter can be regulated, 
it will use all the resources in its power to resist.”

to imperialism in the global economy between 1750 and 1900. 
CAUSES O- MIGRATIO N IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLD417
6.6
Causes of Migration in an 
Interconnected World
I would advise all my friends to quit Ireland—the country most dear to me; 
as long as they remain in it they will be in bondage and misery.
—An Irish settler who had lived in Wisconsin for a year,  
in a letter to The Times  of London, May 14, 1850
Essential Question:   How did environmental and economic factors 
contribute to patterns of migration between  
1750 and 1900?
An increasingly global economy characterized by economic imperialism 
and the availability of different modes of transportation promoted a new era 
in migrations. As industrialization grew, populations moved to urban centers. 
Some workers who left their homelands, such as the Lebanese merchants in 
the United States or the Italian laborers in Argentina, could travel back to 
their native country for visits or to retire. Others, like the Irish settler quoted 
above, chose a permanent resettlement as relief from economic and political 
difficulties. Other movements of people were coerced. To meet the demands 
for workers, coerced and semi-coerced migration of people resulted in slavery, 
indentured servitude, and convict labor. 
Migration through Labor Systems
The desire for low-wage labor was linked to the exploitation of natural resources 
in the system of economic imperialism. Even though slavery was gradually 
being abolished in imperial territories in the 19th century, the demand for the 
agricultural goods that enslaved workers had produced was still increasing. 
European states recruited new laborers to work on plantations, where they 
produced enormous wealth that fueled industrial growth at home:
• Indian laborers migrated to British colonies in the Caribbean, South 
Africa, East Africa, and Fiji. 
• Chinese laborers migrated to California and British Malaya to build 
railroads and serve as farmhands, gardeners, and domestics. 
• Japanese laborers migrated to Hawaii, Peru, and Cuba to work on  
sugar plantations. 
418 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONSlavery  Most countries in the Americas abolished the African slave trade 
in the early 19th century. Slavery itself continued, but without a fresh supply 
of enslaved people, the institution declined. Only in the United States did the 
number of enslaved people increase after the abolition of the slave trade. The 
last countries to abolish slavery in the Americas were the United States 1865, 
Cuba 1886, and Brazil 1888. 
In spite of prohibitions, Africans continued enslaving one another well 
into the 20th century. As slavery was being abolished, labor was still desired, 
so imperial countries turned to other forms of coerced labor.
Indentured Servitude  People who worked for a set number of years 
before becoming free were indentured servants. Many people became 
indentured as a way to pay for their transportation from a desperately poor 
community to one with more opportunity. Others were forced to do so to pay 
off a debt. 
Some of these servants intended to work temporarily, earning money for 
their family, and then return home. But many stayed in their new country. As a 
result, indentured laborers brought their home cultures to their new lands and 
altered the demographics of these lands. For example, the cultures of Mauritius 
in the Indian Ocean off Southeast Africa, Fiji in the South Pacific, and 
Trinidad in the Caribbean added a strong Indian influence.
Asian Contract Laborers  Many Chinese and Indian workers were 
an early substitute for the slave trade. They were forced or tricked into

419 CAUSES O- MIGRATIO N IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLD419servitude. Britain first tried this form of labor after ending the slave trade 
in 1806. They imported 200 Chinese to Trinidad. Between 18 and 18, 
the British, French, Dutch, and Spanish had imported between 250,000 
and 500,000 Chinese workers to their colonies in Southeast Asia, Africa, 
and the Caribbean. About 125,000 Chinese were sent to Cuba alone, where  
80 percent worked the sugar plantations.
The life of an Asian contract workers was riddled with difficulty and 
unjust treatment. While they were not property, they were unskilled laborers 
or porters who were exploited as substitutes for slave labor, often working for 
subsistence wages. The media of the time brought the treatment of them to 
the attention of the public by criticizing the system as a new form of slavery. 
In 1855, Britain stopped its trade. In 1862 Congress banned the contract Asia  
labor trade in the United States, and in 18, under international pressure, 
Portugal ended it. A treaty between China and Spain in 1877 terminated the 
contracts of Chinese workers still in Cuba.
British Penal Colonies  In the late 1700s, Great Britain established a 
penal colony  in Australia after losing its original one in Georgia as a result 
of the American Revolution. The British government shipped convicts  from 
England, Scotland, and Ireland as well as British colonies such as India, to 
Australia. There, they performed hard labor and suffered harsh treatment. 
Actual imprisonment of the convicts was rare. Most performed labor for 
free settlers, worked for the government in record keeping, or worked on 
government projects such as road and railway building. The majority of 
convicts earned their freedom after a prescribed number of years of service. 
Some people sent to penal colonies were never allowed to return to Great 
Britain. In addition, because transportation back home was expensive, the 
majority decided to stay in Australia. By 1850, the British government ended 
the transportation of convicts to Australia, largely because a stay in Australia 
was not considered much of a punishment.
Australia also attracted free settlers, especially after gold was discovered 
there in 1851. Some 50,000 Chinese came during this gold rush. Eventually 
Australia became one of Britain’s most successful settler colonies.
French Penal Colonies  The French also had penal colonies in Africa, 
New Caledonia, and French Guiana. New Caledonia, an island part of an 
archipelago in the southwest Pacific Ocean 50 miles from Australia, served as 
a penal colony from 186 to 18 for both convicts and political prisoners. The 
penal colony in French Guiana, which included Devil’s Island, was notorious 
for its harsh treatment of convicts. Prisoners were underfed and forced to do 
hard labor. Although the French stopped transporting convicts in 1938, Devil’s 
Island continued to hold prisoners until 1953. Connect: Describe the changes

420 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMigration in the Face of Challenges
The word diaspora  is often applied to mass emigrations from a country or 
region that may take place over a period of many years. The African slave trade 
was responsible for one of the biggest diasporas in history, the involuntary 
emigration of millions of people between the 16th and 1th centuries. Most 
diasporas, however, were the result of poverty, political conditions, or famine.
India  Poverty was the principal reason that drove Indians to leave the 
subcontinent. In 18, the British began sending Indians to Mauritius as 
indentured laborers to replace enslaved workers on the sugar plantations. By 
188, Indians were working on plantations in British Guiana Guyana, Dutch 
Guiana Surinam, Natal South Africa, Fiji, and British and French islands in 
the Caribbean. Most Indian laborers signed five-year contracts. Many renewed 
their contracts, and some decided to stay permanently, accepting a piece of 
land or a lump sum rather than their passage back to India. Over 1.5 million 
Indians were shipped to colonies in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Oceania 
before Britain abolished the indenture system in 116. Between 1880 and 
1938, two systems recruited labor in Southeast Asia. 
• The kangani foreman who oversees workers system in Ceylon and 
Malaya recruited from their own extended family.
• The maistry  supervisors system in Burma recruited laborers within a 
structured system with defined hierarchies and sent them to plantations, 
usually in Southeast Asia. Conditions were highly exploitative.
China  The Chinese diaspora did not begin in earnest until the middle 
of the 19th century, with the gold rushes in California, South Australia, and 
western Canada. However, most Chinese migrants were not engaged in mining. 
Despite prejudices toward Chinese immigrants, the Chinese were instrumental 
in the development of the U.S. Transcontinental Railroad. Some Chinese paid 
their own way, but many more left China as indentured laborers. The vast 
majority of Chinese emigrants were males who planned to return to China 
after their time abroad.
People left China for many reasons, some to escape poverty or famine, 
others for better opportunities. Beginning in the late 18th century, a population 
explosion in coastal cities and contacts through foreign trade led large numbers 
of Chinese to emigrate  to Southeast Asia. Most of them were illiterate, landless 
peasants looking for opportunities abroad. However, most of the Chinese did 
not arrive in Southeast Asia until the mid-1th century, after the first Opium 
War made it easier for them to leave. Many people left as a result of the poverty 
and disorder brought on by the Taiping Rebellion 1850±186. See Topic 
6.2. After the middle of the century, most Chinese emigrated to the Americas, 
Europe, Australia, or New Zealand. 
421 CAUSES O- MIGRATIO N IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLDIreland  People emigrated from Ireland for many reasons. Some left for 
political reasons. Britain abolished the Irish Parliament in 1801 when Ireland 
became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Roman 
Catholics and Protestant dissenters faced religious discrimination from their 
British rulers. Evictions of tenant farmers increased after the 186 repeal of 
the Corn Laws, which had regulated the import and export of grain. During 
the Great Famine  185±18 that destroyed the potato crop for four years, 
as many as  million people emigrated from Ireland. Most went to the United 
States, but many others went to England, Scotland, Canada, or Australia.
Emigration continued even after the famine ended; as many people left 
Ireland in the first four years after the famine was over as left during the height 
of the famine. The Irish had been going to Great Britain and the United States 
to build canals since the 18th century, and they continued to leave to help build 
railroads. During the 18th and 19th centuries, 300,000 free Irish emigrated to 
Australia, and 5,000 Irish convicts were transported there. In the second half 
of the 1th century, about 5,000 Irish went to Argentina, although only about 
20,000 remained there. The rest moved on to the United States.

422 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONItaly  The first wave of Italian emigration began with the unification of 
Italy in 1861 and continued until 100. More than  million people left Italy 
during those four decades. More than half of them went to other countries in 
Europe, with most of the rest going to North and South America, Australia, 
and New Zealand. The main reason for the Italian diaspora was poverty. Two-
thirds of the emigrants during this period were men with traditional skills. 
Farmers had an increasingly difficult time making a living in harsh conditions, 
especially in a society where land was subdivided over generations. Some 
left for political reasons, while others left for economic reasons related to 
organized crime, especially in South Italy. Those who left often sent money 
back to family members, encouraging further emigration.
Migration to Settler Colonies
Large numbers of British citizens lived in all the colonies of the British 
Empire. Most who moved abroad permanently went to settler colonies such 
as Canada, South Africa, Australia, or New Zealand. Those who went to other 
colonies such as India, Malaya, or .enya, usually did so with no intention of 
staying permanently. Many went as officers or soldiers in the British army, as 
government officials in the Colonial Service , or as managers for plantations 
or other colonial enterprises. 
Technical Experts  Engineers and geologists migrated to South Asia 
and Africa. One was Andrew Geddes Bain, who emigrated to Cape Town, 
South Africa, in 1816. Bain initially worked on eight major roads and 
passes but moved on to a career in geological studies. Bain prepared the first 
comprehensive geological map of South Africa in 1852. In 185, he reported 
back to the British government about the copper mines in Namaqualand.  
British engineers were so numerous in the colonies that they formed a type 
of diaspora. They spread Western science and technology through the world. 
However, as they did, they blended their knowledge with the experience of 
engineers from the colonial lands. Together, people from Europe and the 
colonies collaborated on both public works and private industrial projects. 
Argentina  During the 19th century, Argentina was part of Britain’s 
“informal” empire. Britain invested more in Argentina than it did in India, 
the so-called “Jewel in the Crown” of the British Empire. Unlike most of 
the people who emigrated to make a new life for themselves, the British 
who settled in Argentina during the 19th century were not trying to escape 
poverty or persecution. They were primarily businessmen, traders, bankers, 
and engineers. They founded banks, developed the export trade in agricultural 
products, built railroads and other infrastructure, and imported luxuries that 
appealed to the growing Argentine middle class. 
Japan  Before 1868, Japan was closed to the rest of the world. However, 
by 1893, the Japanese government had decided that Japan should acquire an 
overseas empire and established the Colonization Society . Its aim was to 
export Japan’s surplus population as well as commercial goods. In 1892 the 
423 CAUSES O- MIGRATIO N IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLDSociety made an unsuccessful attempt to start an agricultural settler colony in 
Mexico. The failure of that attempt did not deter the society from sending 0 
Japanese to Peru in 1899 for contract work. At the same time, many young 
Japanese men were leaving Japan to study in the United States, congregating 
mostly in such cities as San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle on the West Coast. 
Tensions and anti-immigrant sentiment toward Japanese people intensified 
as immigrants assimilated to life in America. In 1907, the Gentlemen’s 
Agreement between the United States and Japan was an informal agreement 
that the U.S. would not impose restrictions on Japanese immigration, and 
Japan would not allow further emigration to the U.S. The agreement was never 
ratified and was ultimately ended by the Immigration Act of 12.
Migration,Transportation, and Urbanization
Improvements in transportation technology allowed some who migrated for 
work reasons to return to their home societies, either for a period of time or 
permanently. For example, in 1885, an agreement between the governments of 
Japan and Hawaii allowed Japanese laborers to go to Hawaii to work on the 
sugar plantations under three-year contracts. Approximately 29,000 Japanese 
went to Hawaii over the next nine years. During that time, thousands more 
Japanese went to other destinations in the South Pacific, including Australia, 
New Caledonia, and Fiji, under similar contracts. Most planned to return home 
after a few years.

the economic and cultural development of 
Argentina that the city of Mendoza erected  
a monument to them in what is known as  
the Plaza Italia.
424 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIndustrial workers from Italy had similar arrangements for working in

“Due to its structural weakness, the local silk industry could not withstand 
foreign competition from the silk of Japan and China and later on the 
introduction of artificial fabrics. It is also argued by many historians that the 
decision of many Christians to emigrate from the mountain was also stirred 
by increasing urbanization, the emergence of a middle class, and the fear of 
conscription in the Ottoman army. 
Commenting on the post-1860 generation of peasants, Akram .hater >wrote@:
‘Having grown in relative prosperity, these peasants were facing 
limitations that threatened to send them economically a few steps 
backward. At the end of the 1880s silk was no longer the golden 
crop it had been ten or twenty years before. At the same time, 
rising land prices and shrinking inheritance combined to make the 
economic future bleak. So it was that many peasants arrived at the 
year 1887 with a sense of malaise [uneasiness]. They did not have 
much land, and what little they had did not promise to make them 
a ‘good’ living. . . . Although some villagers did migrate seasonally 
to neighboring cities like Aleppo and Bursa, these areas provided 
limited opportunities as they were experiencing their own economic 
crises. . . . These drawbacks made a number of peasants look for other 
ways out of their dilemma—namely, how to make enough money 
quickly to guarantee their status as landowners and not slip back into 
the ranks of the landless laborers. About the only option that appeared 
on the economic horizons was emigration.’ ”

It shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come, or having so come after

—Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
Essential Question:   How and why did patterns of migration affect society 
between 1750 and 1900?
Migration in the 19th century—whether undertaken freely to escape poverty 
or seek opportunity or coerced as part of an imperialist labor system—led to 
demographic changes with long-lasting results. Laborers tended to be male and 
from particular ethnic groups, such as the Indian indentured servants brought 
to work on sugar plantations in the Caribbean or the Chinese laborers recruited 
to complete the transcontinental railroad in the United States. These migrants 
often formed ethnic enclaves and created cultural groups that maintained 
elements of their native culture and religion while absorbing the influences 
of their new locations. For example, many Indians in Trinidad and Tobago 
practiced Hinduism and contributed to Caribbean musical traditions. These 
migrants also left behind women who sometimes took on the roles formerly 
filled by men and thus brought about change in migrants’ home societies. 
Migrant groups often experienced racial and ethnic prejudice. The Chinese 
Exclusion Act, noted above, was the first major U.S. federal legislation that 
specifically suspended immigration of a specific ethnic group. 
Changes in Home Societies
The experiences of migrants and the families they left behind varied widely 
depending on the norms of their home cultures. Migrant laborers were more 
often male than female, so in some places their migration—whether internal 
or external—brought a shift in demographics and gender roles in the societies 
they left. In some societies, males waited to emigrate until a male relative 
was available to live with and help support the women and children who did 
not emigrate with the males. In these places, women’s roles were much the 
same as before their husbands left. However, in other places, women gained 
some autonomy and authority as they took on responsibilities once filled by 
their husbands and took a meaningful place in society outside the bounds 
430 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONof family responsibilities. If they later followed their husbands to another 
country, they often participated more fully, though far from equally, in family 
decision-making than women who had not been on their own. If their husbands 
returned, women who had taken up their husbands’ responsibilities sometimes 
continued to play a role outside of domestic life, while those who had been put 
in the care of male relatives remained in traditional gender roles. 
Most male migrants sent remittances, funds from their foreign earnings, 
back home. If the remittance were large enough, women often reduced 
their hours working outside the home and spent more time with family 
responsibilities while also exercising considerable decision-making power 
over how the money was spent. In some places, the receipt of remittances 
correlates to girls’ longer school attendance; in other places boys seem to  have 
been the greater beneficiaries of remittance-supported education.

Immigrants were interested in a new economic start but intent on carrying 
with them their own traditions and culture. Ethnic enclaves , clusters or 
neighborhoods of people from the same foreign country, formed in many 
major cities of the world. In these areas inhabitants spoke the language of their 
home country, ate the foods they were familiar with from home, and pursued a 
way of life similar to that they had known in their home countries. At the same 
time, they influenced the culture of their new  homes which absorbed some of 
the migrants’ cultural traditions.
Chinese Enclaves
Many Chinese emigrated in search of work during the latter half of the 1th 
century—some to work on sugar plantations or for other agricultural endeavors, 
others to work in industry and transportation. Together, they spread Chinese 
culture around the world. 
Southeast Asia  The Chinese who migrated to Southeast Asia thrived 
under colonial rule. In Indochina, the French encouraged them to engage 
in commerce. In Malaya, they managed opium farms and controlled opium 
distribution for the British. In the Dutch East Indies, some Chinese held posts 
with the colonial government. As time went on, many Chinese throughout the 
region became business owners and traders, often founding family businesses. 
Some Chinese acquired great wealth as moneylenders or through international 
trade. By the end of the 19th century, the Chinese controlled trade throughout 
Southeast Asia and were a significant presence in the region. 
The Americas  Chinese immigrants first came to the United States in 
large numbers during the height of the California gold rush . Many worked in 
mines, but others found work on farms or in San Francisco’s garment industry.

431 E--ECTS  O- MIGRATIO N431Between 18 and 18, some 225,000 Chinese laborers were sent to 
Cuba and Peru on eight-year contracts. Almost all of them were male, and 80 
percent of them were sent to work on sugar plantations alongside enslaved 
Africans in Cuba and replacing enlaved workers in Peru, where slavery had 
been abolished. Other Chinese in Cuba were employed as servants, in cigarette 
factories, and in public works projects. Several thousand contract laborers in 
Peru helped build the Andean railroad and worked in the guano mines. In the 
1870s, some Chinese built settlements in the Peruvian Amazon, where they 
were active as merchants and grew rice, beans, sugar, and other crops.
In each area they lived, Chinese immigrants left their cultural stamp. Some 
Peruvian cuisine is a fusion of Chinese foods and ingredients and cooking 
styles of Peru. As in other areas, Chinese immigrants sometimes married local 
people and thus contributed to the multicultural diversity of populations. 
Indian Enclaves 
The British Empire abolished slavery in 1833. However, it was replaced with a 
system that was little better, indentured servitude. Indians were among the first 
indentured servants sent to work in British colonies.of family responsibilities. If they later followed their husbands to another 
country, they often participated more fully, though far from equally, in family

432 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIndians in Africa  Many Indians went to Mauritius,  islands off the 
southeast coast of Africa, and Natal , a colony that is today part of South 
Africa, as indentured servants on sugar plantations. In Natal and British East 
Africa, they built railways. Nearly 32,000 indentured Indian workers went 
to .enya to work on railroad construction between 1886 and 101, but only 
about ,000 chose to stay. Today, Indians continue to make up significant parts 
of the population of these regions.
Both Hindus and Muslims emigrated from India to South Africa. The 
Hindus brought with them their caste system and the social laws that stem 
from it, but they soon abandoned the caste system. In contrast, many kept up 
Hindu traditions and had alters in their homes to honor deities.
The Hindu and Muslim Indian population of South Africa was divided 
by class, language, and religion. However, Indians in South Africa shared 
the injustice of discrimination, which became central to the work of a young 
Indian named Mohandas Gandhi . He arrived in Pretoria, South Africa, in 
1893, where he intended to practice law. After suffering repeatedly from racial 
discrimination, Gandhi became an activist. He founded the Natal Indian 
Congress  and worked to expose to the world the rampant discrimination 
against Indians in South Africa. In 11 Gandhi returned to India, where he 
became a leader in the Indian nationalist movement against British rule.
Indians in Southeast Asia  Between 18 and 1 India was the major 
source of labor for the British Southeast Asian colonies of Ceylon, Burma, 
and Malaya. Many Indians went to Malaya as indentured laborers. Indentured 
servitude was eventually replaced by the kangani system , under which entire 
families were recruited to work on tea, coffee, and rubber plantations in Ceylon, 
Burma, and Malaya. Their lives were less restricted than those of indentured 
laborers, and they had the advantage of having their families with them. It is 
estimated that about 6 million Indians migrated to Southeast Asia before the 
kangani system was abolished. Because Southeast Asia was relatively close, 
Indian workers there often kept close ties with India.
Indian traders settled in many countries where there were indentured 
laborers. They also looked for business opportunities throughout the British 
Empire, such as British East Africa.
Indians in the Caribbean Region  So many Indians were sent to work 
on the sugar plantations in and around the Caribbean that today they comprise 
the largest ethnic group in Guyana  and Trinidad and Tobago , and the 
second largest group in Suriname, Jamaica, Grenada, Saint 9incent and the 
Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Martinique and Guadeloupe. In many of the other 
Caribbean nations Indians constitute a sizable proportion of the population. In 
addition, they have blended ethnically with migrants from other parts of the 
world, creating a unique culture, affecting national cuisines, film, and music. 
Many of the countries in the region celebrate the arrival of the Indians with 
annual holidays or festivals.
433 E--ECTS  O- MIGRATIO NIrish Enclaves in North America
Before the American Revolution, most Irish who came to North America were 
Protestant descendants of Scots who had previously migrated to Ireland. They 
are often referred to as Scots-Irish . Most came as indentured servants. Those 
who paid their own passage often went west to the frontier.
After the American Revolution, most new Irish immigrants who came 
to the United States settled in northern cities. Many others went to British 
North America Canada, where they were able to get cheap land grants. By 
the 1830s, most new Irish immigrants were poorer than earlier settlers, and 
Catholic. Most of those who settled in cities worked in factories. Many of 
the men who came to the United States helped construct the canal system . In 
Canada as well as the United States, many Irish farmed. Most Irish immigrants 
were able to create decent lives for themselves and their children.
Half of the  million Irish who fled Ireland during the Great Famine 
came to North America. Most of this huge wave of Irish immigrants faced 
many hardships, not the least of them anti-immigrant nativist and anti-
Catholic sentiments in the United States. Nevertheless, immigration from 
Ireland continued strong after the Great Famine ended until the 1880s, when 
it gradually slowed. Many of these new immigrants were single women who 
came to the United States looking for work and husbands. More than half 
became domestic servants. Many of the men who came during this period were 
unskilled laborers.
Wherever they settled, the Irish in the United States spread their culture—
their lively dance music and holiday traditions such as the celebration of St. 
Patrick’s Day. They also had a strong influence on the conditions of laborers 
through their efforts at promoting labor unions, and their great numbers 
ensured the spread of Catholicism in the United States.
Second-generation Irish were often either white-collar  or skilled blue-
collar  workers. Many became “stars” of the new popular culture  that was 
taking root at the end of the century as boxers, baseball players, and vaudeville 
performers. Many second-and third-generation Irish, such as the Fitzgeralds 
and the Kennedys, became very wealthy and powerful.
Italians in Argentina
During the 18th and 19th centuries only the United States surpassed Argentina  
in the number of immigrants it attracted. The 1853 Argentine Constitution not 
only encouraged European immigration, but it also guaranteed to foreigners 
the same civil rights enjoyed by Argentine citizens.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Italians made up almost half of 
the European immigrants to Argentina. Today people of Italian descent make 
up more than 55 percent of the Argentine population. As a result, Italians have 
had an enormous influence on all aspects of Argentine culture and language. 
Argentine Spanish has absorbed many Italian words, and Italian is still widely 
spoken in Buenos Aires.
434 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONArgentina was underpopulated and had an enormous amount of fertile land, 
which appealed to Italian immigrants. Most of them were farmers, artisans, and 
day laborers. Wages in Argentina were much higher than in Italy. Agricultural 
workers, for example, could earn five to ten times as much in Argentina as in 
Italy. In addition, the cost of living, even in Buenos Aires, was much lower 
than that of many rural Italian provinces. Both of these factors allowed most 
immigrants to raise their standard of living greatly in a very short time. By 
10, Italian immigrants owned nearly 0 percent of Buenos Aires’ commercial 
establishments.
Prejudice and Regulation of Immigration
In the United States and Australia, native-born residents resented immigrants 
from China who were willing to work for lower wages. In response to these 
resentments, governments institutionalized discrimination against the Chinese. 
Regulation in the United States  
Nativists were powerful enough in California that a revised constitution ratified 
in 1879 included several provisions that targeted people from China:
• It prohibited the state, counties, municipalities, and public works from 
hiring Chinese workers. 
• It prevented individuals from China, and any others who were not 
considered white, from becoming citizens on the grounds that they were 
“dangerous to the well-being of the State.” 
• It encouraged cities and towns either to remove Chinese residents from 
within their limits or to segregate them in certain areas.
With many thousands of Chinese living in the United States by 1882, 
Congress banned further Chinese immigration by passage of the Chinese 
Exclusion Act . Initially limited to a ten year period, the policy was extended 
periodically and made permanent in 102. This act, which was finally repealed 
in 1, showed the discrimination in the United States.
After the U.S. Congress excluded Chinese immigrants, some of them began 
to move to Mexico. Mexican President 3orfirio 'ta] promoted immigration as 
well as development, especially in the northern area bordering the United States. 
Rather than working as laborers in the mines or railroads, most worked as truck 
farmers, shopkeepers, or manufacturers.
White Australia  
Before the Australian gold rushes of the 1850s and 1860s, most of the Chinese in 
Australia were indentured laborers, convicts, or traders. During the gold rushes, 
the Chinese population grew to around 50,000. In response to the influx of Chinese 
miners, the parliament of the province of 9ictoria passed a Chinese Immigration 
Act in 1855 that limited the number of Chinese who could come ashore from each 
ship. Many Chinese got around this law by landing instead in South Australia.
435 E--ECTS  O- MIGRATIO NIn December 1860, white miners in the goldfields of New South Wales 
attacked the area where Chinese miners were quartered, killing several and 
wounding many others. Several other attacks followed. One of the worst 
occurred on June 0, 1861, when several thousand white miners attacked the 
Chinese and plundered their dwellings.
In response to this violence, the New South Wales Legislative Council 
passed the Chinese Immigration Regulation and Restriction Act  in 
November of that year. The act, eventually repealed in 186, was an attempt 
to restrict the number of Chinese immigrants from entering the colony. By the 
end of the gold rushes in 1881, New South Wales passed the ,nflu[ oI Chinese 
Restriction Act , which attempted to restrict Chinese immigration by means of 
an entrance tax. 
After the gold rushes, the Chinese in Australia turned to other sources of 
income, such as gardening, trade, furniture making, fishing, and pearl diving. 
While Chinatowns  Chinese enclaves developed in cities across Australia, 
the Chinese made their biggest economic contributions in the Northern 
Territory and north Queensland regions. Eventually, however, anti-Chinese 
sentiment grew. Because the Chinese artisans and laborers would work for 
less than white Australians, resentment increased. Anti-Chinese leagues also 
began to develop.
Although the number of Chinese in Australia was declining, they were 
becoming more concentrated in Melbourne and Sydney and thus more visible. 
After six separate British self-governing colonies in Australia united under a 
single centralized government in 1901, the new parliament took action to limit 
non-British immigration. The new attorney general stated that the government’s 
policy was to preserve a “white Australia.” The White Australia Policy , as it 
was known, remained in effect until the mid-1970s. Connect: Compare the 
experiences in Australia of Chinese and Japanese immigrants. See Topic 6.6.

CAUSATIO N IN THE IMPERIAL AGE439
6.8
Causation in the Imperial Age
The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from 
those who ha]e a diќerent complexion or who ha]e slightly flatter noses than 
ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much.
—Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness , 1899
Essential Question:   What was the relative signiÄcance of the effects of 
imperialism from 1750 to 1900?
Industrial capitalism caused significant developments between 150 to 100. 
The manufacturing capacity of industrialized nations caused an increase in 
the availability, affordability, and variety of both capital financial assets and 
consumer goods. However, this increased industrial capacity also led to an 
increased demand for natural resources—“the conquest of the earth”—to use 
in manufacturing these goods. Additionally, domestic markets soon became 
saturated, leading industrialized nations to seek out foreign markets to soak 
up the excess production. Competition for these markets increased among 
industrialized economies, especially those in the West. To reduce competition 
and increase profits, Western nations continued to look to empire-building, 
begun in the previous era, as a solution to these challenges. 
Ninetheenth-century imperialism also caused significant effects, including 
increased migration, the rise of independence movements within the colonies, 
and increased political and economic rivalry among Western European nations 
that would lead to catastrophic events in the early 20th century.
Changes in Standards of Living
Due to increased automation, the use of interchangeable parts, the division 
and specialization of labor, and the assembly line, the efficiency of industrial 
production increased. This efficiency led to greater output, especially of such 
consumer goods as textiles, home furnishings, clothing, and porcelain. As the 
supply of consumer goods increased, the availability of goods rose and the 
prices fell. In addition, increased global industrial production led to greater 
competition and variety of both consumer and capital goods. For some people, 
standards of living improved with the proliferation of consumer goods. 
One way economists measure standard of living is by tracing patterns 
in real wages²those adjusted for inflation. Real wages signify the amount 
440 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONof goods or services that can be bought. In the early years of the Industrial 
Revolution, some studies show that real wages grew slowly, but after 1819   
the pace of growth accelerated, and between 1819 and 1852 they doubled.  The 
growth of real wages paralleled the rise in consumption. By these measures, 
standards of living increased for people of all income groups. 
At the same time, however, the distribution of income the wealth gap 
became more pronounced. Additionally, some of the rise in income was offset 
by the growing problems in an industrialized society—pollution, crowded 
cities, and the costs of wars. With these taken into consideration, standards of 
living may not have risen for many people. 
Overseas Expansion
As more countries industrialized and the capacity to produce goods increased, 
overproduction became a serious economic issue. Domestic markets could 
no longer consume the amount of goods being produced. As a result, 
international trade transformed industrial economies from mercantilist to 
capitalist systems. Industrialized economies looked to increase exports of 
their products. The desire to increase exports, however, caused both economic 
and political rivalries among industrialized countries as businesses sought out 
new international customers and enlisted their government’s assistance to help 
open previously closed or inaccessible markets.Average Percentage of GD P*

trade and openness 1800-2010. London, Centre for Economic Poli cy Research. (CEPR WP.11128).*GDP, or gross domestic product, is one measure of the total amo unt of goods and services produced by a country.
As production increased, new and greater amounts of natural resources 
were required by industrial economies. In addition, such common industrial 
resources as coal and iron, tin, bauxite, rubber, and copper were also imported 
from sources in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. A key effect of 
industrial capitalism, therefore, was the expansion of imperialism in the 19th 
441 CAUSATIO N IN THE IMPERIAL AGE441century. Industrialized countries, especially those in Western Europe, the U.S., 
and Japan, saw the benefits of controlling trade and resources of other areas of 
the world. This trend was a continuation from the previous era during which 
European countries created colonies in the Western Hemisphere and in the 
Indian Ocean. 
In contrast, the dependent colonial economies that provided raw material 
to and markets for the imperial powers often saw little economic development 
from participation in the world economy. Reliance on the cash crops introduced 
by imperial powers often left them vulnerable to natural disasters and volatile 
markets. 
In this era, however, states and people in regions that had previously been 
able to resist European colonization found themselves increasingly dominated 
by Western powers. Most areas of Africa came under the direct control of 
European colonizers. Large portions of South Asia and Southeast Asia were 
colonized, mainly by Great Britain and France, respectively. Even China, the 
most dynamic civilization in previous eras, succumbed to the domination of 
Western and Japanese imperialists. Western powers were able to achieve this 
level of dominance because of the technological advances associated with the 
Industrial Revolution. Advances in military technology, ship building, and 
medicine helped Western European nations  assert control over these other 
regions. 
Seeds of Revolution and Rebellion
In the late 1700s, the former North American colonies of Great Britain  revolted 
against its colonial rule and declared themselves the independent nation of 
the United States of America. Shortly after, France threw off the yoke of the 
monarchy and established a republic. In the early 1800s, former Spanish and 
Portuguese colonies in South America also became independent states. 
As western imperialism took hold in other parts of the world, the seeds 
of resistance and rebellion that would, in time, lead to new nation-states took 
root. Westernization assimilation of Western culture was often resisted in 
colonized or dominated areas. In South Asia, for example, Indian soldiers 
known as sepoys rose up in rebellion against the British East India Company. 
While the rebellion was brutally suppressed by British soldiers, the effect 
was the disbandment of the British East India Company and the direct rule 
of India by the British government, commencing a period now known as the 
British Raj. Similarly, westernization was opposed in China by the Boxers 
who attempted to rid China of Western influence, especially from Christian 
missionaries. These nascent independence movements would lead to the more 
widespread and successful nationalism of the post-World War II period.
442 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMigration and Discrimination
One of the more significant effects of modern imperialism was the migration 
from dependent or less industrial areas of the world to the dominant industrial 
economies. People emigrated from rural areas to urban areas within countries 
and from less developed areas of Europe to more developed areas of Europe. 
Immigrants looking for economic opportunity left many European 
countries and settled in the United States and Canada, often making up a large 
proportion of the industrial workforce. Some immigrants signed contracts to 
travel to areas to work for a prescribed period of time, pay back the cost of 
their transport, and then either settle in these areas or return to their homelands. 
These indentured laborers, as they were called, came from China, Japan, South 
Asia, and Europe and found themselves working and living in the Americas, 
Southeast Asia, Africa, or Australia. If they chose to settle in their host 
country, they often formed enclaves, or communities, with others from their 
home country. Often, these immigrants were faced with discrimination based 
on race, religion, or other factors. The spread of global capitalism resulted 
in the accumulation of wealth by the middle and upper classes, while the 
working classes in the industrial economies, already exploited by the profit 
motive, found themselves in direct competition for jobs with immigrants from 
nonindustrial countries.
REFLECT ON THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. Causation There are many ways to determine the relative significance 
of the effects of a historical development. These are some of the criteria 
for ranking the relative impact of effects:
• The depth of change it brought about in people
• The number of people it affected
• How long the effect lasted
• The importance of the change it represented
 Choose one of the effects of imperialism and evaluate it based on these 
criteria for determining significance.
2. In one to three paragraphs, explain the relative significance of  the 
effects of imperialism from 1750 to 1900.

UNIT 6 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   HOW DID COLONIZATION  PROMOTE  
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC GROWTH&
In the 19th century, the European powers believed that building a 
modern economy required establishing colonies. They focused on the 
economic and political benefits of imperialism. 
Problems with Imperialism  By the early 20th century, as the 
struggles of the workers and the burden of imperialist wars began to take 
a toll, some historians focused on the costs of imperialism. British writer 
J. A. Hobson argued in his book Imperialism: A Study 10 imperialist 
competition for new resources and markets was a flaw in capitalism. The 
accumulation of capital in the hands of a few profit-seeking capitalists 
pressured governments to take over underdeveloped nations and to protect 
access to them. Hobson then explained how this was justified, based on 
the needs of a growing population or hopes for quick profits, but that 
those supporting this greed for territorial acquisition did not consider the 
associated political and economic costs. 
Hobson believed that the system could be improved through greater 
global cooperation and planning. In contrast, Russian revolutionary 
9ladimir Lenin wrote in Imperialism, The Highest Stage of Capital 
Development 11 that imperialist conflicts would cause capitalist 
states to destroy each other and usher in the era of communism. 
%enefits to SoPe  In the late 20th century, historians living in an age 
of increasing globalization re-studied the roots of the world economy. 
Immanuel Wallerstein, an American social scientist, popularized world-
systems theory. He described a dynamic system of two main regions: 
• The core included highly developed nations that accumulated 
capital and demanded resources and markets from under- or less-
developed regions
• The periphery consisted of regions that provided resources and 
markets as well as labor needed by the core 
Wallerstein traced the roots of this world-system to the mid-16th century. 
Colonialism became the means by which peripheral states became 
incorporated into the world economy. However, Wallerstein noted that 
politics and culture vary within the world economy, so nations could be 
semi-peripheral at some point and possibly move to the core—or the 
other way around. He cited Spain as an example. Although this world-
system caused inequalities, its dynamic nature insured its durability.

WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  WRITE  THE INTROD UCTION
After you analyze the task, gather and organize evidence, and develop 
an effective thesis statement, much of the hard work in writing a long 
essay is behind you. The most challenging task still remaining is to write 
an introduction that 1 serves as a blueprint for the rest of the essay and 
2 casts the topic in a broader historical perspective.
The Introduction as Blueprint  In generic terms, a good introduction 
conveys the framework or limits of the topic as well as a clear debatable and 
defensible claim. The claim should be expressed in one or more sentences in 
the same location—ideally the introduction. The introduction also suggests 
the organizational pattern and reasoning process that will unfold in the rest of 
the essay. In other words, it conveys without saying, “Here’s what I’m going 
to argue. Here’s the reasoning process I am going to use to convince you. 
Here’s the order I will use to present my ideas.” The reasoning process may 
be causation, continuity and change, or comparison. Each reasoning process 
suggests a unique organization. See Write as a Historian in Topic  .. 
Historical Perspective  A good introduction also relates the topic of 
the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occur before, during, or that continue after the time frame of the question. 
In other words, it conveys without saying, “Here’s how this topic relates 
to what came before it/what came after it/what else was going on in other 
parts of the world or other aspects of society, and any number of broader 
historical patterns and trends.” The introduction is a good place to point out 
the historical perspective, but it will need further development later in the 
essay. A simple reference to a historical perspective is not sufficient to earn 
points on the exam.
Application  Find both the blueprint and historical perspective in the 
following introduction. How does the introduction answer these questions:
• What is the author’s argument? 
• What reasoning process will the author use? 
• What order will the author likely use? 
• How does the topic relate to broader historical events, 
developments, or processes?
The new global capitalist economy that developed between 1750 and 
1900 brought many obvious changes as smokestacks and ships laden 
with raw materials for industry became commonplace. One of the 
most dramatic changes, however, was the effect of industrialization on 
patterns of migration, from the countryside to the city and from one 
country to another. These changes in turn brought about significantly 
different social conditions that laid the foundation for challenges many 
countries continue to face today.

writing time for each essay is 40 minutes.
1. In the period 1750 to 1900, some European powers suffered a decrease 
in influence, and new empires emerged²one in the Americas and one 
in Asia.  
Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which the global 
balance of power shifted during that era.
2. From 1750 to 1900, nationalist movements emerged throughout South

3. European powers divided up much of Africa and India from 1750 
to 1900, but indigenous peoples had their own opinions about 
imperialism.  
Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which the responses 
of native people to imperialism were similar in India and Sub-Saharan 
Africa between 1750 and 1900. 
4. As the economy grew increasingly global from 1750 to 1900, 
working people in Eurasia, the Americas, Australia, and Africa began 
moving into urban centers and across borders, but many had the same 
motivations their ancestors had.

that I should hear no more of their claiming the places they lived on as

consider all those farms as their own. . . . Sir Harry Smith had sent Warden 
to govern in the Sovereignty. He listened to the Boers, and he proposed 
that all the land in which those Boers’ farms were should be taken from 
me. I was at that time in trouble, for Sikonyela and the Korannas [other

UNIT 7: GLOBAL CONFLICT  AFTER 1900 451
UNIT 7:   Global Conflict  
After 1900
Understand the Context
The 20th century was a time of great social and political change, much of which 
resulted in tension and division. People and states challenged existing political 
and social orders, while new technologies and scientific advancements both 
advanced understanding of the universe and enabled the two world wars to be 
increasingly destructive. 
Shifting Powers  Challenges to existing states and political establishments 
set the stage for shifting powers throughout the 20th century. Long-established 
states such as the Ottoman Empire dissolved, while new political experiments 
such as communism emerged in Russia, China, and elsewhere. The ongoing 
power of nationalism and traditional rivalries, combined with economic 
instability, soon embroiled most of Europe and its colonies, the United States, 
Japan, and China in the First World War. Though dubbed “the war to end all 
wars,” it was not. World War II was far larger and bloodier. Additional conflicts 
occurred as colonized regions fought for independence.
A Changing World  Rapid advances in technology altered the 
understanding of the universe and the natural world in the 20th century. 
Advancements in communication, transportation, industry, agriculture, and 
medicine brought people longer lives, greater opportunities to find meaningful 
work, and better access to information. However, emerging military 
technologies also made war more deadly. World War I featured advancements 
such as the aircraft, while World War II enabled the development of the atomic 
bomb. Mass atrocities were also brought about by the intentional destruction 
of entire ethnic or religious groups of people, including the Holocaust during 
World War II. Totalitarian governments, such as the one under Joseph Stalin 
in the Soviet Union, adopted repressive policies that resulted in the deaths of 
many millions of people.19002000 1950A political

SHIFTING POWER453
4537.1
Shifting Power
I shall never, under any circumstances, agree to a representative form  
of government because I consider it harmful to the people whom God  
has entrusted to my care. 
—Russian Tsar Nicholas II (1905)
Essential Question:   How did internal and external factors contribute to 
change in various states after 1900?
An intense period of rebellion continued into the early 100s. Nicholas II, the 
last Russian tsar, clearly did not understand the force of the political opposition 
to his rule that resulted in his assassination in 118. In the 20th century’s first two 
decades, rebellions erupted against long-standing authoritarian governments 
in Russia, China, and Mexico. Revolutionaries unseated ruling governments in 
each country, challenging the existing political and social order and instituting 
their own political philosophies and practices. Established land-based and 
maritime empires collapsed under pressure from internal and external forces. 
By the end of the century, a new global order had emerged.
Revolution in Russia
By the early 20th century, Russia was falling behind most of Europe, the 
United States, and Japan in wealth in power. 
Russia’s  most obvious challenges were internal. While governments 
in other industrializing states in the 19th century were actively promoting 
economic growth, Russia was not. It was slow to expand education for 
peasants, build roads and other parts of its transportation networks, and support 
entrepreneurs with loans and contracts. Further, the tsarist government resisted 
calls for political reform. It did was reluctant to recognize civil liberties and to 
allow more citizens to participate in government. 
These internal problems led to external ones. Without a strong economic 
base to support a military, Russia then became weaker in international affairs:
• It lost the Crimean War (1853–1856) against the Ottoman Empire,, 
which was supported by Great Britain and France.
• It lost the Russo-Japanese War 10±105 in a battle for power in 
East Asia.
454 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn the fall of 1917, the Bolsheviks , an organization representing the 
revolutionary working class of Russia under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, 
seized power and set up a communist government with Lenin at its head. 
The communists  believed that workers eventually should own the means of 
production and that collective ownership would lead to collective prosperity 
and a just society. Toward that long-term goal, the Soviet government abolished 
private trade, distributed peasants’ crops to feed urban workers, and took over 
ownership of the country’s factories and heavy industries (see Topic 7.4)
Key Events Leading to Revolution in Russia
Internal •  Bloody Sunday, January 22, 1905: Thousands of workers 
marched peacefully to petition the tsar asking for better working 
conditions, higher wages, and universal suɈrage. The tsar’s troops 
and police began shooting. About 1,300 marchers were killed.
•  The Revolution of 1905:  In strikes responding to Bloody Sunday, 
400,000 workers refused to work. The tsar tried to appease the 
protesters. However, by the end, thousands of workers had been 
killed, inQured, or exiled.
External •  Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905): Russia and Japan both 
wanted to expand their influence in 2orea and Manchuria. Japan 
won easily, the first time in modern history that an East Asian state 
had defeated a European power.
•  World War I: Germany declared war on Russia in 1914. Russians 
quickly realized how poorly trained and armed their troops were. 
Civilians suɈered from extreme food shortages.
The success of the Bolsheviks in taking power shook the world. They 
were the first example of communists running a large country. Throughout the 
capitalist world, from Europe to the United States to Japan, people worried that 
communists were a danger to their governments as well. The conflict between 
communism and capitalism would become an important issue shaping world 
affairs in the rest of the 20th century.
Upheaval in China
China was another land-based empire that collapsed in this period from 
problems it faced at home and from other countries. The Qing Dynasty had 
come to power in China in 1644. Finally, a revolution overthrew it in 1911, 
creating a republic led first by Dr. Sun Yat-sen . However, his rule was short. 
Internal Challenges  China faced daunting domestic concerns in the 19th 
century, each of which weakened support for the government. One of these was 
ethnic tension. China consisted of dozens of ethnic groups. The largest group 
was the Han. The rulers of the Qing Dynasty were Manchus, from a region 
northeast of China. Many Chinese, particularly the Han, never fully accepted 
the Qing as legitimate rulers of China. By the late 1th century, the Qing had 
ruled China for over two centuries, but they had remained ethni cally distinct. 
455 SHIFTING POWERA second problem was the constant danger of famine. China experienced 
rapid population growth between the mid-100s and mid-1800s, but could not 
expand the amount of farmland or productivity rapidly enough to provide a 
stable food supply. Any natural disaster, such as a drought or a flood, could 
result in the early deaths of thousands of people. 
Third, government revenues were very low. The imperial government had 
not updated the tax system to adjust to changes in the economy. As a result, 
compared to Europe or the United States, taxes in China were low. This meant 
that the government did not have the resources to maintain roads, bridges, and 
irrigation canals. 
External Challenges  China had been one of the wealthiest, most 
powerful, most innovative states in the world for much of its recorded history. 
However, starting in the late 18th century, it faced growing threats to its 
position by industrialization in Europe. In the late 18th century, Europeans 
interested in the Chinese market could trade only in the city of Canton 
Guangzhou. Europeans commonly bought tea, rhubarb, porcelain, and silk. 
In Europe, Chinese fashions, table settings, and art objects were very popular. 
The Chinese received European silver in exchange for they sold. However, the 
Chinese did not desire the products Europeans produced, and they looked down 
on Europeans as violent and less civilized. In response to growing European 
influence in China, many Chinese did rally behind the empress in the 180s.  
Chinese Republic  However the desire to support the empress against 
foreign pressure was not enough to save the Qing Dynasty. In 111, the last 
Chinese dynasty was overthrown by a revolutionary movement led by Sun 
Yat-sen. Though a Christian, Sun believed that China should continued to 
follow such Confucian principles as loyalty, respect for ancestors, and efforts 
to promote social harmony. He combined these traditions with ideas he later 
elaborated upon in his book The Three People’ s Principles:
• Democracy:  Sun believed in sovereignty, not for all the people but 
for those Chinese who were “able.” In Confucian terms, this meant a 
country governed by active and pragmatic experts in the name of the 
people. He felt that expelling foreign capitalists from China would 
enable China to redistribute revenues from land taxes more fairly , since 
the revenues would not have to be used to pay debts to foreigners.
• Nationalism:  Sun advocated patriotism and loyalty, primarily to central 
authority.
• Livelihood:  Sun wanted to end the extreme unequal distribution of 
wealth in China and the harsh economic exploitation.
Sun Yat-sen’s Legacy  Sun never had enough military strength to rule 
all of China. 9arious warlords controlled the majority of the country. Sun 
recognized the weakness of his position. After two months in office, he gave 
up his position to a military leader.
456WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe party Sun led, the Chinese Nationalist Party, or .uomintang, would 
later regain power. It would rule China for two decades before losing a civil 
war with Chinese Communists see Topic .5.While both the .uomintang 
and the Communists would honor Sun as the founder of the Chinese republic, 
neither would fully implement his principles. 
Self-Determination in the Ottoman Collapse
By the beginning of the 20th century, the once-mighty Ottoman Empire²
now “the sick man of Europe”²had relatively few exports and a waning 
agricultural economy. The empire relied mostly upon its position as a trade 
center. Egypt, by contrast, continued to make profits from cotton.
The Young Turks  As Ottoman prosperity declined, a group of reformers 
known as the Young Turks  emerged. They advocated for a constitution like 
those of the European states. They also advocated 7urNification an effort 
to make all citizens of the multiethnic empire identify with Turkish culture, 
which was heavily Islamic. For the millions of Armenians in the empire, 
who were mostly Christians, this was difficult. In response, some Young 
Turks scapegoated, or unfairly blamed, Armenians for the empire’s economic 
problems. Connect: Compare the cultural assimilation forced on Armenians 
to that forced on American Indians. See Topic 6.. 
)iJht $Jainst )oreiJn ,nfluence  Turks resented many Europeans, 
particularly the British and the French, for their economic policies. Foreign 
investments had given Europeans undue power in the empire. Further, 
Europeans had imposed trade privileges that were unprofitable for the 
Ottomans. Because of these resentments,  the Ottoman Empire secretly allied 
with Germany in World War I. See Topic .2. After Germany’s defeat in 
World War I, the Ottoman Empire was dismantled by the victorious powers. 
It was replaced by a smaller nation-state, the Republic of Turkey, and several 
independent countries.
9ictorious Allied forces immediately sent troops to occupy Anatolia. 
Although the sultan of the Ottoman Empire remained on his throne, he had 
little power. He served as a mere puppet for British forces that hoped to control 
the lands of the former empire. 
The Rise of Atatürk  During the war, a group called the Turkish National 
Movement organized an army to fight for self-determination. Led by Mustafa 
.ePal the Turkish Nationalists defeated British and other forces in 121. The 
Republic of Turkey was established in 12, with .emal as the first president. 
The new national assembly awarded him the surname Atatürk  “father of the 
Turks” in recognition of his role in establishing the new republic.
Atatrk’s policies focused on reforming Turkey to make it more like the 
Western democracies. He was determined to create a secular nation, not one 
with strong Islamic influences. He implemented several reforms: establishing 
public education for boys and girls, abolishing polygyny, and expanding 
457 SHIFTING POWERsuffrage to include women. As a symbolic gesture, he wore mainly Western 
suits and hats and encouraged others to do the same. Despite his reforms, he 
ruled as a dictator for 15 years. He did not give up power before his death  
in 1938.
Power Shifts in Mexico 
Mexico entered the 20th century as an independent nation firmly under the 
control of a dictator, 3orfirio 'ta] . He oversaw a period of stability and some 
economic progress. However, he had allowed foreign investors, particularly 
those from the United States, control over many of the country’s resources. 
Additionally, the wealthiest 1 percent of the population controlled  percent 
of the land. Typical Mexican peasants were landless.
Revolution  In 1910, Díaz jailed Francisco Madero , the opposition 
candidate for president. This act, combined with the growing opposition 
to Díaz’s strong-armed policies, accommodation to foreign powers, and 
opposition to land reform, ignited the Mexican Revolution.  Madero escaped 
and set up revolutionary offices in El Paso, Texas. Then, in 111, Madero’s 
troops, under the command of )rancisco ³3ancho´ 9illa  defeated Mexican 
troops, sending Díaz into exile. One revolutionary leader, Emiliano Zapata , 
began the actual process of redistributing land to impoverished peasants. 
Until 120, Mexico suffered from political instability and devastating 
violence. Between 110 and 120, conflict resulted in around 2 million deaths, 
out of a population of around 15 million people. Political violence continued 
for another decade. However, two results came out of conflicts between 110 
and 10 that provided Mexico with stability for the rest of the century:
• Mexico adopted a new constitution in 11. It included the goals of 
land redistribution, universal suffrage, and public education. These 
principles continued to guide Mexico’s government.
• The Institutional Revolutionary Party , or 35, was formed in 1929. 
Though widely criticized as corrupt, the PRI dominated Mexican 
politics. Until 2000, all presidents were PRI members.

460WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   SITUATE THE POWER SHIFTS IN CONTE XT
On the surface, modern revolutions appear to follow a similar pattern. 
In The Anatomy of Revolution 18, Crane Brinton described the 
similarities of four political revolutions: the English Revolution of the 
160s, the American Revolution of 16, the French Revolution of 
1789, and the Russian Revolution of 1917. Brinton thought that all four 
revolutions went through four stages.
1. Citizens become dissatisfied with government.
2. Moderates gain more power.
3. Radicals take over in a “terror” phase.
4. The process culminates in a period of relative calm and 
acceptance.
Within this pattern, each revolution had unique revolutionary 
circumstances and outcomes. For example, Brinton acknowledged 
that the American Revolution, unlike the other three, lacked a “terror” 
phase. He concluded his study by noting that some top-down reforms 
imposed by government or elite leaders brought more lasting social 
change than the political revolutions he described.

CAUSES OF WORLD WAR I 461
7.2
Causes of World War I
The next great European war will probably come out of  
some damned foolish thing in the Balkans.
—German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck (1888)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and consequences  
of World War I?
In the years before World War I, social and political developments, including 
shifting powers, contributed to the escalation of tensions that resulted in 
global conflict. European nations, expanding their empires, competed for raw 
material resources in Africa and Asia. A series of mutual alliances created 
entanglements that committed nations to defense systems that would draw 
them into war. Arms races involving Germany, Great Britain, and Russia gave 
military establishments great influence.
The immediate cause of the war’s outbreak had its roots in yet another 
cause of conflict²a rising wave of nationalism. As Bismarck predicted, this 
clash erupted in the Balkans when Serbian nationalists, protesting  Austria-
Hungary’s control over the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, assassinated 
Austro-Hungarian $rchGuNe )ran] )erGinanG . Thus World War I began.
Immediate Causes of the Great War
World War I, which lasted from 1914 to 1918, was known as the  Great  
War ²not because of its positive nature, but because of the immense 
scale of the fighting. No previous war had involved as many nations from 
different parts of the world or killed as many soldiers and civilians. However,  
World War I did more than create an enormous body count. It fundamentally 
weakened the Western European powers, thus encouraging the growth of 
nationalism and appeals for self-rule within European colonies in Asia and 
Africa. Treaties signed at the end of this war helped set the stage for World 
War II. World War I was one of the most significant events of the 20th century.
A long series of events led up to World War I. The immediate cause was 
the assassination by Gavrilo Princip  of $rchGuNe )ran] )erGinanG  the 
heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, on June 28, 11. 
Princip, a Serbian, was a member of the Black Hand , a nationalist 
462WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONorganization devoted to ending Austro-Hungarian presence in the Balkans. 
From the Austro-Hungarian perspective, however, the Black Hand was a 
terrorist group. 
Immediately after the assassinations, Austria-Hungary sent an ultimatum 
to the Serbian government, demanding that it end all anti-Austrian agitation 
in Serbia. When the Serbian government rejected the ultimatum, Austria-
Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28, 11. Austria-Hungary looked to 
its ally Germany, a stronger nation with more firepower, for military assistance 
to punish Serbia. Serbia, populated by ethnic Slavs, looked to other Slavic 
countries, particularly Russia, for help. On August 1, Germany declared war 
on Russia, and two days later on France. The following day, Britain declared 
war on Germany, and on August 6 Austria declared war on Russia. By the end 
of August 11, Japan’s entrance into the conflict changed a relatively minor 
incident into a true world war.
Long-Term Causes of the Great War
Princip’s actions were not the sole cause of World War I. Tensions in Europe 
had been simmering for decades. One way to remember the sources of these 
tensions is with the acronym MAIN: Militarism, Alliances, Imperialism, and 
Nationalism.
Militarism  Defined as aggressive military preparedness, militarism  
celebrates war and the armed forces. European powers had been competing for 
dominance one way to prove their strength was to invest in the military. Great

463 CAUSES OF WORLD WAR I 463Britain and Germany in particular spent a great deal of money on building up 
their armies and navies, heavily recruiting young men to join their armed forces 
and building more ships and amassing other military hardware. Because of the 
Industrial Revolution, it was possible to mass-produce weapons and supplies. 
A nation’s militaristic attitude influenced its public to view war as a festive 
competition, more like a game than a gravely serious matter. “Everybody said, 
µIt’ll be over by Christmas,’” a British soldier named Bill Haine recalled.
Alliances  In their quest for power, European nations also formed secret 
alliances ²groups whose members secretly agree to protect and help one 
another when attacked. When one member of an alliance was attacked in any 
way, the other members were expected to stand up for that particular member. 
This system explains why Russia and Germany were ready to jump into the 
conflict between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. 
Furthermore, countries that were allied with other countries were also 
sworn enemies of members of other alliances. For example, Britain and France 
were allies with Russia in the alliance called the Triple Entente , and all three 
viewed Germany as a rival²for different reasons. France was bitter about its 
defeat in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) and the loss to Germany of 
Alsace-Lorraine, a major industrial region with rich deposits of iron ore. Both 
Britain and France competed with Germany for colonies in Africa. After the 
war began, the Triple Entente became known as the Allies  as they were joined 
by Italy, Japan, China, the United States, and other countries. By the end of the 
war, there were a total of 2 Allies and “Associated Powers.”
The Allies’ rival alliance before the war was known as the Triple 
Alliance , composed of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. However, 
when the war began, Italy remained neutral until 115, when it switched 
its allegiance and joined the Allies. At the outbreak of the war, the Ottoman 
Empire and Bulgaria joined the former Triple Alliance, which was now 
called the Central Powers .

464WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONImperialism  The alliance system developed largely because Western 
European countries became bitter rivals for global domination. One of the 
most important ways these nations could assert their power and generate 
wealth was to own overseas colonies. During the latter half of the 19th century, 
for example, Western European countries scrambled for any available land 
in Africa to add to the colonies they already owned in Asia, the Americas, 
and the Pacific. Once European powers had claimed nearly all the land in 
Africa, they began fighting with one another over colonies. Thus, imperialism 
was a driving force behind tensions in Europe leading up to the archduke’s 
assassination. Connect: Describe the development of imperialism and how it 
could have led to the tensions of the early 20th century. See Topic 6.2.
Nationalism  The assassination of the archduke in June 1914, the 
immediate cause of war, illustrates the growth of nationalism, the final long-
term cause of the Great War. On a basic level, nationalism originates from 
a feeling of pride in one’s national identity. Multinational empires such as 
the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire had to contend with 
different nationalist movements among their subject peoples. Serbs like Princip 
wanted to rid their land of Austro-Hungarian domination, and Arabs were tired 
of the limitations the Ottoman Empire imposed on them. Both groups sought 
self-determination ²the idea that peoples of the same ethnicity, language, 
culture, and political ideals should be united and should have the right to form 
an independent nation-state. Militant nationalists among Serbs and Arabs 
fought for the Allies, thus extending the boundaries of the Great War.
Consequences of the Great War
As the 20th century began, most Europeans looked forward to a bright future. 
They expected a century of peace guaranteed by alliances, prosperity as a 
result of their colonial empires, and continued progress. All of that optimism 
was shattered on one fateful day in 1914.
Virtually every major event during the remainder of the 20th century was 
a direct or indirect result of World War I. The war led to the downfalls of four 
monarchies: Russia, Austria-Hungary, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire. It 
redrew the maps of Europe and the Middle East with the disintegration of 
Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Germany lost all its overseas colonies 
to various Allied nations, and the former Ottoman provinces of Iraq, Palestine, 
Syria, and Lebanon came under the control of Britain and France. But the war 
also led to the beginning of the end of colonialism.
New technologies made World War I the deadliest and most destructive 
war in human history. It disrupted European economies and had profound 
social consequences, including the rise of communism and fascism, colonial 
revolts, and genocide. There was a massive shift of power from Europe to the 
United States.

467 CAUSES OF WORLD WAR ISHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS 
1. Use the passage to answer all parts of the question that follows. 
“Germany’s military culture developed a constellation of mutually reinforcing 
characteristics that enhanced tactical efficacy. Unleashed in war, however, 
these characteristics propelled the army to ever greater, and in the end, 
dysfunctional extremes of violence. . . . These interactive and self-generating 
characteristics . . . include:
• risk-taking 
• the dogmatic conviction that annihilation was the sole goal of war 
• resulting prescriptions for correct fighting (the offensive, concentration of 
force, use of reserves, hectic speed that all greatly increased casualties 
• minutely technical planning 
• focus on the tactical and operative rather than the strategic 
• disregard of logistics and thus growing unrealism 
• the conviction indeed requirement of one’s qualitative superiority over one’s 
enemies 
• a romantic ruthlessness and actionism (exaggerated drive for action) on the 
part of officers in order to bridge the gap between risk and reality 
• and finally the acceptance of self-destruction (and thus willingness to destroy 
everyone else, as well). 
Some of these qualities were expressed as doctrine, but many more were 
buried inside organizational routines and the unexamined expectations of the 
officer corps.”

CONDUCTING WORLD WAR I 469
7.3
Conducting World War I
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood  
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,  
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud  
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues —  
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest  
To children ardent for some desperate glory,  
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est  
Pro patria mori.
—Wilfred Owen, from “Dulce et Decorum Est” (1920)
Essential Question:   What were some of the methods governments  
used to Äght World War I?
British poet Wilfred Owen’s “Dulce et Decorum Est” is one of the most 
famous war poems of the 20th century. Most of the poem describes the horrors 
of modern warfare, and the final lines of the excerpt, translated as “It is sweet 
and noble to die for one’s country,” he labels “The old Lie.” No previous war 
had involved as many nations from different parts of the world and none had 
killed as many soldiers and civilians.
At the outbreak of World War I, Britain was the only major power going 
into the war without universal conscription , compulsory enlistment in the 
armed forces. Realizing that patriotism could be contagious, the British Army 
began to recruit “Pals Battalions” made up of men who already knew each 
other. The first of these was made up of a group of stockbrokers from the City 
of London. Other Pals Battalions were recruited in cities throughout Britain, 
such as Liverpool and Manchester. Because the men who volunteered were 
friends or associates, these battalions were especially close knit. By the end of 
the war, one out of four British men had served in the military.
Changes in Warfare
Many modern films such as 6aving 3rivate 5yan, set during World War  II, 
and Platoon , set during the Vietnam War,  show that war is not a glorious 
experience, but most Europeans saw warfare differently during the first 
few months of World War I. “Everybody said, µIt’ll be over by Christmas,’ 
” a British soldier named Bill Haine recalled. The war began in June 11. 
470 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONHundreds of thousands of teenage boys enthusiastically enlisted in the military, 
dreaming of heroism. Wartime assemblies sounded more like high school pep 
rallies, in which speakers naively predicted swift and easy victories in battles 
against supposedly inferior enemies. Leaders of some of the socialist parties 
were among the few Europeans who spoke out against the war. Even socialists 
were divided on the issue, however, as many supported the war efforts of their 
nation.
At the time, few people actually understood how brutal 20th-century 
warfare could be. As the war dragged on, the world became aware of the 
horrific effects of new advances in war technology and tactics, such as trench 
warfare, poison gas, machine guns, submarines, airplanes, and tanks. 
•  The defining experience for most soldiers in this war was the 
time spent in the trenches, long ditches dug in the ground with the 
excavated earth banked in front in order to defend against enemy fire. 
Trench warfare  was not a glorious way to fight a war. Combatant 
nations dug hundreds of miles of trenches facing one another, and 
soldiers slept, ate, and fought in the trenches for months at a time. 
Trenches were often cold, muddy, and rat-infested. Many soldiers 
died from diseases caused by unhygienic conditions. Erich Maria 
Remarque’s 12 novel, $ll 4uiet on the :estern )ront,  and the 1930 
film based on it give a vivid sense of a soldier’s life in the trenches. 
Remarque was a young German soldier during World War I.
•  Poison gas  was one of the most insidious weapons of the new style 
of warfare. Chlorine, phosgene, and mustard gas were used during 
World War I. Soldiers were soon equipped with gas masks, which were 
effective when used immediately. Although fatalities were limited, 
the effects of a gas attack could be extremely painful and long lasting. 
Many veterans suffered permanent damage to their lungs. After the 
war, international treaties outlawed the use of poison gas.
•  Developed in the late 1800s, machine guns could fire more than 500 
rounds of ammunition per minute, increasing the deadly impact of 
warfare. The weapon made it difficult for either side in a battle to gain 
new territory.
•  Although primitive submarines  had been used briefly in the American 
Civil War, they played a much larger part in World War I, wreaking 
havoc on the shipping lanes of the Atlantic Ocean.
•  Airplanes  in 11 were still light, small, and unable to carry many 
weapons. Therefore, they did not present much of a threat to troops, 
vehicles, or ships. At first, airplanes were used mainly to carry on 
reconnaissance observation of enemy lines. By 115 they were being 
fitted with machine guns and aerial combat began. Individual “air 
aces” would engage in “dog fights” with enemy aircraft.
•  The British developed tanks  to protect troops as they moved across 
vast areas of difficult terrain, even over trenches, with the ability to fire 
471 CONDUCTING WORLD WAR I 471at the enemy. They were developed by the Royal Navy, and originally 
referred to as landships . They got their name from the fact that during 
their development, they were disguised as water tanks.
With both the Central Powers and the Allies using brutal weapons and 
tactics, neither side could defeat the other. The result was a bloody four-year 
stalemate  in which the death toll and suffering rose ever higher.
The United States Enters the War
Economic ties between the United States and the Allies were one underlying 
reasons for U.S. entry into the war in 11. In addition, many Americans 
believed that the Allied nations were more democratic than the Central Powers 
were. A third reason was growing resentment against the Germans, especially for 
U-boat  (submarine attacks on ships carrying civilians, including Americans. 
On May , 115, a German submarine attacked and sank the Lusitania , an 
ocean liner carrying more than 100 U.S. citizens among its passengers. 
The event that finally pushed the United States into the war was the 
interception of the Zimmermann  Telegram  in January 1917. In this document, 
the German government offered to help Mexico reclaim territory it had lost to 
the United States in 188 if Mexico allied itself with Germany in the war .
Total War
Combatant nations intensified the conflict in World War I by committing all 
their resources to the war effort. This strategy, known as total war , meant 
that a nation’s domestic population, in addition to its military, was committed 
to winning the war. Thus, millions of civilians, including women, worked 
in factories producing war materials. Workers imported from China helped 
make up for labor shortages in Britain, France, and Russia. Entire economies 
were centered on winning the war. Governments set up planning boards that 
set production quotas, price and wage controls, and the rationing of food and 
other supplies. They censored the media and imprisoned many who spoke out 
against the war effort.
Propaganda was another component of total war. Propaganda  is 
communication meant to influence the attitudes and opinions of a community 
around a particular subject by spreading inaccurate or slanted information. 
Governments invested heavily in army and navy recruitment campaigns and 
other wartime propaganda. Posters and articles in newspapers and magazines 
often depicted the enemy crudely or misrepresented the facts of the war 
completely. For example, American and British propaganda demonized the 
German army, exaggerating reports of atrocities against civilians. Likewise, 
German propaganda demonized the Americans and the British. 
The use of highly emotional and often misleading information fomented 
hatred and bitterness across borders, among civilians as well as soldiers. Other 
propaganda was more subtle. For example, the U.S. government sent artists 
to the front lines in Europe to illustrate scenes of battle and glorify Allied 
soldiers.
472 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONA Global War
World War I was fought in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Pacific and Atlantic 
Oceans. Not since the Seven Years’ War of the late 18th century had there 
been such a global war . Most of the major combatants in World War  I ruled 
colonies in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and the Pacific. Competition for these 
colonies was one major reason for war. Imperialism extended the boundaries 
of the war, and major battles were fought in North Africa and the Middle East. 
Japan entered the war on the side of the Allies so that it could take control of 
German colonies in the Pacific²the Marshall Islands, the Mariana Islands, 
Palau, and the Carolines. Japan also occupied Tsingtao Qingdao, a German-
held port in China.
The British seized most of Germany’s colonies in Africa. However, the 
Germans held on to German East Africa, later called Tanzania. The British also 
defended the Suez Canal from an attack by the Ottoman Empire. 
Colonial troops reinforced their home countries’ forces in several battles. 
About half a million Australians and New =ealanders enlisted to fight the 
war. These troops formed a special corps known as ANZAC  and fought in a 
bloody year-long campaign at Gallipoli , a peninsula in northwestern Turkey, 
that resulted in heavy Allied losses with little to show for the effort. Canadian 
troops fought in several European battles. Britain drafted Africans and Indians 
for combat roles in Europe. Some 0,000 Gurkha soldiers from Nepal fought in 
the Indian Army. Approximately 1. million soldiers served in the Indian Army Posters recruiting sailors and soldiers for World War I in the United States and Great Britain reflected how 
governments used art and media to appeal to nationalist feelings in the early 20th century.

fought in the French army, with nearly 50,000 more working in support roles 
behind the lines. Some colonial troops fought in hopes that their efforts would  
gain them recognition from their colonizers, who often promised the colonies 
self-rule after the war ended.
Arabs, long under the rule of the Turkish-led Ottoman Empire, fought with 
the Allies because the British promised self-rule after the war if they were 
victorious. Arab troops attacked Ottoman forts in Arabia and present-day Israel 
and helped the British take over the cities of Baghdad, Damascus, and 
Jerusalem.

474 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONWomen and the War  In the early 20th century, most countries did not 
allow women to vote or to be soldiers. However, the sheer numbers of men 
enlisting meant that women’s lives changed significantly. They began replacing 
those men on farms and in factories. Thousands of women served on the front 
lines as nurses, ambulance drivers, and switchboard operators. 
Most countries forebade women from serving in combat, but Russia, 
Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria allowed it. In 11, the Russian government 
created an all-female battalion military unit as propaganda to shame men into 
continuing to fight. The commander Maria Bochkareva led the First Russian 
Women’s Battalion of Death.
The Paris Peace Conference
The war itself greatly damaged Europe. However, the peace conference held in 
its wake would have even more profound effects on the entire world. The leaders 
of the victorious countries at the Paris Peace Conference  became known as 
the Big Four:  Woodrow Wilson  United States, David Lloyd George  (Great 
Britain), Georges Clemenceau  (France), and Vittorio Orlando  (Italy). The 
Italians walked out of the peace conference in a rage because Italy would not 
get Dalmatia and other territories that they had been promised for joining the 
Allies, including the city of Fiume on the Adriatic Sea. Russia was not invited 
to the conference because it had undergone a communist revolution. Russia’s 
Bolshevik leaders refused to honor Russia’s financial debts to the Allies, who 
in return refused to recognize the Bolshevik government.
The Big Four had different visions of how to settle the peace. President 
Wilson’s pledge to establish “peace without victory” reflected his belief that 
no one country should be severely punished or greatly rewarded. France’s 
Clemenceau rejected this view. He believed that France, out of all the Allies 
represented at the conference, had suffered the most and thus deserved special 
considerations to be protected from Germany. He also argued that the victorious 
powers should seek some sort of revenge on the Central Powers for starting the 
war. Clemenceau complained that Wilson was an unrealistic idealist who was 
naive about European relations, even though Wilson had a Ph.D. in history. 
David Lloyd George tended to support Clemenceau’s ideas, but he often acted 
as an intermediary between the two differing points of view.
Fourteen Points  Despite Clemenceau’s protests, Wilson pushed for his 
principles, which he outlined in a document called the Fourteen Points . He 
particularly wanted to create a League of Nations , an organization in which 
all nations of the world would convene to discuss conflicts openly, as a way to 
avoid the simmering tensions that had caused World War I. Although the other 
nations agreed to establish the League, the U.S. Senate voted against joining 
it and against ratifying the Treaty of Versailles , the 1919 peace treaty with 
Germany.

Powers deserved the right to self-determination , to decide their own political 
futures. Instead of the colonies and territories of the Central Powers being 
snatched up by the Allies, conquered peoples should have the right to decide 
their own political fate. A number of new nations were created or resurrected 
in Europe as the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires were broken up: 
Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. 
The last three of these were home to Slavic peoples. 
The Treaty of Versailles  Because Wilson failed to convince France 
and Britain not to punish Germany, the Treaty of Versailles treated Germany 
harshly. Most notably, Germany had to pay billions of dollars in reparations  
for damage caused by the war, give up all of its colonies, and restrict the size 
of its armed forces. Germans took the entire blame for the war. Signing the 
treaty was humiliating for German leaders. Moreover, the terms of the treaty 
caused tremendous hardship to the nation during the decade following World  
War I. The German economy suffered from sky-high inflation, partly due 
to the reparations the country was forced to pay. The German people were 
bitter in the immediate aftermath of the Paris Peace Conference. Resentment 
toward the Weimar Republic , which had agreed to the terms of the Treaty of 
Versailles, set the stage for an extreme and militaristic political party known 
as the Nazis to take power barely 15 years later. Connect: Compare the forces

In 1914, on hearing of German atrocities toward Belgians, the British 
government undertook its own investigation headed up by 9iscount James 
Bryce, a widely respected  scholar, a former ambassador to the United States, 
and a friend of President Wilson. His committee reviewed the depositions of 
1200 witnesses, though they did not do the actual interviewing of the witnesses. 
Nor were the depositions given under oath. In order to make the report as 
credible as possible, the committee decided to leave out the most sensational 
accounts. The final report used 500 of the 1200 reports. It was translated 
into 30 languages and was reprinted in the 1ew <orN 7imes  Even though the 
most violent and lurid reports were eliminated, the report still detailed many 
gruesome acts and presented the following conclusions:
“It is proved:
i That there were in many parts of Belgium deliberate and 
systematically organized massacres of the civil population, 
accompanied by many isolated murders and other outrages.
ii That in the conduct of the war generally innocent civilians, both 
men and women, were murdered in large numbers, women violated, 
and children murdered.
iii That looting, house burning, and the wanton destruction of 
property were ordered and countenanced by the officers of the 
German Army, that elaborate provisions had been made for systematic 
incendiarism at the very outbreak of the war, and that the burnings 
and destruction were frequent where no military necessity could be 
alleged, being indeed part of a system of general terrorization.
iv That the rules and usages of war were frequently broken, 
particularly by the using of civilians, including women and children, 
as a shield for advancing forces exposed to fire, to a less degree by 
killing the wounded and prisoners, and in the frequent abuse of the 
Red Cross and the White Flag.
Sensible as they are of the gravity of these conclusions, the Committee 
conceive that they would be doing less than their duty if they failed 
to record them as fully established by the evidence. Murder, lust, and 
pillage prevailed over many parts of Belgium on a scale unparalleled 
in any war between civilised nations during the last three centuries.
Our function is ended when we have stated what the evidence 
establishes, but we may be permitted to express our belief that these 
disclosures will not have been made in vain if they touch and rouse 
the conscience of mankind, and we venture to hope that as soon as the 
present war is over, the nations of the world in council will consider 
what means can be provided and sanctions devised to prevent the 
recurrence of such horrors as our generation is now witnessing.”

Economy in the Interwar Period
>e had to struggle with the old enemies of peace·business and financial 
monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism,  
war profiteering 
—U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1936)
Essential Question:   How did different governments respond to economic 
crises after 1900?
Not long after the global trauma of World War I, a global economic crisis 
resulted in the Great Depression of the 1930s and eventually led to World War 
II. It undermined faith in the market-based economics that had delivered such 
wealth as imperialism spread. As unemployment, hunger, and homelessness 
increased, people turned to their governments for help. Governments had 
long been essential to capitalism²building roads, providing schools, and 
regulating trade²but across the world in the 10s, government intervention 
in the economy increased. The United States became more liberal as President 
Roosevelt identified inequities and activities that undermined the economy 
and could lead to war. Countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, however, 
turned radically to the right. In Russia, government economic control was 
instituted through the implementation of often repressive Five-Year Plans 
based on production quotas.
The Great Depression
From today’s perspective, the effects of World War I can look small compared 
to the even greater destruction caused by World War II. However, the effects  
were massive. Many Western Europeans felt bewildered. World War I brought 
anxiety to the people who suffered through it. The Allied nations, though 
victorious, had lost millions of citizens, both soldiers and civilians, and had 
spent tremendous amounts of money on the international conflict. The defeated 
Central Powers, particularly Germany and the countries that emerged from the 
breakup of Austria-Hungary, suffered even greater losses.
The Treaty of 9ersailles forced Germany to pay billions of dollars in 
reparations to the war’s victors. War-ravaged Germany could not make these 
payments, so its government printed more paper money in the 1920s.
481 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO DThis action caused inflation, a general rise in prices. Inflation meant that 
the value of German money decreased drastically. To add to the sluggish 
postwar economy, France and Britain had difficulty repaying wartime loans 
from the United States, partly because Germany was having trouble paying 
reparations to them. In addition, the Soviet government refused to pay Russia’s 
prerevolutionary debts.
Global Downturn  Although the 120s brought modest economic gains 
for most of Europe, the subsequent Great Depression  ended the tentative 
stability. Agricultural overproduction and the United States’ stock market crash 
in 12 were two major causes of the global economic downturn. American 
investors who had been putting money into German banks removed it when 
the American stock market crashed. In addition to its skyrocketing inflation, 
Germany then had to grapple with bank failures. Germany thus suffered more 
than any other Western nation during the Great Depression. The economies 
of Africa, Asia, and Latin America suffered because they depended on the 
imperial nations that were experiencing this enormous economic downturn. 
Japan also suffered during the Depression because its economy depended 
on foreign trade. With the economic decline in the rest of the world, Japan’s 
exports were cut in half between 12 and 11.

In this chart, the levels of production and trade for 1929 are represented

Keynesian Economics  The Great Depression inspired new insights into 
economics. British economist John Maynard Keynes  rejected the laissez-
faire ideal. He concluded that intentional government action could improve 
the economy. During a depression, he said, governments should use Geficit 
spending  (spending more than the government takes in) to stimulate economic 
activity. By cutting taxes and increasing spending, governments would spur 
economic growth. People would return to work, and the depression would end. 
New Deal  The administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  
used .eynes’s ideas to address the Great Depression in the United States. 
Roosevelt and his backers created a group of policies and programs known 
collectively as the New Deal . Its goal was to bring the country relief, recovery, 
and reform: relief  for citizens who were suffering, including the poor, the 
unemployed, farmers, minorities, and women recovery  to bring the nation out 
of the Depression, in part through government spending and reform  to change 
government policies in the hopes of avoiding such disasters in the future.
By 1937, unemployment was declining and production was rising. 
.eynesian economics seemed to be working. However, Roosevelt feared 
that government deficits were growing too large, so he reversed course. 
Unemployment began to grow again. The Great Depression finally ended after 
the United States entered World War II in 11 and ran up deficits for military 
spending that dwarfed those of the New Deal programs. 
Impact on Trade  The Great Depression was a global event. Though it 
started in the industrialized countries of the United States and Europe, it spread 
to Latin America, Africa, and Asia. By 12, more than 0 million people 
worldwide were out of work. People everywhere turned to their governments 
483 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO Dfor help. As unemployment increased, international trade declined, a decline 
made worse as nations then imposed strict tariffs, or taxes on imports, in an 
effort to protect the domestic jobs they still had. 
In contrast to most countries, Japan dug itself out of the Depression 
relatively rapidly. Japan devalued its currency that is, the government lowered 
the value of its money in relation to foreign currencies. Thus, Japanese-made 
products became less expensive than imports. Japan’s overseas expansionism 
also increased Japan’s need for military goods and stimulated the economy. 
Political Revolutions in Russia and Mexico
In the century’s first two decades, rebellions erupted against long-standing 
authoritarian governments in Mexico, China, and Russia. See Topic .1. 
Revolutionaries unseated the ruling governments in each country, instituting 
their own political philosophies and practices. The revolutions influenced 
subsequent events in the Soviet Union, Mexico, and China in the interwar 
years. Each country took a different approach to managing their national 
economy.
Continuing Revolution in Russia  Although Lenin and the Bolshevik 
Party had promised “peace, land, and bread” during World War I, they instead 
presided over a populace that faced starvation during the widespread Russian 
Civil War  118±121. Hundreds of thousands of Russians, Ukrainians, 
and others revolted against the Russian government’s actions. Urban factory 
workers and sailors went on strike, and peasants began to hoard their food 
stocks. Industrial and agricultural production dropped sharply.
By 1921, Lenin realized that the Russian economy was near complete 
collapse. In an attempt to remedy this, he instituted a temporary retreat 
from communist economic policies. Under his New Economic Plan  (NEP ), 
he reintroduced private trade, allowing farmers to sell their products on a 
small scale. Although the government permitted some economic liberties, it 
maintained strict political control. The NEP enjoyed modest successes, but it 
came to an end when Lenin died in 1924.
Joseph Stalin  Several years after Lenin’s death, Joseph Stalin took 
control of the Politburo , the Communist Party’s central organization, setting 
himself up as a dictator. He remained in power for almost 0 years. Once in 
power, Stalin abandoned Lenin’s NEP and instituted the first Five-Year Plan , 
which was meant to transform the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  (also 
called the USSR  or the Soviet Union  into an industrial power. He wanted his 
largely agricultural nation to “catch up” to the industrial nations of the West. 
At the same time, Stalin collectiYi]eG  agriculture, a process in which farmland 
was taken from private owners and given to collectives to manage. In theory, a 
collective, or NolNho], was a group of peasants who freely joined together to 
farm a certain portion of land. In practice, however, peasants were forced by 
the state to work on a specific collective and were expected to follow detailed 
plans and to reach specific goals set by the government. 
484WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThis elimination of private land ownership and the forced redistribution 
of land, livestock, and tools enraged farmers. Each year, the government 
seized food to send to the cities. The farmers retaliated against collectivization 
by burning crops and killing livestock. Many moved to the cities for a better 
life.
A series of five-year plans had mixed results. The collectivization of 
agriculture was a huge failure. Millions of peasants starved to death, especially 
in the Ukraine. However, heavy industry grew tremendously in the 10s. 
Although consumer goods were in short supply, there were plenty of factory 
jobs available, and the cost of living was low.
Stalin’s brutal regime is widely condemned today. He punished his political 
opponents by executing them or sentencing them to life terms in gulags , or 
labor camps, where many died. In addition, his agricultural policies led to the 
deaths of many millions of Soviet citizens. Because Stalin kept tight control 
of the press, details of his atrocities went largely unreported. Nonetheless, in 
the 10s, an economically depressed world viewed the U.S.S.R. with a mix 
of horror and wonder. The USSR was rapidly industrializing and increasing its 
military power. It presented a challenge to countries with capitalist economies  
whose people were experiencing high levels of unemployment. Connect:  
Write a paragraph connecting the USSR with the ideology of Marxism. See 
Topic 5.8.)
Party Rule in Mexico  The economy took a different direction in Mexico. 
The Mexican revolution saw the emergence of one strong political party, the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI. This party dominated Mexican 
politics for most of the 20th century. The Mexican political system has often 
been called corporatist since the ruling PRI party claimed favors, such as access 
to primary education and jobs created through improvements to infrastructure, 
for its constituents.
During PRI’s rule, there was a vast improvement in the economy, 
especially in the period from 1930 to the 1970s. In the 1930s, efforts at land 
reform were successful under /i]aro CirGenas . In 1938, for example, his 
regime nationalized the country’s mostly foreign-owned oil industry, angering 
foreign investors. This company, Petryleos Mexicanos or PEMEX , became 
the second largest state-owned company in the world. Despite these reforms, 
however, the interwar period did not see dramatic changes in Mexico’s social 
hierarchy.
Rise of Right-Wing Governments
In some countries, the turn to the right was radical. A new political system 
known as fascism  arose that appealed to extreme nationalism, glorified the 
military and armed struggle, and blamed problems on ethnic minorities. 
Fascist regimes suppressed other political parties, protests, and independent 
trade unions. They justified violence to achieve their goals and were strongly 
anticommunist. Germany turned to fascism (see Topic 7.6), and some other 
countries did as well.
485 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO DRise of Fascism in Italy  Benito Mussolini coined the term fascism,  
which comes from the term fasces , a bundle of sticks tied around an axe, which 
was an ancient Roman symbol for authority. This symbol helped characterize 
Italy’s Fascist government, which glorified militarism and brute force. 
The Italian fascist state was based on a concept known as corporatism , 
a theory based on the notion that the sectors of the economy²the employers, 
the trade unions, and state officials²are seen as separate organs of the same 
body. Each sector, or organ, was supposedly free to organize itself as it wished 
as long as it supported the whole. In practice, the fascist state imposed its will 
upon all sectors of society, creating a totalitarian state ²a state in which the 
government controls all aspects of society.
Mussolini Takes Control  Even though Italy had been considered 
one of the victors at the 11 Paris Peace Conference²along with Britain, 
France, and the United States²Italy received very little territory from the 
Treaty of Versailles. This failure to gain from the war caused discontent in 
Italy. Amid the general bitterness of the 120s, Mussolini and his allies in the 
Fascist Party managed to take control of the parliament. Mussolini became a 
dictator, repressing any possible opposition to his rule. Militaristic propaganda 
infiltrated every part of the Fascist government. For example, schoolchildren 
were taught constantly about the glory of their nation and their fearless leader, 
“Il Duce .” 
Part of Mussolini’s fascist philosophy was the need to conquer what he 
considered an inferior nation. During the imperialist “Scramble for Africa” in 
the 19th century, Italy seized Libya  and colonized Italian  Somaliland , now 
part of Somalia. However, the Italian army was pushed back by Abyssinia, 
modern-day Ethiopia, in the 180s. In 1, Mussolini called for the complete 
conquest of Abyssinia. In 15, 100,000 Italian troops crossed the border from 
Somaliland to Abyssinia, defying sanctions from the League of Nations. This 
time, the Italian army overpowered Abyssinia’s while the global community 
did little to stop the conquest. Many historians believe the Abyssinian crisis 
destroyed the League of Nations’ credibility. In 16, Mussolini and Germany’s 
Adolf Hitler formed an alliance they hoped would dominate Europe. 
Fascism and Civil War in Spain  After the economic decline in the early 
10s, two opposing ideologies, or systems of ideas, battled for control of 
Spain. The Spanish Civil War  that resulted soon took on global significance 
as a struggle between the forces of democracy and the forces of fascism.
The Spanish Republic formed in 11 after .ing Alfonso 9III abdicated. 
In 16, the Spanish people elected the Popular Front , a coalition of left-
wing parties, to lead the government. A key aspect of the Front’s platform 
was land reform, a prospect that energized the nation’s peasants and radicals. 
Conservative forces in Spain, such as the Catholic Church and high-ranking 
members of the military, were violently opposed to the changes that the Popular 
Front promised. In July of the same year, Spanish troops stationed in Morocco 
conducted a military uprising against the Popular Front. This action marked the 
beginning of the Spanish Civil War, which soon spread to Spain itself. General 
486WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONFrancisco Franco  led the insurgents, who called themselves Nationalists . On 
the other side were the Republicans  or Loyalists , the defenders of the newly 
elected Spanish Republic.
Foreign Involvement  Although the nations of Europe had signed a 
nonintervention agreement, Hitler of Germany, Mussolini of Italy, and Antonio 
Salazar of Portugal contributed armaments to the Nationalists. Civilian 
volunteers from the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France 
contributed their efforts to the Loyalists. Many historians believe that without 
the help of Germany, Italy, and Portugal, the Nationalist side probably would 
not have prevailed against the Republic of Spain.
Guernica  The foreign involvement in Spain’s struggle also escalated the 
violence of the war. One massacre in particular garnered international attention. 
The German and Italian bombing of the town of Guernica  in northern Spain’s 
Basque region  was one of the first times in history an aerial bombing targeted 
civilians. Many historians believe that the bombing of Guernica was a military 
exercise for Germany’s air force, the Luftwaffe .
The tragedy of Guernica was immortalized in Pablo Picasso’s painting of 
that name, commissioned by the Republic of Spain and completed in 18. 
Although abstract, the painting brilliantly depicts the horrific violence of 
modern warfare and is one of the most significant works of 20th-century art.

Franco’s Victory  The Spanish Civil War 16±1 ended when 
Franco’s forces defeated the Loyalist army. He ruled Spain as a dictator until 
his death in 15. Spain did not officially enter World War II 1±15, but 
the government offered some help to Germany, Italy, and Japan.
5ise oI a 5eSressiYe 5eJiPe in %ra]il  As in Europe, parts of Latin 
America also became more conservative. During the interwar years, Brazil 
was considered Latin America’s “sleeping giant” because of its slow shift 
487 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO Dfrom an agricultural to an industrial economy. Large landowners dominated 
the nation’s economy, which frustrated members of the urban middle class. 
Compounding their frustration was the workers’ suffering caused by the Great 
Depression. Discontent led to a bloodless 10 coup, or illegal seizure of 
power, which installed Getulio Vargas as president.
9argas’s pro-industrial policies won him support from Brazil’s urban 
middle class. They believed he would promote democracy. However, his actions 
paralleled those of Italy’s corporate state under Mussolini. While Brazil’s 
industrial sector grew rapidly, 9argas began to strip away individual political 
freedoms. His Estado Novo  “New State” program instituted government 
censorship of the press, abolition of political parties, imprisonment of political 
opponents, and hypernationalism , a belief in the superiority of one’s nation 
over all others and the single-minded promotion of national interests. While 
these policies were similar to those of European fascists, the Brazilian 
government did not praise or rely on violence to achieve and maintain control.
Moreover, even though Brazil had close economic ties with the United 
States and Germany in the late 10s, Brazil finally sided with the Allies in 
World War II. This political alignment against the Axis powers made Brazil 
look less like a dictatorship and more liberal than it actually was. World War II 
prompted the people of Brazil to push for a more democratic nation later. They 
came to see the contradiction between fighting fascism and repression abroad 
and maintaining a dictatorship at home.

“It has been repeated ad nauseam >to a sickening degree@ that the oil industry 
has brought additional capital for the development and progress of the country. 
This assertion is an exaggeration. For many years throughout the major period 
of their existence, oil companies have enjoyed great privileges for development 
and expansion, including customs and tax exemptions and innumerable 
prerogatives. . . . Potential wealth of the Nation miserably underpaid native 
labor tax exemptions economic privileges governmental tolerance²these 
are the factors of the boom of the Mexican oil industry. .  . . These organizations, 
whether authorized by the Government or not, are charged with innumerable 
outrages, abuses, and murders, always on behalf of the companies that employ 
them. . . .
It was therefore necessary to adopt a definite and legal measure to end this 
permanent state of affairs in which the country sees its industrial progress held 
back by those who hold in their hands the power to erect obstacles. . . . It is 
necessary that all groups of the population be imbued with a full optimism and 
that each citizen, whether in agricultural, industrial, commercial, transportation, 
or other pursuits, develop a greater activity from this moment on, in order to 
create new resources which will reveal that the spirit of our people is capable 
of saving the nation’s economy by the efforts of its own citizens.”

When Mexico nationalized the oil industry, some foreign countries whose oil 
companies were taken over boycotted Mexican oil and urged consumers to 
boycott other Mexican products. As a result, Nazi Germany became Mexico’s 
biggest customer for oil. The United States, however, had a “Good Neighbor” 
policy with Mexico and took a softer approach.

7hen answer the Tuestions that follow
“The Government of the United States . . . notes that the applicable 
precedents and recognized authorities on international law support its 
declaration that, under every rule of law and equity, no government is 
entitled to expropriate private property, for whatever purpose, without 
provision for prompt, adequate, and effective payment therefor. . . .
My Government considers that its own practice has amply 
demonstrated that it is the consistent friend of reform, that it has 
every sympathy with misfortune and need, and that it recognizes fully 
the necessities of the under-privileged. It cannot, however, accept 
the idea that these high objectives justify, or for that matter require, 
infringement on the law of nations or the upsetting of constitutionally 
recognized guarantees. . . .
Every sovereign nation is in possession of powers to regulate its

quite as much as international, solely in order to assist the country

Unresolved Tensions After 
World  War I
The British Government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their 
freedom, but has debased it economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually.
—Indian National Congress, Declaration of Purna Swaraj  
(Independence +ay 9esolution, 1anuary 2, 1930)
Essential Question:   How did continuities and changes in territorial holdings 
create tensions after World War I?
As economic crises beset countries after World War I, unresolved disputes 
over the control of land continued to fester. The victors in the war, European 
powers and Japan, generally kept or expanded control over colonial territories. 
However, anti-imperial resistance was growing throughout Asia and Africa. 
In a larger context, the spread of nationalism in these regions was part of the 
same global trend that included the breakup of empires in Europe, the success 
of communism in Russia, and the spread of anti-immigrant sentiments in the 
United States. The example of Turkey’s push for self-determination was already 
discussed in Topic .1. Similarly, events such as the May th Movement in 
China and groups such as the Indian National Congress demonstrated how 
nationalism was spreading throughout the world.
(σecWsRfWKe:DU
The effects of World War I varied around the world. The United States 
prospered because of all the war materials and agricultural products it sold 
to Britain and the other Allies. By contrast, the European countries that 
suffered the greatest damage in the war were economically devastated.
Effects on Colonial Lands  While nationalist movements had been 
brewing for decades in colonies in South Asia and West Africa, the war 
renewed the hopes of people in these regions for independence. African and 
Asian colonial troops contributed thousands of soldiers to the Allied war 
effort. In addition, this disastrous war showed colonial peoples that imperial 
powers such as Britain and France were not invincible.
German propaganda during the war had predicted that colonial soldiers’ 
experience in the war would lead to a great uprising against colonial rule. 
494 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThis did not materialize, although there were several local rebellions. 
Between November 115 and September 116, a large group of villages in 
French West Africa, between the 9 olta and Bani rivers in what later became 
Burkina Faso, united in an effort to drive out the French. It was only with 
a great effort and loss of life on both sides that the French managed to put 
down the revolt. The rebellion forced the French to recognize that they had 
an obligation to the people they colonized. After World War I, many war 
veterans from the French colonies assisted in colonial administration after 
they returned home.
Colonized people’s war experiences raised their expectations. They 
thought that the principle of self-determination, as expressed in Wilson’s 
Fourteen Points, would get them closer to self-rule. Nationalists in Africa 
and Asia hoped that the blood they had shed for their “home countries” 
would earn them some respect from Western Europe and thus begin a 
Gecoloni]ation  process. 
However, the peace conference’s Big Three ²David Lloyd George, 
Woodrow Wilson, and Georges Clemenceau after Italy left²were not 
interested in freeing the colonies. After World War I, European powers 
granted self-determination only to white countries in Eastern Europe. Middle 
Eastern lands that had been a part of the  Ottoman Empire came under the 
control of France and Britain in the League of Nations mandate system. Former 
German colonies in Africa had the same fate. German territories and spheres 
of influence in East Asia and the Pacific were transferred to various victorious 
nations of World War I. India and nearly every nation in Africa²as well as 
most of the Middle East²continued to be controlled by European nations.
Wilson even refused to meet with a group of Vietnamese nationalists, 
including a young Ho Chi Minh, who asked to speak with him about 
self-determination for Vietnam. This rejection fueled stronger nationalist 
movements in colonies scattered across the southern rim of Asia and in 
parts of Africa. The seeds of African, Arab, and Asian nationalism were 
sown largely in the aftermath of World War  I, although they did not come to 
fruition until much later.
The Mandate System
Arab rebels of the former Ottoman Empire were especially insulted by the 
results of the peace conference. They had been promised self-rule if they fought 
with the Allies. Instead, the Allies forgot all of their promises and, through the 
League of Nations, established a mandate  system  to rule the colonies and 
territories of the Central Powers. Article 22 of the League of Nations charter 
stated that colonized people in Africa and Asia required “tutelage” from more 
“advanced” nations in order to survive. Thus, the Allied countries²including 
France, Great Britain, and Japan²were able to increase their imperial holdings 
through a new form of colonization. For example, Cameroon, which had been 
a German colony, was divided and transferred to France and Britain as separate 
mandates. Japan seized the German-held islands of the Western Pacific.
495 UNRESOL=ED  TENSIONS  A-TER WORLD WAR  I495The Middle East experienced enormous upheaval because of the fall of the 
Ottoman Empire. Palestine, Transjordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq all became 
League of Nations mandates. These Arab states were not yet sovereign lands 
but virtual colonies of Great Britain and France. This infuriated the Arabs who 
lived in these lands and set the stage for a nationalist movement known as  
Pan-Arabism —an ideology that called for the unification of all lands in North 
Africa and the Middle East.
Another source of conflict arose in 11, when the British government 
issued the Balfour Declaration , which stated that Palestine  should become a 
permanent home for the Jews of Europe. Those who supported a Jewish 
homeland were known as Zionists . After the Allied victory in the Great War, 
European Jews moved in droves to Palestine, which Britain controlled.
Anti-Colonialism in South Asia
The setback presented by the Paris Conference inspired anticolonial activists 
to redouble their efforts. In South Asia, the Indian National Congress  formed 
in the late 19th century to air grievances against the colonial government. By 
the end of World War I in 118, it had become a strong voice for independence.
Massacre at Amritsar  In the spring of 1919, a group of Indian 
nationalists gathered in a public garden in Amritsar, Punjab, to protest the 
arrest of two freedom fighters. The protest took place during a Sikh festival,

had recently made such public gatherings illegal. Armed colonial forces fired 
hundreds of shots into the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 379 people and 
wounding 1,200 more. 
The Amritsar massacre radicalized many Indians. It convinced moderate 
members of the Indian National Congress that independence from Britain was 
the only way forward.
Gandhi  By the 1920s, Mohandas Gandhi  had brought the congress’s 
cause to the Indian masses and caught the attention of the world. His 
satyagraha  “devotion-to-truth” movement  embarked on a campaign of civil 
disobedience  that encouraged Indians to break unjust laws and serve jail time. 
These actions, he believed, would stir the consciousness of the empire and the 
international community and expose the injustice of Britain’s imperial system.
Gandhi, who came to be known by Indians as Mahatma , or “the great 
soul,” led a boycott against British goods. After returning to India from South 
Africa, Gandhi wore the traditional cotton Hindu dhoti  rather than the Western-
style suits he had worn as a lawyer in Natal. Wearing homespun clothes was 
a form of protest against British fabrics made from Indian cotton and sold to 
Indians at inflated prices. 
One of Gandhi’s first campaigns became known as the Salt March . British 
authorities had made it illegal for Indians to produce their own sea salt. The 
commodity was easy to make in the tropical country, but Britain wanted a 
monopoly on salt. In 10, Gandhi led thousands of Indians to the Arabian Sea 
and simply picked up a few grains of salt, in defiance of Britain’s unjust edict.

497 UNRESOL=ED  TENSIONS  A-TER WORLD WAR  IThe Two-State Solution  While anticolonial sentiment was building, 
leaders of the independence movement disagreed about how India should 
define its national identity. Muslim leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah , a member 
of the Muslim minority in the largely Hindu Indian National Congress, 
originally favored Muslim-Hindu unity but later proposed a two-state plan for 
South Asian independence. He was concerned that Muslim interests would 
be overwhelmed by Hindu concerns in an independent India. He proposed  
creating a separate state, Pakistan , that would include the heavily Muslim 
western and eastern parts of South Asia. This proposal made several leaders, 
including Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru , who eventually became India’s first 
prime minister, anxious about the region’s future. Although independence did 
not come for India and Pakistan until after World War II, the interwar years 
were critical times for the anticolonial movement. Connect: Write a paragraph

Nationalism in East Asia
.orea, China, and Japan had not been formally colonized by Europe, but they 
did suffer from European domination. These countries also demonstrated the 
spread of the desire for self-determination.
The March First Movement in Korea  The small country of .orea had 
suffered under increasing Japanese influence since the 180s. In 110, Japan 
took control of .orea. After World War I, Japan expected to expand its role 
in East Asia, just as European states did in the Middle East. The prospect of 
European support for a stronger Japan, and the mysterious death of the .orean 
emperor, caused .orean resentment to explode. On March 1, 11, .oreans 
began a series of protests that involved as many as 2 million .oreans out 
of a population of 17 million. The occupying Japanese forces cracked down 
harshly, killing several thousand .oreans. But the March First Movement  
demonstrated the power of .orean nationalism.
The May Fourth Movement in China  During World War I, China 
supported the Allies. Britain and France hired nearly 150,000 Chinese 
to work in factories, dig trenches and do other support work. China hoped 
that the victorious Allies would support China’s desire to reclaim German-
controlled land on the Shandong Peninsula in northeast China. However, 
Japan wanted the same land. At the Paris Peace Conference in 11, Great 
Britain and France sided with Japan. Infuriated, Chinese intellectuals and 
workers staged anti-Japanese demonstrations beginning on May , 11. 
The May Fourth Movement  symbolized China’s growing nationalism and 
demand for democracy. Angered by Europe’s support for Japan, many Chinese 
rejected Western-style government. They turned toward the Marxist model of 
the Soviet Union. Several May Fourth leaders joined the Chinese Communist 
Party. In the years after the May Fourth protests, two main groups fought for 
power: the communists and the nationalists. 
498WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• The Chinese  Communist Party (CCP ) was founded in 1921. It 
was eventually led by Mao Zedong  or Mao Tse-tung, the son of a 
prosperous peasant, who was inspired by the communist revolution 
in Russia. Instead of energizing the working classes of Chinese cities, 
however, Mao believed that China’s communist revolution could be 
based on the revolt of peasants, who made up the vast majority of 
China’s population. 
• The Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang , was led by  Sun Yat-
sen. He was devoted to full independence and industrialization, and 
he allied with Mao’s forces to free China from foreign domination and 
overthrow the warlords. Following Sun’s death in 125, Chiang Kai-
shek  took control of the Nationalist Party. Chiang was a conservative 
and had a deep-seated distrust of communism. In 1927, Chiang’s forces 
attacked and nearly annihilated Mao’s forces, initiating the Chinese 
Civil War.
The Long March  Mao and remnants of the Chinese Communist Party 
retreated into China’s interior, where for several years they trained in hiding. In 
1, Chiang’s forces again attacked Mao’s army in the rural areas of Jiangxi. 
After the attack, Mao’s forces began the  /onJ March  a year-long, 6,000-mile 
long retreat. It traversed treacherous mountains, deep marshes, and extremely 
dry deserts. Of the 80,000 or more who began the Long March, only 10,000 
remained to assemble in 15 in northern China. 
The Chinese Communist Party was weak after the Long March. 
However, peasants admired Mao and his army’s tremendous stamina and 
their commitment to their ideals. This support among peasants would later be 
important for the success of the Communists in winning control of the country.
While the Communists were retreating on the Long March, the Nationalist 
.uomintang continued to rule much of China during the 10s. Chiang, 
however, had alienated many. Old traditions were losing support, but he 
advocated Confucianism. When opponents criticized him, he suppressed free 
speech. When people accused the Nationalists of corruption, he did not stop it. 
China -aSan anG ManchuNuo  In 15, the Nationalists and 
Communists in China suspended their civil war to unite against a more pressing 
danger: Japan. Seeking access to natural resources on the Asian mainland, 
Japan had invaded Manchuria in northern China in September 11. Tensions 
increased when someone, either Chinese dissidents or Japanese soldiers, 
attacked a railway owned by Japan near Mukden. When the League of Nations 
condemned Japan’s actions in Manchuria, Japan gave up its membership in 
the League and seized more land. In 1932, the Japanese set up a puppet state 
called Manchukuo.  To make Manchukuo seem like an independent Chinese 
state, it selected the last Chinese emperor to sit on its throne. Connect: 
Create a timeline showing the steps Japan took as it moved from isolation to

499 UNRESOL=ED  TENSIONS  A-TER WORLD WAR  IJapan continued to expand its empire until 1945, the year World War II 
ended. It seized the Philippines under partial U.S. control at the time, the 
Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, Burma, and numerous Pacific islands. 
Japan termed these territories the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . 
Although Japan claimed to be liberating people from Western imperialism, 
people in the region experienced Japan as a conqueror.
Resistance to French Rule in West Africa
As in South Asia, people all over Africa were disappointed that their colonies 
did not achieve independence after World War I. Pro-independence movements 
in Africa began with European-educated intellectuals. For example, the future 
leader of .enya, -oPo .enyatta studied in London. /poSolG SenJhor the 
future leader of Senegal, studied in Paris. In Europe, African intellectuals 
learned to recognize the racial discrimination taking place in their homelands. 
Most members of the educated elite worked for the colonial government, if 
they were not self-employed attorneys or doctors. 
Africans under colonial rule resisted the colonizers. Black workers in 
French West Africa staged a series of strikes, including a strike of railway 
workers in 11 and a general strike in 16. Some of these actions spread 
throughout French West Africa Senegal, Benin, Ivory Coast, and Guinea. 
Strikers protested discriminatory wage and benefit policies and in some cases 
won a number of their demands through a compromise settlement.

“After >World War I@, the world was divided into two camps: one is the 
revolutionary camp which includes the oppressed colonial peoples and the 
exploited working class throughout the world. Its vanguard is the Soviet 
Union. The other is the counter-revolutionary camp of international capitalism 
and imperialism, whose general staff is the League of Nations.
That war resulted in untold loss of life and property. . . . French imperialism 
was the hardest hit. Therefore, in order to restore the forces of capitalism in 
France, the French imperialists have . . . built new factories to exploit the 
workers by paying them starvation wages. They have plundered the peasants’ 
land to establish plantations and drive them to destitution. They have levied 
new heavy taxes. They have forced our people to buy government bonds. 
In short, they have driven our people to utter misery. They have increased 
their military forces, firstly to strangle the 9ietnamese revolution secondly 
to prepare for a new imperialist war in the Pacific aimed at conquering new 
colonies thirdly to suppress the Chinese revolution and fourthly to attack 
the Soviet Union because she helps the oppressed nations and the exploited 
working class to wage revolution.
World War Two will break out. When it does the French imperialists will 
certainly drive our people to an even more horrible slaughter .”

CAUSES OF WORLD WAR II 503
7.6
Causes of World War II
It is blood which moves the wheels of history.
—Benito Mussolini (1914, before he became Il Duce , the Leader)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and consequences of  
World War II?
The causes of World War II lay in the unresolved issues in the aftermath of 
World War I. Economic instability in the postwar economies of Europe led to 
civil unrest in Italy and Germany. In Italy, the rise of fascism was directly related 
to the downturn of the Italian economy that occurred after World War I. Benito 
Mussolini and his National Fascist Party came to power in 122 because of 
their promises to renew the Italian economy and create another Italian empire 
in the Mediterranean and beyond. The peace settlement after World War I also 
placed unsustainable economic and political terms on Germany and instituted 
territorial distributions that took away resources and created resentment among 
the German population. Thus, the ideology associated with Italian fascism and 
militarism²as seen in the quotation above²spread to Germany, where Hitler 
and the Nazis adopted it.
The Path to War
Out of the context of the broad economic and political trends emerged Adolf 
Hitler . His extreme views on the superiority of the Aryan race and his vision 
of a great German civilization led him to persecute Jews and other minorities 
and to systematically seize land. 
5ise oI 1a]isP  Following Germany’s defeat in 1918, the democratically 
elected Weimar Republic  replaced the monarchical rule of the kaiser. Under 
the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the new German government not only had 
to pay billions in war reparations, but it also was not allowed to have an army. 
The Weimar Republic, appearing weak to the demoralized German people, 
became especially unpopular during the Great Depression.
The rolls of the unemployed swelled due to the weak German economy. 
Large numbers of young men, including many World War I veterans, found 
themselves with few job prospects. Such an environment fostered alienation 
and bitterness. Many Germans perceived the Weimar Republic to be too weak 
to solve the country’s problems, so they looked to right-wing political parties 
that promised strong action.
504 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONHitler had declared his extreme anti-Semitic views in his book Mein Kampf  
“My Struggle”, which he began writing in 12 while in a Bavarian prison 
after a failed coup attempt. The National Socialist German Worker’s Party, or the 
1a]is, came to power legally after the party did well in the 1932 parliamentary 
elections. In early 1, the president of Germany, Paul von Hindenburg, invited 
Adolf Hitler to form a government as chancellor, which he did. Hindenburg died 
in 1, giving Hitler the opening he needed to declare himself  president.
Through manipulation, the Nazi Party instilled fear and panic in the 
German people, making them believe that they were in a state of emergency. 
For example, the Nazis staged a burning of the Reichstag , the German 
parliament building, and blamed radical extremists for the act. Using domestic 
security as justification, Hitler outlawed all other political parties and all forms 
of resistance to his rule. 
Hitler openly promoted ultranationalism and scientific racisP , a 
pseudoscientific theory that claimed that certain races were genetically superior 
to others. He also advanced an extreme form of  anti-Semitism , or hostility 
toward Jews. He filled his speeches with accusations against German Jews, 
whom Hitler claimed were responsible for the nation’s domestic problems. 
Nazi propaganda emphasized a need for a “pure” German nation of “ Aryans ,” 
purged of “outsiders”²not only Jews, but also Slavs, communists, Roma also 
known as Gypsies, and gay men and women. Hitler suggested that the only 
way for Germany to live up to its potential was to eliminate the corrupting 
influence of these groups, particularly the Jews.
Nuremberg Laws  Hitler’s anti-Jewish campaign began with laws 
designed to disenfranchise and discriminate against them. The Nuremberg 
Laws , passed in 15, forbade marriage between Jews and gentiles people 
who are not Jewish), stripped Jews of their citizenship, and unleashed a series 
of subsequent decrees that effectively pushed Jews to the margins of German 
society. German Jews, many of whom were successful in their careers and felt 
assimilated into German society, were shocked by the way they were being 
treated. Some Eastern European nations, such as Romania and Bulgaria, also 
passed laws discriminating against their Jewish citizens. 
The Axis Powers  Hitler then sought new allies to help him acquire 
/eEensraum  living space for the new German empire. He did not try to hide 
his ambition to conquer the entire continent. Hitler’s lust for land eventually 
brought the international community to the brink of war. He first formed a 
military pact with Fascist Italy, the Rome-Berlin Axis , in October 16.  In 
addition to their need for military support, the two countries shared a political 
ideology and economic interests. Germany then created a military alliance with 
Japan based on mutual distrust of communism, known as the Anti-Comintern 
Pact  The alliances among these three nations created the Axis Powers 
Kristallnacht  Hitler’s campaign to rid Germany of Jews predated his 
aggressive land grabs in Europe. His propaganda and the Nuremberg Laws 
successfully created an atmosphere of hostility, hatred, and distrust within 
505 CAUSES OF WORLD WAR II 505Germany. This tension erupted one night in early November 18. 
Kristallnacht , the “Night of the Broken Glass,” produced anti-Jewish riots 
that ostensibly occurred in response to the assassination of a German diplomat 
by a Jewish teenager. Although it appeared to be a spontaneous burst of outrage 
on the part of the German citizenry, Nazi leaders had actually engineered the 
entire operation. The riots resulted in the deaths of more than 90 German Jews 
and the destruction of nearly every synagogue in Germany and some 7,000 
Jewish shops. More than 0,000 Jews were dragged from their homes, arrested, 
and sent to concentration camps. Most of these prisoners were eventually 
released on orders to leave Germany, an option not given to later concentration 
camp prisoners.
Nazi Germany’s Aggressive Militarism
The terms of the Treaty of Versailles severely limited the German military after 
World War I. Yet Hitler wanted a stronger military to acquire more land. In 
March 15, he broke the treaty when he announced the creation of a German 
air force and a policy of conscription to enlarge the size of the army.
The Treaty of Versailles   Under the treaty, a strip of land in the Rhineland 
1 miles wide was set up as a buffer zone between Germany and France. 
Germany was not allowed to station troops there. Hitler broke the agreement, 
sending German troops into the Rhineland on March , 16. Both France and 
Britain protested this move, but they took no other action.

506WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONSome British believed that Hitler was the strong anticommunist leader that 
central Europe needed to keep order. Others were simply reluctant to return 
to war. So Britain followed a policy of appeasement , giving in to Germany’s 
demands in hopes of keeping the peace. However, Germany’s military expansion

*erPan$ustrian 8nification  With his military revived and alliances in 
hand, Hitler felt confident about taking his next step in the creation of a new 
German empire, the Third Reich . His plan was to bring Austria, where he 
was born, under German rule. Hitler used the threat of invasion to pressure 
the Austrian chancellor into giving more power to the Austrian Nazi Party. As 
Hitler had planned, the Austrian Nazis then opened the door for German troops 
to occupy Austria with no resistance. With the Anschluss  (political union), 
Austria officially became part of the Third Reich in March 18.
C]echosloYaNia  The annexation of Austria was only the first step for Hitler. 
He wanted more. In September 18, he issued a demand to Czechoslovakia for 
the border territory of the Sudetenland  Most of the people who lived in this 
region spoke German Hitler argued that the area was a natural extension of his 
Aryan empire. The German leader met with the leaders of Britain, France, and 
Italy in Munich to discuss his demands. Neville Chamberlain , the British prime 
minister, again argued that a policy of appeasement would keep the peace and 
put an end to Hitler’s demands for more land. The Munich Agreement  allowed 
Hitler to annex the Sudetenland in return for a promise that Germany would not 
take over any more Czech territory. This was a fateful miscalculation. Hitler saw 
that the British were not willing to stand up to his illegal land grabs, emboldening 
him to seize control of all of Czechoslovakia with an armed invasion in 1939. 
7he Conflict oYer 3olanG  Hitler next set his sights on the Polish port 
of 'an]iJ. Although Germany did have some historical claims to the port, in 
reality, Hitler was merely looking for an excuse to invade Poland. Britain, in 
the meantime, had reached the end of its policy of appeasement and agreed to 
protect Poland from a German attack. Britain and France also reached out to the 
Soviet Union to form a stronger alliance against Germany.
Germany, however, was already in negotiations with the Soviets. With the 
signing of the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact on August 2, 1, the 
two nations pledged not to attack one another. During the negotiations for the 
pact, Hitler secretly offered Stalin control of eastern Poland and the Baltic States 
if Stalin would stand by during a German invasion of western Poland. With this 
assurance in hand, Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1, claiming 
that Poland had attacked first. Britain and France honored their agreement to 
protect Poland and declared war on Germany. These actions marked the official 
start of World War II in Europe.

Japan’s Expansion in Asia
By the time Germany invaded Poland in 1, Japan had already been moving 
aggressively against .orea and China for almost 50 years. In 11, Japan had 
invaded Manchuria. After several months of fighting, it successfully created 
the state of Manchukuo under its control. Then, in 1, a small incident in 
this region between Japanese troops and Chinese troops quickly escalated. 
Soon, Japan had launched a full-scale invasion of China. This marked the start 
of World War II in Asia.

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:   IDENTIF Y ASSUMP TION S SH APING POINT  
O- =IEW
The point of view of a source is often shaped by underlying assumptions.   
For example, the .orean Declaration of Independence states: “We 
proclaim >our independence@ to the nations of the world in affirmation of 
the principle of the equality of all nations.” The underlying assumption 
that shapes the point of view in this statement is that all nations are equal, 
a position with which reasonable people agree. That sound assumption 
establishes a legitimacy to other aspects of the declaration. If it had 
instead said, “. . . in affirmation of the principle of the superiority of  
.oreans,” the point of view would be sufficiently narrowed that its 
legitimacy would be questioned, since enlightened opinion recognizes 
equality of people and nations.

Conducting World War II
>e shall not flag nor fail >e shall go on to the end >e shall fight in -rance and 
on the seas and oceans" we shall fight with growing confidence and growing 
strength in the air. We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be; we 
shall fight on beaches, landing grounds, in fields, in streets and on the hills 
We shall never surrender. 
—British Prime 4inister Winston Churchill (1une 4, 1940)
Essential Question:   What similarities and differences were there in the 
methods governments used to conduct war?
During World War II, governments rallied all their resources in the war effort. 
The call to intense nationalism, as illustrated in Winston Churchill’s speech 
in the British House of Commons, was part of concerted policies that used 
all forms of communication to mobilize the population. Appeal to ideological 
beliefs, including fascism and communism, dominated daily life during the 
conflict and minimized resistance to militarism.
Governments also used new military technology and tactics, including the 
atomic bomb and “total war,” disregarding previously accepted laws of war. 
These policies increased the level of wartime casualties.
Japan and Imperialist Policies
With the military in control of the government, Japan harbored imperialist 
ambitions that would lead to a world war in the Pacific. The Mukden Incident 
and the takeover of land in Manchuria in a state called Manchukuo see 
Topic  7.5) were early efforts in this drive. 
New Order in East Asia  The occupation of parts of China was but one step 
in Japan’s overall strategy, which was to create a “New Order in East Asia.” The 
Japanese had looked to expand into Soviet Siberia, but when Germany and the 
Soviets signed the Nonaggression Pact of 1939, Japan had to look elsewhere 
for new territory. Nearby Southeast Asia, which had been under the control 
of imperial powers in Western Europe and the United States, was the most 
obvious target. However, Japan faced obstacles. Its occupation of China led 
to economic sanctions by the United States. Because Japan’s economy relied 
on oil and scrap iron from the United States, sanctions threatened to strangle 
512 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONits economy and undercut its military expansion. Therefore, Japan began to 
plan to retaliate against the United States with military force in the hope that 
by doing so, the Western powers would submit to Japan’s imperial ambitions.
Germany’s Early Victories and Challenges
Once war broke out in Europe, Hitler moved swiftly to acquire territory. He 
embarked on a strategy called Elit]NrieJ , or lightning war, to quickly subdue 
Poland. Germany used rapidly moving tank divisions supported by the air 
force in its four-week campaign. At the end of September 1, Germany and 
the Soviets divided the country as they had planned when they signed the 
German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact.
Germany’s rapid success in Poland encouraged Hitler to attack and 
conquer Denmark and Norway in April 10 and the Netherlands, Belgium, 
and France in the following month. Germany then proceeded to bring the 
government and resources of the conquered nations under its control. As 
the Germans approached Paris, the French government fled to Bordeaux, in 
southern France. Germany took direct control of the northern two-thirds of 
the country. The French set up a new pro-Nazi regime based in Vichy under  
Marshal Henri-Philippe Pptain, an aged World War I hero. Connect: Create

British-American Relations  Fearing that it would be the next victim 
in Germany’s relentless and rapid campaign, Britain asked the United States 
for support. Despite a long history of isolationism from European troubles, 
President Roosevelt believed the United States should help the British. 
In 1940, the two powers signed the Destroyers-for-Bases Agreement , 
in which the United States promised delivery of 50 destroyers in exchange 
for eight British air and naval bases in the Western Hemisphere. In the 11 
513 CONDUCTING WORLD WAR II 513Lend-Lease Act , the United States gave up all pretensions of neutrality by 
lending war materials to Britain. Also in 11, Britain and the United States 
forged a policy statement known as the Atlantic Charter , which set down 
basic goals for the post-war world. The charter included such provisions as the 
restoration of self-government to those deprived of it, the abandonment of the 
use of force, and the disarmament of aggressor nations. 
The Battle of Britain  In Europe, Britain was the last major holdout 
against Nazi power. In July 10, Hitler ordered a large campaign against 
the small island nation by the Luftwaffe , the German air force. He believed 
that bombardment from the air would sufficiently weaken the country so 
that German sea and land forces could mount a successful invasion. Initially 
targeting military bases in this Battle of Britain , the Germans turned to 
bombing British cities after the British Royal Air Force conducted a raid on 
Berlin. Winston Churchill  termed this Britain’s “finest hour” as the civilian 
population in London and other cities withstood months of relentless bombing.  
The targeting of cities did provide one advantage for Britain: the British 
military was able to rebuild after the earlier raids on its bases. Ultimately, 
Britain’s superior planes and radar system allowed it to destroy German planes 
faster than they could be replaced. By May 11, Hitler was forced to postpone 
indefinitely any attempted invasion of Britain.
War on the Soviet Union  After failing to invade Britain, Hitler turned 
east. He attacked the Soviet Union to eliminate Bolshevism and to create 
/eEensraum— land for settlement and development²for the German people. 
Germany’s turning its focus to the east took pressure off Britain. Germany 
began its invasion of the Soviet Union in June 11. Initially the Nazis 
experienced rapid success as they had in Western Europe, capturing large 
amounts of territory and two million Soviet troops. However, the German 
forces soon found themselves at the mercy of the harsh Russian winter. The 
Soviets defended the city of Leningrad in the Siege of Leningrad , which lasted 
three years and led to the deaths of a million Soviet men, women, and children.
Japan Overreaches
Japan experienced rapid victories in the Pacific. It launched a surprise air attack 
on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor  in Hawaii on December  , 11, 
destroying much of the U.S. Pacific fleet. Japan then seized the Philippines, 
the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, Burma, and numerous Pacific islands. 
Japan believed that the surprise attack and the damage to the U.S. Pacific 
Fleet would prompt the United States to negotiate a settlement favorable to 
Japan immediately. Instead, U.S. isolationism disappeared overnight public 
opinion demanded retaliation against Japan. Great Britain and China joined 
the United States in the fight against Japanese aggression. The war truly 
became global when, within days, Hitler responded to the U.S. declaration of 
war against Japan with his own declaration of war against the United States.
514 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONColonial Armies  As the Axis powers expanded into new territory, 
Western colonies began to join the Allies in the war effort. For example, the 
Indian Army, which had started the war with only 200,000 men, ended the 
war as the largest volunteer army in history with more than 2.5 million men. 
Although the Indian Army sent troops to North Africa, the bulk of its troops 
fought against the Japanese in Southeast Asia. 
Home Fronts
Like World War I, World War II was a total war. Most countries mobilized 
all their resources, including the civilian population, to achieve victory. The 
United States started with the strongest industrial sector of any country in the 
world and it added stringent government planning to provide factories what 
they needed. In addition, unlike anywhere in Europe, U.S. industry operated 
without threat of military attack. The United States ramped up production of 
the resources required for war, including ships, tanks, planes, landing craft, 
radar equipment, guns, and ammunition. With the enlistment of large numbers 
of men in the armed forces, women found far more opportunities to work in 
factories and offices. The U.S. government promoted art of “Rosie the Riveter” 
to encourage women to succeed at jobs that were once thought to be for men.
Instead of mobilizing all available citizens in the war effort, German 
leaders relied on forced labor, some of it in concentration camps. At its peak, 
20 percent of the wartime workforce was forced labor, with 600,000 French 
citizens working in German war plants and 1.5 million French soldiers working 
in prisoner-of-war (POW) camps. The solution was counterproductive, 
however. The workers were treated so poorly that productivity was low. 
In Japan, efforts on the home front were confused. The government 
presented an optimistic view of the war instead of trying to mobilize resources. 
The government took pride in not using women in the war effort, claiming that 
the enemy is “drafting women but in Japan, out of consideration for the family 
system, we will not.” The government was able to systematically remove 
children from cities to the countryside when bombing of cities started late in 
the war. It was also successful in rationing food throughout the war. Connect:

the warfare before and during World War II. See Topic ..
The Tide Turns in the European Theater
With its entry into the war in December 11, the United States joined the 
other Allied powers, Great Britain and the Soviet Union. In spite of political 
differences, the three nations were united in their determination to achieve a 
military victory and agreed that Axis surrender must be unconditional.
In early 12, the Allies were struggling in Europe and North Africa. 
General Erwin Rommel , the “Desert Fox,” led German troops in Egypt and 
threatened to take the northern city of Alexandria. But in the second half 
of 1942, the tide turned. The British defeated Rommel at the Battle of El 
515 CONDUCTING WORLD WAR IIAlamein  And after months of fighting, a Soviet counteroffensive successfully 
defeated the pride of Hitler’s military, the German Sixth Army, in the Battle 
of Stalingrad . Although the Germans remained in control of most of Western 
Europe, the momentum of the war in Europe had turned against the Nazis.
7Ke7iGe7uUnsinWKe3Dciðc7KeDWeU
The year 12 was also crucial in the war against Japan. The first Allied 
victory occurred in May in the %attle oI the Coral Sea  when the U.S. Navy 
stopped a Japanese fleet set to invade New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, 
thus helping to prevent a future invasion of Australia. The following month, 
with the destruction of four Japanese aircraft carriers at the Battle of Midway 
Island , Allied naval forces demonstrated their superiority in the Pacific. These 
battles stopped the advance of the Japanese. The first major Allied offensive 
was on the island of Guadalcanal , which ended in early 1 with an Allied 
victory. 
The Allied forces in the Pacific under U.S. General Douglas MacArthur 
used a strategy called island-hopping  The Allies attacked islands where Japan 
was weak and skipped those where Japan was strong. The Allies slowly, and at 
great human cost, moved through the Philippines, getting closer to Japan itself.
Technology was critical to Allied success. The development of fleets of 
aircraft carriers , ships that allowed planes to take off from and land on their 
decks at sea, provided air support for battleships and increased the range and 
flexibility of naval forces. Aircraft were used for raids on enemy ships and 
bases and for intelligence gathering. Submarines sank about 55 percent of the 
Japanese merchant fleet, severely damaging Japan’s supply lines.
The Last Years of the War
The Allied successes of 12 put the Axis powers on the defensive in 1. 
The Allies identified Italy as the weakest point under Axis control in Europe. 
In spite of German forces sent to aid Italy, the Allies gained control of the 
island of Sicily in July 1, leading to the fall of Mussolini. After the Allies 
invaded southern Italy in September 1, Italy turned against its former ally. 
After months of slow and costly progress, the Allies finally recaptured Rome 
on June 4, 1944. 
June 6, 1, has become known as D-Day , when about 150,000 Allied 
forces under the command of U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower launched an 
amphibious invasion from England, landing on the beaches of Normandy in 
northern France. Allied casualties were high. Eventually, however, the Allies 
established a base to begin the march toward Paris, which was liberated in 
August. With control of Western Europe slipping away, Germany’s defeat was 
drawing closer.
The Germans made one final push against the Allies during the winter of 
1944. The Battle of the Bulge  was fought in the Ardennes Forest across parts 
of France, Belgium, and Luxembourg. An Allied victory left Germany with no 
516WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONrealistic expectation of winning the war, yet Hitler refused to give up. Allied 
air raids began to systematically destroy Germany’s infrastructure and Allied 
troops crossed the Rhine River into Germany in March 15. One month later 
they were approaching Germany’s capital city of Berlin.
On the Eastern Front, Soviet troops were also moving rapidly toward 
Germany. In July 1, the largest tank battle of the war, the Battle of Kursk , 
was fought about 00 miles south of Moscow. The Soviets challenged this 
instance of German Blitzkrieg by successfully holding their defensive position 
and then counterattacking. The Soviets then made rapid progress through the 
Ukraine and the Baltic States in 1. After taking control of Warsaw, Poland, 
in January 15, the Soviets moved on to Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. In 
April 15, they advanced on Berlin.
Victory in Europe  Hitler spent the war’s final days hiding in a bunker, 
a fortified underground shelter, in Berlin. Although the country was falling 
apart, he continued to live under the delusion that somehow Germany would 
triumph. The end came on April 0, 15, when Hitler committed suicide. 
His ally Mussolini had been killed by members of the Italian resistance two 
days before. After Hitler’s death, members of Germany’s High Command 
acknowledged that continuing the war would be futile. In the first days of May, 
Germany surrendered to the Allies. May 8, 15, marked the official end of 
the war in Europe and was designated as Victory in Europe Day or V-E Day 
Victory over Japan  In early 15, U.S. forces captured the islands of 
Okinawa and Iwo Jima and prepared to attack the Japanese mainland. In March 
15, U.S. troops fire-bombed Tokyo, killing about 100,000 people and leaving 
about a million others homeless. Although the island-hopping campaign had 
weakened Japan’s hold on the Pacific, the emperor was not ready to surrender. 
The United States was beginning to consider the costs of invading the Japanese 
homeland, which it feared might lead to enormous Allied casualties. Despite 
initial hesitations about using nuclear weapons, President Truman ordered 
the U.S. Army Air Force to drop the first atomic bomb on the Japanese city 
of Hiroshima  on August 6, 15. The nuclear age had begun. Three days 
later, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki , resulting in an estimated 
total of 10,000 Japanese civilian deaths. The months of Allied victories, 
combined with these devastating nuclear attacks, caused Japan to surrender 
unconditionally on August 1. Truman designated September 2, the day of the 
formal surrender ceremonies, as Victory over Japan Day or V-J Day .
Consequences of World War II
World War II was the bloodiest war in human history. It resulted in the deaths 
of around 5 million people, two-thirds of whom were civilians. As later topics 
explain, it changed how people thought about racism, colonial empires, and 
international relations. Further, it provided the context for a fierce ideological 
battle between the United States and the Soviet Union that would shape global 
affairs for the following five decades.

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“Nearly 50,000 American women served in uniform, both at home and abroad. 
. . . . General Eisenhower felt that he could not win the war without the aid of 
the women in uniform. µThe contribution of the women of America, whether 
on the farm or in the factory or in uniform, to D-Day was a sine qua non of the 
invasion effort.’
Women in uniform took office and clerical jobs in the armed forces in order 
to free men to fight. They also drove trucks, repaired airplanes, worked as 
laboratory technicians, rigged parachutes, served as radio operators, analyzed 
photographs, flew military aircraft across the country, test-flew newly repaired 
planes, and even trained anti-aircraft artillery gunners by acting as flying targets. 
Some women served near the front lines in the Army Nurse Corps, where 
16 were killed as a result of direct enemy fire. Sixty-eight American service 
women were captured as POWs in the Philippines. More than 1,600 nurses 
were decorated for bravery under fire and meritorious service, and 565 WACs 
in the Pacific Theater won combat decorations. Nurses were in Normandy on 
D-plus-four.”

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:   E=IDENCE TO SUPPORT, MODI-@, OR RE-UTE
In the years following the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, historians have considered, from almost every angle, the 
question of whether or not the bombs were needed to end the war. 
Each position has offered evidence to support it. That same evidence 
might modify  someone else’s argument²change it somewhat or add a 
complexity²or it might refute or disprove it entirely. 
The following excerpt is from an article that appeared in The Atlantic  
in December 16. It states a clear position on the question.
“The facts are these. On July 26, 15, the Potsdam Ultimatum

Tsuyoshi Hasegawa of the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, is the most comprehensive study yet undertaken 
of Japanese documentary sources. The highly praised study 
argues that the atomic bomb played only a secondary role in 
Japan’s decision to surrender. By far the most important factor, 
Hasegawa finds, was the entry of the Soviet Union into the war 
against Japan on Aug. 8, 15, two days after the Hiroshima

that Japan would not have surrendered if the bombs had not been 
dropped even after that some in the military tried to prevent 
the Emperor from surrendering. American military leaders 
predicted that an invasion of Japan would have produced 1

MASS ATROCITIE S521
7.8
Mass Atrocities
Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians? 
—German Führer Adolf Hitler (August 22, 1939)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and consequences of mass 
atrocities from 1900 to the present?
The deaths of fighting forces in the two world wars were only part of the 
total casualties. Genocide, ethnic violence, and other atrocities took place as 
extremist groups rose to power. During and after World War I, the Ottoman 
Empire, ruled by a clique of “Young Turks” who were disturbed by the 
continuing decline of Ottoman power, perpetrated the Armenian genocide in 
which some 1.5 million Armenians died. As Adolf Hitler implemented the 
Holocaust, he referred to the Armenian annihilation as a reminder of how little 
the Nazis need fear for the systematic murder of six million Jews.
Ethnic atrocities did not end after World War II. Dictator Pol Pot wanted  to 
“purify” Cambodian society along racial, social, and political lines, resulting in 
the deaths of 1.6 to 1.8 million Cambodians. See Topic 8.6. And in Rwanda, 
the majority Hutu government directed mass slaughter of the Tutsi minority.
Atrocities in Europe and the Middle East
After three years of a bloody stalemate, the United States entered World War 
I in 11, despite considerable popular protests in the United States against 
American involvement. By the summer of 118, when U.S. forces were 
in place in Europe, U.S. actions helped push the war in the Allies’ favor. 
Allied advances against the Central Powers forced Germany to surrender on 
November 11, 118, which became known as Armistice Day .
Between 8 million and 9 million soldiers died in the war, with more than 
21 million wounded. In France, Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary, fewer 
than half of all young men who fought for their countries returned physically 
unharmed. Soldiers who did return often bore emotional scars. 
Civilian casualties were harder to record, but estimates range anywhere 
from 6 million to 1 million. This was one of the first modern wars where 
civilians were considered legitimate targets. Although the Allies’ propaganda 
often exaggerated accounts of atrocities, reports of German soldiers raping 
women and killing families during their march through Belgium were common.

Armenian Genocide  The most shocking example of such atrocities were 
the deaths of between 600,000 and 1.5 million Armenians  in Turkey. This action 
has been called the 20th century’s first genocide , the attempted killing of a group 
of people based on their race, religion, or ethnicity. The Ottoman government 
alleged that the Christian Armenians, a minority within the Ottoman Empire, 
were cooperating with the Russian army, an Ottoman enemy during World  
War I. As punishment for this cooperation, the Ottoman government deported 
Armenians from their homes between 115 and 11 and into camps in Syria 
and what is today Iraq. Many Armenians died from starvation, disease, or 
exposure to the elements. Turkish troops executed others. Armenians have 
argued that the deaths were genocide. The Turkish government has said the 
deaths were the result of actions of war, ethnic conflicts, and disease, not 
genocide. Connect: Create a graphic organizer comparing the Armenian 
genocide with the Nazis’ extermination of millions of Jews. See Topic .6.
Pandemic Disease
War-related deaths continued past Armistice Day in the form of an influen]a 
epidemic . Under peacetime circumstances, a virulent disease might devastate 
a concentrated group of people in a particular region. However, in 118, 
millions of soldiers were returning home as the war ended. As they did, 
they had contact with loved ones and friends, thereby spreading the flu. In 
11, the epidemic became a pandemic , a disease prevalent over a large area  
or the entire world, killing 20 million people in Europe, the United States, and 
elsewhere. India alone may have lost 7 million people to the disease. 
The worldwide spread of the disease was another sign that while nationalism 
remained a powerful political force, improvements in transportation were 
creating a global culture that would create global challenges. Whether people 
could create effective international responses was unclear.

A more intangible casualty of the war was the loss of a sense of security and 
hopefulness. The term Lost Generation , first used to describe American 
expatriate writers living in Paris after the war, came to be used more broadly 
to describe those suffering from the shock of the war. World War I was the 
bloodiest war thus far in history. It resulted in tremendous suffering and death 
for both military personnel and civilians.
Famine in the Ukraine  In the Soviet Union, peasants strongly resisted 
Stalin’s collectivization of agriculture. They hid or destroyed their crops and 
killed their livestock rather than turning them over to state control. This led 
to famines from human action rather than by weather or crop failures. The 
famines in 12 and 1 were especially devastating in the Ukraine, one of 
the Soviet Union’s most fertile farming regions. An estimated  million to 10 
million peasants died as a result of these famines. The government took much 
of the crops that were grown to feed industrial workers or to use for industry. 
Although peasants starved, industry grew.
Casualties of World War II
Because of the widespread fighting, advances in the technology of destruction, 
and its impact on the economies and civilian life of so many nations, the effects 
of World War II were unprecedented. Although exact casualty figures have 
been impossible to determine, total deaths probably numbered 0 million to 50 
million. Maybe half of those were citizens of the Soviet Union, and millions 
of others were from Germany, Poland, China, and Japan. Losses among U.S. 
troops were fewer, but still considerable: about 20,000 soldiers killed and 
more than 600,000 wounded. Civilian casualties from attacks on land, air, 
and sea from government executions based on political rationales, including 
genocide and from disease and starvation caused by the war likely exceeded 
military casualties.
7he 1a]is  During the war, the world gradually learned about Nazi 
brutality. In its pursuit of territory, Germany forcefully removed many Slavic 
peoples, including one million Poles, and Roma, also known as Gypsies, from 
their homes. Heinrich Himmler , the leader of the Nazi special police, the SS, 
oversaw these policies. In addition, more than  million residents of conquered 
territories were forced to work in labor camps or in jobs that supported the 
German war effort. The Nazis sent political opponents, people with disabilities, 
and gay people to the camps. But the largest single group the Nazis targeted 
were the Jews. When Hitler became chancellor, he instituted many policies 
that reflected these extreme anti-Semitic views, such as the Nuremberg Laws  
of 15 that banned Jews from certain professions and certain schools. Jews 
were forced to live in sections of cities called ghettos . 
524 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn 12, the Nazi persecution of Jews turned into mass murder. They 
began a campaign led by the SS to kill all Jews in Europe, a plan they called 
the “ Final Solution .” Initially, Nazi killing units moved from place to place, 
shooting Jews and burying them in mass graves. Later the SS began rounding 
up Jews and shipping them to death camps, where Nazis gassed them. 
Auschwitz and Treblinka in Poland and Dachau in Germany were some of the 
largest camps. By the end of the war, the Nazis had killed about six million 
Jews, an act of genocide known as the Holocaust  The Nazis killed another 
five million people who belonged to other persecuted groups or were Soviet 
prisoners of war. The Nazis worked many to death in labor camps and 
massacred others. 
The Japanese  During the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1, Japanese 
soldiers killed at least 100,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians in what was 
called the Rape of Nanking. During World War II, although the Japanese did 
not carry out a dedicated policy of genocide that paralleled the Holocaust, 
millions of people died as a result of their policies. Under the program “ Asia 
for Asiatics ,” Japan forced people they had conquered into labor programs. 
These included service in the military, on public works projects, and on farms 
to reduce the food shortage in Japan. The Japanese army forced women in 
.orea, China, and other occupied countries to become “comfort women,” 
prostitutes for Japanese soldiers. Because of these harsh programs, more than 
a million civilians died in 9ietnam alone. Perhaps an equal number of Allied 
prisoners of war and local workers perished while doing forced labor for Japan.One shocking aspect of the Holocaust was how the Nazis used technology  ²trains, poisonous gas, and 
ovens for cremation shown here²to make their attempt at genocide more ef ficient and more deadly.

525 MASS ATROCITIE SThe Allies  Air warfare carried out by the United States and the other Allies 
brought a new type of deadly combat to civilians. The Allies’ fireEoPEinJ  of 
German cities, particularly Hamburg  in 1943 and Dresden  in 1945, caused 
large casualties. The number of deaths in Hamburg was about 50,000. Dresden 
had fewer casualties, maybe 25,000 deaths, as 15 square miles of its historic 
city center were destroyed. The United States also used firebombing in Tokyo  
The final two air attacks in the war, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, produced not 
only high casualties, but tremendous fear about the destructiveness of a future 
war fought with nuclear weapons. These weapons had been developed by an 
international group of scientists working in the United States. The scientific 
achievement was impressive, but it also required developments in other areas 
to have military use. For example, to deliver the nuclear weapons required 
improvements in airplane design to allow long flights carrying heavy loads. 
There is a great difference between the planes used in World War II and those 
used in World War I. In addition, the widespread use of the aircraft carrier by 
several powers extended the airplanes’ reach. Using these developments in 
planes and ships, countries could carry out air attacks anywhere in the world.
Genocide and Human Rights
The global community said “never again” to genocide after the horrors of the 
Holocaust. However, genocides continued to occur.
Bosnia  Ethnic conflict drove the genocide in Bosnia . The end of World 
War I brought with it the creation of several new nations in Eastern Europe, 
including Yugoslavia. That country was home to Serbians, who were Eastern 
Orthodox Christians Croats and Slovenes, who were Catholic and Muslims 
in the regions of Bosnia and .osovo. Marshal Josip Broz Tito led communist 
Yugoslavia from the end of World War II until his death in 180. As dictator, 
Tito tried to suppress separatist tendencies among the peoples of Yugoslavia 
by keeping Serbia and Croatia, the two largest republics, from dominating the 
smaller ones.
After the Soviet Union collapsed, so did Yugoslavia. When Slovenia, 
Croatia, and Montenegro declared independence, they each defined citizenship 
in terms of ethnic background and religion. Serbian nationalists led by the 
demagogue Slobodan Miloševicc ´  were particularly emphatic about ethnic 
purity. Serb forces, in attempts to dominate states such as Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and .osovo, committed horrific acts of ethnic cleansing  against Muslims 
from Bosnia and .osovo, killing or driving people who were not part of the 
main ethnic group from their homes. Bosniaks, .osovars, and Croats fought 
back, causing more casualties. Serb soldiers raped untold numbers of Muslim 
women. In total, more than 300,000 people in the region perished over the 
course of Yugoslavia’s EalNani]ation , or disintegration into separate states. 
Rwanda  One of the smallest countries in Africa, Rwanda  was the site of 
one of the worst genocides in modern history. Ethnic and tribal hatred going 
526WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONback to the colonial era was behind the slaughter. Belgian colonizers had treated 
the minority Tutsis better than the majority Hutus . The latter group resented 
all the power that the Tutsis enjoyed. When Rwanda won independence from 
Belgium in 162, the Hutu majority easily won control of the government and 
took revenge on the Tutsis by discriminating against them. In response, tens of 
thousands of Tutsis fled the country and formed a rebel army.
In 1, Tutsi and Hutu forces in Rwanda began negotiations for a coalition 
government in which both ethnic groups would share power. The negotiations 
were cut short in 1 when Rwanda’s president, a Hutu, was killed in an 
airplane crash, supposedly shot down by rebel forces. This incident lit the 
flames of genocide. Over the next three months or so, between 500,000 and 
1 million civilians²mostly Tutsis and some moderate Hutus²were killed. 
Some sources estimate that casualties were even higher.
International responses ranged from insufficient to callous. United Nations 
peacekeepers were instructed not to use force to restore order. There were also 
too few peacekeepers to protect all Rwandans. Individual countries, including 
the United States, evacuated their personnel from the country after Belgian 
peacekeepers were killed. UN peacekeepers and individual nations  failed to 
evacuate any Rwandans. The Rwandan genocide focused attention on the lack 
of leadership in the international community. It became clear that the United 
Nations needed to think seriously about its role in violent conflicts if it wanted 
to effectively protect human lives and human rights.

remind people of the genocide of hundreds of thousands of people in 1994.
527 MASS ATROCITIE SSudan  Another genocide erupted in 200 in Darfur , a region located in 
western Sudan. Most of the people involved were Muslim, but some were 
nomadic pastoralists of Arab descent, while others were non-Arab farmers. 
The government of Sudan was controlled by Arab Muslims. Two Darfur rebel 
groups composed of non-Arabs took up arms against the Sudanese government 
in response to attacks from nomads. In response, the government unleashed 
Arab militants known as the Janjaweed  translation: “evil men on horseback” 
on the region. Together with Sudanese forces, the Janjaweed attacked and 
destroyed hundreds of villages throughout Darfur, slaughtering more than 
200,000 people, mostly non-Arab Muslim Africans. More than one million 
people were displaced, creating a refugee crisis that spilled into neighboring 
Chad. Despite negotiations, appeals, and the  International Criminal Court 
charging Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir with war crimes, the genocide 
continued. 
The genocides in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Sudan became stains on the 
conscience of the world. International organizations and the broad global 
community were supposed to defend human rights after the Jewish Holocaust. 
Considering the millions of lives lost and human dignity shattered, the 
failure of the international community appeared obvious. Connect: Write a

CAUSATION IN GLOBAL CONFLICT 531
7.9
&DusDWiRnin*lREDl&RnñicW
As long as there are sovereign nations possessing great power,  
war is inevitable. 
—.erman-American Physicist Albert Einstein (1945)
Essential Question:   What was the relative signiÄcance of the causes of 
global conflict from 1900 to the present?
The 20th century saw significant changes to the global order. At the beginning 
of the century, the West dominated the global political order. However, the 
First and Second World Wars resulted in a power shift within the Western 
political sphere from Western Europe to the United States. These global 
conflicts also resulted in the emergence of new states around the world as 
independence movements ended the colonial relationships that existed in the 
previous century. 
The Ottoman, Russian, and Qing empires that had existed at the beginning 
of the century all collapsed due to internal decay and political revolutions. 
Other areas of the world also saw political upheaval as nations struggled with 
both economic depression and calls for greater democracy. Often, though, 
totalitarian governments emerged out of these political and economic crises. 
3RliWicDl&DusesRf*lREDl&RnñicW  
in the 20th  Century
Many historians refer to World War I as the first “total war.” The war was 
fought on an industrial scale by soldiers from around the world, including 
soldiers from colonial areas. The combatants discovered more, and deadlier, 
methods of killing each other. Long-range artillery, poison gas, flamethrowers, 
and machine guns led to the deaths of millions of soldiers on both sides. The 
roots of this conflict lie in several main causes. A balance of power in Europe 
had been established during the 1th century through a constantly shifting 
system of alliances. However, these alliances proved instrumental in escalating 
the scope of the war as European nations jumped into the conflict to honor 
their commitments. 
Nationalism was a growing force for political change in Europe. As such, 
Serbian nationalism was the main spark that created conflict in the Balkans, 
known as the “powder keg of Europe,” which led to the expansion of the war 
532WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONthroughout Europe. An arms race among the great powers of Europe helped 
to increase the possibility of war as well. Lastly, the imperial rivalry among 
Western nations, as well as Japan and Russia, helped to increase tensions over 
commerce and access to resources.

Some of the same issues that brought about World War I also led to World 
War II. Fascism was nationalism in an extreme form. The fascist governments 
of Germany and Italy defied international pressure and treaties when they 
invaded neighboring territories. The alliance of Germany, Italy, and, eventually, 
Japan was opposed by the Western democracies of Great Britain and France. 
However, it was the inability of the Western democracies to offer a strong 
response to Germany’s aggressive militarism that launched Europe and the 
rest of the world into war. Additionally, Japan’s imperial ambitions in Asia 
were the main cause for war to break out in the Pacific between Japan and the 
United States. Connect: Compare the motivating factors for wars fought in 
the 20th century with wars fought in the 1th century. See Topic 6..
(cRnRPic&DusesRf*lREDl&RnñicW  
in the 20th  Century
The primary economic cause of global conflict in the early 20th century was the 
acquisition and control of markets and resources. In the 1th century, Western 
European governments, followed by the United States, Russia, and Japan, 
began policies to take control of trade, territory, or both in Asia and Africa. In 
previous centuries, armed conflict would often erupt over the rivalry to control 
the natural resources of these areas. However, as the Industrial Revolution 
spread from Great Britain to the rest of Western Europe, and then to the United 
States, Russia, and Japan, control over markets to sell consumer goods was a 
primary motive of imperialistic policies. Attempts were made, particularly in 
the late 1th century, to prevent wars over trade but these attempts had mixed 
success.
533 CAUSATION IN GLOBAL CONFLICT 533The Opium Wars, the First and Second Sino-Japanese War, the Crimean 
War, and eventually the First and Second World Wars had these economic 
factors as some of their root causes. For example, the desire of Imperial Japan 
to take over territory in Asia to obtain sources of oil, rice, rubber, and other 
raw materials led to the decision of the United States and other countries to 
place an embargo on Japan that cut off oil and steel exports from the United 
States to Japan. The result was the Japanese decision to attack the U.S. Pacific 
Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, causing the United States to enter World War 
II. Economic crisis also helped lead to global conflict. The severe economic 
effects of the Great Depression (1929–1939), including high unemployment 
and low wages, led to the rise of populist leaders like Adolf Hitler who 
promised to rebuild the economies of their states. 
(σecWsRf*lREDl&RnñicWinWKeWK&enWuUy
Rapid advances in science and technology led to a better understanding 
of the natural world and brought about advances in many areas, including 
communication, transportation, industry, agriculture, and medicine. States also 
improved their war-making capabilities. As a result, one of the most significant 
effects of the global conflicts of the 20th century was the immense loss of life 
as warfare became deadlier to both combatants and civilians alike. Large-scale 
aerial bombing that targeted populated areas, deadly policies that targeted 
specific minority groups such as European Jews, and the use of new military 
technology such as the atomic bomb all meant that global conflict would 
cause unprecedented deaths among the civilian population. In addition, mass 
starvation and crimes against humanity were also responsible for millions of 
civilian deaths during the 20th century.

534WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONGlobal conflict in the 20th century also brought about notable political 
changes in the world. In the beginning of the century, the Mexican Revolution 
took place because many Mexicans wanted political and economic reforms. 
Populist movements formed and, eventually, Mexico created a new constitution 
with more political and economic rights for the majority of Mexicans. 
However, true democratic institutions in Mexico emerged and evolved slowly. 
As a result of World War I, regime change occurred in both the Ottoman 
Empire and the Russian Empire. In addition to the effect of the First World 
War, ineffective or corrupt leadership was also instrumental in bringing about 
the political revolutions that toppled the monarchies of these states. While the 
Ottoman government was replaced by a Western-style democracy, the Russian 
Revolution instituted a totalitarian government headed by the Communist 
Party. 
Resentment of the Treaty of Versailles, the peace agreement that ended  
World War I, also helped to bring about totalitarian regimes in Germany and 
Italy. These fascist governments appealed to people’s nationalism and desire 
to restore the country’s glory and standing in the world, leading their nations 
toward war. 
World War I weakened the colonial powers, and after the war, U.S. 
President Woodrow Wilson advocated for the self-determination of people to 
choose their government or nation-state. This was seen as a sign that colonies 
had the right to demand independence. Many people in the colonies also felt 
that their support of or active participation in the war meant that they were 
owed some form of self-government. When those in power did not meet these 
demands, organized independence movements formed or grew. 
The desire for independence continued to grow after World War II, as 
the colonial powers were further weakened by the war and unable to afford 
the cost and labor power to rebuild and maintain their empires. Many new Civilian Deaths in the Second World War

535 CAUSATION IN GLOBAL CONFLICTstates formed during this time. Former colonies that had a small foreign settler 
population gained their independence relatively peacefully, while colonies 
that had a sizeable foreign settler population often experienced a more violent 
process towards independence. 
Perhaps the largest independence movement, in terms of the number of 
people involved, took place in India. Relying on passive resistance and civil 
disobedience, the people of the British colony of India achieved independence 
in 1. However, due to religious and ideological differences, the Indian 
subcontinent was partitioned into a Muslim-dominated Pakistan which 
originally included East Pakistan, now Bangladesh and a Hindu-dominated 
India. See Topic 8.6. The tensions between Muslims and Hindus living in 
British India did not disappear with independence. These tensions have led to 
several military conflicts between the two countries since partition.
Another significant effect of the global conflicts of the 20th century 
was a repositioning of power in the Western countries²away from Western 
Europe and to the United States. Because of the participation of the United 
States in both the First and Second World Wars, as well as the smaller scale 
of destruction the U.S. experienced compared to Western European countries, 
the United States became a world power, playing the dominant role in the 
transatlantic relationship. However, the Soviet Union soon emerged as a 
second superpower in opposition to the United States.
REFLECT ON THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. Causation 5elatiYe SiJnificance oI Causes  How can you determine 
which causes were more significant than others" First, recognize  that 
a cause must be an event or set of conditions that make it more  likely 
an outcome will occur. Then ask yourself these questions to rank 
the relative significance of causes²that is, which causes were m ost 
important in bringing about an outcome.
• Is it an underlying cause or one closer to the surface" Either can be 
more important.)
• Was it one of several causes that had about an equal effect"  
• Was it part of a chain of cause and effect in which the effect became a 
cause for another effect before the final effect was achieved"
 Choose one of the causes of global conflict and evaluate its relative 
significance in generating or producing conflict.
2. In one to three paragraphs, explain the relative significance of  the 
causes of global conflict from 100 to the present.

UNIT 7 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WHAT CAUSED TOTALITARIANI SM?
Scholars disagree about why so many totalitarian states, states with 
complete control over every aspect of public and private life, emerged 
in the 20th century. While many countries moved toward democracy, 
Russia, Germany, Italy, and Spain became dictatorships between the 
two world wars. Scholars often explain the rise of totalitarianism from 
their own discipline’s viewpoint. 
An Economist’s View  An Austrian economist, Friedrich Hayek, argued 
that totalitarianism had developed gradually and was based on decisions about 
economic policy. In his 1 book The Road to Serfdom, Hayek concluded that 
totalitarianism grew in Western democracies because they had “progressively 
abandoned that freedom in economic affairs without which personal and 
political freedom has never existed in the past.” He viewed socialism and 
fascism as two sides of the same coin, since centralized government planning 
and state power characterized both. 
Political Scientists’ View  In contrast, the American political scientists 
Carl Friedrich and =bigniew Brzezinski focused on political and ethnic issues, 
not economic ones. They contended that the totalitarian regimes in Germany, 
Italy, and the Soviet Union had their origins in the upheaval brought about by 
World War I. The forces of nationalism unleashed by the war, combined with 
the need to respond politically to the global depression that followed World 
War I, created fertile ground for strong nationalistic rulers who could rise to 
political power and address ethnic conflict.
A Historian’s View  American historian and journalist William Shirer 
identified the origins of Nazism in Germany’s distant and distinctive past. He 
concluded that Germanic nationalism, authoritarianism, and militarism dated 
back to the Middle Ages. “The course of German history . . . ,” he wrote, 
“made blind obedience to temporal rulers the highest virtue of Germanic man, 
and put a premium on servility.” No other country developed the same sort of 
Nazism because no country had Germany’s past.
A Sociologist’s View  American sociologist Barrington Moore looked to 
the past to explain totalitarianism. However, rather than focus on what made 
each country unique, he searched for patterns in the social structures of groups 
of countries. In his book 6ocial 2rigins of 'ictatorship and 'emocracy  
166, Moore looked at why Great Britain, France, and the United States 
evolved into democracies, while Japan, China, Russia, and Germany evolved 
into dictatorships. For Moore, two vital steps in creating a democracy were 
developing a middle class and breaking the power of the landed aristocracy. 
Countries that failed to do these things were more likely to become dictatorships.
Develop an Argument :  Evaluate the extent to which historical evidence 
supports one of the perspectives on totalitarianism. 
 537
WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  WRITE  THE SUPP ORTING  PARAGRA PHS
The supporting paragraphs in your long essay will demonstrate your skill in 
using evidence. They will also demonstrate your ability to follow a reasoning 
process and develop a complex interpretation of the prompt.
Use of Evidence  Suppose your thesis is that imperialism and militarism 
are the two most significant causes of global conflict in the period 100 to the 
present. To earn any points, you need to provide two examples of evidence 
relevant to your thesis²that is, directly connected to your topic. For example, 
you might point out that imperialism caused conflict not only between 
competing empires but also between the imperialists and the native peoples 
whose land they colonized. You might also note that militarism fed nationalist 
competition and reduced the gravity of warfare in the eyes of the public. For 
both points of evidence, you would include specific examples.
However, to earn the maximum number of points, you need to show 
how your evidence supports your argument. For example, you would need 
to point out that because imperialism touched nearly every part of the globe 
and disrupted so many native peoples, it was a far more significant cause of 
global conflict than other causes, such as European alliances. You would use 
examples to show the breadth of imperialist reach and the smaller sphere of 
European alliances. You might explain in a second paragraph that militarism 
was such a significant cause of global conflict because it was the force that 
made imperialism possible. You might also provide examples of the increasing 
power of military technology to inflict harm. Using such terms as Eecause and 
for this reason  will help you link your evidence to your argument.
Historical Reasoning and Complexity Your supporting paragraphs also 
need to show that you have framed your argument with historical reasoning²
causation, continuity and change, or comparison. You can show this framing in 
your choice of key words as well as in the organization you use. For example, 
if you are comparing imperialism in Africa with imperialism in South America, 
you could organize your material so that you cover imperialism in Africa in one 
or more paragraphs and then move on to cover imperialism in South America, 
noting similarities and differences as you go. Or you might subdivide the topic 
of imperialism into such categories as its effect on social structures and its 
effect on economic matters and discuss both regions in each category. 
To earn the most points, however, your supporting paragraphs must 
demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development that is 
the focus of the prompt. You can show your complex understanding in many 
ways. You can explain both similarities and differences or address multiple 
causes and effects. You could make insightful connections across geographic 
areas and time periods. You could also use evidence from other sources to 
corroborate verify, qualify set limitations, or modify revise an argument 
that addresses the question. See Write as a Historian in Topic 8. for more on 
these uses of evidence.)

Kaiser to Tsar , July 28, 11 >this and the previous telegram crossed@: It 
is with the gravest concern that I hear of the impression which the action 
of Austria against Serbia is creating in your country. The unscrupulous 
agitation that has been going on in Serbia for years has resulted in the 
outrageous crime, to which Archduke Francis Ferdinand fell a victim. 
The spirit that led Serbians to murder their own king and his wife still 
dominates the country. You will doubtless agree with me that we both, you 
and me, have a common interest as well as all Sovereigns to insist that all 
the persons morally responsible for the dastardly murder should receive 
their deserved punishment. In this case politics plays no part at all.
On the other hand, I fully understand how difficult it is for you and your 
Government to face the drift of your public opinion. Therefore, with regard 
to the hearty and tender friendship which binds us both from long ago with 
firm ties, I am exerting my utmost influence to induce the Austrians to deal 
straightly to arrive to a satisfactory understanding with you. I confidently 
hope that you will help me in my efforts to smooth over difficulties that 
may still arise.
Kaiser to Tsar, July 2, 11: I received your telegram and share your 
wish that peace should be maintained. But as I told you in my first 
telegram, I cannot consider Austria’s action against Serbia an “ignoble” 
war. Austria knows by experience that Serbian promises on paper are 
wholly unreliable. . . . I therefore suggest that it would be quite possible 
for Russia to remain a spectator of the Austro-Serbian conflict without 
involving Europe in the most horrible war she ever witnessed.

the attention of your government to the danger 	 grave consequences 
involved by a mobilisation I said the same in my telegram to you. Austria 
has only mobilized against Serbia 	 only a part of her army. If, as it is now 
the case, according to the communication by you 	 your Government, 
Russia mobilizes against Austria, my role as mediator you kindly intrusted 
me with, 	 which I accepted at you>r@ express prayer, will be endangered

shoulders now, who have to bear the responsibility for Peace or War.
Kaiser to Tsar, July 1, 11: On your appeal to my friendship and 
your call for assistance began to mediate between your and the Austro-
Hungarian Government. While this action was proceeding your troops 
were mobilized against Austro-Hungary, my ally. Thereby, as I have 
already pointed out to you, my mediation has been made almost illusory .
I have nevertheless continued my action. I now receive authentic news 
of serious preparations for war on my Eastern frontier. Responsibility 
for the safety of my empire forces preventive measures of defence upon 
me. In my endeavours to maintain the peace of the world I have gone 
to the utmost limit possible. The responsibility for the disaster which is 
now threatening the whole civilized world will not be laid at my door. In 
this moment it still lies in your power to avert it. Nobody is threatening 
the honour or power of Russia who can well afford to await the result of 
my mediation. My friendship for you and your empire, transmitted to me 
by my grandfather on his deathbed has always been sacred to me and I 
have honestly often backed up Russia when she was in serious trouble 
especially in her last war.
The peace of Europe may still be maintained by you, if Russia will 
agree to stop the military measures which must threaten Germany and 
Austro-Hungary.

UNIT 8: COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION 545
UNIT 8:   Cold War and 
Decolonization
Understand the Context
The aftermath of the world wars provided the context for two developments 
in the late 20th century: the decline of colonial empires and the rise of a tense 
conflict between capitalist and communist states known as the Cold War. These 
conflicts became intertwined, resulting in numerous wars.
Decolonization  Against the backdrop of the world wars, nationalist 
movements in African and Asian colonies intensified. In the decades following 
World War II, colonies achieved independence through negotiation, and in 
some cases, armed struggle. The creation of independent states often resulted 
in population resettlements and challenges to inherited colonial boundaries. 
In newly independent states, as in more established states, governments 
actively promoted economic development. Movements to redistribute land 
and wealth gained support in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Some of these 
movements, such as the one in China, embraced a form of communism. Even 
after independence, connections between postcolonial states and former 
colonial empires continued through migration and economic relationships.
The Cold War  After World War II, with Europe weakened, the United 
States and the Soviet Union USSR emerged as competing superpowers. The 
resulting Cold War was a power struggle between capitalism and communism, 
expressed through competing military alliances, a nuclear arms race, and 
proxy wars in postcolonial states in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. 
While the Cold War heightened global tensions, movements advocating 
nonviolence and alternatives to the established order, such as the Non-Aligned 
Movement, also became influential. By the late 100s, Soviet economic 
and military stagnation and public discontent contributed to the collapse of 
communist governments in Eastern Europe and the end of the Cold War. 19002000 1950The Soviet Union refuses

5478.1
Setting the Stage for the Cold 
War and Decolonization
We would consider it our moral duty to lend all support to the ending of 
colonialism and imperialism so that people everywhere are free to mould 
their own destiny. 
—Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indian independence movement leader in the 1920s 
Essential Question:   What was the historical context for the Cold War  
after World War II?
After the global conflict of World War II, the largely unfulfilled hopes for 
greater colonial self-government after World War I were revived. Shastri’s 
anti-imperialist sentiments helped explain how global affairs changed after 
the war ended in 15. Colonies’ desire for independence became intertwined 
with a global ideological conflict between capitalist countries led by the 
United States and communist countries led by the Soviet Union.
Bringing the War to an End
During World War II, the leaders of Great Britain, the United States, and the 
Soviet Union, known as the Big Three , held several meetings to plan for the 
post-war world. Three of these were particularly important. 
The Tehran Conference  During the Tehran Conference  in Iran in 
November 1, the Allies agreed that the Soviet Union would focus on 
freeing Eastern Europe, while Britain and the United States would concentrate 
on Western Europe. In addition, Britain and the United States agreed to a 
Soviet demand to shift some Polish territory to the Soviet Union, which would 
be offset by Poland gaining territory elsewhere, mostly from Germany.
The Yalta Conference  By February 15, the Allies knew that Germany 
was near defeat, but they disagreed about what should happen after Germany’s 
surrender. At the Yalta Conference,  at a resort on the Black Sea, the leaders 
focused on plans for reconstructing Eastern Europe and for defeating Japan. 
• Franklin Roosevelt wanted free, democratic elections in Eastern 
Europe. He also wanted the Soviets to join the war against Japan. 
548 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• Stalin demanded influence over Eastern Europe. Fearful that another 
Napoleon or Hitler would invade Russia from the West, he wanted 
Eastern Europe as a buffer zone. In return for Soviet help against 
Japan, he wanted control of islands claimed by Japan, ports ruled by 
China, and part ownership of a Manchurian railroad.
Roosevelt thought that after years of overseas war, the American public 
was unlikely to support a war against the Soviets over the fate of democracy in 
Eastern Europe. The conference ended with a Soviet pledge to fight Japan, but 
the Soviets offered only vague assurances on free elections in Eastern Europe. 
The Potsdam Conference  The final meeting among leaders of the Big 
Three, the Potsdam Conference, began in July 15 in Germany. Harry 
Truman , who had become president after Roosevelt died on April 12, 
represented the United States. Churchill started the conference but lost his 
position as prime minister in mid-July and was replaced by Clement Atlee. 
Truman insisted on free elections in Eastern Europe. However, by then  
Soviet troops had occupied the region. Stalin refused Truman’s demand. With 
the backing of Soviet power, communists eventually gained control of East 
Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. 
By 15, the United States and the Soviet Union lacked trust in one 
another and had begun the aggressive rhetoric that would become standard 
for four decades following World War II. Potsdam and the earlier conferences 
failed to settle important issues between the world’s major powers. As a result, 
the stage was set for a cold war between countries still devastated by a hot war. 
Shifting Balance of Power
When the war ended in 15, parts of Europe and Asia had been devastated. 
The war resulted in 0 million to 60 million deaths. It destroyed factories, 
roads, bridges, and other structures needed for industrial production. It forced 
millions of people to move. Many were fleeing communism or searching for 
safety and opportunity. 
Massive Destruction in Europe  Wartime losses were not evenly 
distributed throughout Europe. In general, East and Central Europe suffered 
greater losses than did Western Europe. Worst hit were the Soviet Union, 
Poland, and Germany. Each lost between 10 and 20 percent of its population. 
Countries such as Great Britain and France, despite their losses, maintained 
strong traditions of democracy and the rule of law. They still had strong 
educational systems, including outstanding universities. They remained home 
to large, innovative corporations. These advantages provided the foundation 
for Western Europe to become a global leader after the war. However, because 
of the massive physical destruction and population loss in victorious and 
defeated nations, Europe became less influential and powerful in the rest of the 
world, while the United States and the Soviet Union became more powerful.

War I and World War II. See Topic .8.  
549 SETTING T HE STAGE FOR T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATIONThe U.S.-Soviet Rivalry  In 15, then, the United States was poised to 
become the most powerful country in the world. Of all the major countries 
involved in the war, the United States suffered the least. Heavy fighting 
occurred on U.S. soil, in the Philippines, but the U.S. mainland was 
untouched by attacks. Its industrial base and infrastructure not only remained 
intact but also grew stronger through government-funded military contracts. 
Further, the loss of life in the United States was far lower than in Europe. The  
relative prosperity of the United States allowed it to provide financial aid to 
European countries after the war. This aid program, called the Marshall Plan, 
is described in Topic 8.2.
The United States also had developed atomic weapons and used them 
during the war, making the country even more formidable. The Soviets 
successfully tested an atomic bomb of their own in 1. By the end of the 
10s, only the Soviet Union could challenge the United States in military 
might and political influence. 
Advances During the War  Military research at universities and in private 
companies, often funded by government, resulted in tremendous technological 
developments during World War II. Among the items that were developed 
for, improved, or used more widely by the military were air pressure systems 
for airplane cabins, refrigeration for food, stronger plywood for construction, 
and a variety of plastics for many uses. One of the most important advances 
was the spread of the use of penicillin, which saved the lives of thousands of 
wounded soldiers. Each of these advances would be adapted for civilian use, 
thereby improving the lives of millions of people. 
The Start of the Cold War
The U.S.-Soviet tensions evident at Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam made conflict   
likely. However, the high costs of the war meant that neither superpower 
wanted a full-scale war with the other. Rather, they settled into a cold war,  a 
conflict does not involve direct military confrontation between two or more 
rival states. The Cold War between the superpowers played out in propaganda 
campaigns, secret operations, and an arms race. 
The deadliest results of the Cold War occurred outside the lands of the 
two superpowers. The U.S.-Soviet rivalry led both countries to arm opposing 
sides in conflicts around the world, thereby transforming small civil wars and 
regional conflicts into much larger events. This increased the death tolls and 
level of destruction in these wars.
In the early 150s, the United States and Soviet Union each developed a 
hydrogen bomb  that was much more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped 
on Japan at the end of World War II. The arms race fostered close ties between 
the military and the industries that developed weapons. Before he left office in 
161, President Dwight Eisenhower  expressed his concerns about the U.S.-
Soviet competition for supremacy in nuclear armaments. He warned against 
allowing the military-industrial complex,  the informal alliance between the 
550 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONgovernment and the large defense contractors, to gain too much power. In later 
decades, citizens in many countries expressed similar worries. They began to 
protest the stockpiling of nuclear weapons.
Breakdown of Empires
After World War II, efforts resumed to undermine colonialism. The start of 
World War I had marked the high point of colonial empires. The British, the 
French, and other Europeans had colonized almost all of Africa, India, and 
Southeast Asia, and they dominated China. Empires based in Austria, Turkey, 
and Russia were multiethnic states, but each was dominated by one group, 
leaving others feeling discriminated against. After World War I, the demand for 
self-determination , the idea that each country should choose its own form of 
government and leaders, was spreading. The Austro-Hungary Empire and the 
Ottoman Empire crumbled, restructured into multiple new countries. However, 
in China, India, and throughout Africa, Europeans generally maintained their 
power, even expanding it over territories that had been part of the Ottoman 
Empire. 
During World War II, the leading colonial powers focused on stopping 
Hitler. As a result, the anti-colonial movements probably grew stronger, but 
actual independence made little progress. However, after World War II, the 
foundation was set for the dismantling of colonial empires: 
• In the colonized world, movements for self-determination grew. Often, 
they included both advocates of greater self-rule and proponents of full 
independence.
• World War II had so weakened Great Britain, France, and the other 
colonial powers that they had fewer resources to resist independence. 
• The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union gave 
anti-colonial activists two superpowers to recruit as supporters. 
The successful efforts of people to undermine colonial empires are described 
in Topics 8.5 and 8.6.

“On November 1, 152, the United States successfully detonated “Mike,” the 
world’s first hydrogen bomb, on the Elugelab Atoll in the Pacific Marshall 
Islands. The 10.-megaton thermonuclear device, built upon the Teller-Ulam 
principles of staged radiation implosion, instantly vaporized an entire island 
and left behind a crater more than a mile wide. The incredible explosive 
force of Mike was also apparent from the sheer magnitude of its mushroom  
cloud. . . . Half an hour after the test, the mushroom stretched 60 miles across, 
with the base of the head joining the stem at 5,000 feet.
Three years later, on November 22, 155, the Soviet Union detonated its 
first hydrogen bomb on the same principle of radiation implosion. Both 
superpowers were now in possession of the µhell bomb,’ as it was known by

8.2
The Cold War
Let us not be deceived—we are today in the midst of a cold war.
—Bernard Baruch, banker and presidential advisor, 1947
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the ideological  
struggle of the Cold War?
After World War II, the democratic United States and the authoritarian Soviet 
Union emerged as the strongest countries in the world. Both countries had 
expanded their territorial control and influence after the war. After the Potsdam 
Conference in Germany in 15, Truman and Stalin soon recognized their 
rivalry for dominance over Europe and Asia. The ideological conflict noted by 
Baruch, the power struggle between capitalism led by the United States and 
communism led by the Soviet Union, was the central global conflict over the 
next 0 years.
&RRSeUDWiRn'esSiWe&RnñicW7Ke8niWeG1DWiRns
Despite ideological differences, the Allies shared a commitment to building 
a new organization to promote peace and prosperity to replace the League of 
Nations. The League had failed for two significant reasons:
• It lacked the support of all the world’s powerful countries, particularly 
the United States.
• It lacked a mechanism to act quickly to stop small conflicts from 
escalating into large ones.
In 1, leaders of the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and 
China discussed the idea of the  United Nations (UN) . The UN was established 
in 15. Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the United Nations with the 
League of Nations. See Topics . and .5.
Rivalry in Economics and Politics
The existence of the United Nations did not prevent tensions from growing 
worse between the Soviet Union and the West. Winston Churchill’s March 
16 speech symbolized the Cold War. Churchill said that “an iron curtain has 
descended across the continent” of Europe. The metaphor of the Iron Curtain 
described the split between Eastern and Western Europe. 
555 THE COLD WARCapitalism and Communism  One difference between the United 
States and the Soviet Union was how they organized their economies. 
• In the United States, Western Europe, and other capitalist countries, 
economic assets, such as farms and factories, were mostly owned 
privately. Hence, private interests determined economic decisions. 
People had the freedom to act in their self-interest. 
• In the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and other communist 
countries, economic assets were owned by the government. The 
system emphasized equality and fairness. 
Democracy and Authoritarianism  A second difference was how 
the rivals organized their political systems. In the United States, people 
chose their elected leaders through free elections. Further, they relied on an 
independent press to provide accurate information about the government 
and political parties to compete for votes. In the Soviet Union, elections 
were not significant, the press was operated by the government, and a single 
party dominated politics.
Criticisms and Similarities  Each side pointed to what it saw as 
flaws in the other. In the United States, people attacked the Soviet system 
for restricting the rights of people to speak and worship freely, to elect 
their own representatives, and to allow businesses to operate efficiently. 
Soviets accused the United States of giving poor people the “freedom 
to starve” and for discriminating against African Americans and other 
minorities. The Soviet Union also stressed its emphasis on women’s 
equality as a difference between its system and that of the United States.
Despite the difference in the U.S. and Soviet models, some analysts 
emphasized their similarities. For example, in both, control of big economic 
decisions was in the hands of groups, either the government or millions of 
corporate shareholders. Further, both countries often acted out of fear of the 
other, which made the military a powerful force in each. 
&RnñicWsin,nWeUnDWiRnDl$σDiUs
Each side wanted to expand its system of thought throughout the world. 
This competition resulted in a long-running battle for influence over the 
opinions of people and alliance with governments. 
The USSR and Its Satellite Countries  The Soviets were determined 
to make the governments of Eastern Europe as much like the Soviet 
government as possible. They therefore directed the countries of Bulgaria, 
East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania to develop five-year 
economic plans focused on developing industry and collective agriculture 
at the expense of consumer products. All political parties other than the 
Communists were outlawed.
These actions allowed the USSR Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
to exploit the Eastern European nations to benefit the Soviets rather than 
556 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONto help those countries grow. The satellite countries —small states that 
are economically or politically dependent on a larger, more powerful 
state²were forced to import only Soviet goods and to export only to the 
Soviet Union. Moreover, the governments of these countries were just as 
dictatorial as the Soviet government. Connect: Create a graphic comparing 
Communist and earlier Western imperialism. See Topic 6.2.
World Revolution  Beginning with the October Revolution of 11, 
the Soviet Union viewed capitalism as a threat to its power. This view was 
enhanced with the concept of world revolution, a belief that organized 
workers would overthrow capitalism in all countries. The Soviets supported 
revolutions and uprisings between 11 and 12 in Germany, Bavaria, 
Hungary, northern Italy, and Bulgaria. Soviet interference elevated 
Western suspicions about Soviet intentions. After World War II, growing 
revolutionary feelings became a serious threat to Western powers and to 
governments in Central and Southern Europe. 
Containment  U.S. diplomat George .ennan worked in the U.S. 
Embassy in Moscow during the 10s and in 16. .ennan believed that the 
Soviet Union would continue to expand its borders and its influence abroad 
if it could. He advocated a policy of containment ²not letting communism 
spread farther. Some politicians criticized .ennan for accepting the status 
quo. They argued for a more aggressive policy of overthrowing existing 
regimes in order to “roll back” the spread of communism.
Truman Doctrine  .ennan’s reports influenced President Harry 
Truman. A speech in 1 outlined the Truman Doctrine , a strong statement 
that the United States would do what it had to do to stop the spread of 
communist influence, specifically in Greece and Turkey. The Soviet Union 
wanted to put military bases in Turkey so it could control the Dardanelles, 
the strait between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. In Greece, left-
wing groups controlled by Communists were close to gaining control of the 
government. Truman pledged U.S. economic and military support to help 
the two countries resist this communist domination.
The Marshall Plan  After World War II, the United States was deeply 
concerned about rebuilding Europe. The United States provided assistance to 
those countries soon after the war ended. However, many U.S. leaders thought 
more was needed to get European allies back on their feet economically. 
Based on the belief that a communist revolution could happen in economically 
unstable nations, the new goal was to rebuild Europe into a prosperous and 
stable region. The Marshall Plan,  enacted in June 1, was designed to 
offer 12 billion in aid to all nations of Europe, including Germany. This 
money would be used to modernize industry, reduce trade barriers, and 
rebuild Europe’s damaged infrastructure. The plan worked. Economic output 
in the countries aided was 5 percent higher in 151 than it had been in 18.
The Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites refused to 
participate in the plan. Instead, in 1, the Soviets developed their own 
557 THE COLD WARplan to help rebuild Eastern Europe²the Council for Mutual Economic 
Assistance (COMECON) . The scope of the organization was narrower 
than that of the Marshall Plan. It was limited primarily to trade and credit 
agreements among the six members. Its impact was modest compared to the 
Marshall Plan.
The Space Race and the Arms Race 
Space Race  In 15, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, 
called Sputnik , into orbit around Earth, inaugurating what become known as 
the Space Race . The United States launched its first satellite in January 158. 
The two nations competed to become the first with a manned satellite orbiting 
Earth and, later, the first to land a human on the moon.

and Space Museum. Source:  Wikimedia Commons
Launch of first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, on 
January 1, 158. 
Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD)  Early in 15, the Soviets tested 
the first intercontinental ballistic missile  ICBM capable of delivering a 
nuclear warhead into U.S. territory. The United States tested a similar missile 
later that same year. Both countries realized that they had become so powerful 
that they had reached a point of mutual assured destruction . That is, regardless 
of who started a war, both would be obliterated by the end of it. Since neither 
side could win a nuclear war, neither side had an incentive to start one. As long 
as both sides kept improving their technology, the balance of terror between 
them would keep the peace²everyone hoped.
The Non-Aligned Movement
Many new African and Asian countries wanted to stay out of the U.S.-Soviet 
Cold War. They wanted an alternative framework for international economic, 
political, and social order²one not dominated by the two superpowers. In 
558 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION155, Indonesia hosted a conference, known as the Bandung Conference after 
the city where it was held, for representatives of these countries. Delegates from 
China, India, and 2 other countries²representing more than half the world’s 
population²passed resolutions condemning colonialism. The impulse that 
prompted the Bandung Conference led countries to formally organize the Non-
Aligned Movement in 161. However, non-aligned countries faced challenges:
• Member states tried to combine support for stronger international 
institutions with efforts to advance their own interests. For example, 
Indian leader Jawaharlal Nehru supported a stronger UN, but he 
opposed its efforts to intervene in the conflict between India and 
Pakistan over control of the region of .ashmir. 
• Member states often became more closely allied with one superpower 
or the other. When war broke out between Somalia and Ethiopia in 
1, the Soviet Union supplied aid to Ethiopia, prompting the United 
States to supply aid to Somalia.

561 THE COLD WARTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   EXPLAIN  THE HISTORICAL  SITUATION  OF 
THE “RED SCARE ”
Communists are sometimes called “reds.” A “red scare” is a period 
during which non-Communists are especially fearful and suspicious 
that Communists are plotting a takeover, often through infiltrating 
government institutions. A red scare happened in the United States in 
the years after World War II. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin 
became the leading voice for hunting down Communist spies and 
infiltrators. He made unfounded allegations against politicians and 
hundreds of civilians, suspecting them of being Communists and 
Soviet spies. In Wheeling, West 9irginia, on February , 150, 
Senator McCarthy gave an infamous speech proclaiming that he had 
a list of members of the Communist Party who were in the U.S. State 
Department.
“The reason why we find ourselves in a position of impotency is not 
because our only powerful potential enemy has sent men to invade 
our shores . . . . but rather because of the traitorous actions of those 
who have been treated so well by this Nation. It has not been the less 
fortunate, or members of minority groups who have been traitorous 
to this Nation, but rather those who have had all the benefits that the 
wealthiest Nation on earth has had to offer . . . . the finest homes, 
the finest college education and the finest jobs in government we can 
give. 
This is glaringly true in the State Department. There the bright young 
men who are born with silver spoons in their mouths are the ones 
who have been most traitorous . . . I have here in my hand a list of

;he only thing that kept the *old >ar cold was the mutual deterrence aќorded 
by nuclear weapons.
—Chung  4ong-joon,  South 2orean politician  and business  leader, 2013
Essential Question:  In what ways did both the Soviet Union and the United 
States seeR to maintain influence  during the Cold War?
With the start of the Cold War, new military alliances for mutual protection 
formed in different parts of the world. The threat of nuclear war, as noted 
above by Chung Mong-joon, kept the United States and the Soviet Union from 
starting a war that could end in unprecedented global destruction. But proxy 
wars , such as the ones in .orea and 9ietnam, resulted in millions of deaths. In 
a proxy war, a major power helps bring about a conflict between other nations 
but does not always fight directly. These conflicts underlined the political and 
philosophical divide between the superpowers.
The superpowers faced off in Cuba and several other Central American 
countries as well as in the African country of Angola. The combination of 
military, economic, and nuclear influence across the globe made the world a 
tense place for decades after World War II²the war the two superpowers had 
worked together to end.
Allied Occupation of Germany
The conflict among the Allies after World War II was exemplified by the debate 
over how to occupy the defeated country of Germany. The Allies agreed to 
partition the country among France, Great Britain, the United States, and the 
Soviet Union. The three Western Allies wanted to combine their zones into one 
state under democratic principles.  
Berlin Blockade  The Allies also decided to divide Germany’s capital, 
Berlin, into four zones. The three Western zones would become a free city that 
was located within the Soviet zone of Germany. The Soviets wanted to stop 
these Western plans and control all of Berlin. They set up a blockade of the 
Western zones in Berlin to prevent the West from moving supplies into the area 
by land. The Western Allies did not want to risk a military confrontation with 
the Soviets and ultimately began the Berlin Airlift . Through this operation, 
563 EFFECT S OF T HE COLD WARthe Allies flew supplies into Western zones between February 18 and May 
1, when the Soviets lifted the blockade. 
Two Germanys  After the blockade ended, Germany split into two states. 
West Germany became the Federal Republic of Germany. East Germany 
became the German Democratic Republic. The division of Europe into East 
and West was complete. 
Berlin Wall  As citizens of East Germany saw the prosperity and 
democratic lifestyle of West Germany, many wanted to move to the West. 
Between 1 and 161, about 2.5 million East Germans fled.
However, the East German and Soviet governments were determined to 
keep people in East Germany. They knew that the exodus to the West reflected 
poorly on the communist system, and it was hard on their economy. They 
first set up barbed-wire fences patrolled by guards along the perimeter of East 
Germany and between East and West Berlin. In August 161, they began 
replacing the fences in Berlin with a wall, which became known as the Berlin 
Wall . Between 161 and 18, when the Berlin Wall fell, soldiers killed about 
150 people as they tried to escape over it.
NATO, the Warsaw Pact, and Other Alliances
Only a few years after World War II ended, the Soviet Union dominated the 
Eastern European countries they had occupied during the war. Communist 
governments in those countries²buoyed by support and the direct influence 
of Stalin²subjected their people to the same suppression and economic 
system as the Soviet Union. Many Western European countries feared such a 
dominant communist presence on their doorstep. 
Out of a desire to coordinate their defenses in case of a conflict with 
the Soviets, several Western nations created the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO)  in April 1. The treaty pledged mutual support 
and cooperation within the alliance against conflicts and wars. Its original 
members were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Iceland, 
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United States. 
Membership in this Brussels-based organization expanded considerably in the 
decades after its founding.
The Soviet Union’s response to NATO was the Warsaw Pact , created 
in 155. Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, 
Romania, and the Soviet Union were the original members. Warsaw Pact 
nations combined their armed forces and based their army leaders in Moscow, 
the capital of the Soviet Union. These nations were known as the communist 
bloc.
Two countries with communist political systems successfully resisted 
Soviet control. Albania, located next to Greece, joined the Warsaw Pact but 
withdrew in 168. It became more closely tied to China. Yugoslavia, under the 
authoritarian leadership of Marshall Josip Broz Tito, never joined the Warsaw 
564 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONPact. In the 10s, ethnic divisions caused Yugoslavia to break apart into 
several countries, including Slovenia, Serbia, and Croatia.
Other treaty organizations formed in an attempt to halt the spread of 
communism in other regions:
• In 15, Australia, France, Great Britain, New =ealand, Pakistan, the 
Philippines, Thailand, and the United States formed the Southeast 
Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) . 
• The Central Treaty Organization (CENTO)  was an anti-Soviet 
treaty organization formed by Great Britain, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and 
Turkey to prevent the spread of Communism in the Middle East. The 
United States was not a full member, but it joined CENTO’S military 
committee. 
During the Cold War, the United States formed alliances with more than 0 
states. It was sometimes easier for the United States to influence and negotiate 
through these smaller alliances than through the United Nations.
Proxy Wars
The ideological Cold War was accompanied by hot wars in Asia, Africa, Latin 
America, and the Caribbean. They were called proxy  wars  because the armies 
of smaller countries were proxies, or stand-ins, for the two superpowers. These 
wars often combined specific local issues, such as a battle against colonialism 
or for land reform see Topic 8., with the international conflict over the 
spread of communism. Though proxy wars occurred in small countries, some 
resulted in millions of deaths. 
Two of the biggest confrontations were the .orean War and 9ietnam War 
in Asia. In both instances, the countries were split into northern and southern 
sections. In both countries, a communist government ruled the northern section. 
Korean War  Just as the victorious powers divided Germany after World 
War II, they also divided the .orean Peninsula. The Soviets occupied the north 
while the United States and its allies occupied the south. The Korean War  
150±15 began when North .orea invaded South .orea in an attempt to 
reunite the country under its leadership. In response, the UN voted to defend 
South .orea militarily. The Soviet Union could have vetoed the resolution, 
but its representative was absent during the vote because the Soviet Union was 
boycotting all Security Council meetings in protest over a disagreement about 
China’s seat on the Security Council.
UN military forces supporting the South .oreans came from 16 member 
countries, but the United States provided the largest number and the overall 
commander, General  Douglas MacArthur . The Soviet Union did not send 
troops, but it sent money and weapons to North .orea. The UN forces pushed 
back the North .oreans across the inter-.orean border and drove toward 
North .orea’s border with China. The Chinese, allies of North .orea and 
concerned that the UN forces would try to invade China as well, sent Chinese 
565 EFFECT S OF T HE COLD WARtroops across the border and entered the war against the United States and its 
allies. After three years of fighting and some four million civilian and military 
casualties, the war ended in a stalemate. The two parts of .orea remained 
divided, with a demilitarized zone in between. 
Vietnam War  U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, following the 
Truman policy of containment, sent military advisers to South 9ietnam to 
train the South 9ietnamese army and to prevent a communist takeover by 
North 9ietnam. Eisenhower’s successor, President John F. .ennedy, increased 
the number of advisers from 1,000 to 16,000. Some U.S. citizens believed 
America could not afford to lose a confrontation in 9ietnam. They thought a 
communist victory would weaken U.S. prestige around the world. 
However, the United States was supporting an undemocratic and 
unpopular South 9ietnamese ruler, Ngo Dinh Diem. In 16, Buddhist monk 
Thich Quang Duc publicly set himself on fire in Saigon to protest the South 
9ietnamese government’s favoring of Catholics over Buddhists. His protests 
inspired others. A military coup, with U.S. support, soon overthrew Diem. 
In 16, President Lyndon Johnson  sent more U.S. troops to South 
9ietnam. Johnson believed in the domino theory  —the idea that if one 
country in the region became communist, other countries would soon follow. 
Johnson feared that China and the Soviet Union would bring all of Southeast 
Asia under communist rule. Connect: Trace foreign intervention in Southeast 
Asian affairs through the 9ietnam War. See Topic 6.2.
The Bay of Pigs Crisis  Fidel Castro and other communist revolutionaries 
overthrew the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista in 15. Castro soon set up 
a dictatorship in Cuba. On August 6, 160, the new government started to 
nationalize foreign-owned industries, which was a common communist 
strategy. Cuba nationalized businesses and properties of the national telephone 
and electricity companies Texaco, Esso, and Sinclair oil companies and 6 
sugar mills owned by U.S. firms. As a result of these economic losses for its 
citizens, the United States broke off trade with Cuba and cut diplomatic ties. 
Castro in turn accepted Soviet aid and aligned Cuba’s foreign policy with that 
of the Soviet Union. 
In 161, newly elected U.S. President John F. Kennedy  had grave 
concerns about the presence of a communist country located only 0 miles 
from the coast of Florida. Before .ennedy took office, a group of Cuban exiles 
who opposed Castro had asked for U.S. government backing to invade Cuba 
and overthrow Castro. .ennedy gave his support. The resulting Bay of Pigs  
invasion was a total failure. Even worse for the United States, it cemented the 
Cuba-Soviet alliance.
The Cuban Missile Crisis  In response to the Bay of Pigs, the Soviets 
began to support Cuba with arms and military advisors. Soviet Premier Nikita 
Khrushchev , who came to power after Stalin, saw an opportunity in Cuba. 
In 162 he shipped nuclear missiles to Cuba. .hrushchev felt justified in his 
actions because in the summer of 161 the United States had placed nuclear 
missiles in Turkey, a U.S. ally that shared a border with the Soviet Union. 
566 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn October 162, U.S. intelligence learned that more missiles were on their 
way to Cuba. .ennedy ordered the U.S. Navy to prevent the missiles from 
reaching Cuba. He called his action a “quarantine” because a blockade was 
technically an act of war. Regardless of the term, the two superpowers were on 
a collision course that threatened nuclear war. 
Ultimately, the two leaders pulled back from the brink. .hrushchev 
called back the Soviet ships and removed the missiles that had been delivered 
to Cuba. In return, the United States pledged to quietly remove its missiles 
from Turkey. After this incident, leaders of both countries realized that better 
communication between their countries was needed. In 16, the two countries 
set up a Hot Line , a direct telegraphteleprinter link between the U.S. and 
Soviet leaders’ offices.
Test-Ban Treaty  People worldwide worried about deaths and 
environmental harm from nuclear war or nuclear testing. In 16, the Soviet 
Union, the United States, and more than 100 other states signed the Nuclear 
Test-Ban Treaty . France and China did not sign it. This agreement outlawed 
testing nuclear weapons above ground, underwater, and in space. The goal was 
to cut down the amount of radiation that people would be exposed to as a result 
of weapons testing. Underground testing remained legal. In 168, the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty called on nuclear powers to prevent the spread of 
military nuclear technology and materials to non-nuclear countries.
Angola  The Portuguese colony of Angola in southwest Africa won its 
independence in 15, after 1 years of armed struggle. Like the 9ietnamese, 
the Angolans had to fight a war to end their colonial status. 
However, Angola faced greater ethnic conflict than did 9ietnam. The 
borders of Angola, like those of many newly independent African countries, 
had been set by European colonial powers with little regard for traditional Source:  CIA 162

567 EFFECT S OF T HE COLD WARregions. Rival ethnic groups were thrown together under one government. 
Angola was more a multiethnic empire consisting of three distinct cultural 
groups than a nation-state in which everyone shared a common culture. Each 
group had fought for independence. Each wanted to control the country’s 
lucrative diamond mines. And each was supported by other countries:
• The USSR and Cuba backed the Mbundu tribe.
• South Africa backed the Ovimbundu tribe.
• The United States backed the Bankongo tribe.
Upon independence, civil war broke out. In 2002, after 2 years of fighting, 
the rivals agreed on a cease-fire. However, threats of violence from militant 
separatist groups remained.
Contra War  In Nicaragua in 1, the -year dictatorship by the Somoza 
family was ended by the rebel Sandinistas, who called themselves socialists. 
Two years later, conservative opponents of the Sandinistas, known as Contras, 
tried to overthrow them. From 181 to 188, the Contra War gripped the 
country. Wanting to isolate the Sandinistas, the United States heavily backed 
the Contras with covert support. The Contra War took the lives of tens of 
thousands of Nicaraguans. The war ended after the signing of the Tela Accord 
in 18 and the demobilization of the Contra and Sandinista armies. 
Antinuclear Weapon Movement  
The nuclear arms race spawned a reaction known as the antinuclear weapons 
movement . One of the first such movements developed in Japan in 15 in 
opposition to U.S. testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific Ocean. In 155, 
more than one-third of Japan’s population signed a petition against nuclear 
weapons. In the late 10s and early 180s, the antinuclear weapons movement 
expanded to other countries, particularly to the United States and Western 
Europe. On June 6, 182, some one million people demonstrated in New York 
City against the creation, buildup, and possible use of nuclear weapons.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“The epitaph for the disastrous April 1±1, 161, attempt to overthrow 
communist dictator Fidel Castro by invading Cuba with 1,500 amateur 
soldiers and a handful of piston-engined B-26 ground-attack bombers was 
spoken soon afterward by President John F. .ennedy. µHow could I have 
been so stupid"’ he asked an aide.
A better question might have been, How could the Central Intelligence Agency 
have bungled things so badly" The answer is that the CIA²which planned the 
operation, trained its participants and helped execute its amphibious landings 
and air strikes²performed more amateurishly than the Cuban invaders. But 
the agency’s senior leaders were so enamored of the plan they ignored its 
obvious flaws. Worse, two presidential administrations, numerous legislators, 
and plenty of smart generals and admirals also signed off on the scheme.
Rebel troops and tanks began landing early on April 1. By the evening of 
April 1 the invasion brigade had been crushed by Castro’s armor, heavy 
artillery and small but unopposed air force, which included four Lockheed 
T- jet trainers that, much to the CIA’s surprise, were fitted with weapons.
The end result of the ill-fated expedition included 11 men of Brigade 2506 
killed and more than 1,200 captured. In those years before 9ietnam some 
observers called the Bay of Pigs the worst defeat suffered by the United 
States since the War of 1812.”

The road after the revolution will be longer, the work greater and more arduous. 
—4ao Aedong, 1949 
Essential Question:   How did communism  and land reform affect China and 
other countries?  
The Cold War provided the context in which many countries wrestled with 
the legacies of their past. The combined heritage of feudalism, capitalism, 
and colonialism often resulted in societies with a small class of powerful 
landowners and a large class of peasants who owned little or no land. When 
socialists or communists sought to make more people into landowners, they 
got caught up in the U.S.-Soviet ideological battle. Land reform  was a vital 
issue in China, Iran, 9ietnam, Ethiopia, India, and a number of Latin American 
countries, including Mexico, Bolivia, and 9enezuela. 
Communism in China
In China, the Communists and the Nationalists began fighting for control of 
the country in 12. However, after the Japanese invaded, the two sides agreed 
to focus on fighting them instead of each other. See Topic .5. 
Victory by the Communists  After the defeat of the Japanese in 15, 
the Chinese Civil War resumed. The Communists, led by Mao Zedong , won 
popular support because they redistributed land to peasants, opened schools 
and hospitals, and punished soldiers who mistreated civilians. Peasants saw 
the Communists as more nationalist and less corrupt than the Nationalists. 
In 1, the Communists defeated the Nationalists and set up the People’s 
Republic of China. Mao ordered the nationalization of Chinese industries 
and created five-year plans based on the Soviet model. Like the Soviets, the 
Chinese plans emphasized heavy industry instead of consumer goods. 
Great Leap Forward  In 158, China went through more land reform 
as part of the policy called the Great Leap Forward . Peasant lands were 
organized into communes , large agricultural communities where the state held 
the land, not private owners. Those who protested this policy could be sent to 
“reeducation camps” or killed.
572 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONEven though failing harvests caused severe food shortages, China 
continued to export grain to Africa and Cuba. Mao sought to convince the 
outside world of the success of his economic plans. Some 20 million Chinese 
died from starvation. By 160, the Great Leap Forward was abandoned.
Source:  Wikimedia Commons.
During the Great Leap Forward, 
China set up small-scale backyard 
steel furnaces. However, they 
produced steel of very poor quality, 
and the effort was dropped.
Cultural Revolution  In 166, Mao attempted to reinvigorate China’s 
commitment to communism, an effort called the Cultural Revolution . In 
practice, the Cultural Revolution silenced critics of Mao and solidified his hold 
on power. Its impact on China was similar to the impact of Stalin’s purges 
in the Soviet Union. Mao ordered the Red Guards , groups of revolutionary 
students, to seize government officials, teachers, and others and send them 
to the countryside for reeducation. Reeducation involved performing hard 
physical labor and attending group meetings where Red Guards pressured 
them to admit they had not been revolutionary enough.
Relations with the Soviets  Although China and the Soviet Union were 
both communist states, they were often hostile to each other. From 161 
onward, the two countries skirmished over their border. They also competed 
for influence around the world. For example, Albania, a Soviet satellite, took 
advantage of the split by allying with China against the Soviet Union, thereby 
receiving more autonomy and additional financial aid from China.
Turmoil in Iran
The modern country of Iran  fell under foreign domination in the late 1th 
century. Britain and Russia fought to control the area. The competition grew 
even keener when oil was discovered in Iran in the early 20th century .
)oreiJn ,nfluence  Early in World War II, the leader of Iran considered 
supporting Hitler’s Nazi regime. Determined not to let that happen, Russia and 
Britain invaded Iran. They forced the leader to abdicate power to his young 
573 SPREAD OF CO MMU NISM AFTER 1900 573son, Shah Muhammad  Reza Pahlavi . They kept their forces in Iran until the 
end of the war.
Iranian nationalists objected to the new shah as a puppet of Western powers. 
In 151, they forced him to flee the country. Two years later, Iran selected 
Mohammad Mosaddegh  as prime minister. He vowed to nationalize the oil 
companies. The United States and Great Britain engineered an overthrow of 
the democratically chosen Mosaddegh and returned the shah to power. The 
shah ran an authoritarian regime that relied on a ruthless secret police force.
Land Reform in the White Revolution  Despite his harsh rule, the 
shah instituted several progressive reforms, known as the White Revolution 
because they came without bloodshed. They included recognizing women’s 
right to vote, creating a social welfare system, and funding literacy programs 
in villages.
The most important reform dealt with land ownership. The shah wanted 
to undercut the power of traditional landowners and increase his popularity 
among peasants. Under his plan, the government bought land from landlords 
and resold it at a lower price to peasants. The program helped many peasants 
become first-time landowners, but it failed to reach a majority of peasants. 
Many Iranians²both landowners who had been forced to sell their land 
and frustrated peasants who received nothing²opposed the land reforms. 
Religious conservatives opposed modernizing the country, particularly 
changing the relationship between men and women. Advocates for greater 
democracy opposed the shah’s harsh rule. 
The Iranian Revolution  In 1, a revolution toppled the shah. Many 
Iranians supported the revolution because they vividly remembered the 
overthrow of the Mosaddegh government in 15. The leaders to emerge from 
the revolution, though, were ones who rejected the shah’s secular worldview 
for one that viewed Islam as a key part of the individual-state relationship. The 
new government was a  theocracy , a form of government in which religion 
is the supreme authority. The new government was headed by a cleric and 
a Guardian Council, a body of civil and religious legal experts who were 
responsible for interpreting the constitution and making sure all laws complied 
with shariah Islamic law. The clergy had the right to approve or disapprove 
anyone who ran for office. Iran opposed Western policies in the Middle East 
and the state of Israel. 
Land Reform in Latin America
Throughout Latin America, leaders saw the concentration of land ownership as 
a barrier to progress. Hence, as countries freed themselves from colonialism, 
they considered land reform. Mexico’s effort dates back to the 10s, but much 
of the land reform in Latin America took place in the 160s or later. 
Venezuela  In 9enezuela, for example, the government redistributed 
some five million acres of land. Some of the land was state-owned and not 
previously under cultivation, while other pieces of land were seized from large 
574 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONlandowners. The land reform, begun with a 2001 law, was not popular with the 
landowners who claimed that the state seized their property while it was under 
cultivation. Additional problems arose from illegal squatters who moved in to 
settle on lands that were not scheduled for land reform. Land reform efforts had 
political repercussions as well those who benefitted were more willing to vote 
for the government instituting the reforms, while those from whom land was 
confiscated tended not to support the states that seized it. Land reform in Latin 
America varied in its details in each country, shaped partly by environmental 
factors, partly by a legacy from colonialism, and partly by the ideology of the 
rulers instituting the reforms. 
Guatemala  A democratically elected government under Jacob Arbenz 
in the Central American country of Guatemala began efforts at land reform. 
Feeling threatened, the United Fruit Company lobbied the U.S. government to 
remove the Arbenz. In 15, he was overthrown. 
Source:  Diego Rivera, Glorious Victory,  15. Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow, Russia. Wikimedia Commons
The U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles called the overthrow of Guatemala’ s government a 
“glorious victory for democracy.” Diego Rivera used this phrase ironically for the title of his mural 
condemning the action. Rivera portrayed Dulles holding a bomb that featured the face of U.S. President 
Dwight Eisenhower.
Land Reform in Asia and Africa
Vietnam  During World War II, Japan occupied 9ietnam, which France 
still claimed as a colony. At the end of the war in 15, 9ietnam declared 
independence from Japanese and French control. 9ietnam was an agricultural 
society. A few people controlled most of the land. Communists vowed to seize 
land from the large landowners and redistribute it among the peasants. This 
pledge won them great support among peasants. When Communists took 
power in the north, they carried out their policies²sometimes violently. In 
South 9ietnam, the government was slow to implement land reform, which 
was one reason it remained unpopular.
575 SPREAD OF CO MMU NISM AFTER 1900 Ethiopia  Other than a short period from 16 to 11 when it was 
under Italian occupation, Ethiopia had remained an independent country, but 
it suffered problems similar to those of many colonies. During World War 
II, exiled Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie  returned to power. He aligned the 
country with the western powers after the war, and Ethiopia enjoyed economic 
success based largely on its coffee trade. This led to western-style political and 
cultural reforms. Selassie was unable to effectively implement land reforms 
in Ethiopia. By the 160s, the country was souring on his leadership. Many 
people saw him as a pawn of U.S. imperialism. 
In 1, a group of military and civilian leaders deposed Selassie. One 
of the primary figures was Mengistu Haile Mariam , an Ethiopian native 
and major in the military. He ordered the assassination of 60 former regime 
officials. The new government declared itself socialist and received aid and 
weapons from the Soviet Union and other communist countries. Famine, failed 
economic policies, and rebellion marred Mengistu’s leadership. By 11, he 
had resigned and fled to =imbabwe.
India  Southern Asia had been under British rule since 1858. That changed 
in 1. Mahatma Gandhi had led the independence movement against England 
since the 120s, but it wasn’t until after World War II that India became 
independent. India was partitioned in 1, creating two countries: Pakistan 
and India. Pakistan was overwhelmingly Muslim, and India was largely Hindu. 
Both countries struggled to establish their new relationship and economies. 
India undertook economic reforms. It instituted land reforms and tried to 
redistribute some land to the landless, abolish the overwhelming power of rent 
collectors, protect land renters, and promote cooperative farming. The results 
were mixed. However, in .erala, a series of policies had some success: 
• 160: The state passed land reform, but they were overturned by courts.
• 16: Tenant won the right to purchase land from landowners.
• 16: New laws allow tenants to become full owners of land.
• 1: Laws provide for fixed hours of work and minimum wages.
Despite the popularity of the land reform program, the Indian central government 
took direct rule of .erala in order to slow down or reverse the program.

DECOLONIZATION AFTER 1900 579
8.5
Decolonization after 1900
From its inception, South Vietnam was only considered to  
be an outpost in the war against communism. 
—Nguyen  Cao 2y (1930–2011)
Essential Question:  How did people pursue independence after 1900?
In the 20th century, nationalist groups and leaders challenged colonial rule 
not only through land reform but also through political negotiation, as in India,  
and armed struggle, as in Angola See Topic 8.. Struggles for independence 
after World War I and the failure of many independence movements added 
to anticolonial sentiments during World War  II. Empires became politically 
unacceptable. European powers struggled to hold onto their colonies. Notions 
of freedom born of World War II rhetoric helped speed up decolonization. 
That process coincided with the Cold War and the development of the United 
Nations. Nguyen Cao .y, a South 9ietnamese military and political leader, 
noted above that his country’s war was part of the Cold War.
Movements for Autonomy: India and Pakistan
The drive for Indian self-rule began in the 1th century with the foundation of 
the Indian National Congress. Its leader in 120 was Mohandas Gandhi. Hindu 
and Muslim groups, united by their desire to get rid of the British, supported 
the independence movement in South Asia. The National Congress’s tactics 
included mass civil disobedience, and it remained a powerful governmental 
force after Indian independence. The Muslim League , founded in 106, 
advocated a separate nation for Indian Muslims.
Not all Indian leaders agreed with Gandhi’s nonviolent, noncooperation 
movement or his call for unity between Muslims and Hindus. However, 
they put aside their differences until after World War II. Then leaders again 
demanded independence. 
After the war, Britain grew weaker as India’s fighting abilities grew 
stronger. When Britain failed to follow through on promises for more rights 
for Indians, Indian people increased their protests for full independence from 
British rule. The Royal Indian Navy Revolt in 16 was instrumental in 
bringing Britain to the realization it could no longer rule India. As a result of 
580 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONeconomic pressures from India and from its own sluggish postwar recovery, 
Britain was ready to negotiate independence in South Asia. 
'iYision anG Conflict  Muslims feared living in an independent India 
dominated by Hindus. Distrust between Muslims and Hindus dated back 
centuries to the 8th century, when Muslims invaded Hindu kingdoms in 
northern India. Muslims campaigned for an independent Muslim country²
Pakistan. India and Pakistan both gained independence in 1 . 
Decolonization in Ghana and Algeria
Britain agreed to negotiate independence for its West African colony of the Gold 
Coast, just as it had for its colonies in South Asia. The Gold Coast combined 
with the former British Togoland to form Ghana, the first sub-Saharan African 
country to gain independence in the 20th century. The new country of Ghana 
was smaller in area than the historic kingdom of the same name. Negotiations 
led by the United Nations helped bring about Ghana’s independence in 15. 
Its first president, Kwame Nkrumah , took office in 160. 
Ideas from modern nation-states influenced Ghanaian nationalism. 
Nkrumah emulated nationalistic traditions he learned during his time in the 
United States and Britain. For example, Nkrumah constructed a national 
narrative that centered on having a historical past of glory and rich tradition, 
founding fathers, a currency, a flag, an anthem, museums, and monuments. He 
was responsible for numerous public works and development projects, such

581 DECOLONIZATION AFTER 1900 581as hydroelectric plants. However, some critics accused him of running the 
country into debt and allowing widespread corruption²an economic pattern 
that often happened in later African dictatorships. In 16, Nkrumah claimed 
dictatorial powers when the voters agreed to a one-party state , with him as 
party leader.
Nkrumah strongly advocated Pan-Africanism, a term with multiple 
meanings. In the 1th century, American and British abolitionists called their 
plans to return freed men and women to their homes in Africa Pan-Africanism 
or Africa for Africans. The country of Liberia was founded on this vision. In 
the second half of the 20th century, for some Africans, the term Pan-Africanism 
meant a celebration of unity of culture and ideas throughout the continent. 
These Pan-Africanists rejected intervention by former colonial powers. 
In keeping with his vision of Pan-Africanism, Nkrumah founded the 
Organization of African Unity (OAU)  in 16. However, three years later, a 
military coup overthrew Nkrumah’s government and expelled many foreigners 
from the country. Not until 2000 would Ghana witness a peaceful transfer of 
civilian power from one elected president to another.
Algeria  In northern Africa, the French colony of Algeria endured far 
more violence than Ghana before becoming independent. Mounting social, 
political, and economic crises in Algeria resulted in political protests. The 
French government responded with restrictive laws and violence.
Many Algerians, driven by feelings of nationalism, campaigned for 
independence after World War II. The Algerian War for Independence  began 
in 15, and it involved many groups. Because so many French people lived 
in Algeria as settlers, the French government considered Algeria a part of 
France and was adamant that it could not become a separate country. The FLN 
National Liberation Front led the Algerian movement for independence. 
The FLN sought self-determination through guerrilla techniques against half 
a million French forces sent to Algeria. While French military casualties were 
relatively low, hundreds of thousands of Algerians died in the war, often in 
violent street-by-street battles. French historian Pierre 9idal-Naquet confessed 
that there were “hundreds of thousands of instances of torture” by the French 
military in Algeria. 
The Algerian conflict caused sharp divisions in France. The French 
Communist Party, powerful at the time, favored Algerian independence. 
9iolence broke out in cities throughout France. In 158, French President 
Charles de Gaulle  had a new mandate for expanded presidential power under 
the constitution of the new Fifth Republic. De Gaulle planned the steps through 
which Algeria would gain independence. He then went straight to the people 
of France and Algeria to gain approval of his plan in a referendum, thereby 
bypassing the French National Assembly. 
However, with the coming of independence in 162, war broke out again 
in Algeria. Thousands of pro-French Algerians and settlers fled the country. 
The influx of these refugees into France created housing and employment 
582 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONproblems as well as increased anti-immigration sentiment. 9iolence in Algeria 
left between 50,000 and 150,000 dead at the hands of FLN and lynch mobs. 
The first president of the new Algerian Republic was overthrown in 
165 in a military coup led by his former ally. The National Liberation Front 
continued in power under different leadership, making Algeria a single-party 
state for a number of years. The FLN maintained a socialist authoritarian 
government that did not tolerate dissent. Meanwhile, the government led a 
drive for modernization of industry and collectivization of agriculture.
Algerian Civil War  In 11, violence again surfaced in Algeria, this time 
in reaction to one-party rule. The Islamic Salvation Front won the first round 
in an election that was then canceled. A bloody Algerian Civil War  followed 
11±2002, during which the FLN continued in control. The army chose 
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in 1. In his second term, he attempted to 
be more inclusive of insurgents, although suicide bombings continued. In 
2011, the military state of emergency, in place since 12, was finally lifted in 
response to protests in the wake of major uprisings in nearby states, including 
Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.
Comparing Ghana and Algeria  Both Ghana and Algeria experienced 
growing pains under military rule. The main struggles were between those 
who favored multiparty states and those who favored single-party socialism. 
Ghana created a new constitution in 12, easing the transfer of power 
between elected governments. One point of national pride was that a Ghanaian 
leader, .ofi Annan, became UN Secretary General in 1. In Algeria, by 
contrast, religious tensions grew worse. As in other countries in North Africa 
and the Middle East, a growing right-wing Islamist movement that was willing 
to use violence challenged the power of mainstream Muslims. In 12, an 
Islamist assassinated Algeria’s president. As in Egypt and Turkey, the military 
responded by repressing Islamic fundamentalists. In 1, Algeria banned 
political parties that were based on religion.
Negotiated Independence in French West Africa
As Britain negotiated independence with its African colonies, France did the 
same with its colonies in French West Africa. These included Senegal, the 
Ivory Coast, Niger, Upper 9 olta, and other territories. France had controlled 
them since the late 1800s with small military forces. France used indirect rule, 
which relied on local chiefs, existing governments, and other African leaders 
to maintain stability. 
Over the years, France invested in West Africa, building railroads, 
advancing agricultural development, and benefitting in trade revenue that 
grew substantially. But by the mid-150s, various African political parties 
democratic, socialist, and communist and leaders arose in French West 
Africa. By 15, many of the French West African countries had negotiated 
their independence from France.
583 DECOLONIZATION AFTER 1900Nationalism and Division in Vietnam
World War II interrupted France’s long colonial rule in Indochina, but France 
reoccupied the southern portion of 9ietnam when the war ended. A bloody 
struggle began against the forces of Ho Chi Minh , the communist leader of 
North 9ietnam. He appealed to nationalist feelings to unite the country under 
a single communist government. 
France responded by attempting to reestablish its colonial rule, sparking 
a 9ietnamese war of independence that lasted until 15. The peace treaty 
split the country into North and South 9ietnam, with elections planned for 
156 that would reunite the country. However, many in South 9ietnam, along 
with the United States, opposed the Communists and feared Ho would win the 
election. No election took place. 
War broke out between the communist North and the South. U.S. military 
troops supported the South. South 9ietnamese who supported the Communists, 
known as Viet Cong , fought a guerrilla war against U.S. troops.
As the 9ietnam War worsened, American military involvement and 
casualties grew. In response, the antiwar movement became more vocal. 
President Richard Nixon began to withdraw U.S. troops in 11 the last 
troops left in 15. North 9ietnam quickly gained control of South 9ietnam. 
It is estimated that the 9ietnam War resulted in between one million and 
two million deaths, including about 58,000 Americans. It also destabilized 
Southeast Asia. Communists soon won control of Laos and Cambodia, but the 
spread of communism stopped there. 
Beginning in the 180s, 9ietnam introduced some market-based economic 
reforms. In following years, 9ietnam and the United States reestablished trade 
and diplomatic relations. Connect: Write an outline connecting 9ietnam’s 
fight for independence with the 9ietnam War. See Topics 6.2 and 8..
Struggles and Compromise in Egypt
Having long been under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt became 
a nominally independent kingdom in 122. However, the British retained some 
of the same treaty rights there that they had held under their mandate following 
World War I. A 16 Anglo-Egyptian treaty allowed more Egyptian autonomy. 
Still, it also allowed the British to keep soldiers in Egypt to protect the Suez 
Canal. The British army continued to influence Egyptian internal affairs. 
Nasser  Following World War II, Egypt became one of six founding 
members of the Arab League, which grew to 22 member states. In 152, 
General Gamal Abdel Nasser , along with Muhammad Naguib, overthrew 
the king and established the Republic of Egypt. Naguib became its first 
president Nasser its second. Nasser was a great proponent of Pan-Arabism, a 
movement promoting the cultural and political unity of Arab nations. Similar 
transnational movements would attempt to unite all Africans Pan-Africanism 
and all working people communism.
584 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONNasser’s domestic policies blended Islam and socialism. He instituted 
land reform, transforming private farms into socialist cooperatives that would 
maintain the existing irrigation and drainage systems and share profits from 
crops. He nationalized some industries and businesses, including foreign-
owned banks, taking them over and running them as state enterprises. However, 
Nasser touched off an international crisis when he nationalized the Suez Canal.
The Suez Crisis  Built by Egyptian laborers²thousands of whom died 
while working on the project²with money from French investment between 
185 and 186, the Suez Canal had been under lease to the French for 
 years. To the Egyptians, this lease symbolized colonial exploitation, which 
Nasser pledged to fight. In addition, the British owned interests in the canal, 
which they administered jointly with the French. In 156, Nasser seized the 
canal, and Israel invaded Egypt at the behest of Britain and France. The two 
European countries then occupied the area around the canal, claiming they 
were enforcing a UN cease-fire. However, the United States and the Soviet 
Union opposed British and French actions and used the United Nations to 
broker a resolution to the Suez Crisis .
The removal of foreign troops was followed by an agreement for the canal 
to become an international waterway open to traffic of all nations under the 
sovereignty of Egypt. The UN deployed peacekeepers to the Sinai Peninsula 
in Egypt. Britain, France, and Israel were not happy with the interference 
of the United States in the Suez Crisis, but U.S. efforts led to a peaceful 
compromise. The incident also was an example of a nation maintaining a non-
aligned position between the United States and the Soviet Union²the two 
superpowers in the Cold War. 
Independence and Civil War in Nigeria
The western African country of Nigeria, the most populous state on the 
continent, gained independence from Britain in 160. The Biafran Civil War  
began in 16 when the Igbos, a Westernized, predominantly Christian tribe 
in the southeastern oil-rich Niger River Delta area, tried to secede from the 
northern -dominated government. The Igbos sought autonomy because of 
targeted attacks against them by the Hausa-Fulani Islamic group in the north. 
They declared themselves an independent nation called Biafra. 
The Igbos’ secession movement failed, and Biafra ceased to exist when the 
war ended, in 10. Nigeria granted amnesty to a majority of Igbo generals, 
but civilian government did not return. A series of military coups with generals 
in command of the government continued until the 1 election of Olusegun 
Obasanjo, who presided over a democratic civilian government called the 
Fourth Republic of Nigeria.
In an effort to prevent tribalism from destroying the country, the 
government established a federation of 6 states with borders that cut across 
ethnic and religious lines. However, friction continued between Christian 
Yoruba, Igbo groups in the south, and Islamic groups in the northern states. 
585 DECOLONIZATION AFTER 1900The constitution of Nigeria permitted states to vote for a dual legal system of 
secular law and shariah. Eleven states voted for this option. In an additional 
effort to discourage ethnic strife, the constitution encouraged intermarriage 
among the ethnic groups.
Problems remained in the Niger River Delta, which had rich oil deposits. 
Citizens complained that the national government exploited oil resources 
without returning wealth to the region. Also, they contended that the oil 
companies had polluted their lands and rivers. Militants set fire to oil wells and 
pipelines in protest.
Canada and the “Silent Revolution” in Quebec 
Quebec is the largest of Canada’s provinces, and its history is deeply rooted in 
French culture. France’s North American colonial territory in the early 100s 
spanned from Quebec to the Gulf of Mexico. By the late 100s, England 
controlled what was called New France, beginning a cultural and political 
divide in Quebec. People in New France were mainly Catholic, while the 
English-speaking parts of Britain’s Canadian colony were mainly Protestant.
The Quebecois historically aligned themselves with France rather than 
England. Over the centuries, efforts to create a separate independent state have 
flared up²sometimes with violent results. The Quiet Revolution  of the 160s 
involved much political and social change in Quebec, with the Liberal Party 
gaining power and reforming economic policies that led to further desires 
for separation from the rest of British-controlled Canada. French Canadian 
nationalism expanded, and splinter groups adopted extreme tactics, including 
terrorist bombings that began in 16. Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, 
a native of Quebec, was able to preserve the country’s unity. Later, in 15, a 
referendum to make Quebec an independent nation failed by a narrow margin.

NEWLY INDE PENDENT STATE S589
8.6
Newly Independent States
0ndia is free but she has not achie]ed unity, only a fissured and broken freedom 
—Sri Aurobindo  (1872–1950)
Essential Question:  What political changes led to territorial,  demographic,  
and nationalist developments and the economic shifts that resulted?
As imperialistic powers handed over governmental control to their former 
colonies, they often created new states. Between 15 and 2000, the number of 
independent states in the world more than doubled, from approximately 5 to 
around 10. The boundaries of the new states often led to conflicts, population 
displacement, and resettlement. In India, as lamented by Sri Aurobindo, an 
Indian nationalist and philosopher, the country was partitioned into Hindu India 
and Muslim Pakistan. Later, Pakistan divided again, creating Bangladesh. In 
the Middle East, the newly created Israel displaced Palestinian residents. 
Newly independent countries often instituted strong policies to promote 
economic development. At the same time, migrants from the newly 
independent countries kept alive cultural and economic ties as they migrated 
to the colonizing countries, usually to the large cities.
Israel’s Founding and Its  
Relationships with  Neighbors
The Zionist movement originated in the 180s from reaction to the Dreyfus 
Affair. See Topic 5.1. Theodore Herzl, a Hungarian Jewish intellectual and 
journalist, used the affair as evidence that assimilation of Jews into European 
society was failing to provide safety and equal opportunity. At the First =ionist 
Congress in 18, he urged the creation of a separate Jewish state. 
Birth of Israel  =ionists hoped that the new state could be established in 
Palestine because that was where their ancestors had lived. In modern times, 
Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, and most of its inhabitants were 
Arabs who practiced Islam. In a new state, =ionists argued, Jews could be free 
of persecution. In 11, during World War I, the British government issued 
the Balfour Declaration, which favored the establishment in Palestine of a 
“national home” for the Jewish people. However, British Foreign Secretary 
Arthur James Balfour wrote that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice 
the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.”
590 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe situation was complicated because British officer T. E. Lawrence, 
known as “Lawrence of Arabia,” promised certain Arabs an independent state 
as well. The British Foreign Office hoped that Arabs would rise up against the 
Ottoman Empire, which would make it easier to defeat during World War  I. 
The Balfour Declaration promised civil and religious rights to non-Jews in 
Palestine, but the supporters of the Arabs did not trust the British. 
In 118, after World War I, Britain was given a mandate over former 
Ottoman lands in the Middle East. Soon =ionists began to immigrate to 
Palestine from Europe and from other Middle Eastern areas. As immigration 
increased, the Arabs in the area protested their loss of land and traditional 
Islamic way of life. 
World War II and the deaths of six million Jews in the Holocaust provided 
another impetus for Jewish immigration. The fate of the European Jews 
brought worldwide sympathy for the survivors. Britain, trying to hold the line 
on Jewish immigration in the face of Arab opposition, turned the matter over 
to the United Nations. As in India, leaders hoped that partition would bring 
peace and stability. In 18, after the UN divided Palestine into Jewish and 
Arab sections, the Jewish section declared itself to be a new country: Israel.
Multiple Wars  War broke out immediately between Israel, which had 
support from the United States, and the Palestinians, who had support from 
neighboring Arab countries. Arab forces from Syria, Jordan then called 
Transjordan, Lebanon, and Iraq invaded Israel. After several cease-fires, the 
Israeli army won, and an armed truce was declared. Immediately after the 
truce, about 00,000 Palestinians became refugees, living in camps near the 
Israeli border. Three other Israeli-Palestinian wars followed:
• In 156, Israel, with support from France and Great Britain, invaded 
Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, in part to liberate the Suez Canal, which the 
Egyptian government had nationalized under Gamal Abdel Nasser’s 
economic programs See Topic 8.5. Following international protests, 
Israel and its allied forces were ordered to withdraw from Egypt. 
• In the Six-Day War  of 16, Israel fought on three fronts at once. 
Israel gained the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank and East 
Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. 
• In the Yom Kippur War of 1, Israel repelled a surprise invasion by 
Egypt and Syria. 
Israeli-Egyptian Peace  After 0 years of conflict between Israel and 
its Arab neighbors, U.S. President Jimmy Carter mediated the Camp David 
Accords , a peace agreement between Prime Minister Menachem Begin of 
Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt. However, the Palestinians and 
several Arab states rejected the 1 peace treaty. The Palestinian Liberation 
Organization (PLO) and its longtime leader Yasser Arafat wanted the return 
of occupied lands and the creation of an independent nation of Palestine. 
591 NEWLY INDE PENDENT STATE S591Ongoing Violence  In the 21st century, the peace process became more 
complicated when the Palestinians split into two factions. The Fatah faction 
controlled the West Bank. The Hamas faction controlled Gaza. Security 
concerns led the Israeli government to implement tighter border controls on 
the West Bank and on Gaza. These controls, amounting to economic sanctions, 
severely restricted normal activity for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians 
and fomented anger. Israel further angered Palestinians by approving new 
settlements on lands it had occupied during previous wars, lands Palestinians 
considered theirs. 
Without a peace process, violence continued. Between 2000 and 201,  
over ,000 Palestinian and over 1,000 Israelis were killed. Many countries in 
the Middle East remained hostile to United States over its support of Israel.  1947UN Plan of Division for Palestine

0 50 Kilometers0 50 MilesCambodia Gains Independence and Survives Wars
After World War II, 9ietnam’s neighbor Cambodia pressured France to grant 
it independence in 15. Cambodia’s royal family continued to head the 
government and tried to maintain its status as a non-aligned nation during the 
first two decades of the Cold War. However, Cambodia was eventually drawn 
into the 9ietnam War.
Following the 9ietnam War, a communist guerrilla organization called 
the Khmer Rouge , under the leadership of Pol Pot, overthrew the right-wing 
government of Cambodia. Once in power, Pol Pot and the .hmer Rouge 
imposed a ruthless form of communism, following the Chinese model of 
“cultural revolution” that targeted intellectuals and dissenters. The slaughter 
592 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONand famine that followed took more than two million lives²about one-quarter 
of the country’s population. Mass graves of victims from the “killing fields” 
of Cambodia continued to be discovered in the countryside and jungles for 
decades afterward. Connect: Create a graphic organizer comparing the tactics 
of the .hmer Rouge under Pol Pot with that of Joseph Stalin. See Topic ..
In 1, 9ietnamese troops invaded Cambodia to support opponents of 
Pol Pot and the .hmer Rouge. At the end of the ensuing war, the 9ietnamese 
took control of the government in Cambodia and helped the country to regain 
some stability, even as some fighting continued and hundreds of thousands 
of refugees fled the country. In 18, 9ietnamese forces completed their 
withdrawal from Cambodia. A peace agreement reached in 11 allowed free 
elections, monitored by the United Nations. Prince Norodom Sihanouk became 
a constitutional monarch, and the country developed a democratic government 
with multiple political parties and aspects of a market economy.
India and Pakistan Become Separate Countries
In 1, the British divided colonial India into two independent countries: a 
mostly Hindu India and a mostly Muslim Pakistan. India’s population was 
about 10 times larger than Pakistan’s. In both countries, women had the right 
to vote. 
The partition of the colony was chaotic, and violence broke out along 
religious lines. At least 10 million people moved: Hindus and Sikhs fled their 
homes in Pakistan to resettle in India, and Muslims fled India for Pakistan. In 
the political turmoil, between 500,000 and one million people died.

593 NEWLY INDE PENDENT STATE SAfter partition, Pakistani-India distrust grew. While India became the 
world’s largest democracy, Pakistan had both elected leaders and authoritarian 
military rulers. Moderates in both countries confronted powerful conservative 
religious movements that opposed compromise with the other country . 
.ashPir Conflict  One persistent tension between India and Pakistan 
was over Kashmir , a border region in the mountainous north. At the time of 
partition, most people in .ashmir were Muslims, but its leader was a Hindu. 
Therefore, both Pakistan and India claimed .ashmir. At times the rivalry there 
broke out into armed conflict. The tension between the two countries became 
more significant after each began developing nuclear weapons. Eventually, 
India controlled about 5 percent of the .ashmir region, Pakistan controlled 
about 5 percent, and China controlled about 20 percent. 
Women Gain Power in South Asia
In some newly emerging countries, women became heads of state. Often, they 
replaced their fathers or husbands. In India and Pakistan, women won the right 
to vote in 1.
Sri Lanka  The world’s first female prime minister was Sirimavo 
Bandaranaike . She won that position in 160 in Ceylon later Sri Lanka. Her 
husband was assassinated in office in 15, and Bandaranaike ran for office to 
fill his seat. She continued her husband’s socialist economic policies. But in 
165, with a sagging economy, she was voted out of office. Five years later, 
she returned to power and instituted much more radical policies, including land 
reforms, restrictions on free enterprise, and a new constitution that changed 
the country’s name to Sri Lanka. While some of her reforms succeeded, the 
economy stalled again, and in 1, she was again voted out of office. 
Bandaranaike remained active in Sri Lankan politics. Her children became 
leaders as well. When her daughter Chandrika became the country’s first female 
president in 1, she appointed her mother again to the role of prime minister.  
India  In 166, two years after the death of India’s first prime minister, 
Jawaharlal Nehru, his only child, Indira Gandhi,  became India’s leader. She 
was not related to Mohandas Gandhi. She was underestimated at first but 
proved to be effective, distancing herself in some ways from her father’s old-
guard advisors and making political and economic moves to strengthen India’s 
economy. War with Pakistan took a toll on the economy, though India won the 
conflict with the help of military support from the Soviet Union. 
Indira Gandhi became a revered leader in India, though further economic 
strife would undermine her popularity in the ensuing years. High inflation and 
growing poverty threatened her rule. She declared a national emergency in 15 
and jailed many opposition leaders. Her 20-point economic program proved 
successful, alleviating inflation, reforming corrupt laws, and increasing national 
production. But some of her policies were unpopular with the people of India 
despite the economic gains. In 1, Gandhi lost in the elections. She returned 
to power as prime minister in 180 but was assassinated in 18.
594 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONPakistan  Pakistan elected Benazir Bhutto  prime minister in 188. Her 
father had also served as prime minister. She was the first elected female leader 
of a majority Muslim country. Bhutto struggled to improve Pakistan’s economy 
and reduce its poverty. Corruption charges dogged her and her husband. Bhutto 
won election to two nonconsecutive terms  and then went into exile from 1 
until 200. Shortly after she returned to Pakistan, an assassin killed her .
Tanzania Modernizes
Tanganyika gained its independence from Britain in 161, later becoming the 
United Republic of Tanzania. Its first president, Julius Nyerere , instituted 
African socialist political and economic ideas—summarized in the Arusha 
Declaration of 16. It was an egalitarian approach based on cooperative 
agriculture. Literacy campaigns, free education, and collective farming were 
key components of what Nyerere called ujamaa  Swahili for “familyhood”. 
He also advanced the country’s economic independence away from foreign 
aid. Economic hardships challenged Nyerere’s leadership for years, as did 
conflicts with Uganda and its leader Idi Amin. Though personally popular, 
Nyerere could not pull Tanzania out of poverty. He resigned the presidency in 
185 but remained an important social leader until his death in 1.
Emigration from Newer Countries to Older Ones
People from these newly independent countries sometimes moved to the former 
colonial powers. For example, large numbers of refugees and immigrants from 
Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh moved to London after the chaos of World 
War II and other conflicts. London was a metropole ²a large city of a former 
colonial ruler. Similarly, 9ietnamese, Algerians, and West Africans migrated 
to Paris and other cities in France, and Filipinos migrated to the United States. 
Many migrants found jobs in the medical field. Others worked on railroads, in 
foundries, and in airports. In this way, economic and cultural ties between the 
colonial power and newly independent countries remained strong.

Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“After four wars during 0 years, despite intensive human efforts, the Middle 
East, which is the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of three great 
religions, does not enjoy the blessings of peace. The people of the Middle East 
yearn for peace so that the vast human and natural resources of the region can 
be turned to the pursuits of peace and so that this area can become a model for 
coexistence and cooperation among nations«.
Peace requires respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political 
independence of every state in the area and their right to live in peace within 
secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force. Progress 
toward that goal can accelerate movement toward a new era of reconciliation in 
the Middle East marked by cooperation in promoting economic development, 
in maintaining stability and in assuring security.”

596 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONSHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“At the turn of the 160s . . . a state-sponsored agency that recruited workers 
from the French Antilles, and the lack of economic opportunities throughout 
sub-Saharan African nations spurred a large-scale working class labor 
migration to Paris. However, this postwar labor migration occurred in the 
midst of changing mentalité  attitudes. The attributes of colonialism had 
recently been challenged . . . .
However, when Antilleans >people from an archipelago in the Caribbean@ and 
sub-Saharan Africans migrated to France in the 160s, their former colonial 
status still determined their social conditions, especially in the labor and 
housing markets. As the Antillean writer Franooise Ega who lived in France 
during the period observes, µthe French government and society perceive all 
Polish people as agricultural workers, all Algerians as unskilled construction 
workers, and all Antillean women as maids.’ Although race, gender, and 
ethnicity structure the labor landscape, only offering people of African 
descent menial worker, household employee, or lower rank tertiary worker 
positions, Antilleans and sub-Saharan Africans had migrated to France 
with clear-cut professional goals they desired decent wages, congenial and 
respectful treatment, and the possibility of receiving a job promotion related 
to their hard work.”

Historical evidence can support, modify, or refute an argument or 
claim. In fact, evidence that can be used to support one argument might 
also be used to refute another. That flexibility of the historical record is 
partly why history is so reliant on interpretation. To appreciate the ways 
in which historical evidence relates to claims, complete the following 
activity on the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.
Carefully read each of the following statements. Then, for each one, 
develop a claim or argument that the statement supports. Develop a 
second claim that the same statement either modifies or refutes 
1. “We are not two nations. Every >Muslim@ will have a Hindu name if 
he goes back far enough in his family history. Every Muslim is merely 
a Hindu who has accepted Islam. That does not create nationality . . .  
We in India have a common culture. . . . When communal riots 
take place, they are always provoked by incidents over cows and 
by religious processions. That means that it is our superstitions that 
create the trouble and not our separate nationalities . . . We must not

. “Jinnah felt eclipsed by the rise of Gandhi and Nehru, after the 
First World War. In December, 120, he was booed off a Congress 
Party stage when he insisted on calling his rival “Mr. Gandhi” 
rather than referring to him by his spiritual title, Mahatma²Great 
Soul. Throughout the nineteen-twenties and thirties, the mutual 
dislike grew, and by 10 Jinnah had steered the Muslim League 
toward demanding a separate homeland for the Muslim minority of 
South Asia. This was a position that he had previously opposed. . . .

Global Resistance to Established 
Power Structures
>hat diќerence does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless, 
whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism 
or the holy name of liberty and democracy? 
—4ohandas  .andhi (189–1948)
Essential Question:   What were differing reactions  to e_isting power 
structures after 1900?
The conflicts of the 20th century affected newly independent states and long-
established ones. Some of the most successful challenges to existing order, 
such as the one led by Mohandas Gandhi, used nonviolence. Other movements, 
such as Shining Path in Peru, used violence against civilians to achieve political 
results. Some leaders, such as Francisco Franco in Spain, used the military to 
crush resistance. The military-industrial complex that President Eisenhower 
warned about took hold in other countries, as governments increased arms 
supplies and traded weapons with one another.
Nonviolent Resistance as a Path to Change
Despite the frequent wars and violent protests of the 20th century, movements 
around the world also used nonviolence to bring about political change. Three 
of these movements were particularly large and effective, in part because of 
their visionary leaders.
Mohandas Gandhi  Topic .5 described how Mohandas Gandhi led 
nonviolent marches, boycotts, and fasts to oppose British colonial rule in 
India. In 1, India became independent.
Martin Luther King Jr.   The most prominent of African American 
civil rights leaders in the United States in the 150s and 160s was a Baptist 
minister, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr . The civil rights movement 
used various tactics to achieve its goals:
• Court decisions, such as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 
Kansas , that banned forced racial segregation of schools in the  
United States  
600 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• A year-long boycott of public buses in Montgomery, Alabama  
155±156, which ended segregation in public transit 
• Massive marches, such as the 250,000-person March on Washington 
for Jobs and Freedom in 16 
These efforts provided the foundation for the movement’s biggest 
successes, such as the Civil Rights Act of 165, which is covered in Topic  .5.
Nelson Mandela  In South Africa, the white-minority government codified 
a system of racial segregation, called apartheid, into law in the 20th century. 
Leading the black resistance to apartheid was a socialist lawyer, Nelson 
Mandela  118±201. Though early in his life he sometimes supported 
sabotage and other forms of violence, he was known for leading nonviolent 
protests. The victory over apartheid is described in Topic .5.
Challenges to Soviet Power in Eastern Europe
In the 150s and 160s, reformers in Eastern European satellites of the Soviet 
Union sought to become less dominated by the Soviets. In most cases, the 
Soviets clamped down hard against dissent. 
Poland  In 156, Polish workers demonstrated against Soviet domination 
and demanded better living conditions. As a result, a new secretary of the 
Polish Communist Party, Wladyslaw Gomulka , came to power. He decided to 
pursue an independent domestic policy in Poland but continued to be loyal to 
the Soviet Union, allowing the continued presence of Soviet troops in Poland. 
The Soviet-established forced collectivization of farms ended at this time.
Hungary  In that same year, Hungarian protesters convinced the 
country’s political leader Imre Nagy to declare Hungary’s freedom from 
Soviet control and demand the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country. 
Nagy vowed to support free elections in which non-Communist parties 
would participate. He announced Hungary’s neutrality in the Cold War and 
the withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. Soviet leaders responded by invading 
Hungary, gaining control of Budapest in 156. The Soviets captured Nagy 
and executed him. Many Hungarians fled to the West as refugees.
Czechoslovakia  The reform movement in Czechoslovakia reached a 
peak in the Prague Spring  of 168. Alexander Dubcek , first secretary of the 
Communist Party, acceded to the demands of the Czech people by increasing 
freedom of speech and the press and allowing greater freedom to travel. He 
also agreed to make the political system more democratic.
As with Hungary, Soviet leaders feared the Prague Spring’s independence. 
Soon the armies of four Warsaw Pact nations crushed it. In 168, the Soviet 
Union used the Brezhnev Doctrine , named for then-Soviet leader Leonid 
Brezhnev, to justify its actions. This doctrine stated that the Soviet Union and 
its allies would intervene if an action by one member threatened other socialist 
countries. Connect: Explain the continuity or change between the Eastern 
European resistance movements in the 1th and 20th centuries. See Topic 6..
601 GLOBAL RE SISTANCE TO E STABLISHED POWER STRUCTURES6011968: The Year of Revolt  
Events in Czechoslovakia were just one of many upheavals in 168:
• In Yugoslavia. students marched against authoritarian government. 
• In Poland and Northern Ireland, people protested over religious issues.
• In Brazil, marchers demanded improvements in public education and 
fairer treatment of workers. 
• In Japan, students protested both university financial policies and 
government support for the United States in the war in 9ietnam. 
In many countries, protests took place on university campuses. Tensions 
started building up after World War II, when higher education had opened up 
for more people in Western society and facilities were crowded. As a result, 
discontent was high among the student population by the 160s, resulting 
in a call for university reforms. Student grievances mounted as civil rights, 
women’s rights, workers’ rights, and the war in 9ietnam commanded attention .  
Source:  Wikimedia Commons 
The student movement in Mexico was met by military resistance. Two months before the 
168 Olympics began in Mexico City, armored vehicles entered the city to suppress the social 
movement. 
France  In 168, the student movement reached epic proportions in Paris, 
France. Hundreds of thousands of students took to the streets, resulting in 
violence when police forces moved in. In sympathy, some 10 million French 
workers went on strike. It was the largest general strike in French history. 
President Charles de Gaulle called new elections in France and was able to 
remain in office when his party won. 
602 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe United States  In the United States, students and others demonstrated 
for rights for women and African Americans. However, the largest and most 
heated protests were against the country’s involvement in the war in 9ietnam. 
After members of the Ohio National Guard killed four unarmed students during 
an antiwar demonstration at Kent State University  on May , 10, students 
and faculty at hundreds of U.S. colleges and universities went on strike.
An Age of Terrorism 
In the post-Cold War period, large-scale open conflict between sovereign states 
was rare. Instead, individuals unaffiliated with any government committed 
terrorist acts in Western Europe, South America, the Islamic world, and the 
United States that intimidated and murdered civilians. 
Conflict in 1orthern ,relanG  Most of Ireland, the portion dominated by 
Roman Catholics, gained independence from the United .ingdom in 122. 
However, Northern Ireland, which was dominated by Protestants, remained part 
of the United .ingdom. Northern Ireland Catholics suffered discrimination, 
and many wanted their region to join the rest of the Irish Republic. Northern 
Ireland Protestants fiercely refused. 
The Catholic-Protestant conflict in Northern Ireland became more violent 
in the 160s, with Catholics fighting as part of the Irish Republican Army 
(IRA)  and Protestants with the Ulster Defence Association . Between 16 
and 1, some ,500 people died in the conflict. Some members of the IRA 
took their independence campaign to England by engaging in acts of terrorism, 
the use of violence to achieve political ends. These acts included setting off 
bombs in London and other cities. In 1, the two sides reached a cease-fire. 
Later the IRA renounced violence and turned to politics to achieve its goals.
Separatists in Spain  Another group that used terrorist tactics to 
advance a political agenda was the Basque Homeland and Freedom (ETA) 
organization, founded in 15, which wanted independence for the Basque 
region in northern Spain. ETA actions killed more than 800 people and injured 
many others. In 1, members of ETA killed the hand-picked successor to 
longtime dictator Francisco Franco. See Topic .. Over the years, ETA 
announced several cease-fires. In 2011 it declared an end to violent actions and 
promised to work within the political system to achieve Basque independence. 
Peru’s Shining Path  During the 10s, former philosophy professor 
Abimael Guzmán  built a revolutionary organization called Shining Path  
based on the ideas of Mao =edong and Cambodia’s .hmer Rouge. In 180, 
the Shining Path began decades of bombings and assassinations in Peru in 
order to overthrow the existing government and replace it with a communist 
one. Shining Path’s 20 years of terrorism caused an estimated ,000 deaths. 
Guzmin was arrested and sentenced to life in prison in 12, though the 
Shining Path continued its attacks through the late 10s. In 2011 one of the 
group’s top leaders admitted defeat and began negotiations with the Peruvian 
government. 
603 GLOBAL RE SISTANCE TO E STABLISHED POWER STRUCTURESIslamic Terrorism  Several small groups used a fundamentalist 
interpretation of Islam, one widely condemned by mainstream Muslims, to 
justify terrorism. Among these groups were the Boko Haram in West Africa, 
al-Shabaab in East Africa, the Islamic State of Iraq, the Levant ISIL in the 
Middle East, and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Most victims were Muslims. 
Some high-profile attacks occurred in European cities such as Madrid, London, 
and Paris.
One of the deadliest groups was al-Qaeda . Financed by Saudi billionaire 
Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda carried out attacks in many countries, including 
one in the United States on September 11, 2001. In this attack, terrorists killed 
themselves and more than ,000 people when they hijacked and crashed planes 
in New York City, near Washington, D.C., and in rural Pennsylvania. Most of 
the world, even bitter foes of the United States such as Iran, rallied to support 
the United States. Focused efforts by the United States and its allies severely 
weakened al-Qaeda. Bin Laden was killed in a raid on his home in 201 1.
Terrorism in the United States  While the September 11 attack was the 
deadliest act of terrorism in the United States, it was not the only one. Acts 
of terrorism in the United States come from different sources and groups, 
including domestic groups, some of which are associated with white-nationalist 
or extreme right-wing views. One of the largest of these occurred when two 
anti-government extremists bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City in 
15, killing 168 people. Other attacks targeted Muslims, Jews, and blacks.
Response of Militarized States
States in which military dictators ran the government tended to respond to 
internal conflicts in ways that made the conflicts even worse. Spain under 
Franco and Uganda under Idi Amin are two prominent examples. 
The Franco Dictatorship in Spain  The dictator Francisco Franco 
ruled Spain from 1 to 15. See Topic .. He had come to power by 
overthrowing a popularly elected government that included many leftists. 
Franco’s fervent anti-communism made him an ally of the United States. It also 
led his government to execute, imprison, or send to labor camps hundreds of 
thousands of political dissenters. However, opposition to his authoritarianism 
remained. When Franco died, Spain took the opportunity to move toward 
democracy.
,ntensifieG Conflict in 8JanGa unGer ,Gi $Pin  Few countries in the 
10s suffered as much as Uganda, a small country in eastern Africa ruled 
from 11 to 1 by Idi Amin, a military dictator so brutal he was known as 
the “Butcher of Uganda.” Although he was aligned with Western democracies 
early on, he was later backed by the Soviet Union and East Germany. He 
declared himself president for life and set policies that worsened ethnic 
tensions, denied people basic human rights, and undermined economic 
stability. Amin was unpredictable. He was for a time the chairman of the 
604 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONOrganization of African Unity and even a member of the United Nations 
Commission on Human Rights. But in 12 he forcefully expelled 60,000 
Asians from Uganda, most of whom were of Indian descent, and turned 
over their businesses to his supporters. He is believed to be responsible for 
up to 500,000 deaths among targeted ethnic groups during his reign. When 
he threatened neighboring Tanzania with attack, Ugandan nationalists joined 
forces with Tanzanian troops and forced Amin into exile. 
The Military-Industrial Complex
Conflicts around the world intensified because of fear and economic pressure. 
Countries that felt threatened, including the United States and the Soviet Union, 
built strong militaries to defend themselves. These military forces required 
large factories to build planes, tanks, and other goods. Since many countries 
lacked facilities to make their own weapons, the international weapons trade 
expanded greatly. 
As the defense industries expanded, so did the number of people who 
relied on them for jobs. Cutting back on defense spending, then, became very 
difficult. In 161, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, a highly decorated 
general in World War II, called this combination of government defense 
departments and private businesses supplying their demands the military-
industrial complex. He warned that it could grow powerful enough to threaten 
the country’s democracy.

End of the Cold War
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!
—9onald  9eagan, speech in West Berlin, .ermany,  1une 12, 1987
Essential Question:  What caused the end of the Cold War?
Power structures continued to change in the 180s and 10s. President 
Ronald Reagan’s  appeal to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev  came two 
years before the Berlin Wall fell in 18. Two years after the fall, a coup ousted 
Gorbachev from power. The Soviet Union collapsed and the Cold War was 
over. The U.S.-Soviet Union rivalry that had dominated the world stage for 
nearly five decades ended. Governments in only a few countries, such as China, 
North .orea, Cuba, and 9ietnam, still called themselves communists, Political 
alliances changed, and economic interactions among nations expanded.
The Final Decades of the Cold War Era
Despite the persistent mistrust between the two countries, diplomatic relations 
between the United States and the Soviet Union were maintained²albeit 
inconsistently at times²during the last decades of the conflict. Proxy wars and 
support of opposing sides in international conflicts remained standard for both 
nations. These conflicts reinforced the fundamental disagreement between the 
capitalist United States and the communist Soviet Union. Agreements between 
the superpowers to limit nuclear weapons played a key role in ending the Cold 
War. However, the path to a thaw was not always steady. Connect: Describe 
the similarities in the competition between world powers in the Cold War and 
during the imperial era. See Topics . and .5.
Détente and a Colder War  After resolving the crises of the 160s, which 
included the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis, the relationship between 
the superpowers improved in the following decade. This period of time was 
called détente , a relaxation of strained relations between nations. 
One symbol of dptente was the visit of President Richard Nixon to the 
Soviet Union in 12. Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed the 
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) , designed to freeze the number 
of intercontinental ballistic missiles that each power could keep. To play one 
power against the other, Nixon also visited China that year. It was the first visit 
by an American president in the existence of communist China. 
609 END OF T HE COLD WARDptente served both the U.S. and Soviet needs at the time. The Soviet 
Union faced challenges during the late 160s and the 10s. 
• Economically, the USSR was in a crisis. It was no longer growing. 
Central governmental controls prevented farmers and manufacturers 
from deciding what to grow or make and what to charge for it. Foreign 
trade was extremely limited.
• Eastern European Soviet bloc countries were bucking for reforms and 
freedom from Moscow’s direct control. The Soviet military violently 
put down the Prague Spring, a liberation movement in Czechoslovakia. 
• Russia faced skirmishes with China along their shared border²a 
reflection of the troubled relationship between the two communist 
countries. 
The United States also faced difficulties. President Nixon was mired in 
the 9ietnam War, a costly and unpopular conflict. The American economy 
was suffering as well. The possibility of establishing relations with China 
would, Nixon knew, open potential new markets to the United States and 
at the same time press a bit on the strained Soviet-Chinese relationship. 
Dptente could help the United States maintain its containment policy and 
might ease tensions between the superpowers. 
As a result of dptente, the United States started to sell excess stores of 
American grain to the Soviet Union, where drought had created a shortage. 
This benefitted American farmers, who now had access to a new, large market 
for goods, and the struggling people of the Soviet Union. However, after the 
Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1, U.S. President Jimmy Carter halted the 
grain shipments. This action marked the end of dptente. 
Soviet-Afghan War  The Soviets invaded Afghanistan to prop up that 
country’s communist government against Muslim fighters. Estimates of  
Afghan civilian deaths vary from 562,000 to two million. Millions of Afghans 
fled to Pakistan and Iran, and many within the country became homeless. 
Ultimately, the Soviet army could not conquer the guerrilla groups in the rough  
terrain of Afghanistan. Soviet legitimacy was undermined and new forms of 
political participation in Afghanistan developed. As the Soviet Army withdrew 
in 18, a civil war continued in Afghanistan. While the collapse of the Soviet 
Union would not occur until 12 years after the Afghan War began, the war put 
immense stress on the Soviet Union’s centralized economic system and left 
Soviet leadership vulnerable to reform. 
Reagan and Gorbachev  During the presidency of Ronald Reagan 
181±18, tensions between the Americans and the Soviets increased even 
further. Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as the “evil empire” and sent 
military aid, including weapons, to support the Afghans. The Soviet Union 
resented this overtly militaristic move. 
In addition, by the early 180s, the United States and the Soviet Union 
had more than 12,000 nuclear missiles, each one pointed at the other side. Not 
610 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONonly would the superpowers destroy each other with a nuclear exchange, but 
the rest of the world would also be destroyed²seven times over. 
In light of this growing tension, Reagan declared that the United States 
would create a missile defense program he called the Strategic Defense 
Initiative , or SDI. Dubbed “Star Wars” after the internationally popular 
1 film by critics, the system would supposedly destroy any Soviet nuclear 
missiles that targeted the United States or its allies. Lacking such a system, the 
Soviets would be unable to keep U.S. missiles from hitting targets in the Soviet 
Union. The Soviets saw this move as the beginning of an arms race in space. 
While it was not an immediate threat that required a quick response, it worried 
liberal and moderate Soviets who wanted reforms. They saw it as a long-term 
economic concern and one that strengthened the hand of Soviet conservatives. 
The Soviets objected loudly to Reagan’s plan.
The Thaw  The increase in tensions during the 180s led to other nations 
believing that they must choose sides between the superpowers. Non-aligned 
nations hoped they would not experience a nuclear holocaust that the two 
nations caused. 
In this tense atmosphere, Mikhail Gorbachev, a more progressive Communist 
than previous Soviet leaders, came to power in 185. He favored perestroika , 
attempts to restructure the Soviet economy to allow elements of free enterprise, 
and glasnost , the policy of opening up Soviet society and the political process 
by granting greater freedom. Reagan and Gorbachev met three times in two 
years. The two men liked each other and, despite tough negotiations, created a 
working relationship that ultimately delivered results. 
In 18, the Soviet Union and the United States agreed on a new nuclear 
arms treaty. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces  Treaty (INF)  restricted 
intermediate-range nuclear weapons. Around the world, people could breathe 
a cautious sigh of relief as the world’s two superpowers reduced the risk of 
nuclear war. The INF and other U.S.-Soviet agreements quieted some of the 
more bellicose Cold War supporters in both countries. With less pressure from 
Soviet conservatives, Gorbachev could more easily implement political and 
economic reforms in the Soviet Union.

The man is Mikhail Gorbachev, 
who looks on sadly at a symbol of 
the Soviet Union, the hammer and 
sickle, broken into pieces.
611 END OF T HE COLD WARThe End of the Soviet Union  
One aspect of Gorbachev’s reform program was an end to economic support for 
the Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe. He also implied that the Soviet Army 
would no longer come to the rescue of communist regimes in Eastern Europe. 
In effect, economic reform in the Soviet Union provided greater freedom to 
other communist countries. Once people in these countries got a small taste of 
freedom, they wanted more. As a result, democratic reform movements swept 
through Eastern European nations in 18. The Berlin Wall was torn down. In 
October 10, East and West Germany reunited as one country.
The Spread of Reforms  With most of the Eastern European nations 
caught up in democratic reforms, it was not long before the Soviet Union was 
also swept into the movement. Lithuania, Georgia, and other Soviet republics 
began to overthrow their rulers and declare independence. The Warsaw Pact 
dissolved. Gorbachev’s reforms ultimately led to his political downfall and 
the end of the Soviet Union in December 11. Among the former Soviet 
republics that became independent countries, Russia emerged as the strongest. 
The Cold War had ended.
New Challenges  The decline of a superpower presented opportunities 
and several challenges. Political alliances changed, and economic interactions 
among nations expanded. With this new openness, particularly with regard 
to trade, the world became more interconnected than ever before. This 
interconnectedness produced greater wealth for some but hardships for others. 
The post-Cold War world had to grapple with new democracies, vast economic 
inequality, ethnic conflict and genocide, terrorism, environmental degradation, 
and global epidemics.

Read the following summary of the beginnings of a process set in 
motion by the introduction of perestroika. Then, in a paragraph, 
explain how the process continued, leading to the breakup of the 
Soviet Union.  
“From modest beginnings at the Twenty-Seventh Party Congress 
in 186, perestroika, Mikhail Gorbachev’s program of economic, 
political, and social restructuring, became the unintended catalyst for 
dismantling what had taken nearly three-quarters of a century to erect: 
the Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist totalitarian state.
The world watched in disbelief but with growing admiration as 
Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan, democratic governments 
overturned Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Germany was 
reunited, the Warsaw Pact withered away, and the Cold War came to 
an abrupt end.
In the Soviet Union itself, however, reactions to the new policies 
were mixed. Reform policies rocked the foundation of entrenched 
traditional power bases in the party, economy, and society but did not 
replace them entirely. Newfound freedoms of assembly, speech, and 
religion, the right to strike, and multicandidate elections undermined 
not only the Soviet Union’s authoritarian structures, but also the 
familiar sense of order and predictability. Long-suppressed, bitter 
inter-ethnic, economic, and social grievances led to clashes, strikes, 
and growing crime rates.
Gorbachev introduced policies designed to begin establishing a 
market economy by encouraging limited private ownership and 
profitability in Soviet industry and agriculture. But the Communist 
control system and over-centralization of power and privilege were 
maintained and new policies produced no economic miracles. Instead, 
lines got longer for scarce goods in the stores, civic unrest mounted, 
and bloody crackdowns claimed lives, particularly in the restive 
nationalist populations of the outlying Caucasus and Baltic states.
. . . Boris Yeltsin, who had become Russia’s first popularly elected 
president in June 11, . . . embarked on even more far-reaching 
reforms as the Soviet Union broke up into its constituent republics 
and formed the Commonwealth of Independent States.”

CAUSATION IN T HE AGE OF T HE  COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION 615
8.9
Causation in the Age of the  
Cold War and Decolonization
Walls in the mind often stand longer than those built of concrete blocks.
—Willy Brandt, December 1991
Essential Question:   Why and to what e_tent were the effects of the Cold 
War similar in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres? 
The end of World War II marked the beginning of a new world order as the 
nations of Western Europe no longer dominated the world stage. The United 
States and the Soviet Union took over as the superpowers. In Western Europe, 
however, countries were free from domination by a superpower and retained 
their political independence and democratic governments. The Marshall Plan 
had helped them rebuild and achieve a level of economic prosperity that was 
unknown among the countries of Eastern Europe. 
However, during this time, Western European colonial empires began 
to crumble as anti-imperialist sentiment fueled independence movements in 
Africa and Asia. Resentment of European and American economic imperialism 
also rose in Latin American countries, leading to revolutionary movements 
that aimed to overturn the political and social status quo in these countries. The 
United States and the Soviet Union regularly supported opposing sides in these 
clashes, projecting their own differences onto regional conflicts. 
The Cold War also influenced economic, social, and cultural aspects of 
global events, providing further evidence that this conflict had far-reaching 
effects that affected the latter half of the 20th century.
Challenges to Existing Social Orders 
The years following World War II were a time of unprecedented conflict as 
people and states challenged the established order. How they carried out their 
challenges, how the existing powers responded, and how the challenges were 
or were not resolved depended in part on the position of the challenging 
people or states in the geopolitical balance of power. 
Toward the end of World War II, a serious ideological and economic 
rift  emerged among the “Big Three” Allied powers²the Soviet Union, the 
United States, and Great Britain. The United States and Great Britain, along 
with France which had recently been liberated from German occupation, 
616 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONoccupied the western half of Germany. The Soviets occupied the eastern half. 
Agreements made at Yalta and Potsdam were supposed to have settled the 
future status of Western and Eastern European countries affected by the war. 
However, after the war officially ended, it became apparent that the Soviet 
Union was not going to relinquish control over the Eastern European territories 
it occupied during the war. The Soviets viewed these states as a buffer against 
future aggression from the West. Even though the countries of Eastern Europe 
were officially independent, the Soviet Union had immense influence over 
their governments and internal affairs. The so-called Soviet bloc was made up 
of East Germany and these satellite nations of the USSR. The United States 
distrusted the motives of the Soviet Union and believed the Soviets were intent 
on bringing about a global communist revolution. 
After China became a communist state in 1 and the United States 
recognized it could not free Eastern Europe from Soviet influence, the United 
States established a policy of containment. The policy used military, economic, 
and political means to stop the spread of communism outside of the areas 
where it was currently practiced. Containment drove the direction of U.S. 
foreign policy throughout the Cold War.
Three Alignments  The Cold War thus caused a division of the world into 
three alignments. The “First World” was the United States and its allies. The 
“Second World” was the Soviet Union, the Soviet bloc countries of Eastern 
Europe, and other communist nations around the world. The third alignment 
was often called the “Third World” but was more accurately described as the 
non-aligned countries that did not have close military or ideological ties with 
any of the First or Second World countries .SOVIET UNION

617 CAUSATION IN T HE AGE OF T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION 617As the map on the previous page shows, the United States was the 
First World superpower situated in the Western Hemisphere. The dominant 
superpower in the Second World, the Soviet Union, was in the Eastern 
Hemisphere. These superpowers represented a geopolitical balance of power. 
Third World countries were mainly those with colonial pasts they were in 
Asia, Africa, and Oceania in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America in the 
Western Hemisphere.
Superpower Rivalries
One result of the superpower rivalry was the division of Europe. The western 
portion had, for the most part, democratic and free-market societies, while 
the eastern portion was autocratic and communist. The dividing line ran 
through Germany, which was divided into the two independent countries of 
West and East Germany. The capital city of Berlin was similarly divided. The 
Iron Curtain, as it was termed, reflected the Western democratic view that 
the Soviet-bloc countries were a threat to the individual freedoms and liberty 
of the people living on both sides of the border. The Soviets believed, based 
on their historical perspective, that the Western democracies were intent on 
invading the Soviet Union. Mistrust on both sides led to a nuclear arms race 
that was an existential threat to Europe and the world. 
The Arms Race  The United States developed an atomic bomb at the end 
of World War II. It used the bomb to end the conflict with Japan by dropping 
two of them²one on the city of Hiroshima and the other on Nagasaki. The 
devastation to the two cities shocked the world. The Soviet Union soon 
developed its own nuclear weapon, and the nuclear arms race was on. The 
number of nuclear weapons and the means to use them increased for both states. 
Relations between the superpowers grew tense, and the fear in Europe, and 
elsewhere, was that any provocation could lead to nuclear annihilation. Both 
the United States and the Soviet Union took defensive actions that resulted in 
Europe becoming what was effectively an armed camp with millions of troops 
and weapons, both conventional and nuclear, facing off against each other. 
During this time, two international military alliances formed. The United 
States and its allies formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO.
The Soviet Union and its allies created the Warsaw Pact. Both groups sought 
to ensure collective security through military cooperation. Part of the “cold” 
factor in the Cold War is that there never was direct, “hot” military conflict 
between the two superpowers. But the brinkmanship and proxy battles that 
characterized this war put most people on Earth on edge whenever the United 
States and the Soviets appeared poised to launch a nuclear atta ck.
Hopes for Greater Self-Government
The high point of empires and colonization was World War I. The British, 
the French, and other Europeans had colonized almost all of Africa, India, 
and Southeast Asia, and they dominated China. The Turkish Ottoman Empire 
618 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONcontrolled the Middle East. But the desire for self-government that had fueled 
colonial rebellions throughout the Americas in the 18th and 1th centuries as 
well as national independence movements in Europe in the 1th century spread 
throughout the world in the 20th century. The two world wars crystallized the 
opposition to the empires. Although most hopes for independence remained 
unfulfilled after World War I, the war did result in the breakup of two large 
multiethnic empires, Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey. 
World War II, however, accelerated the dismantling of global colonial 
empires. Between the end of World War II in 15 and the year 2000, the 
number of independent states more than doubled, going from around 5 to 
around 10. 
As the Cold War established new alignments among both newer and 
established states, it extended far beyond its ideological roots and exerted 
political, economic, social, and cultural influence on nearly all parts of the 
globe.

The Cold War affected the Eastern and Western Hemispheres in similar ways, 
since each was dominated by a superpower and also had former colonies and 
emerging new nations. However, most countries in the Western Hemisphere 
had become independent long before the Cold War. The Eastern Hemisphere 
paid an especially heavy price as a result of the Cold War, since several key 
proxy conflicts were located in Asia and Africa. Nonetheless, rivalries between 
the superpowers played out in both hemispheres. 
Many transitions to independence were largely peaceful and nonviolent 
others involved open armed rebellions. In some cases, these insurgent 
movements were led by communist groups and supported by the Soviet Union, 
such as in 9ietnam and Angola. As a result, the United States would either 
support the colonial power against the communist insurgency or would support 
opposition groups that would establish a non-communist government. Often 
these Western-backed governments proved to be unpopular with the majority 
of the people, which only heightened anti-imperialist feelings.
Political Effects in Asia  The Cold War brought armed conflict and played 
a part in internal revolts and crises in some countries of Asia. The U.S. policy 
of containment led to wars in .orea and 9ietnam. Communist revolutions 
overtook Cambodia and Laos. The Soviets invaded Afghanistan to prop up the 
communist government in that country. Anti-communist crackdowns occurred 
in Indonesia and the Philippines. Communist China had a falling-out with the 
Soviet Union and began to seek better relations with the United States.
Political Effects in Africa  As with Asia, the Cold War brought conflict 
and turmoil to Africa. Communist insurrections supported by the Soviet Union 
were often met by government resistance supported with arms supplied by 
the United States. Communist governments came to power in Ethiopia and 
Angola. In the case of Angola’s war for independence from Portugal, the Soviet 
Union and the United States fought a proxy war. The Soviets supported the use 
619 CAUSATION IN T HE AGE OF T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION of Cuban soldiers and provided arms and military training to help establish a 
communist-style government in the country. The United States provided arms 
and supported anti-communist groups. 
Political Effects in the Western Hemisphere Latin America also 
experienced the results of the Cold War conflict between the superpowers. 
Communist revolutions were successful in Cuba and Nicaragua. Communist 
insurrections, sometimes backed by the Soviet Union or Cuba, occurred in El 
Salvador, Columbia, Peru, and Guatemala. The United States would support 
the government in power²often a dictatorship made up of military officers or 
right-wing politicians²to try to stop the spread of communism. 
&RPSDUinJ(cRnRPic(σecWsRfWKe&RlG:DU
The Cold War divided Europe in economics as well as politics. The Western 
countries, aided by the United States’ Marshall Plan, rebuilt their economies 
after the destruction of World War II with a mixture of free-market principles 
and state-sponsored economic development. The Eastern bloc nations struggled 
in a transition away from communism to free-market economies. Developing 
countries²those in the “Third World”²faced unique challenges.
State Response to Economic Challenges in the West  To promote 
economic security, many Western European governments created public 
health systems, built public housing, provided unemployment insurance, and 
developed state-backed pension plans. The creation of the welfare state, as it 
became known, was to counteract the attraction of the communist system that 
promised to provide many of these benefits. As a result, the Western European 
nations’ economies boomed while the Eastern European economies, under a 
communist system, struggled to recover from the costs and effects of the war.

620 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONState Response to Economic Challenges in the Eastern Bloc  The 
Soviet government quickly transitioned its economy after the war to peacetime 
endeavors. Yet the military-industrial complex was so large in the Soviet Union 
that it employed about 20 percent of the workers, many of whom became 
unemployed during the transition. The Soviet-bloc countries faced a serious 
economic crisis as the government instituted economic reforms to encourage 
free-market practices and move away from a state-controlled economy . 
However, moving from a state-controlled to a free-market economy proved  
to be an extremely complex endeavor. Debates swirled about whether to 
institute reforms gradually or all at once, and party officials resisted the loss 
of their control over the economy. In the end, reformers have succeeded in 
removing state controls over prices, and formerly state-owned businesses have 
been privatized. After a period of decline, the Russian economy is improving. 
China made a more gradual transition to a free-market economy and has 
become a global economic powerhouse. 
State Response to Economic Challenges in Developing Countries  Many 
former colonies still had close economic ties to the countries that had colonized 
them and remained dependent on the extraction and exporting of natural 
resources. The perspective of many people in the former colonies was that the 
industrial countries were using this relationship to exploit and undermine the 
economies of these developing countries. Getting control of their resources 
was a top priority of developing nations. Oil-rich Angola, for example, left in 
disarray after years of civil war, has a government-controlled oil conglomerate 
that accounts for about 0 percent of government revenue and has helped the 
nation rebuild and update infrastructure.
&RPSDUinJ6RciDlDnG&ulWuUDl(σecWs
The tension and turmoil of the Cold War era created social effects for all sides 
involved. For example, the proxy wars cost millions of people their lives, 
especially in Southeast Asia. In the 9ietnam war alone, two million soldiers 
and two million civilians died over 20 years of conflict. Bombs destroyed 
villages, and chemical defoliants killed anything growing on farmlands. 
Families were separated and displaced. Many rural villagers left for the city, 
where they thought they could find safety. Saigon, the capital city, tripled in 
size as refugees from the countryside flooded in. Most of the fighting took 
place in South 9ietnam, so it sustained the most damage, but North 9ietnam 
was also bombed²especially such infrastructure as railroads and highways.
Social Tensions  The Cold War created suspicions as well. Americans 
were afraid of communist infiltration, and some people’s careers were ruined 
when they were unjustly accused of being communists. In the Soviet Union, 
people were afraid to express their beliefs openly if they disagreed with the 
government. They knew they could be sent away to a political prison camp. 
People everywhere lived under the threat of a nuclear attack. Some people built 
bomb shelters where they hoped they could safely weather an atomic attack.
621 CAUSATION IN T HE AGE OF T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION Cultural Effects  With greater personal freedom, and with help from the 
United States, Western Europeans experienced a cultural rebirth after World 
War II. Scientific research, music, art, and architecture flourished. Eastern 
Europe, in contrast, lacked freedom of expression. Because of the Cold War, 
governments actively blocked the spread of Western culture. The people of 
Eastern Europe did not see much in the way of cultural achievements beyond 
those that were government-sponsored or approved.
During the Cold War, many people from former colonies moved to the 
metropole see Topic 8.6, furthering the blending of cultures. At the same 
time, the imperial powers left a legacy of culture in their former colonies, 
including the languages spoken, as the chart below shows.
European-Based Languages Spoken Widely in Sub-Saharan Africa

• Democratic Republic of the Congo
Portuguese 14 million • Angola
• Mozambique
Dutch (Afrikaans) 7 million • South Africa
English 7 million • South Africa
Spanish 1 million • Equatorial Guinea
In places where a Cold War superpower had maintained order, such as 
Afghanistan and Yugoslavia, violent culture clashes occurred when the 
superpower retreated. In Yugoslavia, for example, which had been stitched 
together and annexed to Serbia after World War I, ethnic tensions flared as 
Serbia’s ultra-nationalist president, Slobodan Milosevic, pitted one group 
against another to strengthen his own position after the fall of the Soviet Union 
left a power vacuum. Wars in the region took tens of thousands of lives and 
created hundreds of thousands of refugees. Connect: Analyze the changing 
goals for both superpowers during the Cold War. See Topics 8.1, 8., and 8.8. 
Development of Global Institutions
The end of the Cold War and the growth of globalization has reset the 
geopolitical framework. The idea of a balance of power has yielded to a more 
cooperative approach as countries recognize global interdependence. To further 
cooperation, global organizations such as the United Nations and the World 
Trade Association have been established. Others address such transnational 
issues as environmental degradation and global warming, human rights, and 
epidemic diseases.

UNIT 8 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WHY ARE SOME COUNTRIE S WEALT HY?
In 16, Adam Smith published the first modern, in-depth look at why 
some countries are wealthier than others, The Wealth of Nations . Smith 
recognized a need for government, but emphasized the benefits of trade.
Modernization  After World War II, Western Europe and the 
United States grew wealthier rapidly. Scholars in these regions, such 
as American political scientist David Apter, developed modernization 
theory.  The problems of poor, newly emerging countries were seen as 
the natural by-products of the transition from a traditional, agrarian 
society to a modern, developed society. Developed countries could 
provide economic and technological assistance to help in this transition.
Self-Reliance  In the 10s, a new generation of scholars saw 
developed countries as the problem, not the solution. They rejected 
modernization theory, arguing that it placed the blame for poverty 
on poor countries, not on the former colonial powers. According to 
dependency theory , former colonies were victims of the international 
marketplace. In this theory, the way out of poverty was self-reliance. 
Globalization  Recent writers, such as journalist Thomas 
Friedman, focused not on self-reliance but on globalization.  Friedman 
saw the increasing interconnectedness of economies around the world 
as an opportunity for countries to prosper. His “flat world” referred to 
relatively inexpensive technologies that allowed developing nations to 
compete with developed ones for jobs and the creation of innovative 
products. In response, Canadian journalist Linda McQuaig attacked 
Friedman as an “apologist of globalization.” Friedman’s critics charged 
that he looked at the benefits of increased trade and investments without 
seeing the costs incurred in poor countries through these actions.
Trade  Ha-Joon Chang, a British economist who was born and raised 
in South .orea, took a historical view. In Kicking Away the Ladder: 
Development Strategies in Historical Perspective  2002, he evaluated 
the path to prosperity for today’s wealthy countries in Western Europe 
and the United States. All once had high tariffs and other trade barriers 
to protect their growing industries from foreign competition. Only after 
they became wealthy did they advocate for free trade. However, today 
wealthy countries press poor ones to open their borders economically. 
The lesson of history, he argued, was to let poor countries use the same 
protectionist methods that led to prosperity for other countrie s.

evidence supports one of the perspectives on nations’ wealth after 100.
624 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION
WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  WRITE  THE CONCL USION
A strong conclusion helps create unity by circling back to the ideas in 
your introduction and thesis statement. The conclusion is also a good 
opportunity to extend and refine the complex understanding you have 
developed and woven throughout your essay.
Providing Unity  While wrapping up your essay with a return to the 
ideas in your introduction helps provide unity, simply restating your thesis 
is not a strong way to end the essay. Suppose your thesis is that the main 
causes of the end of the Cold War were the decline in communist ideology 
and the weakness of the Soviet economy. Avoid simply restating it “Thus 
we can see that the decline of communist ideology and the weakness of 
the Soviet economy were the main causes of the end of the Cold War”. 
Instead, you might say, “Although many factors led to the end of the Cold 
War, including Gorbachev’s efforts at reform and the development of 
communication technologies that allowed for the rapid spread of liberal 
ideas, most served to feed the two main causes²declining support for 
communism and a faltering Soviet economy.” This change extends the 
thesis statement rather than simply repeating it.
Demonstrating Complexity  An extension of your thesis statement 
such as the one above also helps demonstrate a complex understanding of 
the topic by referring to multiple causes. The College Board identifies the 
following ways to demonstrate a complex understanding: “Corroborate, 
qualify, or modify an argument using diverse and alternative evidence 
in order to develop a complex argument.” You might, for example, 
analyze multiple variables to arrive at a nuanced conclusion: “Economic, 
ideological, political, social, and religious factors all played a role in the 
fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.” You might make 
a connection within or across regions: “A democracy movement was 
building in China as well, but China used military force to put it down, 
while Gorbachev decided not to use military force.”
Other ways you can demonstrate a complex understanding are to 
consider the significance of a source’s credibility and limitations and 
explain why a historical argument is or is not effective. Most of the 
development of your complex understanding must be done within the 
body of your essay for you to earn the point for complexity, but you can 
use the conclusion to summarize or extend that understanding. 
Application:  Review the sample scored essays on the College 
Board website. Evaluate the conclusion of each sample. For any that 
lack a conclusion, draft one that would provide unity to the essay and 
summarize a complex understanding of the historical development that 
is the focus of the prompt.

Bandung Conference, April 18, 155.
Perhaps now more than at any other moment in the history of the world, 
society, government, and statesmanship need to be based upon the highest 
code of morality and ethics. And in political terms, what is the highest code 
of morality" It is the subordination >placing in a lower rank@ of everything 
to the well-being of mankind. But today we are faced with a situation 
where the well-being of mankind is not always the primary consideration. 
Many who are in places of high power think, rather, of controlling the 
world. Yes, we are living in a world of fear. The life of man today is 
corroded >destroyed or weakened gradually@ and made bitter by fear. Fear 
of the future, fear of the hydrogen bomb, fear of ideologies. Perhaps this 
fear is a greater danger than the danger itself, because it is fear which 
drives men to act foolishly, to act thoughtlessly, to act dangerously . . . 
All of us, I am certain, are united by more important things than those 
which superficially divide us. We are united, for instance, by a common 
detestation of colonialism in whatever form it appears. We are united 
by a common detestation of racialism. And we are united by a common 
determination to preserve and stabilize peace in the world.

culture, in civilization. But I do submit that greatness sometimes brings 
quite false values, false standards. When they begin to think in terms of 
military strength²whether it be the United .ingdom, the Soviet Union or

of that will be that the overwhelming might of one country will conquer

The Middle East has abruptly reached a new and critical stage in its long 
and important history. In past decades, many of the countries in that 
area were not fully self-governing. Other nations exercised considerable 
authority in the area and the security of the region was largely built 
around their power. But since the First World War there has been a steady 
evolution toward self-government and independence. This development 
the United States has welcomed and has encouraged. Our country supports 
without reservation the full sovereignty >supreme power or authority@ and 
independence of each and every nation of the Middle East. The evolution 
to independence has in the main been a peaceful process. But the area 
has been often troubled . . . All this instability has been heightened and, 
at times, manipulated by International Communism. Russia’s rulers have 
long sought to dominate the Middle East . . . The Soviet Union has nothing 
whatsoever to fear from the United States in the Middle East, or anywhere 
else in the world, so long as its rulers do not themselves first resort to 
aggression. That statement I make solemnly and emphatically.

As the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union came to dominate 
U.S. foreign policy concerns in the late 10s and 150s, the Truman 
and Eisenhower Administrations grew increasingly concerned that as 
the European powers lost their colonies or granted them independence, 
Soviet-supported communist parties might achieve power in the new 
states. This might serve to shift the international balance of power in favor 
of the Soviet Union and remove access to economic resources from U.S. 
allies. Events such as the Indonesian struggle for independence from the 
Netherlands 15±50, the 9ietnamese war against France 15±5, 
and the nationalist and professed socialist takeovers of Egypt 152 and 
Iran 151 served to reinforce such fears, even if new governments did 
not directly link themselves to the Soviet Union. Thus, the United States 
used aid packages, technical assistance, and sometimes even military 
intervention to encourage newly independent nations in the Third World to 
adopt governments that aligned with the West. The Soviet Union deployed 
similar tactics in an effort to encourage new nations to join the communist 
bloc. . . . Many of the new nations resisted the pressure to be drawn into 
the Cold War, joined in the “non-aligned movement.”

UNIT 9:   Globalization after 1900
Understand the Context
Unprecedented advancements in science and technology, from airplanes 
to the internet, increased globalization in the 20th century. These changes 
provided the setting for vast political and social change, including the spread 
of democracy and increased international trade. 
Innovation by Necessity  Science and technology exploration changed 
the way people in the 20th century viewed the universe and the natural world. 
Advancements were often a reaction to some sort of large, global problem. 
An increase in diseases that threatened human populations throughout the 
world necessitated medical advancements such as vaccines. Deforestation 
and a decline in the fresh water supply meant that humans had to compete 
over natural resources and develop environmentally friendly practices. Other 
conditions necessitated advancements in communication, transportation, and 
other global industries. 
Reaction to Globalization  Many states employed free-market economic 
policies that paved the way for emerging multinational organizations. 
Access to education and the political process improved as disseminating 
knowledge and information became easy with technology. Classrooms and 
political movements came to include more diverse participants, including 
those from various races, classes, and religions. Communication innovations 
also led to discussions about human rights that challenged previous forms of 
discrimination. 
The globalization of the 20th century also led to changes in the arts and 
humanities, especially in the second half of the century. Arts and entertainment 
increasingly reflected a new, globalized world and consumer culture began to 
transcend borders. Countries also had to learn to work together as they never 
had before. The United Nations formed with stated goals not only to maintain 
world peace but also to facilitate international cooperation.19002000 195020501945

smaller, as did advances in telecommunications technology. Starting in the 
early 1900s, radio  brought news, music, and cultural events to a wide range of 
people. Later in the century, air travel and shipping containers, large standard-
sized units that could be carried on a truck or train or stacked on ship, promoted 
the widespread movement of people and goods. Energy technologies, such as 
the use of oil and nuclear power, made it possible to transport goods faster 
and more cheaply than ever. The internet, first developed for the U.S. Defense 
Department during the Cold War, emerged as a regular tool of communication 
for much of the public by the late 1990s. Knowledge economies, based on 
developing or sharing information, took root in cities around the world.
Communication and Transportation
Decades before the introduction of the internet, communication technologies 
were connecting people around the world. Television and radio ads encouraged 
people to “reach out and touch someone” by making a long-distance phone 
call. By the 1990s, mobile technologies such as cellphones put the tools of 
information creation and dissemination into the hands of individuals around 
the world. Twitter, Facebook, and other social networking sites made the media 
accessible to anyone anywhere. 
The impact of this revolution became apparent quickly. Videos taken 
on phones of police actions in the United States and other countries led to 
inquiries into racial profiling and sparked outrage. Social media also played a 
role in the “Arab Spring,” a series of antigovernment protests that spread from 
country to country in North Africa and the Middle East in the 2010s as people 
shared their protest experiences on social media.
634 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONWhile communication technologies put people in virtual touch, 
transportation advancements move people and goods into actual proximity. 
Every day, about 2 million people fly on an airplane. Cargo planes transport 
commercial shipments around the clock. Giant tankers—up to one-quarter 
mile in length—loaded with thousands of shipping containers ply the seas in 
increasing numbers, some of them too big to fit through the Panama Canal.
The Green Revolution  
In the mid-20th century, the Green Revolution  emerged as a possible long-
term response to hunger. Scientists developed new varieties of wheat, rice, and 
other grains that had higher yields and greater resistance to pests, diseases, 
and drought. The new varieties were first developed by crossbreeding —
breeding two varieties of a plant to create a hybrid. More recently, scientists 
have used genetic engineering —manipulating a cell or organism to change 
its basic characteristics. Farmers also used more irrigation, fertilizers, and 
pesticides. In Brazil and elsewhere, people burned down forests and plowed 
the land for agriculture. Acreage devoted to crops, especially grains, increased 
dramatically worldwide. 
The Green Revolution solutions were not free of problems. Many small 
farmers could not afford the new fertilizers or pesticides. For this reason, they 
were often unable to compete with large landowners. Many small farmers 
were forced to sell their land, increasing the holdings of large landowners even 
more. Also, since some of the techniques developed in the Green Revolution 
involved the use of mechanized equipment, fewer jobs were available for farm 
laborers. Finally, the heavy applications of chemicals damaged the soil and the 
environment. Total Grain Production in China 1945–2010

635 ADVANCE S IN TEC HNOLOG Y AND EXCHANGEGenetic engineering created its own set of concerns as well. Some argued 
that a genetic modification designed to give a plant resistance to insects might 
inadvertently cause a decline in the population of pollinating insects, such as 
bees. Another problem was the loss of old seed varieties as new genetically 
engineered plants were adopted.
Energy Technologies
In 1900, coal accounted for about half of the global energy consumed. As 
extraction, refinement, and transportation technologies allowed for widespread 
use, petroleum, also known as crude oil, and natural gas joined coal in fueling 
industrial output and helped increase productivity. Research in the 1930s and 
10s that led to the atomic bomb also led to the first use of nuclear power 
plants to generate electricity for factories and homes. 
Fossil fuels—coal, petroleum, and natural gas—are nonrenewable 
resources. Once they have been used up, the supply is permanently depleted. 
Fossil fuels have contributed to air pollution and to the cloak of greenhouse 
gases, especially carbon dioxide, that allow sunlight through the Earth’s 
atmosphere but block the escape of Earth’s heat. Nuclear power, while 
considered a clean energy, has its own dangers. Accidents at nuclear plants 
have caused serious problems with leaked radiation, and storing nuclear waste 
has hazardous consequences. 
Technologies continue to be developed to combat the emission of carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases as well as minimize harm from nuclear 
power. The building of nuclear power plants declined starting in the 1980s, and 
nuclear power accounts for only about 5 percent of global energy consumption. 
Renewable resources, such as wind and solar power, are beginning to supply 
energy to both industries and homes, but they too represent only 5 percent 
of global energy output. (Connect: Analyze the role of various energy 
sources in the first and second industrial revolutions and in the 21st century.  
See Topic 5.5.)
Medical Innovations
A number of advances in medicine have had a dramatic effect on the survival 
and longevity of humans. Medical research and advancement benefit from, 
and also inspire, new technologies. 
Antibiotics   In 1928, Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming was working 
in his lab in London when he accidentally discovered that a particular fungus 
produced a substance that killed bacteria. He had discovered penicillin. 
Penicillin became the first antibiotic,  a useful agent in curing bacterial 
infections. During World War II, antibiotics saved the lives of soldiers who 
would have died in any previous war from a minor wound that became 
infected. After the war, antibiotics spread to civilian use, where they fought a 
range of illnesses.
636 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION“I would like to sound one warning,” Fleming said in a speech as he 
accepted the Nobel Prize. He pointed out that the extensive use of antibiotics 
carried a risk. By killing off certain strains of a disease, antibiotics allowed the 
evolution of strains of the disease unaffected by them. These antibiotic-resistant 
strains could be untreatable. This prospect raised fears of renewed epidemics 
of diseases once under control.
Reliable Birth Control  Another groundbreaking medical advance was 
in birth control . In the early 150s, scientist Gregory Pincus developed a 
birth control pill, a more reliable method than the barrier methods then in use. 
Scientists tested the pill on women in the 1950s, and the U.S. government 
approved it for widespread use in 1960. 
As a result of the pill and other forms of birth control, fertility rates  
declined in much of the world. In other words, the average woman began 
having fewer babies than her mother or grandmother had. Birth control 
transformed sexual practices and played a part in reshaping gender roles. By 
2018, more than 300 million women worldwide were using modern forms of 
contraception, including the pill. 
Vaccines  Vaccines have existed since 1796, but governments and 
nonprofit organizations did not begin developing and widely distributing 
vaccines  to prevent deadly diseases until after 1900. Thanks to vaccines, 
polio and measles became rare, and smallpox was eradicated by the 1980s. 
Vaccines are also available to prevent mumps, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, 
and whooping cough, all potentially serious diseases. As of 2019, a malaria 
vaccine is in the trial stage.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccines were 
preventing as many as 3 million deaths each year in the 21st century. However, 
the WHO also said that better vaccination coverage would save another 1.5 
million people annually. Some people were unable to get vaccinated because 
they lived in hard-to-reach areas.

Penicillium fungi are the source of penicillin, which people can take orally 
or by injection. Penicillin works by interfering with bacteria cell walls. 
Scientists began to treat humans with the drug in 1941.

that follows.
“Gender equity is defined by the World Health Organization as, µthe fairness 
and justice in the distribution of benefits and responsibilities between women 
and men,’ (Euro.who.int., 2002). When women can have control over their 
fertility, they have control of their lives which creates a society where 
gender equity can occur with all genders benefiting from the same resources. 
Contraceptive use promotes gender equality by improving the accessibility 
of education, employment and health care to women. If women are using 
contraception to postpone or prevent a pregnancy from occurring, they are 
able to stay in school and seek gainful employment upon completion.
Family planning is deeply influenced by inequality because the caliber of 
medical care between men and women is just not the same across the board. 
These gender differences are greater where women have relatively lower 
socioeconomic status than that of men (WHO, 2011; Nelson, 2011). It stands 
to reason that gender inequality intersects with other social determinants of 
health, such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, to produce health 
disparities between men and women that are similar to social divisions within 
society (WHO, 2008).”

Technological Advancements 
and Limitations—Disease
We live in a world fraught with risk from new pandemics. Fortunately,  
we also now live in an era with the tools to build a global immune system. 
—Nathan Wolfe, virologist (born 1970)
Essential Question:   How have environmental  factors affected human 
populations since 1900?
As virus specialist Nathan Wolfe pointed out, progress in science and 
medicine, combined with government-run public health measures, drastically 
reduced illnesses and deaths from many diseases after 1900. These included 
pandemics , epidemic diseases that spread across national borders.  The disease 
smallpox , for example,  had plagued the ancient Egyptians and devastated the 
native population of the Americas and Australia. As recently as the 1960s, it 
killed millions of people each year. However, the World Health Organization 
(WHO) conducted a global vaccination campaign to wipe out the disease. 
In 1979, scientists declared success. Smallpox had been eliminated from the 
planet, except for the culture kept alive at the Centers for Disease Control in 
the United States. 
Other diseases persisted, especially those related to poverty, including 
malaria, tuberculosis, and cholera. New epidemics also emerged, such as 
deadly strains of flu, HI9AIDS, and Ebola. Other conditions, such as heart 
disease and Alzheimers, became more common as people began living longer. 
Each medical problem spurred even more technological and medical advances 
to try to combat it.
Disease and Poverty
Even when cures exist, some diseases persist because the conditions of poverty 
are contributing factors. Poor housing or working conditions, contaminated 
water, and lack of access to health care are commonplace among populations 
with low incomes, and they all contribute to the spread of disease.
Malaria  A parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes in tropical areas, 
malaria  killed more than 600,000 people each year in the early 21st century. 
Most of these were young African children. The international non-governmental 
642 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONorganization (NGO) Doctors Without Borders  treated about 1.7 million 
people annually. Experts developed preventive approaches, such as distributing 
mosquito nets treated with insecticide as cover during sleep. However, people 
can still become infected during waking hours. A vaccine for malaria has been 
in development for many years, but one that is effective in most cases is still 
in trials. Nonetheless, progress has been made. In 2019, the World Health 
Organization certified Algeria and Argentina as malaria-free. The organization 
cautioned, however, that some types of mosquitoes were becoming resistant 
to insecticides.
Tuberculosis  Another disease associated with poverty is tuberculosis 
(TB), an airborne infection that spreads through coughs and sneezes and 
affects the lungs. Before 1946, no effective drug treatment was available for 
this deadly disease. Then a cure was developed involving antibiotics and a long 
period of rest. In countries where TB is common, vaccines are administered to 
children. In the early 21st century, a strain of tuberculosis resistant to the usual 
antibiotics appeared. The number of infected patients increased, especially in 
prisons, where people live in close quarters. The WHO began a worldwide 
campaign against tuberculosis in the 2010s.
Cholera  A bacterial disease that spreads through contaminated water, 
cholera causes about 95,000 deaths per year. Like tuberculosis and malaria, 
cholera affects mainly poor people in developing countries. Methods to counter 
cholera include boiling or chlorinating drinking water and washing hands. 
Although cholera vaccines are available, they do not reduce the need to follow 
these preventive measures. A severe cholera infection can kill within a few 
hours, but quickly rehydrating an exposed person can effectively eliminate the 
risk of death.

transmitted in fecal matter, polio  once infected 100,000 new people per year. 
It could result in paralysis and sometimes death. The world cheered when 
an American researcher, Jonas Salk , announced on April 12, 1955, that an 
injectable vaccine against polio had proven effective. Six years later, an oral 
vaccine, developed by Albert Sabin , became available.  
Vaccines became the centerpiece of a global public health campaign to 
eliminate polio. A joint effort by governments, private organizations, and United 
Nations agencies began in 1988. In less than 30 years, polio was eliminated 
in all but a few countries. In places where it still exists, such as Pakistan and 
Afghanistan, war makes administering the vaccine difficult. Political unrest 
and religious fundamentalism make people fearful of programs advocated by 
outsiders. Still, the success of the campaign showed that coordinated global 
efforts could help solve global problems. (Connect: Compare the effects 
of diseases during the Age of Exploration to those in the 20th century. See

Emerging Epidemics
Some diseases have emerged that caused major social disruption. In the fall of 
118, as World War I was drawing to a close, a new fight erupted. The issue 
of the Journal of the American Medical Association  published on December 
12, 1918, described the battle this way: “Medical science for four and one-
half years devoted itself to putting men on the firing line and keeping them 
there. Now it must turn with its whole might to combating the greatest enemy

644 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONbattle. One quarter of all Americans and one-fifth of the world’s population 
became infected with this particularly virulent strain of the flu, which killed 20 
million people worldwide. Its victims tended to be between the ages of 20 and 
0. The effects of the flu were so disastrous that longevity in the United States 
fell by 10 years. More people died from the flu in 118±11 than had died in 
four years of the Bubonic Plague 1±151. Like the plague, the flu spread 
along trade routes and with military troops.
HIV/AIDS  Another disease outbreak causing social disruption occurred 
between 1981 and 2014. $cTuireG iPPunoGeficiency synGroPe $,'S , 
which is caused by the  huPan iPPunoGeficiency Yirus +,9 , killed more 
than 25 million people around the world. HIV weakens the immune system, 
so people more easily succumb to other illnesses. The virus is contracted 
through the exchange of bodily fluids, usually through unprotected sex, blood 
transfusions, or sharing intravenous needles. Funding for the research on the 
disease, which was associated in its early days with homosexual men and drug 
addicts, was difficult to come by, and a high percentage of its first victims died.
By the mid-1990s, however, medical researchers had developed ways to 
treat the disease but not to cure it. Antiretroviral drugs  could stop HIV from 
weakening the immune system, thus allowing a patient to live with the virus for 
many years. However, the drugs were very expensive, so access to treatment 
was difficult, particularly for patients in poor countries. Brazil is a notable 
exception. In 1996 it established a policy of providing free antiretroviral drugs 
to any person who needed them. Deaths have declined dramatically, and the 
program has actually saved the government money by lowering the number of 
hospitalizations, medical leaves, and early retirements.
After 2000, the WHO, the United States government, and private groups 
increased funding for AIDS prevention and treatment, but the disease remains 
a serious problem. In 2018, about 40 million people globally were living 
with HIV , the majority in developing countries or low-income neighborhoods 
of developed countries. Each week, more than 600 young women between 
the ages of 15 and 24 become infected with HIV , and many lack access to 
healthcare. 
Ebola  Another recent and frightening epidemic is Ebola. Discovered in 
the Congo in 1976, Ebola is a deadly disease caused by a virus that infects 
the African fruit bat, humans, and other primates. Humans get the virus from 
exposure to fluids of infected people or animals. The disease causes extensive 
bleeding, organ failure, and, for the majority of infected people, death. 
In 2014, a massive outbreak in West Africa caused fear around the world. 
However, a coordinated, intensive public health effort contained and then 
ended the outbreak. As with polio, countries demonstrated their ability to work 
together to confront a danger. The WHO took a leading role in this public 
health response, issuing emergency warnings and implementing a “road map” 
for handling the outbreaks. 
645 TECHNOLOGICAL A DVANCE MENTS AND LIMITATION S—DISEASEDiseases Associated with Longevity
Heart Disease  As longevity increases, diseases that typically do not 
develop until later in life began to assert themselves. Heart disease,  for 
example, is associated with lifestyle, genetics, and increased longevity. One of 
the major discoveries in fighting heart disease was the  heart transplant , first 
performed by the South African Christiaan Barnard  in 1967. Robert Jarvik  
led a team that designed an artificial heart , used as a temporary device while 
the patient waited for a compatible human heart. Other researchers developed 
less invasive procedures: replacing valves, installing stents in arteries, replacing 
the vessels leading to the heart, and developing medications to reduce blood 
conditions that led to heart disease. In the 2000s, people with heart disease 
lived longer than similarly affected people did in the 1970s.
Alzheimer’s Disease  As people lived longer, a form of dementia known 
as Alzheimer’s disease  that affects elderly and some middle-aged people also 
became an increasing concern. Alzheimer’s patients progressively lose their 
memory, eventually leading to a stage in which they do not recognize their 
loved ones. Since the disease undermines bodily functions, it leads to death. 
Researchers continue to search for a cure.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“The health problems faced by the world’s poorest populations are not caused 
by a lack of drugs specifically related to their problems and diseases. The real 
problem is ensuring that these populations can actually access vital medicines. 
Many governments fail their populations in this respect by imposing punitive 
tariffs and taxes on medicines, and by skewing their spending priorities in 
favour of defense over health. The governments of poor countries hinder the 
creation of wealth, imposing obstacles in the way of owning and transferring 
property, imposing unnecessary regulatory barriers on entrepreneurs and 
businesses, and restricting trade through extortionate tariffs . . . [leaving] 
poor populations without the necessary resources to access the medicines 
that could so easily transform their quality of life.
Emerging health threats, ranging from drug-resistant strains of AIDS and 
tuberculosis to avian flu, remind us of the importance of ensuring that the 
pharmaceutical industry continues to discover and develop new drugs. 
Innovation is a fragile process, and it can be weakened or thwarted by poor 
public policies.”

Technology and the Environment
Climate change does not respect border; it does not respect who you  
are—rich and poor, small and big. Therefore this is what we call global 
challenges which require global solidarity. 
—Ban Ki-moon, UN Secretary General, 2007–2016
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of environmental  
changes from 1900 to the present?
During the 20th and 21st centuries, human agricultural, industrial, and other 
commercial activity contributed to many environmental changes that led to 
increased competition for increasingly scarce resources. These problems 
include: 
• Deforestation —the loss of Earth’s trees as a result of cutting down 
trees so the land could be used for agriculture
• Desertification —the removal of the natural vegetation cover through 
expansion and intensive use of agricultural lands in arid and semi-arid 
lands
• A decline in air quality  as a result of increased pollutants in the air
• Increased consumption of the world’s supply of fresh water
Scientists observed that, along with these changes, Earth was getting 
warmer. Ban Ki-moon, a South Korean politician and diplomat, and many 
other world leaders concluded that climate change was a global problem and 
debated the best ways to approach it through global action.
Causes of Environmental Changes
A number of interconnected factors contributed to the environmental changes 
that have taken place since 1900. 
Population Growth  In 1900, the world population was 1.6 billion. By 
1950 it had risen to 2.55 billion, and by 2000 the population was 6.12 billion. 
All of the billions more people that lived on the planet since 1900 needed to be 
fed. Growing populations led to a demand for more croplands. This increase in 
land used for agricultural purposes resulted in deforestation, soil erosion, and 
smaller habitats for many species of plants and animals. 
650 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONGrowing populations affected not only land resources but also water 
resources. Overfishing in the oceans has led to the near disappearance of cod. 
Although fresh water is a renewable resource, growing populations consume 
increasing amounts of it. 
Urbanization  Another cause of environmental change is the increasing 
size and number of cities. By some estimates, by 2025, 5.1 billion people 
will live in cities, which will pressure those who grow food to use intensive 
farming methods that deplete the soil and cause erosion or to clear more forests 
for agricultural use. City dwellers also produce vast amounts of waste, some of 
which pollutes the water they depend on. 
Globalization and Industrialization  The global reach of industrialization 
has also affected the environment. As industry spread to developing countries, 
energy and other natural resources used in manufacturing were in demand, 
drawing further on the reserves of resources. Workers in industry in these 
developing countries are creating a new middle class that increases the market 
for such products as cars that require metals and other resources and that also 
contribute to pollution. 
(σecWsRf(nYiURnPenWDl&KDnJes
While humans have always competed for raw materials and natural resources, 
this competition became more intense as industrialization spread. With an ever-
growing population, humans grappled with hunger, environmental damage, 
and global epidemics.
Resource Depletion  Since the mid-1800s, when petroleum extraction 
began in earnest and oil pumped energy into the Industrial Revolution, about 
half of the earth’s finite resources of this vital resource have been used up. With 
the rapidly growing urban and industrial population, some experts predict the 
remaining half could be used up at a much faster rate, within the next 30 to 40 
years. While supplies of coal will last longer, if coal is used to make up for the 
loss of petroleum, coal reserves could also be depleted in 60 years. (Connect: 
Evaluate the claim that the Industrial Revolutions have created dependency on 
natural resources that will soon lead to their depletion. See Topic 5.5.)
Inequality and Scarce Resources  According to the United Nations, 
31 countries are facing water scarcity and more than 1 billion people lack 
clean, accessible drinking water. As water consumption continues to increase, 
some corporate interests are depleting, polluting, and exploiting water sources. 
The World Health Organization predicts that by 2025, half of the world’s 
population will lack clean and safe drinking water. 
Water scarcity is also linked to other inequalities. Surveys from 45 
developing countries show that women and children bear the primary 
responsibility for water collection in most households. This is time not spent 
working at an income-generating job or attending school. A study in Ghana 
found that a 15-minute reduction in water collection time increases the 
proportion of girls attending school by 8 percent to 12 percent.
651 TECHNOLOG Y AND THE ENVIRON MENT 651In 2015, world leaders agreed to 17 goals for a better world by 2030. Many of 
these global goals address the environmental problems the world faced after 1900 
that relate to extreme poverty, inequalities and injustice, and climate change. 
Changes in the Atmosphere  Factories, automobiles, airplanes, and many 
other products and processes of industrialization have emitted huge amounts 
of pollutants, including carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases —those 
that build up in the atmosphere and let the heat of the sun reach Earth but 
trap it from escaping Earth. At the same time, some of Earth’s natural carbon 
trapping resources, including forests and ground cover for unused farmlands, 
are shrinking. 
Development of Renewable Energy Sources  Concerned about 
unsustainable demands for energy through  fossil fuels (coal, oil, petroleum, 
and natural gas), companies and nations began to invest in renewable energy,  
energy derived from resources that are continuously replenished, such as wind, 
solar, tidal, and geothermal power. At first, high costs slowed development 
of such sources. However, as new techniques and technologies reduced costs, 
these sources became increasingly attractive options. Renewable energy 
provides only about 7 percent of the world’s energy needs. However, a 2018 
study predicted that by 2050, half the world’s electricity will come from wind 
power and solar power.
Increasing Environmental Awareness  In 1968, the “Club of Rome”—
an organization of scientists, industrialists, diplomats, and others—formed in 
Europe to promote solutions to global challenges facing humanity. It called 
attention to concerns that resource depletion would limit economic growth. In 
many countries, people joined a Green Party  that focused on environmental 
issues. Some supported th e Green Belt Movement  to protect wilderness 
areas from urban growth. (See Topic 9.5.) By the 21st century, the Green Belt

Debates About Global Warming
Air pollutants and greenhouse gases prompted debates about rising temperatures. 
Scientists, including those on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change, cited data showing that the emissions of carbon dioxide 
and other greenhouse gases caused by the burning of fossil fuels were causing 
global warming . This is an increase in the average temperature of the world. 
Experts advised governments to reduce their countries’ carbon footprint —the 
amount of carbon dioxide that each person produces. Without a reduced carbon 
footprint, global warming would contribute to catastrophes: more powerful 
hurricanes, more severe droughts, and rising sea levels that could flood islands 
and coastal areas. Some activists argued that the term “global warming” was too 
mild to express the urgency of action. They said that humanity faced a “climate 
emergency” or “climate crisis.” 
Climate-change skeptics, in contrast, questioned whether global warming 
was happening and whether human activities had any influence on the climate. 
In addition, some people in the energy industries resisted the interference of 
government, arguing that market forces would cause consumers to reduce their 
carbon footprint if that became necessary. In contrast, other leaders of energy 
companies began planning for a shift to renewable fuel sources.
Most government leaders, however, agree that global warming requires a 
global response, but countries disagree on how to reduce carbon emissions .

and Western Europe)Developing Countries (including 
China, India, Russia, and Brazil)

Carbon

to reduce their rapidly 
increasing outputs of carbon

provide electricity, cars, and a path out 
of poverty for their citizens. (Developed

huge amounts of coal and oil.)

United States as the world’s 
biggest emitter of carbon 
dioxide. Developing countries emit far less 
carbon dioxide per person  than 
developed countries do. Therefore, 
developed countries must take the lead 
in restricting their use of fossil fuels.
Kyoto  The first major international agreement to reduce carbon emissions 
was the Kyoto Protocol , signed in 1997. Developed nations in Western Europe, 
along with the United States, argued that developing countries, such as China, 
India, Russia, and Brazil, needed to curb their rapidly increasing output of carbon 
dioxide. However, the United States refused to ratify it, and China and India 
were not required to agree to the strictest terms of the protocol. 
653 TECHNOLOG Y AND THE ENVIRON MENTGlobal Action at Paris  In 2015, 195 countries signed a deal, the Paris 
Agreement , that gave new hope for progress against global warming. Leaders 
of both the United States and China supported this new deal. However, in 2017, 
President Donald Trump announced that the United States would withdraw 
from the Paris Agreement.
Climate Activism  Increasing global temperatures led to calls to action. 
“You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their 
future in front of their very eyes,” 15-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg 
raged in a speech at a United Nations climate conference in 2018. Beginning 
with a solo protest in her native Sweden, Thunberg eventually led a global 
climate strike with more than 1.6 million participants in more than 125  countries. 
Extinction Rebellion, a climate activist group formed in 2018, engaged in 
civil disobedience in London, blocking a main bridge and key intersections for 
more than a week, chaining themselves to the headquarters of big companies, 
and interrupting “business as usual” in other ways. About a thousand people 
were arrested, but the group succeeded in having Members of Parliament call 
a citizens’ assembly to discuss ideas for addressing the climate emergency. 
Many other citizen groups are pressuring lawmakers in many countries to 
take necessary steps to avert the worst consequences of continued warming 
predicted in reports from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change.
A New Age?
What should people call the time period we live in? Traditionally, geologists 
have called the current period the Holocene epoch. Holocene  means “entirely 
recent.” This time period started about 11,700 years ago, at the end of the last 
significant ice age. 
However, some scientists believed humans have left the Holocene. They 
wanted to call the present time the Anthropocene . This term means “new 
man.” These scientists wanted to change the name because humans now affect 
almost the entire planet. In 2019, a panel of scientists voted to approve the 
name. Anthropocene  reflects the idea that humans are the strongest influence 
on Earth’s climate and environment—for better and for worse.

CONTEXT S
The geopolitical context of environmental change provides one lens 
through which to see complex interrelationships. Economic context 
provides another useful lens, as Sean Mcelwee explains below:
“Marx’s ideas about overproduction led him to predict what is now 
called globalization—the spread of capitalism across the planet in 
search of new markets. µThe need of a constantly expanding market 
for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of 
the globe,’ he wrote. µIt must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, 
establish connections everywhere.’ While this may seem like 
an obvious point now, Marx wrote those words in 1848, when 
globalization was over a century away. And he wasn’t just right about 
what ended up happening in the late 20th century—he was right about 
why it happened: The relentless search for new markets and cheap 
labor, as well as the incessant demand for more natural resources, are 
beasts that demand constant feeding.”

Economics in the Global Age
A market economy is to economics what democracy is to government: 
a decent,  if flawed, choice among many bad alternati]es
 —Charles Wheelan, Naked Economics:  Undressing the Dismal Science  (2002)
Essential Question:   How did the global economy change and remain the 
same from 1900 to the present?
Global trade exploded with the end of the Cold War. The new global economy 
was part of a renewed emphasis on market-oriented policy advocated by leaders 
such as Ronald Reagan  in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in Great 
Britain. They advocated cutting taxes, regulations, and government assistance 
to the poor as a way to promote economic growth. As Wheeler pointed out, 
this was a flawed choice producing greater wealth for many but hardships 
for others. At the same time, revolutions in information and communications 
technology led to the growth of knowledge economies in some regions, while 
industrial production and manufacturing were increasingly situated in Asia 
and Latin America. 
Acceleration of Free-Market Economies
Globalization is interaction among peoples, governments, and companies 
around the world. The Indian Ocean trade and European imperialism are both 
examples of globalization. However, the term usually refers to the increased 
integration of the global economy since the 1970s. The Eastern Bloc nations 
that had been under Soviet control suddenly could trade freely with capitalist 
democracies. India and other countries that had been nonaligned during the 
Cold War relaxed restrictions on trade in the 1990s. This opening up of a 
country’s economy is called economic liberalization .
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher wanted free markets , which are 
economic systems based on supply and demand, with as little government 
control as possible. While Reagan and Thatcher were strongly nationalistic, 
corporations used the shift in emphasis to move jobs to countries with lower 
wages, lower taxes, and fewer regulations. Critics charged that globalization 
led to labor exploitation and environmental damage.
658 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONEconomic Liberalization in Chile  In Chile in 1973, Augusto Pinochet  
took power in a U.S.-backed coup against a democratically elected socialist 
government led by Salvador Allende. Pinochet ruled from 1 to 10. Then 
a coalition of citizens ousted him because of his violent tactics. Indicted for 
kidnapping, torture, money laundering, and murder, Pinochet died in 2006 
before he could be convicted. “We buried our democracy, and we buried 
freedom,” the Chilean author Isabel Allende said about his rule.
However, during his rule, the Chilean economy took a turn away from 
state control toward a free-market approach. Among the goals of this approach 
were privatizing formerly state-run businesses and taming the serious inflation 
Chile was experiencing. Economists known as the Chicago Boys because they 
studied under free-market economist Milton Friedman at the University of 
Chicago helped design Chile’s economic reforms. The reforms were unpopular 
because they did not address poverty and other social concerns,  and Pinochet 
used repression to enact them. Subsequent administrations, however, guided 
the economy with a balanced approach, using a combination of economic 
growth as a result of free trade and government programs to significantly 
reduce poverty. (Connect : Evaluate the success of the free-market economic 
approach of both Chile and the Soviet Bloc. See Topic 8.9.)
Chinese Economic Reforms  Economic liberalization reached China as 
well. In 1981, Deng Xiaoping  became the Chinese leader. Under him, the 
Communist Party backed away from its commitment to economic equality, 
and more actively promoted economic growth. Deng called his policy “Let 
some people get rich first.” The government took several steps to open up the 
economy, even as it kept overall control:
• It replaced communes with peasant-leased plots of land where the 
peasants could grow their own crops and sell part of them in markets. 
This reform led to agricultural surpluses instead of the famines of the 
past.
• It allowed factories to produce more products for consumers.
• It encouraged foreign companies to set up factories in special 
economic zones. Foreign firms were attracted to China because of low 
wages and lax environmental laws.
• It  reopened the Shanghai stock market and allowed private ownership 
of some businesses.
Some Chinese thought that these economic reforms should be accompanied 
by political reforms, such as freedom of speech and the press and the end 
of the Communist Party’s monopoly on political power. Political discourse 
did become somewhat freer than in the past. In 1989, however, a large but 
peaceful student-led demonstration in Tiananmen Square  in Beijing was met 
by force from the government. Soldiers using guns and tanks broke up the 
demonstrations, killing hundreds of people. (See Topic 9.5.)
659 ECONO MICS IN T HE GLOBAL AGE 659Economic Change: New Knowledge Economies
In the late 1900s, revolutions in information and communications technology 
led some countries to undertake a new kind of economy—the knowledge 
economy . A knowledge economy creates, distributes, and uses knowledge and 
information. Designers, engineers, teachers, and many others have jobs in the 
knowledge economy. In the United States, the knowledge economy is evident 
in the vast stretch of technology companies in Silicon Valley in California, 
where workers use their knowledge to create ways for other people to use 
theirs through technology, communication, innovation, and collaboration. 
Knowledge Economy in Finland  In many cases, knowledge economies 
have evolved with the explosion of information and communication technology. 
In knowledge economies, governments and investors put resources into 
research, education, innovation, and technological infrastructure. 
Finland, for example, had been an agrarian economy in the 1950s but 
followed other European countries in industrializing after World War II. 
When the Soviet Union collapsed, Finland lost one of its main customers 
of manufactured goods and faced an economic crisis. In the 1990s, Finland 
turned a corner by entering the global marketplace, encouraging competition, 
and establishing the Science and Technology Policy Council to set a direction 
of economic growth through technology and innovation. Finland experienced 
great economic growth in this endeavor and led the way in the development 
of mobile phones. By investing in education and communications technology, 
Finland was able to build on its success with mobile phones and establish 
software companies. These industries required highly educated workers, while 
outsourcing hardware production to countries with lower labor costs. 
Japanese Economic Growth  Japan followed a somewhat different 
path. After World War II, Japan implemented economic policies similar to 
18th-century mercantilist policies that were designed to increase exports and 
decrease imports, as well as policies to boost competitiveness: 
• To encourage exports, the government coordinated its finance and 
labor policies with large corporations and gave them subsidies to help 
them keep their costs low. 
• To discourage imports, the government used high tariffs and other trade 
restrictions on goods made abroad. 
• To prepare its citizens to be productive workers, Japan emphasized 
rigorous education. 
These policies, aided by large investments from the United States and other 
countries, turned Japan into a manufacturing powerhouse. 
However, Japan’s impressive growth came at a high cost for its consumers. 
Low-wage workers producing items for foreign markets often could not afford 
to buy what they made. For example, Japanese-made cars were more expensive 
660 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONin Japan than they were in the United States. Over time, Japanese unions 
became strong enough to negotiate higher wages, and international pressure 
forced Japan to relax its trade restrictions. Japan’s economy diversified, and it 
became a knowledge economy and an international center of banking, finance, 
and information technology. Although Japan’s growth slowed after the 1980s, 
Japan remained the third-largest economy in the world in 2014, behind only 
the United States and China.
Closely following Japan’s economic model were four states known as 
the Asian Tigers —Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Like 
Japan, these states prospered through government-business partnerships, high 
exports, intense education, and a low-wage workforce. The success of the 
Asian Tigers and China raised hundreds of millions of people from poverty.
Economic Continuities: Shifting Manufacturing
As the knowledge economy develops in some regions, industrial production 
and manufacturing in those regions, including in the United States, have 
declined. Manufacturing plants are increasingly located in Asia and Latin 
America rather than the United States and Europe. Countries in both Asia and 
Latin America have become known for their contributions to the textile and 
apparel industries, though they manufacture many other products. So while it 
has moved to different regions, manufacturing continues to play a key role in 
the global economy. 
Vietnam and Bangladesh  Importers who once purchased their 
manufactured goods from China have been finding other options in such Asian 
countries as 9ietnam and Bangladesh, where labor costs tend to be significantly 
lower than in China where they are already significantly lower than in the 
United States and Europe). Both Vietnam and Bangladesh have become 
known for their exports of clothing. In compounds the size of small villages 
in some places, garment manufacturers—often funded by foreign investors— 
churn out the clothes that end up on hangers in stores in developed countries. 
Clothing accounts for 80 percent of exports from Bangladesh. Phones are the 
largest export from Vietnam, worth about $45 billion in 2017, with apparel and 
electronic goods each bringing in $25.9 billion. 
Workers in both Vietnam and Bangladesh have mounted strikes in recent 
years, protesting both low wages and poor working conditions. Their pay has 
increased slightly as a result, but not enough to keep up with rising costs of 
living.
Manufacturing in Mexico and Honduras  In 1994, the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico negotiated NAFTA , the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. This agreement encouraged U.S. and Canadian industries to 
build maquiladoras  (factories) in Mexico that used low-wage Mexican labor 
to produce tariff-free goods for foreign export. Many factories hired large 
numbers of young women and exposed them to harsh working conditions. 
661 ECONO MICS IN T HE GLOBAL AGELabor unions in the United States complained that NAFTA led to the export of 
thousands of U.S. jobs to Mexico, where wages and benefits were lower and 
safety and environmental standards were weaker.
Honduras in Central America, the second largest exporter of textiles in the 
Americas, has sought to upgrade its manufacturing using principles of 
sustainability—recycling or treating its waste materials—and fair labor 
practices, including housing and education plans for workers, through business-
government partnerships. As in Vietnam and Bangladesh, considerable 
business investment comes from enterprises in South Korea and Taiwan.
Transnational Free-Trade Organizations
Several organizations contributed to the growth of the global economy in the 
decades following World War II. Some countries joined regional organizations 
such as the European Economic Community, Mercosur  (in South America), 
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) . Many countries 
signed an international accord, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) , which lifted restrictive barriers to trade. Protective tariffs , which are 
taxes on foreign imports, had been at a world average rate of 40 percent before 
GATT. By lowering and eliminating many tariffs, the agreement promoted 
more international trade and helped restore economic prosperity to war-
ravaged Europe. By the 1990s, average tariff rates had sunk below 5  percent, 
easing the movement of goods across national borders and lowering prices for 
consumers.

662 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO)  took over GATT’s 
operations. The WTO made rules that governed more than 90 percent of all 
international trade. In part because of its power, the organization became 
controversial. Its meetings were closed to the public, and its board members 
represented mostly corporate interests. Also, the organization’s rules favored 
trade over consideration of issues of moral concern. For example, through 
strict application of WTO rules, a member nation that refused to buy clothing 
made by sweatshop labor could suffer trade sanctions from the organization.
Multinational Corporations
A multinational corporation  is one that is legally incorporated in one country 
but that makes or sells goods or services in one or more other countries. The 
joint-stock companies of the Commercial Revolution, such as the British 
East India Company and Dutch East India Company (see Topic 4.5) were the 
earliest examples of multinational corporations. Multinational corporations 
were also the business means through which imperialist nations made their 
wealth during the age of imperialism, exploiting the resources and labor of the 
colonized regions for profit in home countries.
Today’s multinational corporations take advantage of both knowledge 
economies and more traditional manufacturing and industrial economies. 
They employ leading edge workers in the knowledge economy—software 
designers, communications specialists, and engineers—and at the same time 
hire low-wage workers abroad to make their products. They also have a global 
market in which to sell their goods and services. 
To free-market supporters, multinational corporations produce the greatest 
gains for both developed and developing countries. For example, in the 
early 1990s, India opened its markets and allowed in more imports. With its 
highly educated, English-speaking workforce, India became a software and 
information technology powerhouse, drawing investments from American 
and European companies that wanted to outsource jobs and lower labor costs. 
Multinational corporations, such as Microsoft  a n d  Google , also invested in 
the Indian economy. The influx of corporate wealth and foreign goods created 
a thriving consumer culture among India’s middle class, the ranks of which 
swelled tremendously after 2000. In 2014, the Indian middle class was estimated 
to be the largest of any country in the world, with more than 350 million people.
The India-based multinational corporation Mahindra & Mahindra , 
which produces cars, farm equipment, military vehicles, and electrical energy, 
is headquartered in Mumbai, India, but has operations not only throughout 
India but also in South Korea, China, Australia, the United States, South 
Africa, and other Africa nations. Some multinational corporations are 
criticized because they lack a strong national identity and therefore do not 
necessarily adhere to the ethical standards of their home country. They are 
also criticized for exploiting workers and establishing their operations in such 
663 ECONO MICS IN T HE GLOBAL AGEa way that they avoid as many taxes as possible. Mahindra & Mahindra, in 
contrast, has received awards for its socially responsible corporate practices 
and is considered one of the most trusted businesses in India.
In contrast, Swiss-based multinational Nestlé  corporation, the largest food 
company in the world, has been the subject of many controversies and 
criticisms, including purchasing cocoa for its chocolate products from suppliers 
who use child labor and engage in cocoa production on protected lands. It has 
also faced criticism for its bottled water business for its attitude toward drinking 
water as a product rather than a human right. At the same time, Nestlé invests 
in a number of research programs aimed at sustainable agriculture and training 
for farmers.

664 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONMULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Questions 1–3 refer to the passage below. 
“[Google] has become famous in India for its program of Saathis—the Hindi 
word for friend—which it launched in 2015 to help draw more women online. 
Women make up a small percentage of internet users in the country. Google 
partnered with Tata Trusts, the philanthropic arm of India’s manufacturing and 
retail conglomerate, and recruited about 60,000 so-called Saathis, all women, 
in more than 200,000 villages across India, to teach other women how to get 
online. Google trained the Saathis and gave them each a smartphone, while 
Tata pays them a stipend of about $40 a month. . . . 
Google claims the Saathis have so far trained about 22 million people, 
mostly women, in basic skills like how to make WhatsApp calls and pay bills 
online. It aims to reach about 300,000 villages by the end of this year. Several 
Saathis and their trainees have seized the chance to start cottage industries 
with their new Internet skills, downloading instructional videos on YouTube 
on how to make homemade honey or embroider shirts, for example. . . .  
µI learned how to decorate bangles with thread and stones on YouTube,’ says

“To take advantage of opportunities provided by globalization, 
firms have become multinational, establishing worldwide supply, 
production, and distribution networks. Many workers at firms that 
have successfully adapted to globalization have benefited, but large 
numbers of U.S. jobs have disappeared due to foreign competition 
or to offshoring by domestic firms. In effect, globalization means a

CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSES667
9.5
Calls for Reform and Responses
We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage  
of po]erty, depri]ation,  suќering,  gender and other discrimination  
—Nelson Mandela (1918–2013)
Essential Question:   How have social categories, roles, and practices 
changed and stayed the same since 1900?
In the age of global economics, global transportation and communication, and 
global devastation from war, human rights were, for the first time, also elevated 
to the level of global discourse, which challenged long-held assumptions 
about race, class, gender, and religion. Efforts to establish and safeguard 
human rights opened doors of educational and professional opportunity and 
political participation for some who had previously been excluded. People 
sought liberation from the “continuing bondage,” in Nelson Mandela’s terms, 
that had kept them in poverty. People around the globe also began to protest 
the inequalities and environmental damage that globalization had created or 
reinforced. 
An Era of Rights
In December of 1948, the United Nations laid the groundwork for an era of 
rights when it adopted a foundational document, the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights , asserting basic rights and fundamental freedoms for 
all human beings. It stated that everyone is entitled to these rights without 
distinctions based on “race, colour [color], sex, language, religion, political or 
other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.” 
The UN and Human Rights  Since its creation, the United Nations has 
promoted human rights , basic protections that are common to all people. 
As part of its humanitarian work, the UN created the United Nations 
International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF)  in 1946 to provide 
food for children in Europe who were still suffering more than a year after the 
end of World War II. In 1948, the UN formalized its position on human rights 
in the Universal Declaration. Since that time, the UN has investigated abuses 
of human rights, such as genocide, war crimes, government oppression, and 
crimes against women. 
668 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe International Court of Justice is a judicial body set up by the original 
UN charter. It settles disputes over international law that countries bring to it. 
Also called the World Court, it has 15 judges, and each must be a citizen of a 
different country. It often deals with border disputes and treaty violations.
Another main aim of the UN is to protect refugees , people who have fled 
their home countries. In times of war, famine, and natural disasters, people 
often leave their country and seek refuge in a safe location. Working through 
sub-agencies such as NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and the agency 
UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), the UN provides 
food, medicine, and temporary shelter. Among the earliest refugees the UN 
helped were Palestinians who fled the disorder when the UN partitioned 
Palestine to create the state of Israel in 18.
Global Feminism  On January 21, 2017, the day after Donald Trump’s 
inauguration as president, the Women’s March on Washington drew about 
500,000 demonstrators standing up for women’s rights and other concerns. 
However, the march drew even more power from the millions more 
demonstrators who took part in locations on every continent around the 
globe, from Antarctica to  Zagreb, Croatia and from Buenos Aires, Argentina 
to Mumbai, India. As many as five million people stood together that day 
representing a global solidarity for women’s rights. That march was the most 
dramatic sign of global feminism, but other landmark events since 1900 had 
done their part to solidify the movement.

669 CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSES669The 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women outlined many rights and protections that are cornerstones of 
global feminism:
• The right to vote and to hold office
• The right to freely choose a spouse
• The right to access the same education as men
• The right to access family planning resources and birth control. 
Cultural and Religious Movements  Discourse on rights also became 
part of cultural and religious movements. For example, the Negritude 
Movement , which took root primarily in French West Africa, emphasized 
pride in “blackness,” the rejection of French colonial authority, and the right 
to self-determination. Léopold Sédar Senghor  of Senegal wrote poems about 
the beauty and uniqueness of African culture and is now regarded as one of 
the 20th century’s most distinguished French writers. (Senghor later served as 
first president of independent Senegal. During the 120s and 10s, American 
intellectuals such as W.  E. B. Du  Bois, Richard Wright, and Langston Hughes 
wrote movingly about the multiple meanings of “blackness” in the world. What 
many now refer to as “black pride”of the 1960s had its roots in the Negritude 
Movement
Inherent rights became a focus of a religious ideology as well. Liberation 
theology , which combined socialism with Catholicism, spread through Latin 
America in the 1950s and 1960s. It interpreted the teachings of Jesus to include 
freeing people from the abuses of economic, political, and social conditions. 
Part of this liberation included redistributing some wealth from the rich to 
the poor. In many countries, military dictators persecuted and killed religious 
workers who embraced liberation theology.
However, advocates of liberation theology had a few notable successes. 
In Nicaragua, they helped a rebel movement topple a dictator and institute 
a socialist government. In 9enezuela, President Hugo Chivez was deeply 
influenced by the movement. Then, in 201, the Roman Catholic Church 
selected a cardinal from Argentina as pope, the first one from Latin America. 
The new leader, who took the name Pope Francis , reversed the Vatican’s 
opposition to liberation theology.
Steps toward Gender Equality
During the 20th century, men and women made great strides toward securing 
some of their rights and participating more fully in professional and political 
life. In the first part of the century the percentage of women who could read 
and who attended college increased, and in country after country, women won 
the right to vote. However, not all the women in a country won the right to 
vote at the same time. In the United States, for example, white women won 
the right to vote in national elections in 1920. Native American and African 
670 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONAmerican women did not have full voting rights throughout the country until 
the V oting Rights Act of 1965. Britain granted women the right to vote in 
118, but at first only women over 0 who met a property qualification could 
do so. British women did not achieve the same right to vote as men until 1928. 
In Australia, white women gained some voting rights in 1894, but aboriginal 
men and women did not gain the right to vote until 1962.

As of 2018, only the tiny country of Vatican City did not allow women 
to vote. Whether women are able to exercise their vote is another issue. In 
Pakistan, women gained the right to vote in 1. However, in 201, women 
cast only 10 percent of votes there.
Steps toward Racial Equality
In the United States, African Americans won major victories against 
discrimination and segregation. Through the 1965 Civil Rights Act,  which 
outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, 
and the 1965 Voting Rights Act , which banned discrimination in voting, the 
federal government stepped in to protect the rights of all citizens. African 
Americans also sought equality of education through desegregation of schools.
South Africa’s Colonial Legacy  South Africa’s system of apartheid , 
instituted in 1948, enforced the segregation of people based on race. Although 
white South Africans made up only 15 percent of South Africa’s population, 
apartheid reserved good jobs and other privileges for them. So-called pass 
laws  required black South Africans to carry identity documents when entering 
areas set aside for whites, which they often had to do when traveling to their 
jobs. They were banned from living in certain areas of the country. Mixed 
marriages were prohibited. Although South Africa had 11 major languages, 
671 CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSESclasses for blacks were taught only in Afrikaans, the language of many of 
the white South Africans who ruled the nation. These dehumanizing decrees 
marginalized the 85 percent of South Africans who were black, South Asian, 
or mixed race. 
The white-dominated South African government had its basis in European 
colonization of Africa in general and the Dutch and British colonization of 
South Africa in particular. The colonizers pushed the native people off the fertile 
lands and gave them no say in government. South Africans began to demand 
equal treatment. “I am not interested in picking up crumbs of compassion,” 
said Desmond Tutu , Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa, and 
human rights activist. “I want the full menu of rights.”
Challenges to Apartheid  In 1964, Nelson Mandela , a leader of the 
African National Congress (ANC) , was imprisoned for life for agitating 
against apartheid. The ANC’s primary goals were to end white domination 
and create a multiracial South Africa. Mandela’s imprisonment throughout the 
1960s, 1970s, and 1980s inspired a global movement to end apartheid. Black 
protests in South Africa, which were often peaceful, were crushed violently by 
the government’s forces. South Africa’s reputation grew worse in the eyes of 
the global community. Musicians staged concerts calling for Mandela’s release 
from prison, college students urged universities and corporations to divest 
from South Africa, and many countries voted for strict economic sanctions 
against the country. The United Nation expelled South Africa in 1974 because 
of its apartheid,
As South Africa became a pariah state  (undesirable state) in the 1980s, 
its leadership began to take notice. Mandela himself began negotiations with 
the government in 1986 while still in prison. In 1989, F. W. de Klerk  became 
the nation’s acting president. He recognized the need for change. Within six 
months, de Klerk announced Nelson Mandela’s release from prison.
Although euphoria was high in the weeks following Mandela’s release, 
apartheid remained the law of the land. Police violence against protesters 
persisted, which stalled negotiations between Mandela and de Klerk. However, 
a series of reforms in the 1990s ended apartheid. In 1994, South Africa held 
its first free elections and rejoined the United Nations. The African National 
Congress won the majority of the seats in the Parliament. The Government 
of National Unity was established with ANC members in the majority. On 
May 10, 1, Nelson Mandela was sworn in as president, South Africa’s first 
black leader.
Uniting South Africa  Immediately the Government of National Unity set 
up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) . Unlike the Nuremberg 
Trials that sought retribution for crimes against humanity committed by Nazis 
during World War II, the TRC sought to restore and establish an atmosphere 
of trust in the new multiracial South Africa. The TRC organized a series of 
19 public hearings designed to expose the truth of human rights violations that 
had occurred during apartheid, while at the same time granting amnesty to 
members of the apartheid regime who agreed to testify. 
672 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONCaste Reservation in India  The fight for civil rights was also a global 
effort as people from different races and social classes began to demand 
equality. In India, the 1949 Constitution outlawed discrimination against the 
Dalits , also known as untouchables. Pakistan outlawed discrimination against 
Dalits in 1953. Before then, many people believed that being touched by a 
Dalit required the person who was touched to undergo a cleansing ritual. 
People in India and Pakistan continued to discriminate against Dalits until 
well into the 21st century.
To open doors of opportunity to social groups or castes that had faced 
historical discrimination, the government of India established the caste 
reservation system . Through this system, the government guaranteed that a 
certain percentage of government and public sector jobs and enrollment in 
higher education would be set aside for people whose caste had conferred an 
underprivileged life.

Nelson Mandela voted for the first time in 1994, at age 76. In that 
year, he was selected as president of South Africa. 
673 CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSESHuman Rights Repression in China  
After the economic reforms of the late 1980s and 1990s, China quickly 
became an economic powerhouse. The economic liberalization, however, was 
not matched by democratic reforms. The Chinese Communist Party CCP 
ruled the People’s Republic with an iron fist. It censored the news industry 
and controlled what students were taught in primary and secondary schools. 
Such practices limited freedom of speech and thought. The CCP also required 
all nonstate organizations and groups to register with the government. 
International nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were not free to operate 
in China unless they were willing to undergo strict regulation. Opposition 
political parties did not stand a chance in China’s governing system, although 
some debate was allowed in the legislative process. Overall, however, the 
governing system was designed to thwart all challenges to the CCP’s authority. 
How could the CCP have such power" The Communists had controlled 
China since 1949. The government owned and controlled all industries. 
Government officials had killed or imprisoned those who had spoken out 
against previous government actions, such as the Great Leap Forward.
Tiananmen Square  Chinese intellectuals and students had a history of 
protesting against their government based on the May Fourth Movement in 
1919. In the spring of 1989, pro-democracy activists organized a public event 
mourning the death of a sympathetic high official. The protesters demanded 
a chance to speak with Chinese leaders about freedom of the press and other 
reforms. After the Chinese government refused to meet with the activists, 
citizens in more than 400 Chinese cities staged sit-ins, refused to attend classes, 
and began hunger strikes. Hundreds of thousands of students, professors, and 
urban workers staged a massive protest in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. After 
seven weeks of protests, the government declared martial law. It sent troops 
armed with tanks and assault weapons into Beijing. Citizens responded by 
setting up barricades to block the troops.
On June 4, 1989, the army arrived in Tiananmen Square and attacked the 
unarmed protesters. The Chinese government claimed that nobody died in 
Tiananmen Square that day. No mention of the event was included in school 
texts, and the government blocked all Web sites that discussed the Tiananmen 
Square incident and human rights abuses in China. However, estimates by 
Amnesty International, the International Red Cross , and the New York Times 
indicated that anywhere from several hundred to a few thousand civilians were 
killed. As Chinese officials continue to describe the Tiananmen event as a 
western conspiracy, Tiananmen mothers are prohibited from openly mourning 
family members who died in June 1989. The government still imprisons 
those who commemorate June 4. (Connect: Analyze the methods of protest at 
Tiananmen Square and the May 4th Movement. See Topic 7.5.)
Minority Rights in China  The communist government in China 
has struggled with the demands of the nation’s 55 ethnic minorities. Some 
prominent examples were calls by Tibetans for more autonomy or independence 
674 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONand the complaints of the Uighur people concerning religious and political 
discrimination in the northwest province of Xinjiang. 
In 2011, some of the Mongolian people in China protested against the high 
number of Han Chinese who had moved into Inner Mongolia, an autonomous 
region of northern China, and disrupted their pastoral way of life. The Han are 
the largest ethnic group in China and worldwide. The Mongolians protested 
the environmental damage that came with settled agriculture, strip-mining of 
coal, building of highways, damming of rivers, and overgrazing of land.
Steps toward Environmental Repair
People realized that part of securing their rights in a globalized world is to 
claim their environmental rights to clean water and air and a sustainable planet 
with biodiversity. A number of organizations try to identify and achieve goals 
toward guaranteeing those rights.  
Earth Day  Starting in 1970, citizens in the United States designated 
April  22 each year as Earth Day , a day for people to focus on environmental 
awareness. Organizers hoped to highlight recycling, developing alternative 
energy, eating locally grown and organic foods, and passing antipollution 
legislation. Today, about 174 countries observe and participate in Earth Day 
activities with the Earth Day Network, an environmental advocacy group. 
Greenpeace  Founded in 1971 as an organization to advocate for the 
environment, Greenpeace  grew into a multinational agency with offices in more 
than 55 countries. It battles deforestation, 
desertification, global warming, the killing 
of whales, and overfishing. Greenpeace has 
engaged in lobbying and education, but it 
became famous for its direct actions, such 
as confronting whaling boats in the ocean.
Green Belt Movement  In 1977, 
Kenyan activist Wangari Maathai  founded 
the Green Belt Movement , a direct response 
to the environmental degradation resulting 
from the colonial experience. Women in 
rural Kenya were reporting that streams 
were drying up and their food supply was 
unpredictable. The Green Belt Movement 
helped women work together to plant trees 
to improve the soil and collect rainwater. 
More than that, however, Dr. Maathai and 
the Green Belt Movement helped women 
see their capacity for making changes 
through participation in public life rather 
than leaving decisions to others. 
Source:  Wikimedia Commons
In 200, Maathai won the Nobel Prize for 
Peace, becoming the first African woman 
to do so. “We are called to assist the Earth 
to heal her wounds and in the process heal 
our own,” she said. 
675 CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSESSteps toward Economic Fairness
To counterbalance the strictly commercial interests of the powerful World 
Trade Organization (see Topic 9.4), organizations from around the world

have done as a nation as we leave our terrible past behind us forever.
Let us celebrate our rich diversity as a people, the knowledge that when 
the TRC in its wisdom apportions blame, it points at previous state structures; 
political organisations [organizations]; at institutions and individuals, but never 
at any community. Nor can any individual so identified claim that their brutal 
deeds were the result of some character inherent in any community or language 
group… Above all, we should remember that it was when South Africans of 
all backgrounds came together for the good of all that we confounded the 
prophets of doom by bringing an end to this terrible period of our history.”

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“I think these may be my last words. My name is Chai Ling. I am twenty-
three years old. My home is in Shandong Province. . . . The situation has 
become so dangerous. . . . If we withdraw from the square, the government 
will kill us anyway and purge those who supported us. If we let them win, 
thousands would perish, and seventy years of achievement would be wasted. 
Who knows how long it would be before the movement could rise again? The 
government has so many means of repression—execution, isolation. 
. . . I believe that democracy is a natural desire. It should guarantee human 
rights and independence, and foster self-respect—all of which people are 
entitled to.
Unfortunately, the basic human instinct for independence has been greatly 
inhibited and degraded among the Chinese. . . . The square is our last stand. If 
we lose it, China will retreat into another dark age, the people will once again 
turn against one other, with no real feelings or communication between them. 
If a nation’s own people don’t stay and help it to grow and develop, who will? 
But I will not be there to protect the square because I’m different from the 
others: my name is on the blacklist. I don’t want to die.”

678 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   HUM AN RIGHTS IN A DIGITAL  AGE
This topic has explored an era of human rights in the context of a 
shifting world after World War II and decolonization. The Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights assigns responsibility to each member 
nation to protect and promote the human rights of its people. 
In November 2018, the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, 
Michelle Bachelet, addressed students at the University of Geneva 
in Switzerland, situating human rights in a new context, the digital 
landscape:
“. . . [W]e are seeing increasing reports of the use of bots and 
disinformation campaigns on social media to influence the opinions 
and choices of individual voters. 
Maybe you think this doesn’t apply to us: we are too clever to be 
affected by a bunch of bots. But I am not so sure. It appears the internet 
is increasingly becoming an arena for sometimes very sophisticated 
forces for propaganda—whether by movements of violent extremism, 
or by private actors or even State authorities for political purposes. 
In such a context, can there be any doubt that our freedom to think, 
to believe, to express ideas, to make our own choices and live as we 
wish, is under threat? 
If our thoughts, our ideas and our relationships can be predicted by 
digital tools, and even altered by the action of digital programmes, 
then this poses some very challenging and fundamental questions 
about our future.”
Situate human rights in the broader context of the digital landscape. 
Identify three challenges to promoting and protecting human rights 
in this context.

Globalized Culture
What is interesting is the power and the impact of social media. . . .  
So we must try to use social media in a good way. 
—Malala Yousafzai, Pakistani human rights activist (born 1997)
Essential Question:  How has globalization changed culture since 1900?
At the start of the 20th century, political and social developments led to new 
directions in the arts. Writers, painters, and musicians developed modernism, 
a rejection of tradition in favor of experimentation and uncertainty. World  
War I, a global depression, and World War II had focused attention on survival. 
After World War II, however, citizens of wealthier nations began to develop a 
consumer culture —one in which people tended to focus more on what they 
bought and owned than on where they lived, what they did for a living, or what 
they believed. As trade restrictions loosened and new technology became more 
widely available, people worldwide began sampling arts, popular culture, 
and ideas from faraway countries. However, few could predict the global 
connectedness made possible by social media, nor its power to do both good 
and ill.
Political, Social, and Artistic Changes
Change was everywhere at the start of the 20th century. In just about every main 
field of human endeavor, new perspectives and discoveries were redefining 
the way people thought about their social and physical environments. Key 
political changes also helped shape society.
Political Changes  At the beginning of the 20th century, imperialism 
was creating sometimes fierce competition among nations. Two world wars 
raised the conflict to the level of deadly force, although allies standing together 
developed a good working relationship and understanding of one another. 
The Cold War divided much of the world into camps, stressing differences 
rather than commonalities. After the Cold War, however, both economic and 
cultural barriers fell, bringing countries closer together. In some key ways, 
collaboration gradually replaced competition as nations formed cooperative 
regional organizations such as the European Union and NAFTA as well as 
global associations such as the United Nations for conflict resolution and the 
World Trade Organization to regulate international trade.
680 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONSocial Changes  Along with these changes came social changes. 
International organizations and collaboration brought people of different 
cultures into closer contact with one another, just as international exchanges 
had done in the past. Rights movements—civil rights and women’s rights 
especially—helped bring formerly marginalized voices into the mainstream 
conversation. 
People were also questioning long-held beliefs about humans and their 
environments. Albert Einstein 18±155 and other scientists upended 
people’s understanding of physical reality. Sigmund Freud 1856±1 probed 
the invisible inner workings of the human psyche. Jean-Paul Sartre 105±
1980) philosophized that nothing had meaning. Technological developments 
in communication, transportation, and medical and other scientific knowledge 
brought change after change—from horses to cars, from telegraph to radio, 
from antibiotics to vaccines.
Artistic Changes   These changes were reflected in the visual arts, 
literature, and music of the time. Cubism, a style Picasso used in his famous 
painting “Guernica,” challenged traditional perspective in the visual arts 
(See Topic 7.4.) Stream-of-consciousness writing by such authors as Marcel 
Proust 11±122 and James Joyce 1882±11 rebelled against traditional 
narrative forms, and atonal music such as that composed by Arnold Schoenberg 
18±151 explored musical expression outside of familiar tonalities, to 
name just a few examples. Many scholars suggest these expressions were a 
response to the mechanized, urbanized society widespread in the early 1900s.
An especially vibrant expression of 20th century perspectives was the 
Harlem Renaissance, a “rebirth” of African American culture as it sought to 
distance itself from the stereotyped portrayal of African Americans in literature 
and onstage. During the Harlem Renaissance, writers, poets, musicians, and 
social activists made Harlem a thriving center of energy for black artistic 
expression. Jazz emerged and became an international language.
Global Consumer and Popular Culture 
In the 1920s, popular culture  —the culture of everyday people rather than 
the educated elite—expressed itself through new media: radio and motion 
pictures. Radio, movies, and later television created a culture shared 
throughout a nation, and eventually throughout the world. Radio provided a 
variety of programs, from easy-going comedies to music hours featuring the 
latest in big band entertainment, and during World War II it played a vital 
role in national defense in most industrialized nations. Movies provided relief 
from the anxieties and pressures of the Great Depression while reflecting it 
in its themes. Charlie Chaplin’s “Little Tramp” character of silent movies 
epitomized the down and out. 
Radio and television also ushered in the consumer culture that characterized 
much of the developed world after World War II. The “free” programming 
reaching into the homes of millions of people carried with it commercials 
681 GLOBALIZE D CULTURE681for the products of sponsors. Industry turned from wartime production to the 
manufacture of consumer products, and people around the world were eager to 
buy. In the 1990s, the internet connected people around the globe.

Source:  Pew Research Center for the People.Primary News Source for People in the United States
In the early 21st century, the United States remained the world’s most influential 
culture. Through Americanization , people the world over learned more about 
the United States than Americans learned about the rest of the world. This 
dominance of the United States created resentment among those who felt that 
American popular culture diluted their unique cultural identity. In the early 
21st century, many people around the world considered American consumer 
culture to be throwaway culture . They objected to the waste and pollution 
that was part of the focus on newer, cheaper, more disposable products.
English Spreads and Changes  Through the influence of the British 
Empire and through American movies, corporations, and scientific research, 
English became a second language in much of the world. In the early 21st 
century, about 300 million people in China were learning English—which was 
about the same as the population of the United States. 
Many English-speaking corporations moved their call centers to India and 
the Philippines, where there were large numbers of fluent English speakers 
who would work for relatively low wages. As more people from other 
countries learned English, they spoke it in new ways. For example, Indian 
English included the word prepone , which meant the opposite of postpone .
682 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONGlobal Brands and Commerce  As multinational corporations advertised 
and distributed their products, global brands  such as Apple, Nike, and Rolex 
emerged. A company called Interbrand names the top global companies each 
year based on financial performance, ability to influence consumer choice, and 
ability to command a premium price. The 2018 winners included Toyota, which 
sells more cars than any other brand; tech giants Apple, Google, Amazon, 
Microsoft, and Facebook; and the company that famously announced its desire 
to “buy the world a Coke” in its 1971 multicultural commercial, Coca-Cola.
Online commerce  makes shopping a global affair as well. Sites such as 
Amazon (in more than 17 countries) and Alibaba (mostly in Asia) make a 
massive selection of items available. The online auction site eBay operates in 
30 different countries. Although their platform is international, these online 
retailers must pay a variety of sales taxes according to the laws of each country 
or state in which they sell products. (Connect: Write a paragraph comparing 
Americanization in the 21st century with assimilation in the 19th century.  
See Topic 6.3.)
*loEal ,nfluences on 3oSular Culture  Although the United States is still 
the dominant culture internationally, influences from other cultures have been 
welcomed in the United States and elsewhere. For example, Indian musicals 
made in Bollywood , the popular name given to the film industry in Bombay 
Mumbai, enjoy popularity worldwide. Bollywood itself is a blend of film 
styles. India makes more films than any other country. 
A style of Japanese hand-drawn animation known as anime  became hugely 
influential. In 2016, 60 percent of the world’s animated T9 shows were based 
on anime. Anime was introduced to American culture in the 1980s through the 
movie Akira. Television shows in the late 1990s, such as  Pokeman and Dragon 
Ball,  brought anime into the American mainstream.
Reggae music  from Jamaica  is global in both its origins and its popularity. 
It emerged in the 1960s, blending New Orleans jazz and rhythm and blues 
styles with mento, itself a fusion of African rhythms and European elements. 
It is associated with the Rastafari religion which promotes Pan-Africanism, the 
connectedness of all Africans whether they live in Africa or in the diaspora. 
It often blended with musical traditions of other countries as its popularity 
became global in the 1970s through the music of Bob Marley.
Another style of music that fused a variety of traditions and became a 
global hit was the Korean music nicknamed K-pop . Its artists, who sang in a 
mixture of Korean and English, became global stars in the early 21st century. 
Their popularity has also boosted the popularity of other South Korean exports. 
In fact they are considered so valuable that the government has invested 
in .-Pop concerts and tours. Internet-based streaming video  sites such as 
YouTube and 9imeo helped popularize .-Pop and other musical styles with a 
global audience.
Social Media and Censorship  Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and other 
forms of social media  changed communication. They can inspire but also 
manipulate, as attested to by Malala Yousafzai , the Pakistani activist and the 
youngest Nobel Prize laureate. People debated their power for good or ill.
683 GLOBALIZE D CULTUREIn some countries, such as China, the government banned social media 
from outside the country. However, China allowed its own forms of social 
media, including WeChat, Weibo, and YuKu. The government censored any 
criticism of the Communist Party that appeared on these platforms.
Global Culture in Sports  The globalization of popular culture included 
sports as well. The establishment of the modern Olympic Games  in 1896 
reflected an early sense of internationalism. In 2016, the Olympics in Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil, attracted about 3.6 billion viewers worldwide. 
Soccer emerged as the most popular sport in the world, in part because 
it required so little equipment that it could be played almost anywhere. The 
World Cup  soccer competition rivaled the Olympics as a global event. 
Basketball also became a global game, and players such as Michael Jordan and 
LeBron James became internationally known. In 2014, the National Basketball 
Association (NBA) included players from 30 countries or territories. In 2017, 
reporters from 35 countries covered the NBA Finals. In 2018, 27 percent of 
major league baseball players were foreign-born, from 21 different countries.
As sports became more popular globally, they also became more available 
to women. Some Muslim female athletes  —including fencers, weightlifters, 
beach volleyball players, hockey players, and figure skaters²competed while 
wearing hijab, known in English as a headscarf. They adapted athletic wear 
so they could compete while following traditional Muslim practices regarding 
female modesty in clothing. Hajar Abulfazi, a soccer player from Afghanistan, 
explained that she wore the hijab to “show the next generation and their parents 
how Afghan women and girls can maintain respect for religion and culture 
while pursuing sports achievements.”
Source:  Thinkstock
Since Olympic athletes represent their home nations, the games demonstrate the strength of 
nationalism. However, since the Olympics draws people together from nearly every country 
in the world, it is also an example of internationalism. 
684 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONGlobal Culture and Religion
Globalization promoted new religious developments. In the 1970s, former 
Beatles band member George Harrison released a song containing the words 
of a Hindu mantra, or sacred utterance. This launched the popularity of the 
Hari Krishna  movement, which was based on traditional Hindu scriptures. 
It quickly gained popularity in the United States and Europe. In what some 
called New Age  religions, forms of Buddhism, shamanism, Sufism, and other 
religious traditions were revived and adapted for a largely Western audience. 
In China in the 1990s, Falun Gong,  a movement based on Buddhist and 
Daoist traditions, gained popularity. Although the communist government 
allowed the movement at first, Chinese authorities began to restrict it in 1. 
The suppression prompted international protests against the Chinese regime 
for human rights abuses.
In the early 21st century, most people around the world identified with 
some form of religion. However, an increasing number of younger people in 
many countries identified as nonbelievers . They were not necessarily atheists 
(people who do not believe in any god) or agnostics (people who believe that 
it may not be possible to know if God exists. Most were simply not affiliated 
with any religious institution.

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that 
follows.
“Western leaders exploited the lure of their popular culture during the Cold 
War. They created radio and television stations such as Radio Free Europe 
Radio Liberty to broadcast as much popular culture material into the Soviet 
bloc as could be programmed. This programming was done to achieve the 
very purpose the Soviets accused it of: to westernize the values of those who 
watched or listened to it. . . . 
In using American pop culture as a tool of the Cold War, Western policymakers 
were exploiting what political scientist Joseph Nye has referred to as µsoft 
power.’ The notion of soft power refers to cultural, social, intellectual, and 
ideological ideas, values, attitudes, and behaviors that influence human life. 
Nye distinguishes these soft forms of power from µhard power,’ which is 
typically associated with the use of violent, coercive tools of social action like 
armies and economic sanctions. Soft power is a significant factor in global 
politics, Nye argues. . . . As such, it provides a way for one people—in the 
case of the Cold War, people in the political West—to change the attitudes 
and behaviors of other cultures without resorting to war or other forms of 
coercion.”

culture since 1900.
688 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION
9.7
Resistance to Globalization
The whole of the global economy is based on supplying the cravings of two 
percent of the world’s population. 
—Bill Bryson, nonÄction  writer (born 1951)
Essential Question:   What were the various responses to globalization from 
1900 to the present? 
While globalization of culture has in many ways raised awareness and 
appreciation of cultural diversity, the economics of globalization have led to 
serious concerns. Resistance to globalization has come from non-governmental 
and governmental sources. A network of opponents to economic globalization 
promotes equal distribution of economic resources, challenging the lopsided 
economy described above by author Bill Bryson. Participants contend that 
corporations and global financial institutions, such as the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF)  and the World Trade Organization (WTO) work to 
maximize profit and sacrifice safety and labor conditions, environmental 
conservation needs, and national independence. 
Some countries, such as North Korea, have resisted economic and cultural 
globalization. Others, such as Saudi Arabia and China, have resisted cultural 
globalization, particularly through controlling the internet. These countries want 
goods and money to flow freely among nations, but they are more restrictive of 
how people and ideas cross borders.
The Roots of Globalization and Anti-Globalization
Globalization affected the relationships among and within nations. After  
World War II, several organizations contributed to the growth of a global 
economy. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the European 
Economic Union, Mercosur (in South America), and the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) all formed between 1947 and the early 1990s. These 
organizations were meant to help economies and expand prosperity. Falling 
tariff rates eased the movement of goods across national borders. 
In 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO) took over GATT’s operations. 
The WTO makes rules for more than 90 percent of international trade. The 
rules and its closed board meetings led people to believe that the WTO did not 
care for their welfare. (Connect: Compare the economic practices of the 17th 
century to globalization in the 20th and 21st centuries. See Topic 4.5.)
689 RESISTANCE TO GLOBALIZATIONThe “Battle of Seattle”  In 1999, protests erupted at a WTO conference 
in Seattle. The WTO had planned a round of trade negotiations for the new 
millennium. Then more than 40,000 protesters arrived. Special interest groups, 
including labor unions, family farmers, student groups, and environmentalists 
shut down the WTO’s meeting and drew global attention to the issues of the 
new global economy. Anti-WTO demonstrations took place in dozens of other 
countries as well.
Many people consider the Seattle protests to be the beginning of the anti-
globalization movement. They were also one of the first social movements to 
be coordinated through the internet. However, the WTO itself remained 
powerful. China joined in 2001, increasing the group’s territorial and economic 
reach.

Seattle, Washington.  
Why Resist Globalization? 
Why did people protest globalization when it made goods and services more 
freely available? Opponents had different reasons. Many of them centered on 
the idea that consumers who buy products and services with a few clicks often 
have no idea who creates those products and services and what the short-term 
and long-term costs really are. A series of scandals in different parts of the 
world showed some of the hazards of globalization. Working conditions are 
especially problematic
• Much of the chocolate that consumers bought in the early 21st century 
had its origins in child labor  in West Africa. The largest chocolate 
companies missed deadlines in 2005, 2008, and 2010 to make sure 
their suppliers did not use child laborers. In 2015, the U.S. Department 
of Labor estimated that more than 2 million children took part in 
dangerous labor in the cocoa-growing regions of the world.
690 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• Working conditions in Western nations could also be harsh. In 2019, 
employees of Amazon ’s warehouses described such intense pressure 
to fulfill orders that workers risked being fired if they took a bathroom 
break. At the time, Amazon employed more than 600,000 people and 
another 100,000 at holiday time, though not all of them worked in 
warehouses. 
• In 2013, the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory , an eight-story 
building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, shocked the world. More than 1,000 
people died and another 2,500 suffered injuries. Most of the dead and 
injured were female garment workers who made clothing for Western 
companies. Muhammad Yunus , a Bangladeshi who won the Nobel 
Prize for Peace, called the disaster “a symbol of our failure as a 
nation.” He suggested that companies worldwide set an international 
minimum wage.
Source:  Wikimedia Commons
The Rana Plaza collapse is considered the deadliest structural failure accident in modern 
human history, and therefore also the deadliest garment-factory disaster in history.
Environmental Damage  Critics of globalization pointed out that the 
fuel involved in shipping products vast distances increased the amount of 
greenhouse gases in the environment, thus worsening the climate emergency. 
Also, in the early 21st century, Brazil cut down thousands of square miles of 
rainforest each year to make way for cattle farms. The meat was one of the 
country’s most valuable exports.
691 RESISTANCE TO GLOBALIZATIONProponents of globalization argue that it can help the environment. They 
point out that Costa Rica and other nations have developed ecotourism  
industries that make profits while showing off the country’s natural wonders.
Threats to National Sovereignty  Many liberal groups believe that 
globalization often harms children, workers, and the environment. However, 
many conservative groups also distrust globalization.
In 2016, 52 percent of British voters agreed to leave the European Union, 
an international political and economic organization of 28 countries. This 
British exit was nicknamed Brexit . Britain was a founding member of the EU 
in 1993, but conservative British politicians argued that the EU interfered with 
Britain’s right to govern itself. Many Brexit proponents contended that the EU 
required Britain to accept too many immigrants. 
Negotiations to leave the EU broke down when British prime minister 
Theresa May  was unable to craft a deal that was acceptable to her own political 
party, let alone to the other 27 nations in the EU. May resigned in 2019. Brexit 
critics believed that leaving the EU would be economically disastrous for 
Britain, an island nation that depended on imports.
Economic Resistance
Critics of globalization believe that international agreements and institutions 
can destroy small local businesses. Large corporations could use the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the WTO to achieve their goals, 
but local individuals and businesses could not. For example, many small 
businesses and individuals could not cross state lines or national borders. They 
could not extract the natural resources they needed or use the wide variety of 
labor sources that big corporations and transnational businesses used. In an 
attempt to combat globalization, some businesses, especially restaurants, have 
insisted on providing their customers locally grown or made products. 
Globalization critics also distrusted the World Bank, an international 
organization affiliated with the United Nations. The bank’s mission is to 
improve the economic development of member states. In 1988, about 20,000 
people protested meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in West Berlin. 
Protesters insisted that these agencies favored richer nations over poorer ones. 
In 2001 and 2002, anti-IMF and anti-World Bank protests took place in 23 
countries, including many of the world’s poorest nations. In 2014, the World 
Bank made reforms to its structure and governance, but critics maintained that 
the world’s richest nations controlled the bank.
What Measures Do Anti-Globalists Favor?  The anti-globalization 
movement has grown into a social movement as well. Its followers tend to 
focus on these issues:
• Human rights , which are basic freedoms that every person has, such 
as freedom from slavery and freedom to express opinions
692 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• Fair trade , which is a system that ensures the person who provided the 
good or service receives a reasonable payment for it
• Sustainable development , which means business ventures that allow 
people and companies to make a profit without preventing future 
generations from meeting their own needs
• Debt relief  or debt restructuring  so that countries that owe huge sums 
to the IMF do not have to risk economic breakdown
Anti-Globalization and Social Media 
Anti-globalization activists have used the internet to perpetuate and spread 
their ideas in nearly every country on Earth. However, access to global 
communication through social media outlets has met resistance in some 
countries. In 2009, more than 1,000 rioters clashed with police in the city of 
Urumqi, China. The unrest resulted from tensions between members of the Han 
ethnicity and members of the Uighur  ethnicity, most of whom are Muslim. 
Chinese authorities blamed the riots on the growth of social unrest based on 
Twitter and Facebook and banned both platforms. The government introduced 
a new platform called Weibo  as a substitute. It could stream incoming posts 
while tracking and blocking “sensitive” content. Weibo has become a vehicle 
of negotiation between the Chinese government and its citizens.
In some other countries, governments allow social media platforms but 
influence or control their content. For example, critics contend that Saudi 
Arabian officials use Twitter and Facebook to harass and intimidate citizens. 
“If the same tools we joined for our liberation are being used to oppress us 
and undermine us, and used to spread fake news and hate, I’m out of these 
platforms,” explained Manal al-Sharif , a women’s rights activist. 
In some parts of the world, resistance to participating in an interconnected 
society persists. The coming together of economies and cultures threatens 
some people’s and governments’ sense of autonomy and identity.

694 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONSHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that 
follows.
“Critique of, and resistance to, the spread of consumer culture is as old as the 
emergence of consumer culture in the 18th century. Systematic critique of the 
institutional bases of consumer culture have been offered by social theorists 
that highlight the alienating dehumanizing effects of materialism, while 
others have commented on the envy, possessiveness, and non-generosity . . . 
consumer culture sometimes entails. . . .
Religious, environmentalist, nationalist, and anti-corporate critiques have 
emerged with considerable vigor. Many of these forms of resistance appear to 
be motivated by a global sense of anxiety about the risk to life and happiness 
provoked by the globalization of consumer culture itself. In one global 
study of global brands, the authors found µThirteen percent of consumers 
are skeptical that transnational companies deliver higher quality goods. They 
dislike brands that preach American values and don’t trust global companies 
to behave responsibly. Their brand preferences indicate that they try to avoid 
doing business with transnational firms.’”
Jagdish Sheth and Naresh Maholtra, “Global Consumer 
Culture” in Encyclopedia of International Marketing
(A) Identify ONE thinker from the 18th and 19th centuries who might 
have views consumer culture as described in the passage.
(B) Explain ONE reason some consumers avoid transnational firms, 
according to the authors.
(C) Explain ONE way in which globalization increased despite growing 
resistance in the late 20th century. 
2. Answer all parts of the question that follows. 
(A) Identify ONE example of a state government that resisted 
globalization after 1900. 
(B) Explain ONE social reason for resistance to globalization after 
1990.
(C) Explain ONE reason for resistance to global financial institutions 
after 1990.

9.8
Institutions Developing in a 
Globalized World
We have actively sought and are actively seeking to make the United Nations 
an eќecti]e instrument  of international  cooperation  
—Dean Acheson, U.S. diplomat, (1893–1971)
Essential Question:   How did globalization change international interactions 
between states after 1900?
In an era of increasing globalization, people formed international organizations 
to promote useful working relationships among nations. Dean Acheson, 
a U.S. secretary of state, described how the mission of the United Nations 
UN fit with this goal of maintaining world peace and making international 
cooperation easier. Working through agencies such as the IMF (International 
Monetary Fund) and the World Bank, the UN provides technical advice and 
loans to developing nations. Other international organizations and treaties, 
such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), promote free trade worldwide. However, the United 
Nations was born of the devastation of world wars and preventing conflict was 
its primary goal.
The United Nations: A Structure for Peace
Despite ideological differences, the Allies shared a commitment to preventing 
conflicts from escalating into war. In 1, representatives of the United 
States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China discussed the idea of the 
United Nations. The UN was born on October 24, 1945, a day still honored as 
United Nations Day. At its founding, there were 51 member states. By 2019, 
that number had grown to 193.
League of Nations vs. United Nations  Countries had tried to create a 
similar international organization previously. In 1920, at the end of World War  I, 
the Allied powers created the League of Nations. (See Topic 7.3.) Its purpose 
was to resolve international disputes and prevent another world war. However, 
the United States never joined the League. Some Americans believed that doing 
so would undercut U.S. authority. The League disbanded after it failed to prevent 
World War II. Countries hoped that a new, more powerful organization would 
697 INSTITUTION S DEVELO PING IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLDhelp keep the peace. This time around, all the major powers realized they would 
need to belong for the organization to have any chance of success. 
Assemblies of the United Nations
Within the UN, six main bodies implement its work.
• The General Assembly  is the only UN body in which all members 
have representation. It decides important questions on peace and 
security, admission of new members, and budget. To make a decision, 
a two-thirds majority of those present and voting must agree. Each 
member nation has one vote. 
• The Security Council acts on issues the General Assembly debates. 
It may even use military force against a country accused of violating 
UN principles. The Security Council has five permanent members, the 
leading Allies of World War II: the United States, France, Great Britain, 
Russia, and China. It elects 10 other members on a rotating basis. Each 
permanent members has veto power in the Security Council. Granting 
veto power to these five nations was controversial in 1945. Other 
nations resented giving them so much power. Conflicts among these 
five often prevented the UN from taking action to confront problems.
• The Secretariat  is the UN’s administrative arm.  The secretary 
general leads and influences the entire organization. He or she usually 
comes from a small, neutral nation so one of the more powerful 
countries cannot have an outsize influence on what the UN does. All 
five permanent members of the Security Council must approve the 
secretary general’s selection. Staffers of the Secretariat must take an 
oath of loyalty to the UN and are not allowed to receive instructions 
from their home countries.
• The International Court of Justice settles disputes countries bring 
to it about international law. The court has no power to enforce its 
decisions, but the Security Council may make recommendations or 
take action in response to a judgment. Most countries obey the court’s 
decisions. 
• The Economic and Social Council is the largest and most complex 
part of the UN. It directs economic, social, humanitarian, and cultural 
activities. In the early 21st century, the council promoted green energy 
and looked for ways to raise people’s wages in poorer countries.
• The Trusteeship Council supervised the governments of trust 
territories, including land that is now Israel, Papua New Guinea, 
and Nauru. The council’s mission was to help those areas become 
self-governing and independent. The last trust territory, Palau, 
became independent in 1994. Since then, the council has suspended 
its operations. Some people have suggested that the council should 
become trustees of the seafloor or of outer space. 
698 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe UN and Human Rights
One of the goals of the United Nations was the promotion of human rights. 
The UN adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  in 1948. It 
included several basic rights and freedoms:
• freedom from slavery, torture, and degrading punishment
• equality before the law
• the right to a nationality
• the right to own property, either individually or with others
• freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion, and expression
• equal pay for equal work
• the right to rest and to enjoy paid holidays
• equal rights for children born within and outside of marriage
• the right to adequate food, clothing, shelter, health care, and education
The declaration was a milestone achievement. Individuals from different 
countries, cultures, and legal traditions came together to draft a document that 
set standards for all governments and all people. People have translated the 
declaration into more than 500 languages. Since 1948, the UN has investigated 
abuses of human rights, such as genocide, war crimes, government oppression, 
and crimes against women.
Keeping the Peace
Since the end of World War II, the United Nations has been well known 
for its peacekeeping  actions. Of primary importance is prevention through 
diplomacy. The UN sends special envoys to help resolve problems peacefully, 
mindful that it was formed to prevent “the scourge of war.”
The organization has also frequently sent peacekeeping forces, consisting 
of civilians, police, and troops from member countries, to try to ease tensions 
in trouble spots. The first peacekeeping mission was related to the 18 Arab-
Israeli conflict in Palestine. After that, UN peacekeepers served in the Congo, 
Lebanon, East Timor, and the Balkans. 
Expansion in the 1990s  In 188, the UN had only five active peacekeeping 
operations. By 1993, it had 28. Individual countries supplied soldiers to form 
UN peacekeeping forces. They came from dozens of countries—including 
Canada, Venezuela, Ukraine, Egypt, and Bangladesh. The soldiers were 
usually lightly armed and instructed to return fire only if attacked.
In the 1990s, the United Nations sent peacekeeping missions to hotspots 
in Africa, Central America, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. In Africa, UN 
troops kept peace while Namibia changed from a South African colony to an 
independent state. Peacekeeping troops helped end devastating civil wars in 
699 INSTITUTION S DEVELO PING IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLDMozambique, El Salvador, and Cambodia. In Haiti, they maintained peace 
while a democratic government replaced a military dictatorship.
Some efforts failed. In 1994, UN peacekeepers could not prevent massacres 
in Rwanda. In 1995, UN forces withdrew from Somalia while a civil war raged 
there. The struggle to bring order to Bosnia in the former Yugoslavia took 
years and had mixed results. As a UN officer in Bosnia observed, “It’s much 
easier to come in and keep peace when there’s some peace around.”
Challenges for Peacekeeping Missions  One problem faced by UN 
peacekeepers has been their slow response. By the time countries agree on 
the UN mission and send forces, the war might have grown and become hard 
to control. A second problem happens when people expect the peacekeeping 
troops to stop the fighting instead of simply monitoring a truce, running 
free elections, and providing supplies to civilian populations. By 2019, the 
United Nations was involved in fewer but larger peacekeeping missions. The 
number of missions had dropped to 15, but the number of troops involved had 
increased .

700 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONOther UN Priorities
In addition to assemblies and peacekeeping, the UN has other missions.
Protecting Refugees  The UN also protects refugees. In times of war, 
famine, and natural disasters, people often flee their country and seek 
refuge in a safer location. Working through partners such as NGOs (non-
governmental organizations) and the agency of UNHCR (United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees), the UN provides food, medicine, and temporary 
shelter. Among the earliest refugees the UN helped were Palestinians who fled 
the disorder following the UN partition of Palestine to create the state of Israel 
in 18. In 201, the UN helped refugees who fled 9enezuela and Myanmar.
Feeding the Hungry  In 1961, the UN established its World Food 
Program (WFP)  to provide food aid. Its first missions were in Iran, Thailand, 
and Algeria in 162. Since its founding, the WFP has fed more than 1. billion 
people, many of whom were affected by natural disasters or political unrest.
Supporting Education, Science, and Culture  Fighting in World War  II 
destroyed schools, libraries, and museums in many European countries. In 
1945, the UN created the 8niteG 1ations (Gucational Scientific anG 
Cultural  Organization (UNESCO) . After repairing war damage, UNESCO 
began to focus on developing literacy, extending free education, and protecting 
cultural and environmental sites by designating them World Heritage Sites. 
The United Kingdom, Singapore, Israel, and the United States have all left 
UNESCO in disputes over politics and priorities. Although the UK and 
Singapore rejoined the organization, as of 2019 the United States had not. 
Other UN Missions  The UN also created the World Health Organization, 
which improves human health by controlling epidemics and providing 
vaccines. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) was created to help 
children after World War II. After that, the fund provided aid to children in 
the developing world and at disaster sites. The UN program Human Rights 
Watch (HRW)  has monitored human rights abuses in 100 countries. HRW 
uses the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as its guide and advocates 
for policies that prevent abuses.
The Global Goals  In 2015, the UN General Assembly set 17 goals to 
accomplish by 2030. These included wiping out hunger and poverty, achieving 
gender equality, ensuring clean water and sanitation for all, and fighting 
climate change. On this project, the UN worked with NGOs, including the 
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (Connect: Evaluate the success of the 
United Nations in handling political crises compared to its success in dealing 
with other priorities. See Topic 8.5.)
International Financial NGOs
Several NGOs have worked closely with the United Nations on economic 
issues. Each NGO was independent and caused controversy. 
701 INSTITUTION S DEVELO PING IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLDThe World Bank  Created in 1944, the World Bank fought poverty by 
providing loans to countries. It first focused on dams and roads. Later it expanded 
its mission to social projects, such as education and disease prevention. Critics 
charged that the World Bank often ignored how its projects damaged the 
environment and local culture. For example, a dam might permanently flood 
many farms. A highway might promote growth, but the resulting profits might 
all go to investors overseas rather than people living in the region.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF)  Created in 1945, the IMF  
was designed to help a country’s economy by promoting stable currency 
exchange rates. It focused on making short-term loans and providing economic 
advice to countries. Some economists argued that conditions on IMF loans 
failed to take into account each country’s individual needs. Large, wealthy 
nations influenced the IMF. It acted on their behalf, critics insisted, even while 
it claimed to help developing nations. 
The IMF and the World Bank worked together to create Pathways for 
Peace in 2018. This report described how countries could work together to 
prevent violent conflicts.
NGOs Separate from the UN
Although the UN is well funded and powerful, other NGOs also help maintain 
world peace and improve communication among countries during a time of 
globalization. For example, the International Peace Bureau  was founded in 
181 and won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 110. It began working for nuclear 
disarmament in the 1980s. It also lobbied governments to reduce military 
spending. By 2019, it had 300 member organizations in 70 countries. The chart 
on the next page lists other international organizations committed to peace and 
cooperation.

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“Whatever the international tensions and the UN shortcomings, the existence 
of the United Nations as an institution for all countries created a sense of being 
part of a world-wide community and helped develop a global consciousness. 
For developing countries, the United Nations provided a political arena and 
spearheaded their struggle for decolonization and political emancipation, 
engendering a feeling of empowerment and importance, and providing a 
means of participating on the world stage as equals. . . . 
The norms and standards set by the United Nations specialized agencies 
have enriched life, both nationally and internationally. The smaller and more 
technical specialized agencies like the International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the International 
Civil Aviation Organization ICAO, the Universal Postal Union UPU, etc. 
have, through their standards and regulatory regimes, helped in maintaining 
international order in such diverse areas as meteorology, communications, 
aviation, etc. Successive global conferences convened by United Nations 
organizations have helped to identify and focus global attention on new 
problems relating to such issues as environment, population, energy, science 
and technology, food and nutrition and women’s place and role in society and 
social development in general.”

705 INSTITUTION S DEVELO PING IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLDTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   C OMPARE TWO ARG UMENTS ON THE 
UNITE D NATION S
Is the United Nations still relevant? That was the question posed in 2006 
by the University of Pennsylvania Law Review as part of its Debate 
series. Two law professors participated in the written debate. Excerpts 
from their conflicting answers to that question appear below.
Read the following two statements on the United Nations. Explain in 
your own words the gist of each one. Then compare the arguments 
and write a few sentences summari]ing the differences Eetween them
“The UN offers . . . the possibility for wide, and sometimes even 
universal, participation in the creation of the legal rules that regulate 
international affairs. Every state is represented at the UN and can 
be included in the processes of international lawmaking. While 
it is true that bilateral or regional agreements may result in deeper 
levels of commitment—greater synergies of interests are likely to 
be found amongst smaller numbers of states—the challenges and 
dangers the global community faces today demand the near universal 
participation in legal regimes made most possible through the UN. 
Whether international law seeks to regulate the Internet, respond to 
global warming, combat international terrorism, or address pandemic 
diseases, the exclusion or defection of only a small number of states 
may well render the broader enterprise of legalization worthless. 
A handful of serious polluters, a few safe havens for terrorists, or 
even one epicenter of disease outbreak may well undermine an 
otherwise global legal regime. The UN, with its broad reach, its all-
encompassing membership, and its agenda-setting potential may well 
be the best (and perhaps the only) hope for developing universal legal 
regimes that can effectively respond to these new challenges.”
William Burke-White, University of Pennsylvania 
Law School2. Answer all parts of the question that follows. 
(A) Identify ONE way in which international interactions affected 
human rights issues in the late 20th century.
(B) Identify ONE way in which globalization changed international 
interactions in the late 20th century. 
(C) Explain ONE way in which an international organization, other 
than the UN, furthered international cooperation in maintaining 
world peace in the late 20th century. 
706 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION“Professor Burke-White points to various global problems²WMD 
[weapons of mass destruction] proliferation, terrorism, infectious 
disease, and the like. He does not claim that perfect solutions may 
be found for these problems . . . He argues only that no international 
institution can take certain kinds of lawmaking steps regarding these 
issues better than the UN. He shows that the UN has taken many 
such lawmaking steps and that proponents hope that such steps will 
lead to reducing the net harm produced by these problems. He thus 
concludes that the UN is “urgently needed.” Nowhere does he actually 
demonstrate that these lawmaking steps actually reduce the net harm 
produced by the problems. Indeed, if one looks at the actual examples 
cited by Professor Burke-White, it seems clear that the UN has not 
had a positive effect at all.
“Despite an impressive outpouring of words, the UN has done little 
effectively to address the problems mentioned by Professor Burke-
White—like terrorism prevention, global climate change, and 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction—and in some ways has 
even exacerbated them. The UN has done nothing to prevent North 
Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons, and it seems highly unlikely 
that the UN will do anything effective to prevent Iran from completing 
its plans to obtain such weapons. The UN has played a useful role in 
collecting some kinds of information about Al Qaeda, but has actually 
undermined other antiterror efforts.”

Essential Question:   How did science, technology, politics, justice, 
transportation, communication, and the environment 
change and stay the same after 1900?
One perspective shared by many scholars is that the 20th and 21st centuries 
were periods of unprecedented change. One factor in bringing about this 
transformation was the pace of discovery in science and the number of 
technological achievements made since the turn of the 20th century. These 
scientific and technological advancements led to changes in society, politics, 
economics, culture, and the environment. While many outcomes of these 
advancements were positive, they also included some unintended consequences 
that had negative impacts. Responses to these outcomes were varied.
Advances in Science and Technology
People made significant advances in understanding the universe and the natural 
world. These included:
The Origin of the Universe  Several scientific theories tried to determine 
how the universe began. One of the best-known and best-supported theories 
was the Big Bang . This theory, that the universe started with one single cosmic 
event, led to a better understanding of the universe as well as atomic and 
subatomic science.
Wave Science  Discoveries extended human knowledge and use of radio, 
light, sound, and microwaves. These breakthroughs led to improvements in 
radio and cellular communications as well as faster internet service. 
Medical Science  Experts made discoveries about germs, viruses, 
diseases, and the human body. These discoveries led to cures or vaccines for 
common diseases such as polio, tuberculosis, and tetanus. Experts pioneered 
708 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONnew treatments for chronic diseases such as cancer and arthritis. The discovery 
of antibiotics, such as penicillin, helped people recover from or prevent 
infections. Reliable methods of birth control allowed women to control the 
size of their families. These and other medical advancements meant that 
people could live longer and better lives.
Energy Technologies  Inventors and entrepreneurs made advancements 
in extracting and producing oil. Nuclear power  became a significant source of 
energy. Renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, and thermal energy, 
became much cheaper to produce. In 2018, the International Renewable Energy 
Agency predicted that renewable energy sources would be consistently cheaper 
than fossil fuels by 2020. The increase in sources of power led to increased 
productivity, greater production of material goods, and faster transportation.
Communication Technologies  In the 20th century, radio and television 
technology was further developed and telephone coverage increased so that 
most people eventually had a telephone in their homes. Internet communication 
and cell phones then replaced the older systems of communication. As a result, 
the amount and extent of mass communications increased, as did the global 
transfer of information.

Technology advanced from voice communication over wires to massive amounts of data 
available almost anywhere.
709 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLD Transportation Technologies  Airplanes were invented in the first years 
of the 20th century. Later, jet airplanes closed the distance between regions of 
the world. Shipping technology improved, with faster and larger ships carrying 
prefabricated shipping containers. These ships and planes could transport more 
goods farther and faster than ever before. Improved transportation technology 
resulted in the expansion of the global trade network and interactions among 
cultures.
Agricultural Technologies  Scientists produced genetically modified 
crops that were more resistant to drought and disease and had higher yields. 
The most significant effect of these advances, known as the Green Revolution, 
was higher population growth rates, especially within developing countries. 
Another effect was the decline in biodiversity, as these genetically modified 
crops began to be cultivated at the expense of local crop types.
Changes in a Globalized World
Partly as a result of the advances in science and technology, the world 
experienced a number of significant changes to societies, economies, politics, 
cultures, and the environment. 
Social Changes  During this period, the world’s population grew faster 
than at any previous time in history. The increase in population meant increasing 
challenges to existing social orders. The greatest growth rate in population 
occurred in developing countries, while developed countries saw a slowing of 
their population growth. In the developing countries, the population growth 
rate was largest in the lower socioeconomic classes. Improvements in 
communication and transportation made it easier for people to migrate from 
less developed countries to more developed ones. That led to a “brain drain” 
in some countries as more highly educated and skilled people left their home 
countries to find jobs elsewhere. 
Girls and women in this era began to experience an increase in 
socioeconomic status, especially in the more developed countries. Women 
in these societies began to enter careers traditionally reserved for men. 
Their right to vote in elections was finally legalized, and in some cases w 
omen held the highest political offices in their nations. Because birth 
control allowed women to make choices, fertility declined in developed 
countries. Some women chose to put off having children until later in life  
or decided to not have children at all. In some countries, though, women 
saw little improvement in their status as societies resisted the change that 
was happening elsewhere. (Connect: Analyze changes in the practice 
of birth control from the mid-20th century to the early 21st century.  
 See Topic 9.5.)
Economic Changes  The trend toward economic globalization that 
started in the 1th century intensified during the 20th and 21st centuries. More 
developed nations continued to exploit less developed areas of the world, 
harvesting their raw materials and using the less developed areas as markets 
for finished goods. However, significant changes to the world economic 
710 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONorder took place. While the West, and especially the United States, was still 
a dominant economic force in the world economy, its superiority was being 
challenged by new sources of economic strength. Governments in Japan, Hong 
Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore began policies that led to economic 
growth. These policies started the trend of Asian economies, which relied on 
inexpensive labor and high-quality manufacturing, competing against the 
Western economies to make consumer goods and high-tech products. Because 
of the modernization policies established after the death of Mao Zedong, which 
relaxed government control, China eventually became the second-largest 
economy in the world after the United States and a major exporter of goods to 
the rest of the world. India became an economic powerhouse by developing a 
labor force that specialized in software development and engineering.

was reduced, but unemployment 
rose to record levels.
711 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLD Political Changes  Mass protest movements helped bring about political 
and social change. Demonstrations in India showed how to effectively use 
nonviolent resistance and win social and political change.  Activists championed 
civil rights in the United States, Northern Ireland, Canada, and other countries. 
Anti-war protests erupted in the United States and Western Europe. Women’s 
rights movements emerged in the Western democracies and spread across the 
globe. Protests against the system of apartheid brought an end to racial 
segregation in South Africa. Democracy movements led to political protests 
and revolutions in North Africa and the Middle East called the “Arab Spring.”

Tahrir Square was the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution against former president Hosni 
Mubarak and his policies of police brutality. Over 1 million gathered in Tahrir Square on February 9, 2011, 
demanding the removal of the regime and for Mubarak to resign. 
Governments were sometimes slow to respond to these calls for change. In 
some cases, they persecuted, imprisoned, or attacked the protesters. 
During this time period, governments also began to play a larger role in 
managing or regulating their nations’ economies. This increased government 
intervention in the economy was a change from the free-market, or laissez-
faire, economics practiced in the previous era. 
Cultural Changes  Once information (and people) could quickly spread 
across the globe, the pace of cultural interactions and exchanges intensified. 
People all over the world consumed Western culture, particularly aspects that 
originated in the United States, in the form of movies, television shows, and 
music. Fashion styles that appeared in one area of the world quickly were 
imitated and adopted in other regions. A consumer culture spread.
712 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONOne significant change in the process of cultural exchanges from the 
previous era was that these exchanges were often a two-way street. For 
instance, while global audiences watched Hollywood movies, cuisine from 
China, Japan, India, and Latin America often found its way to the plates of 
Americans and Europeans. Music and art from East Asia found a loyal fan 
base in the United States. The Internet helped increase the rate and scope 
of these transfers, and advances in cellular technology made even the most 
remote areas on Earth accessible to these cultural exchanges.
Environmental Changes  In the 20th and 21st centuries, humans 
attempted to overcome the challenges of their environment in many new ways. 
With jet airplanes, travel between points on the globe was measured in hours 
rather than in days, months, or years. New technologies in petroleum extraction 
meant that sources of energy were cheaper and more abundant than previously 
imagined. The Space Age broke the terrestrial limits placed on humans by 
their environment, and space exploration became possible. 
However, although humans overcame some challenges, they also harmed 
the environment. Airborne pollution increased as factories, automobiles, 
and homes got their power from carbon-based fuels. Water pollution also 
increased as people and companies dumped waste in rivers, lakes, and oceans. 
Debates about the sources and causes of climate change developed as average 
temperatures around the globe increased, polar ice caps began to melt, and 
more intense and catastrophic weather events occurred. 
REFLECT ON THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. Continuity and Change  In 1919, economist John Maynard Keynes 
wrote: 
“What an extraordinary episode in the progress of man that age was 
which came to an end in August 1914! . . . The inhabitant of London 
could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various 
products of the whole earth . . . he could at the same time and by the same 
means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprise 
of any quarter of the world . . . he could secure forthwith, if he wished it, 
cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate . . . .” 
 This review topic emphasizes changes. Use Keynes’s description of life 
in 1914 as a starting point for noting continuities since 1900 as well. 
Consider such areas as technology, globalization, relation of developed 
to developing nations, status of women, and cultural exchange. 
2. In one to three paragraphs, explain how science, technology, politics, 
justice, transportation, communication, and the environment changed 
and stayed the same after 1900.

UNIT 9 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   WHAT HAPPENS TOMORRO W?
One reason people study the past is to provide insight into the future. 
And even though predictions are risky, people continue to make them. 
Optimism After Communism  Inspired by the fall of the Soviet 
Union, some intellectuals felt hopeful. In his provocatively titled 1992 
book, The End of History and the Last Man , Francis Fukuyama posited 
that history as people knew it was over. He argued that democracy was 
the ideal form of government and capitalism was the best economic 
system, and they were spreading throughout the world. Eventually, all 
countries would adopt them, and the political and economic conflicts 
that had driven wars in the past would vanish. Critics of Fukuyama 
argued he was wrong, just as Karl Marx had been in the 19th century 
when he also argued that people were entering the final phase of history. 
Cultural Conflict  One of Fukuyama’s former teachers, Samuel 
Huntington, rejected the entire end-of-history argument. In response, 
he wrote 7he &lash of &ivili]ations and the 5emaNing of :orld 2rder  
16. While Fukuyama was influenced by the end of the rivalry 
between the United States and the Soviet Union, Huntington was struck 
by the increasing tensions around religion and culture. He contended that 
people’s beliefs and affiliations would draw the fault lines for conflicts in 
the post-Cold War world. Huntington cited several examples of cultural 
conflict, including Hindu and Muslim tensions in India and the rise of 
Islamic fundamentalism and its hostility toward Western culture. 
Cultural Understanding  Critics asserted that Huntington’s 
generalizations were oversimplified and reflected a pro-Western 
prejudice. One of these critics is Nobel prize-winning economist 
Amartya Sen. In his 2006 work, Identities and Violence: The Illusion of 
Destiny,  Sen rejected Huntington’s suggestion that people of different 
beliefs and ethnic groups could not get along, pointing to the existence 
of peaceful diverse societies around the world. Further, as globalization 
spread through all parts of life, people found many ways to identify 
themselves in the 21st century besides by religion and ethnicity.
Hope in Technology  Debates over the post-Cold War world 
began before the Internet and smartphones were common. By 2011, 
technology was connecting people around the globe. When physicist 
Michio Kaku published Physics of the Future (2011), he was optimistic 
that technology and trade could break down the cultural barriers. He 
held out hope for material abundance and greater peace.

Historical Background
Developing nations are generally described as countries with a less 
developed industrial base; low levels of safe drinking water, sanitation, 
and hygiene; high levels of pollution; and widespread poverty. Developed 
nations are generally described as countries with advanced technological 
infrastructure and developed economies; better educational opportunities; 
greater wealth of the people; and higher living standards.

Two hundred years after the discovery of vaccine by the English physician 
Edward Jenner, immunization can be credited with saving approximately 
9 million lives a year worldwide.  . . So far only one disease, smallpox, 
has been eradicated by vaccines, saving approximately 5 million lives 
annually.  . . Polio could be next.  . . If the year 2000 goal of eradicating 
polio is achieved, the United States will be able to save the $270 million a 
year that is currently spent on polio vaccination. The savings for Western 
European countries will amount to about $200 million a year.  . .In all, 
vaccines have brought seven major human diseases under some degree 
of control - smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever, whooping cough, 
polio, and measles. Most of the vaccines now in use have been available for 
several decades, but only in the last 15 years has protection been extended 
to the majority of children in the developing world. Only about a quarter 
were being immunized when, in the mid-1980s, UNICEF and WHO called 
for a new commitment to regularly reaching 80% of infants by 1990. In 
most nations, that goal was reached and has since been sustained - saving 
over 3 million young lives each year. As frequent disease is also a major 
cause of malnutrition, immunization is also helping to protect the normal 
growth of millions of children.

Life expectancy worldwide has risen for decades. But more people are 
living more years with debilitating [weakening] ailments, according 
to a new study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in 
Seattle. In developed countries, the trouble comes almost entirely from 
noncommunicable [not transmitted directly from one person to another] 
conditions such as heart and lung disease and back pain—ills typically 
associated with lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise. In developing 
nations, however, the prevalence of these ailments is increasing rapidly, 
even as those countries continue to try to stamp out communicable diseases 
such as diarrhea and malaria that have plagued them for a long time. If 
developing nations are clever, though, they can create health policies that 
impede the new threats and keep reducing the old ones.

For the first time in history, residents of high-, middle-, and low-income 
countries are likely to live to 60 years of age and beyond. Longevity [long 
life] is one of the greatest achievements of our modern era—the United 
Nations calls it one of the most significant social transformations of the 
21st century.  . . According to the World Health Organization’s World 
Report on Aging and Health, we still have a way to go. While we may be 
living longer, older individuals are not necessarily living healthier, more 
active lives. The report shines a light on the need for governments around 
the world to develop policies and programs to better meet the health and 
social care needs of citizens throughout their lives.  . . Population aging is a 
major concern for many governments around the world, but perhaps even 
more so for those whose populations are projected to be among the oldest 
in 2050, such as Japan, South Korea, and Germany. According to a global 
study conducted by the Pew Research Center, achieving an adequate 
standard of living in old age is directly influenced by the extent to which 
a country’s population is expected to age healthfully. Improving quality 
of life and functional ability among older people must be geared toward 
helping them effectively manage chronic diseases and complex coexisting 
conditions. By their very nature, these conditions—heart disease, diabetes, 
and chronic obstructive pulmonary [relating to the lungs] disease, to name 
a few—place a burden on individuals, their families, and health systems.

The Conversation , a magazine based on academic research, 2017.
Each year, 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of the illness occurs around the 
world, leading to between 21,000 to 143,000 deaths. About two-thirds 
of these are in developing countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Cholera is.  . . transmitted through contaminated water or food in areas 
with poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water. Cholera is referred 
to as a disease of poverty because of the lack of social development in 
the areas in which it occurs. The constant threat of natural catastrophes 
such as flooding and man-made ones including civil unrest, make the 
management and prevention of cholera a huge challenge in most of 
Africa. Several conditions on the continent make it fertile ground for the 
emergence and rapid spread of cholera. These include: Inadequate access 
to clean water and sanitation facilities, especially in peri-urban slums, 
where basic infrastructure isn’t available. Camps for internally displaced 
persons or refugees, where minimum requirements of clean water and 
sanitation have not been met.  . . Other humanitarian crises including 
flooding and earthquakes, civil unrest or war that causes disruption of 
water and sanitation systems.  . . But generally the lack of comprehensive 
programs for improvement of general public health especially for 
vulnerable populations like refugees and informal settlement residents is a 
challenge.  . . The increase in population, especially in urban.  . . settlements, 
has been exponential over the last two decades posing a major challenge 
for public health as more people flock to the cities in search of jobs.  . . On 
top of this a lack of political maturity in many African countries as well 
as greed for political power has led to civil unrest and chaos which in turn 
has resulted in internal displacements of huge populations.  . . There are 
recommended vaccines that can minimize the spread of cholera. But they 
are rarely used as for most governments this not a priority. Vaccines can 
prevent up to 65% of vulnerable populations from getting cholera.

news and opinion website and blog, 2018.
More than 1 billion people worldwide are infected with diseases of 
poverty. These conditions disproportionately afflict the world’s poorest, 
either in the developing world, or in developed countries with extreme 
inequality. Though well-known conditions such as HI9AIDS and 
malaria are considered diseases of poverty, many of the other illnesses 
that primarily strike the world’s poorest are lesser-known and frequently 
misunderstood. The World Health Organization has designated about 20 
of these conditions as “neglected tropical diseases.” This diverse array 
of conditions—such as leprosy, dengue, Chagas, and elephantiasis, to 
name a few—don’t attract the global media attention or funding that 
certain wide-ranging tropical diseases, such as malaria, have garnered 
in recent years. Neglected diseases cost developing economies billions of 
dollars annually and lock sufferers into a cycle of poverty that is nearly 
impossible to escape.High Income Moderate Income Low IncomeIncome Group

followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is 
best in each case.
Questions 1 and 2 refer to the passage below.
“I will give you my father’s words just as I received them; royal griots 
[storytellers] do not know what lying is. . . . Fear enters the heart of him

towards a great destiny. . . . There is one that will make a great king. He forgets 
nobody. . . . In the same way as light preceded the sun, so the glory of Sundiata, 
overleaping the mountains, shed itself on all the Niger plain. . . . The arms 
of Sundiata had subdued all the countries of the savanna. . . . With Sundiata 
peace and happiness entered Niani. . . . Every king wants to have a singer to 
perpetuate his memory, for it is the griot who rescues the memories of kings 
from oblivion, as men have short memories. . . . The prophets did not write and 
their words have been all the more vivid as a result. . . . But whoever knows the 
history of a country can read its future. . . . Kings are only men, and whatever 
iron cannot achieve against them, words can.”

723 AP® WORLD HISTORY PRACTICE EXAMQuestions 3 and 4 refer to the passage below.
“South-eastern China was also the chief centre [center] of porcelain production, 
although china [Chinese] clay is found also in North China. The use of porcelain 
spread more and more widely. The first translucent porcelain made its appearance, 
and porcelain became an important article of commerce both within the country and 
for export. Already the Muslim rulers of Baghdad around 800 used imported Chinese 
porcelain, and by the end of the fourteenth century porcelain was known in Eastern 
Africa. Exports to South-East Asia and Indonesia, and also to Japan gained more and 
more importance in later centuries. Manufacture of high-quality porcelain calls for 
considerable amounts of capital investment and working capital; small manufacturers 
produce too many second-rate pieces thus we have here the first beginnings of an 
industry that developed industrial towns such as Ching-te, in which the majority of the 
population were workers and merchants, with some 10,000 families alone producing 
porcelain. Yet, for many centuries to come, the state controlled the production and 
even the design of porcelain and appropriated most of the production for use at court 
or as gifts.”
Wolfram Eberhard, A History of China , 1969

easily.
(B) The invention of inexpensive paper created an easier way to 
communicate and to advertise for job openings in the porcelain 
factories.
(C) The spread of gunpowder weapons allowed landlords to force 
rebellious peasants to end their revolts and move into the cities to 
work in porcelain factories.
(D) The changes in agriculture, including the introduction of a 
fast-growing variety of rice known as champa, increased food 
production.

“Apart from his navigational skills, what most set Columbus apart from other 
Europeans of his day were not the things that he believed, but the intensity

upon those beliefs. . . . Columbus was, in most respects, merely an especially 
active and dramatic embodiment of the European—and especially the Medi -
terranean—mind and soul of his time: a religious fanatic obsessed with the 
conversion, conquest, or liquidation of all non-Christians; a latter-day crusader 
in search of personal wealth and fame, who expected the enormous and mys -

forests, and with golden people living in Eden.”

“Montezuma, who with one of his sons and many other chiefs who had been 
captured at the beginning, was still a prisoner, asked to be carried to the roof of 
the fort where he could speak to the captains and the [Aztec] people, and cause 
the war to cease. I had him taken there, and when he reached the parapet on the 
top of the fort, intending to speak to the people who were fighting there, one 
of his own subjects struck him on the head with a stone with such force that 
within three days he died. I then had him taken out, dead as he was, by two of 
the Indian prisoners, who bore him away to his people; but I do not know what 
they did with him.”

than they had dealt with the Spaniards. There they found him dead with a 
chain about his feet and five dagger wounds in his chest. Near him lay many

made by barbarians is all taken from the rightful share of China. By what 
right do they then use the poisonous drug to injure the Chinese people? Even 
though the barbarians may not necessarily intend to do us harm, yet in coveting 
profit to an extreme, they have no regard for injuring others. Let us ask, where 
is your conscience? I have heard that the smoking of opium is very strictly 
forbidden by your country; that is because the harm caused by opium is clearly 
understood. Since it is not permitted to do harm to your own country, then even 
less should you let it be passed on to the harm of other countries—how much

The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to

Source 2
“Even in interpreting the psychology of the worker of the transitional period, 
Marx exhibited a rationalistic bias. The worker’s opposition to the capital -
ist order is a total opposition to its laws, its factories, and its government. 
But this revolutionary consciousness of the worker is to take him next to  
Marxist socialism, where he will accept the factory system and the state, the only 
difference being the abolition of capitalism. Why shouldn’t the revolutionary 
protest of the worker flow into other channels: into rejection of industrialism as 
well as capitalism, into rejection of the socialist as well as the capitalist state?”

“We are making out a full and detailed report but it takes time to collate the enormous 
amount of information which we have collected. The trouble started early on the 
morning of the 16th and both sides were equally responsible. The Hindus started 
putting up barricades at Tala Bridge and Belgachia Bridge and other places to prevent 
Muslims processions coming into the town and Muslims goondas [gang members] 
went round forcing Hindus to close their shops. As previously mentioned in my D.O. 
[daily orders]  of the 15th the air was electric and this caused crowds to gather, lathis 
[heavy stick used as a weapon by Indian police] were produced and in no time North 
Calcutta was a scene of mob riot. By 1100 hours there were brick bat fights all over 
North Calcutta. . . .
Soon after midnight on the 16/17th these gangs fought out the most desperate battles, 
murder and butchery of a worst type were carried on in the side lanes and byways of 
North Calcutta. Round Vivekananda Road/ Central Ave., crossing, about 50 Hindu 
Behari rickshaw pullers were caught in a cul-de-sac and butchered. Further up Central 
Ave., round the temple which stands in the middle, a party of some 30 Mohamedans 
[Muslims] were killed. It was during the period midnight 16/17th and 0700 hours on

deepened the division of Germany and made her reunification exceptionally 
difficult. A dangerous hotbed of war began to form in Europe. In the Far East 
the United States strove to create a hotbed of war in Japan, stationing its armed 
forces and building military bases on her territory.”

743 AP® WORLD HISTORY PRACTICE EXAMQuestions 53 to 55 refer to the passage below.
“The beauty of globalization is that it can free people from the tyranny of 
geography. Just because someone was born in France does not mean they can 
only aspire to speak French, eat French food, read French books, visit museums 
in France, and so on. . . . Globalization not only increases individual freedom, 
but also revitalizes cultures. . . . Thriving cultures are not set in stone. . . . 
It is a myth that globalization involves the imposition of Americanized 
uniformity, rather than an explosion of cultural exchange. For a start, many 
archetypal ‘American’ products are not as all-American as they seem. Levi 
Strauss, a German immigrant, invented jeans by combining denim cloth . . . 
with Genes, a style of trousers worn by Genoese sailors. So Levi’s jeans are in 
fact an American twist on a European hybrid. Even quintessentially American 
exports are often tailored to local tastes. MTV in Asia promotes Thai pop 
stars and plays rock music sung in Mandarin. CNN en Español offers a Latin 
American take on world news. . . . Britain’s favorite takeaway is a curry, not a 
burger: Indian restaurants there outnumber McDonald’s six to one. . . . Trendy 
Americans wear Gucci, Armani, Versace, Chanel. . . . Nike shoes are given a 
run for their money by Germany’s Adidas, Britain’s Reebok, and Italy’s Fila.”
Philippe Legrain, “Cultural Globalization is Not Americanization,” 
Chronicle of Higher Education, 2003
53. The author’s most likely purpose is to show that the spread of 
American culture is 
(A) a form of imperialism spreading under the label of globalization
(B) a cause of a fundamentalist religious backlash against globalization
(C) the foundation on which globalized culture is created
(D) one influence among many leading to globalized syncretic cultures
54. Which of the following statements provides the strongest evidence to 
support the argument of the author in the passage?
(A) McDonald’s operates restaurants in over 100 countries. 
(B) Films from Hollywood dominate the global movie market. 
(C) Soccer, the world’s most popular sport, was spread by the British.
(D) About one billion people are fluent in English.
55. Which of the following historical developments during the second half 
of the 20th century is best conveyed by the passage?
(A) Popular culture increasingly reflected a globalized society.
(B) As culture became more globalized, women had more freedom.

Historical Background:  In the late 18th century, Europeans who wanted to 
trade with China were limited to the city of Canton (Guangzhou). In 1792, 
Lord Macartney, a British statesman and foreign diplomat, became the first 
British envoy to China and met briefly with Chinese Emperor Qianlong. At 
the time, opium was grown in great quantities in British India and the Ottoman 
Empire. The British East India Company, a joint-stock company chartered in 
1600, represented the interests of the British government in Asia.

The Celestial Court has pacified and possessed the territory within the four 
seas. Its sole aim is to do its utmost to achieve good government and to manage 
political affairs, attaching no value to strange jewels and precious objects. The 
various articles presented by you, O King, this time are accepted by my special 
order to the office in charge of such functions in consideration of the offerings 
having come from a long distance with sincere good wishes. As a matter of 
fact, the virtue and prestige of the Celestial Dynasty having spread far and 
wide, the kings of the myriad nations come by land and sea with all sorts 
of precious things. Consequently there is nothing we lack, as your principal 
envoy and others have themselves observed. We have never set much store 
on strange and ingenious objects, nor do we need any more of your country’s 
manufactures.

Thus, then, have I seen “King Solomon in all his glory.” I use this expression,

We find that your country is sixty or seventy thousand li from China. Yet there 
are barbarian ships that strive to come here for trade for the purpose of making 
a great profit. The wealth of China is used to profit the barbarians . . . .  By what 
right do they use this poisonous drug to injure the Chinese people?
I have heard that the smoking of opium is very strictly forbidden by your 
country; that is because the harm caused by opium is very clearly understood. 
Since it is not permitted to do harm in your country, then even less should you 
allow it to be passed on to do harm in other countries. Of all that China exports 
to other countries, there is not a single thing that is not beneficial to people:  
they are of benefit when eaten, or of benefit when used, or of benefit when 
resold:  all are beneficial. This is for no other reason than to share the benefits 
with the people of the whole world . . . .  We have heard heretofore that your 
honorable ruler is kind and benevolent.  Naturally you would not wish to give 
unto others what you yourself do not want.

government, 1840.
It appeared that the Laws of the Chinese Empire forbid the importation of Opium 
into China, and declare that all Opium which may be brought into the Country 
is liable to confiscation. The Queen of England desires that Her Subjects who 
may go into Foreign Countries should obey the Laws of those Countries; and 
Her Majesty does not wish to protect them from the just consequences of any 
offenses which they may commit in foreign parts. But, on the other hand, Her 
Majesty cannot permit that Her Subjects residing abroad should be treated with 
violence, and be exposed to insult and injustice; and when wrong is done to 
them,  Her Majesty will see that they obtain redress.
Document 7
Source:  Sir George Staunton, speech in the House of Commons on British 
trade with China, 1840. 
The course which I hope and believe Her Majesty’s Government 
are about to take, is to make rational proposals to China—such 
proposals as China may accept without national dishonour [dishonor]
or disgrace. But, considering the character of its Government, and 
all the events that have already taken place, no man can doubt the 
necessity of accompanying and supporting such propositions with 
a competent physical force (hear). The armament destined for this 
service has been condemned on account of its being supposed to 
be intended to support the trade in opium. On the contrary, I call 
on all those who would wish to see that detestable traffic really 
and effectually put down, to support a measure by which, alone, 
I am convinced, such a wished-for consummation can ever be 
accomplished. Without a national treaty between the Governments 
of England and China, such as this armament may be hoped to lead 
to, and which it would be hopeless to expect otherwise, providing 
a plan of cordial co-operation between them for this end, it is but 
too certain that this detestable opium traffic must, in spite of every 
effort, not only flourish, but become every day more and more 
piratical and buccaneering in its character.

What Are Geographic Questions? 9
Globalizing processes occur at the world scale; these 
processes bypass country borders and include global 
ﬁ nancial markets and global environmental change. 
However, the processes of globalization do not magically appear at the global scale: what happens at other scales (indi-vidual, local, regional, national) helps create the processes of glo-balization and shape the outcomes of globalization.
Some argue that the impacts of globalization are exag-
gerated, but as geographers Ron Johnston, Peter T aylor, and Michael Watts explain, “Whatever your opinion may be, any intellectual engagement with social change in the twenty ﬁ  rst century has to address this concept seriously, 
and assess its capacity to explain the world we currently inhabit.” We integrate the concept of globalization into this textbook because processes at the global scale, processes that are not conﬁ  ned to local places or national borders, are clearly changing the human geography of the planet. At the same time, as we travel the world and continue to engage in ﬁ eldwork and research, we are constantly reminded of how 
different places and people are from one another—processes at the individual, local, regional, and national scales con-tinue to change human geography and shape globalization.
No place on Earth is untouched by people. As people 
explore, travel, migrate, interact, play, live, and work, they make places. People organize themselves into communi-ties, nations, and broader societal networks, establishing political, economic, religious, linguistic, and cultural sys-tems that enable them to function in space. People adapt to, alter, manipulate, and cope with their physical geo-graphic environment. No environment stands apart from human action. Each place we see is affected by and created by people, and each place reﬂ  ects the culture of the people in that place over time.
Imagine and describe the most remote place on Earth you can think of 100 years ago. Now, describe how globalization has changed that place and how the people there continue to shape it and make it the place it is today.
WHAT ARE GEOGRAPHIC QUESTIONS?
Geographers study human phenomena such as lan-
guage, religion, and identity, as well as physical phenom-ena such as landforms, climate, and environmental change. Geographers also examine the interactions between humans and environment. Human geography is the study of the spatial and material characteristics of the human-made places and people found on Earth’s surface; physical geography asks similar questions about the natural envi-ronment. Human and physical geographers adopt a similar perspective but focus on different phenomena.
Geographer Marvin Mikesell once gave a shorthand 
deﬁ nition of geography as the “why of where.” Why and how 
do things come together in certain places to produce particu-lar outcomes? Why are some things found in certain places but not in others? How do the characteristics of particular places shape what happens? T o what extent do things in one place inﬂ  uence those in other places? T o these questions, we add “so what?” Why do differences across geographic space matter? What role does a place play in its region and in the world, and what does that mean for people there and else-
where? Questions such as these are at the core of geographic inquiry—whether human or physical-and they are of critical importance in any effort to make sense of our world.
If geography deals with so many aspects of our world, 
ranging from people and places to coastlines and climates, what do the various facets of this wide-ranging discipline have in common? The answer lies in a perspective that both human and physical geographers bring to their stud-ies: a spatial  perspective. Whether they are human geog-
raphers or physical geographers, virtually all geographers are interested in the spatial arrangement of places and phe-nomena, how they are laid out, organized, and arranged on the Earth, and how they appear on the landscape.
Mapping the spatial distribution of a phenomenon 
can be the ﬁ  rst step to understanding it. By looking at a map of how something is distributed across space, a geog-rapher can raise questions about how the arrangement came about, what processes create and sustain the particu-lar distributions or patterns, and what relationships exist between different places and things.
Maps in the Time of Cholera Pandemics
In medical geography, mapping the distribution of a dis-
ease is the ﬁ  rst step to ﬁ  nding its cause. In 1854, Dr. John Snow, a noted anesthesiologist in London, mapped cases of cholera in London’s Soho District.
Cholera is an ancient disease associated with diarrhea 
and dehydration. It was conﬁ  ned to India until the beginning of the nineteenth century. In 1816 it spread to China, Japan, East Africa, and Mediterranean Europe in the ﬁ  rst of several pandemics, worldwide outbreaks of the disease. This initial wave abated by 1823, but by then cholera was feared throughout the world, for it had killed people everywhere by the hundreds, even thousands. Death was horribly convul-sive and would come in a matter of days, perhaps a week, and no one knew what caused the disease or how to avoid it.
Soon a second cholera pandemic struck. It lasted 
from 1826 to 1837, when cholera crossed the Atlantic and attacked North America. During the third pandemic, from 1842 to 1862, England was severely hit, and cholera again spread into North America.c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 9  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 9  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Home of
Cholera VictimWhen the pandemic that began in 1842 reached 
England in the 1850s, cholera swept through the Soho 
District of London. Dr. Snow mapped the Soho District, marking all the area’s water pumps—from which people got their water supply for home use—with a P and marking the residence of each person who died from cholera with a dot (Fig. 1.5). Approximately 500 deaths occurred in Soho, and as the map took shape, Snow noticed that an especially large number of those deaths clustered around the water pump on Broad Street. At the doctor’s request, city author-ities removed the handle from the Broad Street pump, making it impossible to get water from that pump. The result was dramatic: almost immediately the number of reported new cases fell to nearly zero, conﬁ  rming Snow’s 
theory about the role of water in the spread of cholera.
Dr. Snow and his colleagues advised people to boil 
their water, but it would be a long time before his advice reached all those who might be affected, and in any case many people simply did not have the ability to boil water or to wash hands with soap.
Cholera has not been defeated completely, however, 
and in some ways the risks have been rising in recent years rather than falling (Fig. 1.6). People contract cholera by eating food or water contaminated with cholera bacteria.

Cholera bacteria diffuse to broader areas because once 
one person has cholera it can be spread through his or her feces. In an impoverished area with no sanitary sewer sys-tem, the person’s feces can easily contaminate the water supply. Even in places with sanitary sewer systems, chol-era contamination occurs when rivers, which are typically the water supply, ﬂ  ood the sanitary sewer system.
We expect to ﬁ  nd cholera in places that lack sanitary 
sewer systems and in places that are ﬂ  ood prone. In many of the teeming shantytowns of the growing cities of the developing world, and in some of the refugee camps of Africa and Asia, cholera remains a threat. Until the 1990s, major outbreaks remained few and limited. After remain-ing cholera-free for a half century, Europe had its ﬁ  rst 
reappearance of cholera in Naples in 1972. In 2006, a cholera outbreak in Angola, in southern Africa, spread quickly throughout the country. When heavy rains came to West Africa in 2010, an outbreak of cholera killed 1500 peo-ple in Nigeria alone.

January 1991 became a fast-spreading epidemic (regional outbreak of a disease) that touched every country in the Americas, infected more than 1 million people, and killed over 10,000 in the region. The outbreak in Peru began when the ocean waters warmed off the coast of Peru. Cholera bacteria live on plankton in the ocean, and the warming of the ocean allowed the plankton and cholera to multiply. Fish ate the plankton, and people ate raw ﬁ  sh, 
thus bringing cholera to Peru.
In the slums of Peru, the disease diffused quickly. The 
slums are densely populated and lack a sanitary sewer system large enough to handle the waste of the population. An esti-mated 14 million Peruvians were infected with cholera, 350,000 were hospitalized, and 3500 Peruvians died during the outbreak in the 1990s. Peruvians who accessed health care received clean water, salts, and antibiotics, which com-bat the disease.
In January 2010, an earthquake that registered 7.0 on 
the Richter scale hit Haiti, near the capital of Port au Prince. Months later a cholera outbreak started in the Artibonite region of Haiti (Fig. 1.6). Health ofﬁ  cials are not certain whether the outbreak began in the multiple refugee camps or elsewhere. The disease diffused quickly through the refugee camps and by October 2010 reached the capital city of Port au Prince. Scientists worry that the cholera outbreak in Haiti will be long lasting because the bacteria have contaminated the Artibonite River, the water supply for a large region. Although purifying water through boiling and thoroughly washing hands prevent the spread of cholera, water contam-inated with cholera and a lack of access to soap abound in many neighborhoods of world cities. A vaccine exists, but its effectiveness is limited, and it is costly. Dr. Snow achieved a victory through the application of geographical reasoning, but the war against cholera is not yet won.
The fruits of geographical inquiry were life-saving in 
Snow's case, and the example illustrates the general advan-tage that comes from looking at the geographic context of events and circumstances. Geographers want to understand how and why places are similar or different, why people do different things in different places, and how the relationship between people and the physical world varies across space.
The Spatial Perspective
Geography, and being geographically literate, involves much more than memorizing places on a map. Place loca-tions are to geography what dates are to history. History is not merely about memorizing dates. T o understand his-tory is to appreciate how events, circumstances, and ideas came together at particular times to produce certain out-comes. Knowledge of how events have developed over time is thought to be critical to understanding who we are and where we are going.
Understanding change over time is critically impor-
tant, and understanding change across space is equally as important. The great German philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that we need disciplines focused not only on particular phenomena (such as economics and sociology), but also on the perspectives of time (history) and space (geography). The disciplines of history and geography have intellectual cores deﬁ  ned by these perspectives 
rather than by subject matter.
Human geographers employ a spatial perspective  
as they study a multitude of phenomena ranging from political elections and urban shantytowns to gay neigh-borhoods and folk music. T o bring together the many subﬁ elds of human geography and to explain to non-
geographers what geographers do, four major geograph-ical organizations in the United States formed the Geography Educational National Implementation Project in the 1980s. The National Geographic Society published their ﬁ  ndings in 1986, introducing the five themes of geography. The ﬁ  ve themes are derived from geography’s spatial concerns.
The Five Themes
The ﬁ  rst theme, location, highlights how the geographical 
position of people and things on Earth’s surface affects what happens and why. A concern with location underlies almost all geographical work, for location helps to establish the context within which events and processes are situated.
Some geographers develop elaborate (often quantita-
tive) models describing the locational properties of particular phenomena—even predicting where things are likely to occur. Such undertakings have fostered an interest in loca-
tion theory , an element of contemporary human geography 
that seeks answers to a wide range of questions-some of them theoretical, others highly practical: Why are villages, towns, and cities spaced the way they are? A geographer versed in location theory might assess where a SuperT arget should be c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 11  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 11  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
12 Chapter 1   Introduction to Human Geography
built (downtown or in a suburb), given the characteristics of 
existing neighborhoods and new developments, the median income of people, the locations of other shopping areas, and the existing and future road system. Similarly, a geographer could determine the best location for a wildlife refuge, given existing wildlife habitats and migration patterns, human set-tlement patterns, and road networks.
A spatial perspective invites consideration of the rela-
tionship among phenomena in individual places—including the relationship between humans and the physical world. Thus, the second of the ﬁ  ve themes concerns human-environment interactions. Why did the Army Corps of Engineers alter Florida’s physical environment so drastically when it drained part of the Everglades? Have the changes in Florida’s environment created an easier path of destruction for hurricanes? Why is the Army Corps of Engineers again changing the course of the Kissimmee River, and what does that mean for farmers around the river and residential devel-opments in the south of Florida? Asking locational ques-tions often means looking at the reciprocal relationship between humans and environments.The third theme of geography is the region. 
Phenomena are not evenly distributed on Earth’s surface. Instead, features tend to be concentrated in particular areas, which we call regions. Geographers use ﬁ  eldwork 
and both quantitative and qualitative methods to develop insightful descriptions of different regions of the world. Novelist James Michener once wrote that whenever he started writing a new book, he ﬁ  rst prepared himself by 
turning to books written by regional geographers about the area where the action was to occur. Understanding the regional geography of a place allows us to make sense of much of the information we have about places and digest new place-based information as well.
The fourth theme is represented by the seemingly 
simple word place. All places on the surface of Earth have unique human and physical characteristics, and one 
of the purposes of geography is to study the special char-acter and meaning of places. People develop a sense of place by infusing a place with meaning and emotion, by remembering important events that occurred in a place, or by labeling a place with a certain character.

experience and give meaning to places, we can have a feel-
ing of “home” when we are in a certain place.
We also develop perceptions of places where we 
have never been through books, movies, stories, and pic-tures. Geographers Peter Gould and Rodney White asked college students in California and Pennsylvania: “If you could move to any place of your choice, without any of the usual ﬁ  nancial and other obstacles, where would you like to live?” Their responses showed a strong bias for their home region and revealed that students from both regions had negative perceptions of the South, Appalachia, the Great Plains, and Utah (Fig. 1.7). What we know shapes our perceptions of places.
The ﬁ  fth theme, movement, refers to the mobility of 
people, goods, and ideas across the surface of the planet. Movement is an expression of the interconnectedness of places. Spatial interaction between places depends on the 
distances (the measured physical space between two places) among places, the accessibility (the ease of reaching one loca-tion from another) of places, and the transportation and com-munication connectivity (the degree of linkage between loca-
tions in a network) among places. Interactions of many kinds shape Earth’s human geography, and understanding these interactions is an important aspect of the global spatial order.Cultural Landscape
In addition to the ﬁ  ve themes, location, human-
environment, region, place, and movement, landscape is a 
core element of geography. Geographers use the term landscape to refer to the material character of a place, the complex of natural features, human structures, and other tangible objects that give a place a particular form. Human geographers are particularly concerned with the cultural landscape, the visible imprint of human 
activity on the landscape. The geographer whose name is most closely identiﬁ  ed with this concept is former University of California at Berkeley professor Carl Sauer. In Sauer’s words, cultural landscapes are com-prised of the “forms superimposed on the physical land-scape” by human activity.
No place on Earth is in a “pristine” condition;  
humans have made an imprint on every place on the planet (Fig. 1.8). The cultural landscape is the visible imprint of human activity and culture on the land-scape. We can see the cultural landscape in the layers of buildings, roads, memorials, churches, fields, and homes that human activities over time have stamped on the landscape.c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 13  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 13  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Glacier National Park, United States.  © Alexander B. Murphy.Field Note
“Hiking to the famed Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National 
Park brings one close to nature, but even in this remote part of the United States the work of humans is inscribed in the landscape. The parking lot at the start of the six-mile trail, the trail itself, and the small signs en route are only part of the human story. When I hiked around the turn in this valley and arrived at the foot of the glacier, I found myself looking at a sheet of ice and snow that was less than a third the size of what it had been in 1850. The likely reason for the shrink-age is human-induced climate change. If the melt continues at present rates, scientists predict that the glacier will be gone by 2030.”
Any cultural landscape has layers of impressions from 
years of human activity. As each group of people arrives and occupies a place, they bring their own technological and cultural traditions and transform the landscape accordingly. Each new group of residents can also be inﬂ uenced by what they ﬁ  nd when they arrive and leave 
some of it in place. In 1929, Derwent Whittlesey pro-posed the term sequent occupance to refer to these sequential imprints of occupants, whose impacts are lay-ered one on top of the other, each layer having some impacts on the next
The T anzanian city of Dar es Salaam provides an 
interesting urban example of sequent occupance. Arabs from Zanzibar ﬁ  rst chose the African site in 1866 as a summer retreat. Next, German colonizers imprinted a new layout and architectural style (wood-beamed T eutonic) when they chose the city as the center of their East African colonies in 1891. After World War I, when c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 14  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 14  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 Why Do Geographers Use Maps, and What Do Maps Tell Us?  15
the Germans were ousted, a British administration took 
over the city and began yet another period of transfor-mation. The British encouraged immigration from their colony in India to T anzania. The new migrant Asian population created a zone of three- and four-story apart-ment houses, which look as if they were transplanted from Bombay, India (Fig. 1.9 left and right). Then, in the early 1960s, Dar es Salaam became the capital of newly independent T anzania. Thus, the city experienced four stages of cultural dominance in less than one century, and each stage of the sequence remains imprinted in the cultural landscape.
The cultural landscape can be seen as a kind of book 
offering clues into each chapter of the cultural practices, values, and priorities of its various occupiers. As geogra-pher Peirce Lewis explained in Axioms for Reading the 
Landscape  (1979), “Our human landscape is our unwitting 
autobiography, reﬂ  ecting our tastes, our values, our aspi-rations, and even our fears, in tangible, visible form.” Like Whittlesey, Lewis recommended looking for layers of history and cultural practice in cultural landscapes, adding that most major changes in the cultural landscape occur after a major event, such as war, an invention, or an economic depression.
Geographers who practice ﬁ  eldwork keep their eyes open to 
the world around them and through practice become adept at reading cultural landscapes. Take a walk around your cam-pus or town and try reading the cultural landscape. Choose one thing in the landscape and ask yourself, “What is that and why is it there?” How might the existence of that thing inﬂ  u-
ence the future development of the neighborhood? Take the time to ﬁ  nd out the answers!
WHY DO GEOGRAPHERS USE MAPS, 
AND WHAT DO MAPS TELL US?
Maps are an incredibly powerful geographic tool, and 
cartography, the art and science of making maps, is as old as 
geography itself. (For details on cartography, see Appendix A at the end of this book.) Maps are used for countless pur-poses, waging war, promoting political positions, solving  Figures 1.9, left and right
Mumbai, India (left) and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania (right). Apartment buildings through-
out Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India, are typically four stories with balconies. In Dar-es-Salaam, T anzania, this four-story walkup with balconies (right) stands where single-family African dwellings once stood, reﬂ  ecting the sequential occupance of the city.

medical problems, locating shopping centers, bringing 
relief to refugees, and warning of natural hazards, to name just a few. Reference maps show locations of places and geographic features. Thematic maps tell stories, typically showing the degree of some attribute or the movement of a geographic phenomenon.
Reference maps focus on accuracy in showing the 
absolute locations  of places, using a coordinate system that 
allows for the precise plotting of where on Earth something is. Imagine taking an orange, drawing a dot on it with a marker, and then trying to describe the exact location of that dot to someone who is holding another orange so she can mark the same spot on her orange. If you draw and number the same coordinate system on both oranges, the task of drawing the absolute location on each orange is not only doable but simple. The coordinate system most frequently used on maps is based on latitude and longitude. For example, the absolute location of Chicago is 41 degrees, 53 minutes North Latitude and 87 degrees, 38 minutes West Longitude. Using these coordinates, you can plot Chicago on any globe or map that is marked with latitude and longitude lines.
The establishment of a satellite-based global posi-
tioning system (GPS) allows us to locate things on the sur-face of Earth with extraordinary accuracy. Researchers col-lect data quickly and easily in the ﬁ  eld, and low-priced units are encouraging ﬁ  shers, hunters, and hikers to use GPS in 
their activities. New cars are equipped with GPS units, and dashboard map displays help commuters navigate trafﬁ  c and 
travelers ﬁ  nd their way. Geocaching is an increasingly pop-ular hobby based on the use of GPS. Geocachers use their GPS units to play a treasure hunt game all over the world. People leave the treasures (“caches”) somewhere, mark the coordinates on their GPS, and post clues on the Internet. If you ﬁ  nd the cache, you take the treasure and leave a new one. Many mobile phones and “smart” devices are also equipped with GPS units, and applications such as Google Maps have helped to spread the use of GPS even further.
Relative location describes the location of a place in 
relation to other human and physical features. Descriptors such as “Chicago is on Lake Michigan, south of Milwaukee” or “Chicago is located where the cross-coun-try railroads met in the 1800s” or “Chicago is the hub of the corn and soybean markets in the Midwest” are all descriptors of Chicago relative to other features. In the southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and western Indiana region, all major roads lead to Chicago (Fig. 1.10).

 Why Do Geographers Use Maps, and What Do Maps Tell Us?  17
Within this region, people deﬁ  ne much of their lives rela-
tive to Chicago because of the tight interconnectedness between Chicago and the region. Northwestern Indiana is so connected to Chicago that it has a time zone separate from the rest of Indiana, allowing people in northwestern Indiana to stay in the same time zone as Chicago.
Absolute locations do not change, but relative loca-
tions are constantly modiﬁ  ed and change over time. 
Fredericksburg, Virginia, is located halfway between Washington, D.C. and Richmond, Virginia. T oday, it is a suburb of Washington, D.C. with commuter trains, van pools, buses, and cars moving commuters between their homes in Fredericksburg and their workplaces in metro-politan Washington, D.C. During the Civil War, several bloody battles took place in Fredericksburg as the North and South fought over the land halfway between their wartime capitals. The absolute location of Fredericksburg has not changed, but its place in the world around it, its relative location, certainly has.
Mental Maps
We all carry maps in our minds of places we have been and places we have merely heard of; these are called mental 
maps. Even if you have never been to the Great Plains of the United States, you may have studied wall maps and atlases or come across the region in books, magazines, and newspapers frequently enough to envision the states of the region (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and T exas) in your mind. Regardless of whether you have visited the Great Plains, you will use your mental map of the region. If you hear on the news that a tornado destroyed a town in Oklahoma, you use your mental map of the Great Plains region and Oklahoma to make sense of where the tornado occurred and who was affected by it.
Our mental maps of the places within our activity 
spaces, those places we travel to routinely in our rounds of daily activity, are more accurate and detailed than places where we have never been. If your friend calls and asks you to meet her at the movie theater you go to all the time, your mental map will engage automatically. Y ou will envision the hallway, the front door, the walk to your car, the lane to choose in order to be prepared for the left turn you must make, where you will park your car, and your path into the theater and up to the pop-corn stand.
Geographers who study human-environment behav-
ior have made extensive studies of how people develop their mental maps. The earliest humans, who were nomadic, had incredibly accurate mental maps of where to ﬁ nd food and seek shelter. T oday, people need mental maps 
to ﬁ  nd their way through the concrete jungles of cities and suburbs.Geographers have studied the mental map forma-
tion of children, the blind, new residents to cities, men, and women, all of whom exhibit differences in the forma-tion of mental maps. T o learn new places, women, for example, tend to use landmarks, whereas men tend to use paths. Activity spaces vary by age, and the extent of peo-ples’ mental maps depends in part on their ages. Mental maps include terra incognita, unknown lands that are off-limits. If your path to the movie theater includes driving past a school that you do not go to, your map on paper will likely label the school, but no details will be shown regard-ing the place. However, if you have access to the school and you are instead drawing a mental map of how to get to the school’s cafeteria, your mental map of the school will be quite detailed. Thus, mental maps reﬂ  ect a person’s 
activity space, what is accessible to the person in his or her rounds of daily activity and what is not.
Generalization in Maps
All maps simplify the world. A reference map of the world cannot show every place in the world, and a thematic map of hurricane tracks in the Atlantic Ocean cannot pinpoint every hurricane and its precise path for the last 50 years. When mapping data, whether human or physical, cartog-raphers, the geographers who make maps, generalize the 
information they present on maps. Many of the maps in this book are thematic maps of the world. Shadings show how much or how little of some phenomena can be found on a part of the Earth’s surface, and symbols show where speciﬁ  c phenomena are located.
Generalized maps help us see general trends, but 
we cannot see all cases of a given phenomenon. The map of world precipitation (Fig. 1.11) is a generalized map  
of mean annual precipitation received around the world. The areas shaded in burgundy, dark blue, and vibrant green are places that receive the most rain, and those shaded in orange receive the least rain on average. T ake a pen and trace along the equator on the map. Notice how many of the high-precipitation areas on the map are along the equator. The consistent heating of the equator over the course of the entire year brings consistent pre-cipitation to the equatorial region. At the scale of the world, we can see general trends in precipitation, such as this, but it is difﬁ  cult to see the microscale climates of intense precipitation areas that are found throughout the world.
Remote Sensing and GIS
Geographic studies include both long- and short-term environmental change. Geographers monitor Earth from a distance, using remote sensing technology that gathers data at a distance from Earth’s surface. c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 17  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 17  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
18 Chapter 1   Introduction to Human Geography
Remotely sensed data are collected by satellites and air-
craft and are often almost instantaneously available. After a major weather or hazard event, such as the 2011 ﬂ oods in the Mississippi River Valley, the unprece-
dented hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 (which included Hurricane Katrina), or the 2010 earth-quakes in Haiti and Chile, remotely sensed data show us the major areas of impact (Fig. 1.12). A remotely sensed image surveys the damage of the earthquake, and photos taken on the ground show the impact and destruction (Fig. 1.13).
In states that restrict foreign access or that do not 
reliably allow foreign aid to enter the country, remote sensing can help geographers understand the physical and human geography of the place. Google Earth is a free, web-based user-friendly set of remotely sensed images from around the world woven together and acces-sible to anyone with Internet access. Y ou can think of  Figure 1.11

Google Earth as a quilt of remotely sensed images, taken 
all over the world, coming from several sources, and sewn together. As a result, the resolution (the measure of the smallest object that can be resolved by the sensor, the degree of detail) of the images (each piece of the quilt) differs from place to place.
Remotely sensed images can be incorporated in a map, 
and absolute locations can be studied over time by plotting change in remotely sensed imagery over time. Advances in computer technology and data storage, increasing accessibil-ity to locationally based data and GPS technology, and soft-ware corporations that tailor products to speciﬁ  c uses have all 
driven incredible advances in geographic analysis based on geographic information systems (GIS) over the last two decades. Geographers use GIS to compare a variety of spatial data by creating digitized representations of the environment (Fig. 1.14), combining layers of spatial data, and creating maps in which patterns and processes are superimposed. 40°60° 60°

Geographers also use GIS to analyze data, which can give us 
new insights into geographic patterns and relationships.
Geographers use GIS in both human and physical 
geographic research. For example, political geographers use GIS to map layers showing voters, their party registra-tion, their race, their likelihood of voting, and their income in order to determine how to draw voting districts in con-gressional and state legislative elections. In this case, a geographer can draw a line around a group of people and ask the computer program to tally how many voters are inside the region, determine what the racial composition is of the district, and show how many of the current political representatives live within the new district’s boundaries.
Geographers trained in GIS employ the technol-
ogy in countless undertakings. Students who earn undergraduate degrees in geography are employed by software companies, government agencies, and busi-nesses to use GIS to survey wildlife, map soils, analyze natural disasters, track diseases, assist ﬁ  rst responders, 
plan cities, plot transportation improvements, and fol-low weather systems. For example, a group of geogra-phers working for one GIS company tailors the GIS software to serve the branches of the military and the defense intelligence community. The vast amounts of intelligence data gathered by the various intelligence agencies can be integrated into a GIS and then analyzed spatially. Geographers working in the defense intelli-gence community can use GIS to query a vast amount of intelligence, interpret spatial data, and make recom-mendations on issues of security and defense.
The amount of data digestible in a GIS, the power of 
the location analysis that can be undertaken on a computer platform, and the ease of analysis that is possible using GIS software applications allow geographers to answer compli-cated questions. For example, geographer Korine Kolivras analyzed the probability of dengue fever outbreaks in Hawaii using GIS (Fig. 1.15). The maps Kolivras pro-duced may look as simple and straightforward as the chol-era maps produced by Dr. John Snow in the 1800s, but the amount of data that went into Kolivras’s analysis is stagger-ing in comparison. Dengue fever is carried by a particular kind of mosquito called the Aedes mosquito. Kolivras ana-lyzed the breeding conditions needed for the Aedes mos-quito, including precipitation, topography, and several other variables, to predict what places in Hawaii are most likely to experience an outbreak of dengue fever.
A new term of art used in geography is GISci. 
Geographic information science (GISci) is an emerging research ﬁ  eld concerned with studying the development and use of geospatial concepts and techniques to examine geographic patterns and processes. Y our school may have a program in GISci that draws across disciplines, bringing together the computer scientists who write the programs, the engineers who create sensors that gather data about the Earth, and the geographers who combine layers of data and interpret them to make sense of our world.
Use Google Earth to ﬁ  nd a place where a humanitarian cri-sis is occurring today (such as Haiti or Pakistan) and study the physical and human geography overlaid on Google Earth in this place. How does studying this place on Google Earth change your mental map of the place and/ or your under-standing of the crisis?c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 21  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 21  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

The diffusion of diseases carried by vectors, such as the Aedes 
mosquito that transmits dengue, is not solely a result of the envi-
ronmental factors in a place. I use disease ecology to understand the ways in which environmental, social, and cultural factors interact to produce disease in a place. Through a combination of ﬁ eldwork and geographic information systems (GIS) modeling, I 
studied the environmental habitat of the Aedes mosquito in 
Hawaii and the social and cultural factors that stimulated the outbreak of dengue in Hawaii.
When I went into the ﬁ  eld in Hawaii, I observed the diver-
sity of the physical geography of Hawaii, from deserts to rain-forests. I saw the speciﬁ  c local environments of the dengue 
outbreak area, and I examined the puddles in streams (Fig. 1.15A) in which the mosquitoes likely bred during the 2001–2002 dengue outbreak. I talked to public health ofﬁ  cials who worked 
so hard to control the dengue outbreak so that I better understood the local environmental factors contributing to the disease. I visited a family that had been heavily affected by dengue, and I saw their home, which, by their choice, lacked walls or screens on all sides. In talking with the family, I came to understand the social and cultural factors that affected the outbreak of dengue in Hawaii.
I created a GIS model of mosquito habitat that considered not only total precipitation in Hawaii (Fig. 1.15B), but also 
seasonal variations in precipitation (Fig. 1.15C) and temperature (Fig. 1.15D), to help explain where the Aedes mosquito is able 
to breed and survive on the islands. I also studied seasonal ﬂ  uctuations in streams and population distributions in creating my model of dengue potential areas (Fig. 1.15E).
The GIS model I created can now be altered by public ofﬁ  cials in Hawaii to reﬂ  ect precipitation and temperature 
variations each year or to incorporate new layers of environmental, social, and cultural data. Ofﬁ  cials will be able to better predict locations of dengue outbreaks so they can focus their efforts to combat the spread of the disease.

 Why Are Geographers Concerned with Scale and Connectedness? 23
WHY ARE GEOGRAPHERS CONCERNED 
WITH SCALE AND CONNECTEDNESS?
Geographers study places and patterns at a variety of 
scales, including local, regional, national, and global. 
Scale has two meanings in geography: the ﬁ  rst is the dis-tance on a map compared to the distance on the Earth, and the second is the spatial extent of something. Throughout the book, when we refer to scale we are using the second of these deﬁ  nitions. Geographers’ interest in 
this type of scale derives from the fact that phenomena found at one scale are usually inﬂ  uenced by what is hap-pening at other scales; to explain a geographic pattern or process, then, requires looking across scales. Moreover, the scale of our research or analysis matters because we can make different observations at different scales. We can study a single phenomenon across different scales in order to see how what is happening at the global scale affects localities and how what is happening at a local scale affects the globe. Or we can study a phenomenon at a par-ticular scale and then ask how processes at other scales affect what we are studying.
The scale at which we study a geographic phenom-
enon tells us what level of detail we can expect to see. We also see different patterns at different scales. For example, when we study the distribution of material wealth at the scale of the globe (see Fig. 1.3), we see that the countries in western Europe, Canada, the United States, Japan, and Australia are the wealthiest, and the countries of Subsaharan Africa and Southeast Asia are the poorest. Does that mean everyone in the United States is wealthy and everyone in Indonesia is poor? Certainly not, but on a global-scale map of states, that is how the data appear.
When you shift scales to North America and 
examine the data for States of the United States and the provinces of Canada (Fig. 1.16), you see that the wealthiest areas are on the coasts and the poorest are in the interior and in the extreme northeast and south. The State of Alaska and the province of the Northwest T erritories have high gross per capita incomes that stem largely from oil revenues that are shared among the residents.
By shifting scales again to just one city, for example, 
metropolitan Washington, D.C. (Fig. 1.17), you observe that suburbs west, northwest, and southwest of the city are the wealthiest and that suburbs to the east and southeast have lower income levels. In the city itself, a clear dichot-omy of wealth divides the northwest neighborhoods from the rest of the city. Shifting scales again to the individual, if we conducted ﬁ  eldwork in Washington, D.C., and 
interviewed people who live below the poverty line, we would quickly ﬁ  nd that each person’s experience of pov-
erty and reasons for being in poverty vary-making it difﬁ  -cult to generalize. We would ﬁ  nd some trends, such as 
how women in poverty who have children cope differently than single men or how illegal immigrants cope differ-ently from legal immigrants, but no two individual cases are the same.
Because the level of detail and the patterns observed 
change as the scale changes, geographers must be sensitive to their scale of analysis and also be wary of researchers who make generalizations about a people or a place at a particu-lar scale without considering other scales of analysis.
Geographers’ concern with scale goes beyond an 
interest in the scale of individual phenomena to a concern with how processes operating at different scales inﬂ  uence 
one another. If you want to understand the conﬂ  ict 
between the T utsi and the Hutu people in Rwanda, for example, you cannot look solely at this African country. The Rwandan conﬂ  ict was inﬂ  uenced by developments at a variety of different scales, including patterns of migration and interaction in Central Africa, the economic and polit-ical relations between Rwanda and parts of Europe, and the variable impacts of globalization-economic, political, and cultural.
Geographers are also interested in how people use 
scale politically. Locally based political movements, such as the Zapatistas in southern Mexico, have learned to rescale  
their actions-to involve players at other scales and create a global outcry of support for their position. By taking their political campaign from the local scale to the national scale through, for example, protests against the North American Free T rade Agreement (NAFTA), and then effectively using the Internet to wage a global campaign, the Zapatistas gained attention from the world media, a feat relatively few local political movements achieve.
Geographer Victoria Lawson uses the term jumping 
scale to describe such rescaling activities. She compares the ways in which Western countries, multinational cor-porations, and the World T rade Organization take prod-ucts and ideas created in Western places and by Western corporations and globalize all rights to proﬁ  ts from them 
through intellectual property law. Efforts to push European and American views of intellectual property on the globe negate other local and regional views of products and ideas. T o the West, rice is a product that can be owned, privatized, and bought and sold. T o East Asians, rice is integral to culture, and new rice strains and new ideas about growing rice can help build com-munity, not just proﬁ  t. Lawson explains that taking a single regional view and jumping scale to globalize it can serve to legitimate that view and negates other regional and local views.
Regions
Geographers often divide the world into regions for analysis. Many colleges offer a course in world regional c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 23  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 23  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
24 Chapter 1   Introduction to Human Geography
geography that compares and contrasts major regions of 
the world. In this book, we use examples from all over the world, but our focus throughout is on a thematic approach to human geography. Nongeographers use some form of the regional idea all the time, even in everyday conversation. When you plan or dream of a vacation in the Rockies, or a hiking trip in New England, or a cruise in the Caribbean, you are using regional notions to convey what you have in mind. Used this way, regions serve as informal frames of reference.In geography, a region constitutes an area that shares 
similar characteristics. T o identify and delimit regions, we must establish criteria for them. The criteria we choose to deﬁ ne a region can be physical, cultural, functional, or 
perceptual.
When geographers choose one or more physical 
or cultural criteria to define a region, they are looking for formal regions. A formal region is marked by homogeneity in one or more circumstance or phenom-enon. A formal physical region is based on a shared  Figure 1.16

physical geographic criterion, such as the karst region 
of China (Fig. 1.18).
A formal region has a shared trait, it can be a shared 
cultural trait or a physical trait. In a formal cultural region, people share one or more cultural traits. For example, the region of Europe where French is spoken by a majority of the people can be thought of as a French-speaking region. When the scale of analysis shifts, the formal region changes. If we shift scales to the world, the French-speaking formal region expands beyond France into former French colonies of Africa and into the overseas departments that are still associ-ated politically with France.
A functional region is deﬁ  ned by a particular set 
of activities or interactions that occur within it. Places that are part of the same functional region interact to create connections. Functional regions have a shared political, social, or economic purpose. For example, a  Figure 1.17

city has a surrounding region within which workers 
commute, either to the downtown area or to subsidiary centers such as ofﬁ  ce parks and shopping malls. That entire urban area, deﬁ  ned by people moving toward and within it, is a functional region. Thus a functional region is a spatial system; its boundaries are deﬁ  ned by 
the limits of that system. Functional regions are not necessarily culturally homogeneous; instead, the people within the region function together politically, socially, or economically. The city of Chicago is a functional region, and the city itself is part of hundreds of func-tional regions-from the State of Illinois to the seventh federal reserve district.
Finally, regions may be primarily in the minds of 
people. Perceptual regions are intellectual constructs 
designed to help us understand the nature and distribu-tion of phenomena in human geography. Geographers do not agree entirely on their properties, but we do con-cur that we all have impressions and images of various regions and cultures. These perceptions are based on our accumulated knowledge about such regions and cultures. Perceptual regions are not just curiosities. How people think about regions has inﬂ  uenced everything from daily activity patterns to large-scale international conﬂ  ict. A 
perceptual region can include people, their cultural traits, such as dress, food, and religion; places and their physical traits, such as mountains, plains, or coasts; and built environments, such as windmills, barns, skyscrap-ers, or beach houses.
But where is this Mid-Atlantic region? If Maryland 
and Delaware are part of it, then eastern Pennsylvania is, too. But where across Pennsylvania lies the boundary of this partly cultural, partly physical region, and on what basis can it be drawn? There is no single best answer (Fig. 1.19).
Major news events help us create our perceptual 
regions by deﬁ  ning certain countries or areas of countries 
as part of a region. Before September 11, 2001, we all had perceptions of the Middle East region. For most of us, that region included Iraq and Iran but stretched no farther east. As the hunt for Osama bin Laden began and the media focused attention on the harsh rule of the T aliban in Afghanistan, our regional perceptions of the Middle East changed; for many, the region stretched to encom-pass Afghanistan and Pakistan. Scholars who specialize in this part of the globe had long studied the relationship between parts of Southwest Asia and the traditional “Middle East,” but the connections between Afghanistan and Pakistan and the rest of the Middle East were almost invisible to the general population.

The problem of deﬁ  ning and delimiting perceptual 
regions can be approached in several ways. One is to con-
duct interviews in which people residing within as well as outside a region are asked to respond to questions about their home and cultural environment. Zelinsky used a dif-ferent technique; he analyzed the telephone directories of 276 metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada, noting the frequency with which businesses and other enterprises use regional or locational terms (such as “Southern Printing Company” or “Western Printing”) in their listings. The resulting maps show a close similarity between these perceptual regions and culture regions identiﬁ  ed by geographers.
Among the perceptual regions shown in Figure 1.20, 
one, the South, is unlike any of the others. Even today, ﬁ  ve 
generations after the Civil War, the Confederate ﬂ  ag still 
evokes strong sentiments from both those who revere the ﬂ ag and those who revile it.
A “New South” has emerged over the past several 
decades, forged by Hispanic immigration, urbanization, movement of people from other parts of the United States to the South, and other processes. But the South, espe-cially the rural South, continues to carry imprints of a cul-ture with deep historical roots. Its legacy is preserved in language, religion, music, food preferences, and other tra-ditions and customs.
If you drive southward from, say, Pittsburgh or 
Detroit, you will not pass a speciﬁ  c place where you enter this perceptual region. Y ou will note features in the cultural landscape that you perceive to be associated with the South (such as Wafﬂ  e House restaurants), and at some stage of the trip these features will begin to dominate the area to such a degree that you will say, “I am really in the South now.” This may result from a combination of features in the culture: the style of 
Perceptual Regions in the United States
Cultural geographer Wilbur Zelinsky tackled the com-plex task of deﬁ  ning and delimiting the perceptual regions of the United States and southern Canada. In an article titled “North America’s Vernacular Regions,” he identi-ﬁ ed 12 major perceptual regions on a series of maps (sum-
marized in Fig. 1.20). When you examine the map, you will notice some of the regions overlap in certain places. For example, the more general term the West actually incorporates more speciﬁ  c regions, such as the Paciﬁ  c 
Region and part of the Northwest.

houses and their porches, items on a roadside restaurant 
menu (grits, for example), a local radio station’s music, the sound of accents that you perceive to be Southern, a succession of Baptist churches in a town along the way. These combined impressions become part of your over-all perception of the South as a region.
Such cultural attributes give a certain social atmo-
sphere to the region, an atmosphere that is appreciated by many of its residents and is sometimes advertised as an attraction for potential visitors. “Experience the South’s warmth, courtesy, and pace of life,” said one such com-mercial, which portrayed a sun-drenched seaside land-scape, a bowing host, and a couple strolling along a palm-lined path.
The South has its vigorous supporters and defend-
ers, and occasionally a politician uses its embattled history to arouse racial antagonism. But today the South is so multifaceted, diverse, vigorous, and interconnected with the rest of the United States that its regional identity is much more complicated than traditional images suggest (Fig. 1.21). This serves as an important reminder that per-ceptual regions are not static. Images of the South are rap-idly changing, and perceptions of the South as a region will change over time.
Regions, whether formal, functional, or percep-
tual, are ways of organizing humans geographically. They are a form of spatial classiﬁ  cation, a means of 
handling large amounts of information so we can make sense of it.Culture
Location decisions, patterns, and landscapes are funda-mentally inﬂ  uenced by cultural attitudes and practices. 
Culture refers not only to the music, literature, and arts of a society but to all the other features of its way of life: pre-vailing modes of dress; routine living habits; food prefer-ences; the architecture of houses and public buildings; the layout of ﬁ  elds and farms; and systems of education, gov-ernment, and law. Culture is an all-encompassing term that identiﬁ  es not only the whole tangible lifestyle of peo-ples, but also their prevailing values and beliefs. Culture lies at the heart of human geography.
The concept of culture is closely identiﬁ  ed with the 
discipline of anthropology, and over the course of more than a century anthropologists have deﬁ  ned it in many 
different ways. Some have stressed the contributions of humans to the environment, whereas others have empha-sized learned behaviors and ways of thinking. Several decades ago the noted anthropologist E. Adamson Hoebel deﬁ ned culture as:
[the] integrated system of learned behavior patterns which are characteristic of the members of a society and which are not the result of biological inheritance . . . cul-ture is not genetically predetermined; it is noninstinc-tive . . . [culture] is wholly the result of social invention and is transmitted and maintained solely through com-munication and learning.GuestField Note
Montgomery, Alabama
Located in a predominately African American neighborhood in Montgom-
ery, Alabama, the street intersection of Jeff Davis and Rosa Parks is sym-bolic of the debates and disputes in the American South over how the past is to be commemorated on the region’s landscape. The Civil War and civil rights movement are the two most important events in the history of the region. The street names commemorate Montgomery’s central role in both eras, and they do so in the same public space. Montgomery was the site of the ﬁ  rst capital of the Confederacy in 1861 while Jefferson Davis was president. The Alabama capital was also the site of the 1955–1956 Montgomery bus boycott that launched the civil rights movement. The boycott was sparked by Rosa Parks’s arrest after she refused to give up her seat on a city bus when ordered to do so by a white person. Most of my research examines the politics of how the region’s white and African Americans portray these separate heroic eras within the region’s public spaces, ranging from support for and against ﬂ  ying 
the Confederate ﬂ  ag to disputes over placing statues and murals honoring the Civil War and the civil rights movement on the South’s landscape.

 Why Are Geographers Concerned with Scale and Connectedness? 29
Hoebel’s emphasis on communication and learning antic-
ipated the current view of culture as a system of meaning, not just a set of acts, customs, or material products. Clifford Geertz advanced this view in his classic work, The 
Interpretation of Cultures (1973), which has inﬂ  uenced 
much recent work in human geography. Hence, human geographers are interested not just in the different pat-terns and landscapes associated with different culture groups, but in the ways in which cultural understandings affect both the creation and signiﬁ  cance of those patterns and landscapes.
Cultural geographers identify a single attribute of a 
culture as a culture trait. For example, wearing a turban is a culture trait in certain societies. Many men in the semiarid and desert areas of North Africa, Southwest Asia, and South Asia wore turbans before the birth of Islam. The turbans protected the wearers from sunlight and also helped distinguish tribes.
Not all Muslim men wear turbans, but in some 
Muslim countries, including Afghanistan, wearing tur-bans is popular because either religious or political lead-ers (in the case of Afghanistan, the T aliban) prescribe it for men. T oday, turbans often distinguish a man’s status in society or are worn as a sign of faithfulness to God. In many Muslim countries, including Egypt and T urkey, men rarely wear turbans. The appearance of turbans in other Muslim countries varies a great deal. For instance, in Y emen men who cover their heads typically wear kalansuwa, which are caps wrapped in fabric. In Palestine, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, men who cover their heads typically wear kafﬁ  yeh, which are rectangular pieces of cloth draped and secured on the head.
Wearing turbans is not a cultural trait limited to 
Muslims. In the United States, most men who cover their heads with a turban are Sikhs, which is a separate religion from Islam. In the Sikh religion, men are required to keep their hair uncut. The common practice is to twist the hair and knot it on top of one’s head and then cover it with a turban. The Sikh religion began in the 1500s, and in the late 1600s, the tenth guru of the religion taught that wearing a turban was a way to demonstrate one’s faithful-ness to God. As the turban example exhibits, culture traits are not necessarily conﬁ  ned to a single culture. More than one culture may exhibit a particular culture trait, but each will consist of a discrete combination of traits. Such a combination is referred to as a culture complex. In many cultures, the herding of cattle is a trait. However, cattle are regarded and used in different ways by different cul-tures. The Maasai of East Africa, for example, follow their herds along seasonal migration paths, consuming blood and milk as important ingredients of a unique diet. Cattle occupy a central place in Maasai existence; they are the essence of survival, security, and prestige. Although the Maasai culture complex is only one of many cattle-keep-ing complexes, no other culture complex exhibits exactly the same combination of traits. In Europe, cattle are milked, and dairy products, such as butter, yogurt, and cheese, are consumed as part of a diet very different from that of the Maasai.
A cultural hearth is an area where cultural traits 
develop and from which cultural traits diffuse. Often a cultural trait, for example the religion of Islam, can be traced to a single place and time. Muhammad founded Islam in the 500s c.e. (current era) in and around the cities of Mecca and Medina on the Arabian Peninsula. Other culture traits, such as agriculture, can be traced to several hearths thousands of years apart. When such a trait devel-ops in more than one hearth without being inﬂ  uenced by 
its development elsewhere, each hearth operates as a case of independent invention.
Connectedness through Diffusion
Geographer Carl Sauer focused attention on how ideas, speciﬁ  cally the innovation of agriculture, spread in 
Agricultural Origins and Dispersals . Based on geography and 
archaeological evidence, Sauer established that MesoAmerica independently invented agriculture, adding it to the hearths of agriculture in Europe, Africa, and Asia. When ideas, people, or goods move across space, this process of dissemination is called cultural diffusion .
In 1970, Swedish geographer T orsten Hägerstrand 
published pioneering research on the role of time in the dif-fusion process. Hägerstrand’s research revealed how time, as well as distance, affects individual human behavior and the diffusion of people and ideas. Sauer and Hägerstrand’s fascinating research attracted many geographers to the study of diffusion processes. Geographers are still using principles of diffusion to model movement and diffusion through GIS and other geographic techniques.
Whether diffusion of a cultural trait occurs depends, 
in part, on time and distance from the hearth. The farther a place is from the hearth, the less likely an innovation will be adopted. Similarly, the acceptance of an innovation becomes less likely the longer it takes to reach its potential adopters. In combination, time and distance cause time-
distance decay in the diffusion process.
Not all cultural traits or innovations diffuse. 
Prevailing attitudes or cultural taboos can mean that cer-tain innovations, ideas, or practices are not acceptable or adoptable in particular cultures. Religious teachings may prohibit certain practices or ideas, such as divorce, abor-tions, or contraceptive use, on the grounds of theology or morality. Some cultures or religions prohibit consump-tion of alcoholic beverages, and others prohibit consum-ing certain kinds of meat or other foods. Prescriptions cultures make about behavior act as cultural barriers  
and can pose powerful obstacles to the spread of ideas or innovations.c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 29  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 29  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
30 Chapter 1   Introduction to Human Geography
Expansion Diffusion
When a cultural trait, such as a religion, spreads, it typi-
cally does so from a hearth. Islam’s hearth was on the Arabian Peninsula, and from there, Islam diffused to Egypt and North Africa, through Southwest Asia, and into West Africa. This is a case of expansion diffusion, 
when an innovation or idea develops in a hearth and remains strong there while also spreading outward. Geographers classify diffusion processes into two broad categories: expansion diffusion and relocation diffusion. In the case of expansion diffusion, an innovation or idea develops in a hearth and remains strong there while also spreading outward (Fig. 1.22).
Expansion diffusion takes several forms. The sili-
con bands that are different shapes and colors, like an animal, a football, or a continent, and that stretch into bracelets are called Silly Bandz. Robert Croak, a busi-nessman from T oledo, Ohio, invented the bands in 2008 after seeing similar rubber bands produced by a Japanese company when he was at a trade show in China. The vast majority of Croak’s marketing came from contagious 
diffusion, a form of expansion diffusion in which nearly all adjacent individuals and places are affected. One child had Silly Bandz, and the next day, many more children in his classroom would have the bracelets.
Croak already had a company, Brainchild Products, 
that sold silicon awareness bracelets, and he worked with his Chinese supplier to create Silly Bandz. Croak trade-marked the name and launched a website in the summer of 2008. Without spending any money on marketing, Croak started a Facebook page. Between the website and the Facebook page, the demand for Silly Bandz diffused conta-giously and quickly. Business Week reports the company that once shipped 24 boxes a day out of its T oledo headquarters now ships 1500 boxes a day. Croak reports Silly Bandz are “carried in approximately 18,000 stores in 25 states.”
Although several other competitors quickly entered 
the market, the demand for Croak’s Silly Bandz increased in stores. Croak now offers Silly Bandz in partnership 
with celebrities and companies, including Justin Bieber.

 Why Are Geographers Concerned with Scale and Connectedness? 31
In addition to the contagious diffusion on the play-
ground and in the classrooms, the diffusion of Silly Bandz, 
as opposed to a competing brand, is going to be greatest around the 18,000 stores in 25 states that sell this particu-lar product. The stores create a hierarchy, a structure to the diffusion of the innovation, in this case a particular brand of bracelets.
Instead of Silly Bandz on their wrists, many Major 
League Baseball players now wear necklaces. The colorful necklaces are not made of silicon. They are made of a nylon fabric that matches their uniform and is imbued with titanium. The baseball players, including Justin Morneau of the Minnesota T wins, Joba Chamberlain of the New Y ork Yankees, and Josh Beckett of the Boston Red Sox, wear titanium necklaces sold by Phiten. Phiten is a Japanese company with corporate stores in Honolulu, Hawaii, T orrance, California, and Seattle, Washington.
Formed in 1983, the Phiten Company uses what it 
calls aqua technology to disperse titanium throughout the nylon fabric it uses to make necklaces and bracelets. Phiten supporters believe the titanium helps restore bal-ance and allows the ﬂ  ow of energy through fatigued mus-cles. The company’s website states that wearing a Phiten will “restore normal relaxation” for customers. Phiten not only sells necklaces and bracelets, but also compression sleeves and shorts, athletic tape, patches, and even bed-ding infused with aqua metals, typically titanium.
The diffusion of Phitens from its hearth in Japan to 
the United States began with a sport the two countries share: baseball. In 2001, New Y ork Yankee Randy Johnson traveled to Japan and saw baseball players wear-ing titanium necklaces. He started wearing a Phiten, and other Major League players in the United States soon followed. The custom caught on hierarchically, from team to team and contagiously from player to player. In an article published by CBS News, a regional sales man-ager for Phiten in Seattle is quoted as saying “I’d say about three-fourths of the Detroit Tigers and Minnesota T wins players use them.” Baseball players adopted the custom because they believe the titanium helped allevi-ate muscle pain.
An idea such as a new fashion or new genre of 
music may not always spread throughout a contiguous population. For example, the spread of Crocs footwear is a case of hierarchical diffusion, a pattern in which the main channel of diffusion is some segment of those who are susceptible to (or adopting) what is being dif-fused. In the case of Crocs, founder Scott Seamans found a clog manufactured by a Canadian company that was created out of the unique croc resin material. Seamans, an avid sailor, put a strap on the back and holes for drainage. He and two co-founders of the crocs company based the company in Boulder, Colorado, had the shoes manufactured, and sold them at boat shows in 2002 and 2003. Crocs footware diffused from boating enthusiasts to gardeners to the American public-becoming especially popular among children, who adorned their crocs with Jibbitz, or charms designed for crocs. The hierarchy of boaters, gardeners, and then the contagious diffusion that followed helps explain the rapid growth of the crocs brand, which had revenues of over $800 million in 2007.
A third form of expansion diffusion is stimulus dif-
fusion. Not all ideas can be readily and directly adopted by a receiving population; some are simply too vague, too unattainable, too different, or too impractical for immedi-ate adoption. Y et, these ideas can still have an impact. They may indirectly promote local experimentation and even-tual changes in ways of doing things. For example, the dif-fusion of fast, mass-produced food in the late twentieth century led to the introduction of the hamburger to India. Y et the Hindu religion in India prohibits consumption of beef, which is a major cultural obstacle to the adoption of the hamburger (Fig. 1.23). Instead, retailers began selling burgers made of vegetable products. The diffusion of the hamburger took on a new form in the cultural context of India. With expansion diffusion, whether contagious or hierarchical, the people stay in place and the innovation, idea, trait, or disease does the moving.
Relocation Diffusion
Relocation diffusion occurs most frequently through migration. When migrants move from their homeland, they take their cultural traits with them. Developing an ethnic neighborhood in a new country helps immigrants maintain their culture in the midst of an unfamiliar one. Relocation diffusion , in contrast, involves the actual 
movement of individuals who have already adopted the idea or innovation, and who carry it to a new, perhaps dis-tant, locale, where they proceed to disseminate it (Fig. 1.22). If the homeland of the immigrants loses enough of its population, the cultural customs may fade in the hearth while gaining strength in the ethnic neighbor-hoods abroad.
Once you think about different types of diffusion, you will be tempted to ﬁ  gure out what kinds of diffusion are tak-ing place for all sorts of goods, ideas, or diseases. Please remember that any good, idea, or disease can diffuse in more than one way. Choose a good, idea, or disease as an example and describe how it diffused from its hearth across the globe, referring to at least three different types of diffusion.c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 31  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 31  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

WHAT ARE GEOGRAPHIC CONCEPTS, 
AND HOW ARE THEY USED IN ANSWERING GEOGRAPHIC QUESTIONS?
Geographic concepts include most of the boldfaced 
words in this chapter, such as place, relative location, men-
tal map, perceptual region, diffusion, and cultural land-scape. In doing geographic research, a geographer thinks of a geographic question, one that has a spatial or landscape component, chooses the scale(s) of analysis, and then applies one or more geographic concepts to conduct research and answer the question. Geographers use ﬁ  eld-
work, remote sensing, GIS, GPS, and qualitative and quan-titative techniques to explore linkages among people and places and to explain differences across people, places, scales, and times.
Research in human geography today stems from a 
variety of theories and philosophies. T o understand what geographers do and how they do it, it is easiest to start by deﬁ ning what geography is not. T oday’s geography is not 
environmental determinism.
Rejection of Environmental Determinism
The ancient Greeks, ﬁ  nding that some of the peoples sub-
jugated by their expanding empire were relatively docile while others were rebellious, attributed such differences to variations in climate. Over 2000 years ago, Aristotle described northern European people as “full of spirit... but incapable of ruling others,” and he characterized Asian people (by which he meant modern-day T urkey) as “intelligent and inventive... [but] always in a state of sub-jection and slavery.” Aristotle attributed these traits to the respective climates of the regions-the cold north versus the more tropical Mediterranean.
Aristotle’s views on this topic were long-lasting. As 
recently as the ﬁ  rst half of the twentieth century, similar notions still had strong support. In 1940, in the Principles 
of Human Geography, Ellsworth Huntington and C.W. Cushing wrote:
The well-known contrast between the energetic people of the most progressive parts of the temperate zone and the inert inhabitants of the tropics and even of intermediate regions, such as Persia, is largely due to climate. . . the people of the cyclonic regions rank so far above those of the other parts of the world that they are the natural leaders.
Huntington and Cushing suggest climate is the critical factor in how humans behave. Y et what constitutes an “ideal” climate lies in the eyes of the beholder. For Aristotle, it was the climate of Greece. Through the eyes of more recent commentators from western Europe and North America, the climates most suited to prog-ress and productiveness in culture, politics, and tech-nology are (you guessed it) those of western Europe and c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 32  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 32  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 What Are Geographic Concepts, and How Are They Used in Answering Geographic Questions?  33
the northeastern United States. Each of these theories 
can be classiﬁ  ed as environmental determinism, 
which holds that human behavior, individually and col-
lectively, is strongly affected by, even controlled or determined by, the physical environment.
For a time, some geographers attempted to explain 
the location of major cultural hearths as solely a func-tion of environment. Quite soon, however, certain geographers doubted whether these sweeping general-izations were valid. They recognized exceptions to the environmental determinists’ theories. For example, the Maya civilization in the Americas arose in a tropical cli-mate that most assumed was incapable of complex cul-tures. They argued that humanity was capable of much more than merely adapting to the natural environment. The many environmentally determinist theories that explain Europe as “superior” to the rest of the world because of the climate and location of the region ignore the fact that for thousands of years, the most techno-logically advanced civilizations were found outside of Europe in North Africa, Southwest Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia.
Chipping away at deterministic explanations helped 
move the geographic study of the relationships between human society and the environment in different direc-tions. Everyone agrees that the natural environment affects human activity in some ways, but people are the decision makers and the modiﬁ  ers-not just the slaves of 
environmental forces. People and their cultures shape environments, constantly altering the landscape and affecting environmental systems.
Possibilism
In response to environmental determinism, geographers argued that the natural environment merely serves to limit the range of choices available to a culture. The choices that a society makes depend on what its members need and on what technology is available to them. Geographers called this doctrine  possibilism .
Even possibilism has its limitations, partly because it 
encourages a line of inquiry that starts with the physical environment and asks what it allows. Human cultures, however, frequently push the boundaries of what is “envi-ronmentally possible” through their own ideas and inge-nuity, and advances in technology. In the interconnected, technologically dependent world we live in today, it is possible to transcend many of the limitations imposed by the natural environment.
T oday, much research in human geography focuses 
on how and why humans have altered environment, and on the sustainability of their practices. In the process, the interest in cultural ecology—an area of inquiry concerned with culture as a system of adaptation to and alteration of environment, has been supplemented by interest in polit-ical ecology, an area of inquiry fundamentally concerned with the environmental consequences of dominant political-economic arrangements and understandings (see Chapter 13). The fundamental point is that human societies are diverse and the human will is too powerful to be deter-mined by environment.
Today’s Human Geography
Human geography today seeks to make sense of the spa-tial organization of humanity and human institutions on Earth’s surface, the character of the places and regions created by people, and the relationships between humans and the physical environment. Human geography encom-passes many subdisciplines, including political geography, economic geography, population geography, and urban geography. Human geography also encompasses cultural geography, which incorporates a concern with cultural traits such as religion, language, and ethnicity.
Cultural geography is both part of human geogra-
phy and also its own approach to all aspects of human geography. Cultural geography looks at the ways culture is implicated in the full spectrum of topics addressed in human geography. As such, cultural geography can be seen as a perspective on human geography as much as a component of it.
T o appreciate more fully the vast topics researched 
by human geographers, we can examine the multitude of careers human geographers pursue. Human geographers have titles such as location analyst, urban planner, diplo-mat, remote sensing analyst, geographic information sci-entist, area specialist, travel consultant, political analyst, intelligence ofﬁ  cer, cartographer, educator, soil scientist, 
transportation planner, park ranger, and environmental consultant. All of these careers and more are open to geographers because each of these ﬁ  elds is grounded in 
the understanding of places and is advanced through spa-tial analysis.
Choose a geographic concept introduced in this chapter. Think about something that is of personal interest to you (music, literature, politics, science, sports), and consider how whatever you have chosen could be studied from a geographical perspective. Think about space and location, landscape, and place. Write a geographic question that could be the foundation of a geographic study of the item you have chosen.

34 Chapter 1   Introduction to Human Geography
Summary
Our study of human geography will analyze people and places and explain how they 
interact across space and time to create our world. Chapters 2 and 3 lay the basis for our study of human geography by looking at where people live. Chapters 4–7 focus on aspects of culture and how people use culture and identity to make sense of themselves in their world. The remaining chapters examine how people have created a world in which they function economically, politically, and socially, and how their activities in those realms re-create themselves and their world.

362CHAPTER
Population
Field Note Basic Infrastructure
The words wafted in the air as my colleague and I took a minute to process them. 
We were in Shanghai, China, visiting with a Chinese student who had spent a semester at our small college in a town of 26,000 in rural South Dakota. My col-league had asked the student what he missed most about our small town of Aberdeen. He replied without hesitating, “Basic infrastructure.”
I thought about brand-new subway lines in Shanghai and Beijing, new airports 
throughout China, and high-speed trains being built to connect China’s cities. I visualized the miles of gleaming new concrete we had driven on that afternoon on the ring highway on the outskirts of Shanghai (Fig. 2.1) and the empty ﬁ  elds where 
houses or other buildings had been leveled to make room for new high-density housing, more concrete, and more infrastructure. Shanghai’s metro system only

 Basic Infrastructure 37
dates to 1995. Shanghai now has the longest metro system on Earth—a system 
capable of transporting 5 million people a day. I thought about the lack of public transportation in my small town. I remembered that in 2010, China committed to spend an additional $1 trillion on urban infrastructure by 2015. I considered the words United States President Barack Obama used as he described, enviously, the infrastructure in China, “their ports, their train systems their airports are all vastly superior to us now.”
I looked at the student and said, “Basic infrastructure? But you have better 
subway lines, high-speed railroads, roads, and airports than we do in the States.” “Yes,” he said, “But I don’t have hot water.”
A 2010 report in Foreign Policy agreed, “China’s biggest urban challenge may 
be water; already, it has little to spare. Some 70 percent of water use today traces back to agriculture, but demand from urban consumers and commercial enter-prise is on the rise. Even if the sheer amount of water isn’t the problem, location will be; the country will need to spend more than $120 billion on water systems in the coming years to transport, store, and manage supplies.” A graduate student in Beijing reiterated the water problem in China’s cities. Her dormitory houses about 1000 students, but they all must walk out of the building to a central facility to shower, and she reported that they are only allowed to shower between 2 and 4 
PM or between 9 and 11 PM.
China’s population of 1.34 billion people has been migrating to cities in d roves 
since economic reforms began in 1978. In 2011, the population of the world hit 7 billion people, with rising populations in China and India accounting for 40 per-cent of the population growth. China has undergone incredibly rapid expansion in its mining and manufacturing sectors, resulting in economic growth rates that are often at 10 percent a year. But rapid economic growth took its toll on water quality in China, which exacerbates water shortages in the country.
Providing services for 1.34 billion people is no small feat. Even though 
demographers now predict China’s population will stabilize at 1.4 billion by 2025 and begin to decline after that, shifts in the composition of China’s population will continue to challenge the provision of basic infrastructure to the country’s people.
Southern, coastal China has a moist climate, much like the southeastern 
United States, but the climate in northern China is drier. With only 7% of the world’s fresh water supply, China has an uphill battle in providing water resources to 1.34 billion people. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that southern China has 80% of the country’s water (Foreign Policy, 2011). To remedy the imbalance, China is now building a $60 billion canal system called the South-North Water Transfer Project that will include three different routes to divert water from the Yangtze River in southern China to the cities in the north (Fig. 2.2).
In this chapter, we examine the distribution of the world’s population at sev-
eral scales in order to understand where people live and why they live where they do. We also look into the continued growth of global population, noting that growth rates vary quite widely across our planet. Even as population growth in the wealthier core slows down to near (or below!) zero, it continues in the less wealthy periphery, in some countries at rates far above the global average. No such discus-sion would be complete without consideration of the health conditions prevailing across the world: health, well-being, and population growth tend to be closely related. And we will study the role of governments in their efforts to control the process.c02Population.indd Page 37  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 37  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

WHERE IN THE WORLD DO PEOPLE LIVE 
AND WHY?
When geographers study population, they focus on the 
variability of demographic features and factors across space. 
Demography is the study of population in general perspective, and population geographers work in tandem with demogra-phers, seeking answers to the problems posed by these varia-tions. The concept of scale is crucial in this research because such variability occurs from region to region, country to country, and within individual countries themselves.
Demographers report the population density of a 
country as a measure of total population relative to land size (Fig. 2.3). Population density assumes an even distri-bution of the population over the land. The United States, for example, with a territory of 3,717,796 square miles or 9,629,047 square kilometers (including the surfaces of lakes and ponds and coastal waters up to three nautical miles from shore) had a population of 308.2 million in 2010. This yields an average population density for the United States of just over 82 per square mile (32 per sq km). This density ﬁ  gure is also known as the country’s 
arithmetic population density, and in a very general way it emphasizes the contrasts between the United States and such countries as Bangladesh (2741 per sq mi or 1058 per sq km), the Netherlands (1046 per sq mile or 404 per sq km), and Japan (875 per sq mile or 338 per sq km).c02Population.indd Page 38  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 38  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Field Note
“An overpass across one of Yangon’s busy streets provides a 
good perspective on the press of humanity in lowland South-east Asia. Whether in urban areas or on small back roads in the countryside, people are everywhere—young and old, ﬁ  t 
and inﬁ  rm. When population densities are high in areas of poverty and unsophisticated infrastructure, vulnerabilities to natural hazards can be particularly great. This became stun-ningly evident in 2008 when a tropical cyclone devastated a signiﬁ  cant swath of the Irrawaddy Delta south of Yangon, killing some 100,000 people and leaving millions homeless.”
No country has an evenly distributed population, and 
arithmetic population ﬁ  gures do not reﬂ  ect the emptiness 
of most of Alaska and the sparseness of population in much of the West. In other cases, it is actually quite misleading. Egypt, with a population of 78.1 million in 2010, has a seemingly moderate arithmetic population density of 78 per square kilometer (201 per sq mi). Egypt’s territory of 1,000,445 square kilometers (386,660 sq mi) however, is mostly desert, and the vast majority of the population is crowded into the valley and delta of the Nile River. An estimated 98 percent of all Egyptians live on just 3 percent of the country’s land, so, the arithmetic population density ﬁ gure is meaningless in this case (Fig. 2.4 top, bottom).Physiologic Population Density
A superior index of population density relates the total population of a country or region to the area of arable  
(farmable) land it contains. This is called the physio-logic population density, defined as the number of people per unit area of agriculturally productive land. T ake again the case of Egypt. Although millions of people live in its great cities (Cairo and Alexandria) and smaller urban centers, the irrigated farmland is densely peopled as well. When we measure the entire population of Egypt relative to the arable land in the country, the resulting physiologic density figure for c02Population.indd Page 39  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 39  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

 Figure 2.4 top
Luxor, Egypt. © Alexander B. Murphy.
 Figure 2.4 bottom
Luxor, Egypt. © Alexander B. Murphy.Egypt in the year 2010 is 2599 per square kilometer 
(5717 per sq mi). This number is far more reflective of Egypt’s population pressure, and it continues to rise rapidly despite Egypt’s efforts to expand its irrigated farmlands.
Appendix B (at the end of this book) provides 
complete data on both arithmetic and physiologic pop-ulation densities, and some of the data stand out mark-edly. Mountainous Switzerland’s physiologic density is 10 times as high as its arithmetic density because only 1 out of every 10 acres in Switzerland is arable. Ukraine’s population is 45,600,000 and its arithmetic density (population per sq km) is 76. Ukraine has vast farm-lands which make its physiologic density 128 people per sq km of arable land. When comparing arithmetic density and physiologic density, the total number of people stays the same, and the only number that changes in calculating each is the amount of land. The difference in arithmetic density and physiologic den-sity for a single country reveals the proportion of arable 
land to all land. In the case of Ukraine, the physiologic density is 1.68 times as high as the arithmetic density because 1 out of every 1.68 acres of land in Ukraine is arable.
In Appendix B, the countries and territories of 
Middle America and the Caribbean stand out as having high physiologic densities compared to the moderate physiologic densities for South America. India’s physi-olog density is the lowest in South Asia despite its huge population. Both China and India have populations well 
over 1 billion, but according to the physiologic density, 
India has much more arable land per person than China.
Population Distribution
People are not distributed evenly across the world or within a country. One-third of the world’s population lives in China and India. Y et, each country has large expanses of land (the Himalayas in India and a vast inte-rior desert in China) where people are absent or sparsely distributed. In addition to studying population densi-ties, geographers study population distributions—descriptions of locations on the Earth’s surface where individuals or groups (depending on the scale) live. Geographers often represent population distributions on dot maps, in which one dot represents a certain 
number of a population. At the local scale, a dot map of population can show each individual farm in a sparsely populated rural area. At the global scale, the data are much more generalized. In the following sec-tion of this chapter, we study world population distri-bution and density.Field Note
“The contrasting character of the Egyptian landscape could not be more striking. Along the Nile River, the landscape is one of green ﬁ  elds, scattered trees, and modest houses, as along this stretch of the river’s west bank near Luxor (Fig. 2.4 top). But anytime I wander away from the river, brown, wind-sculpted sand dominates the scene as far as the eye can see (Fig. 2.4 bottom). Where people live and what they do is not just a product of culture; it is shaped by the physical envi-ronment as well.”c02Population.indd Page 40  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 40  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 Where in the World Do People Live and Why? 41
World Population Distribution and Density
From the beginning of humanity, people have been 
unevenly distributed over the land. T oday, contrasts between crowded countrysides and bustling cities on the one hand and empty reaches on the other hand have only intensiﬁ  ed. Historically, people tended to congregate in 
places where they could grow food—making for a high correlation between arable land and population density. Cities began in agricultural areas, and for most of history, people lived closest to the most agriculturally productive areas. In recent history, advances in agricultural technol-ogy and in transportation of agricultural goods have begun to change this pattern.
At the global scale, where one dot on a map repre-
sents 100,000 people, three major clusters of population jump out (Fig. 2.5). Each of the three largest population clusters is on the Eurasian (Europe and Asia combined) landmass. The fourth largest is in North America.
East Asia
Although the distribution map (Fig. 2.5) requires no color contrasts, Figure 2.6 depicts population density through shading: the darker the color, the larger the number of people per unit area. The most extensive area of dark shading lies in East Asia, primarily in China but also in Korea and Japan. Almost one-quarter of the world’s popu-lation is concentrated here—over 1.34 billion people in China alone.
In addition to high population density in China’s 
large cities, ribbons of high population density extend into the interior along the Yangtze and Y ellow River val-leys. Farmers along China’s major river valleys produce crops of wheat and rice to feed not only themselves but also the population of major Chinese cities such as Shang-hai and Beijing.
South Asia
The second major population concentration also lies in Asia and is similar in many ways to that of East Asia. At the heart of this cluster of more than 1.5 billion people lies India. The concentration extends into Pakistan and Ban-gladesh and onto the island of Sri Lanka. Here, people again cluster in major cities, on the coasts, and along rivers, such as the Ganges and Indus. The South Asia population cluster is growing more rapidly than the others as a result of China’s declining total fertility rate (TFR). Demogra-phers predict that by 2030, 1 out of 6 people in the world will live in India.
T wo physical geography barriers create the bound-
aries of the South Asia population cluster: the Himalaya Mountains to the north and the mountains west of the Indus River Valley in Pakistan. This is a conﬁ  ned region with a rapidly growing population. As in East Asia, the overwhelming majority of the people here are farmers, but in South Asia the pressure on the land is even greater. In Bangladesh, over 152 million people, almost all of them farmers, are crowded into an area about the size of Iowa. Over large parts of Bangladesh the rural population den-sity is between 3000 and 5000 people per square mile. By comparison, in 2010 the population of Iowa was just about 3 million people, and the rural population density was 53 people per square mile.
Europe
An axis of dense population extends from Ireland and the United Kingdom into Russia and includes large parts of Germany, Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus. It also includes the Netherlands and Belgium, parts of France, and north-ern Italy. This European cluster contains over 715 million inhabitants, less than half the population of the South Asia cluster. A comparison of the population and physical maps indicates that in Europe terrain and environment are not as closely related to population distribution as they are in East and South Asia. For example, note the lengthy exten-sion in Figure 2.5, which protrudes far into Russia. Unlike the Asian extensions, which reﬂ  ect fertile river valleys, the 
European extension reﬂ  ects the orientation of Europe’s 
coal ﬁ  elds. If you look closely at the physical map, you will note that comparatively dense population occurs even in mountainous, rugged country, such as the boundary zone between Poland and its neighbors to the south. A much greater correspondence exists between coastal and river lowlands and high population density in Asia than in Europe generally.
Another contrast can be seen in the number of Euro-
peans who live in cities and towns. The European popula-tion cluster includes numerous cities and towns, many of which developed as a result of the Industrial Revolution. In Germany, 88 percent of the people live in urban places; in the United Kingdom, 89 percent; and in France, 
74 percent. With so many people concentrated in the cities, the rural countryside is more open and sparsely populated than in East and South Asia (where only about 40 percent of the people reside in cities and towns).
The three major population concentrations we have 
discussed—East Asia, South Asia, and Europe—account for over 4 billion of the total world population of 7 billion people. Nowhere else on the globe is there a population cluster even half as great as any of these. The populations of South America and Africa combined barely exceed the population of India alone.

Washington, D.C. in the south to Boston, Massachusetts 
in the north. On Figure 2.5, the cities in this region agglomerate into one large urban area that includes Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New Y ork City, and Boston. Urban geographers use the term mega-lopolis to refer to such huge urban agglomerations. The cities of megalopolis account for more than 20 percent of the U.S. population.
Look at the global-scale map in Figure 2.6 and 
notice that the dense population concentration of meg-alopolis is stretched west into the nearby Canadian cit-ies of T oronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City. Adding these Canadian cities to the population of meg-alopolis creates a population cluster that is about one quarter the size of Europe’s population cluster. If you have lived or traveled in megalopolis, you can think about trafﬁ  c and comprehend what dense population means. However, recognize that the total population of megalopolis is 2.8 percent of the East Asian population cluster and that the 5,309 people per square mile density of New Y ork City does not rival the density in world cit-ies such as Mumbai, India, with a population density of  Figure 2.5

Reliability of Population Data
When the United States planned and conducted its 2010 population census, the government ran adver-tisements on television and sent mailings encouraging every person in the country to be counted. State and city governments also recognized the importance of having their citizens counted in order to gain more fed-eral dollars in per capita outlays because much federal government funding depends on population data. If the population of a disadvantaged group is undercounted, it translates into a loss of dollars for city governments that rely on federal government funding to pay for social services to disadvantaged groups. In addition to governments that provide services, advocates for disad-vantaged groups encourage people to ﬁ  ll out their cen-sus forms: they are concerned that the people already in disadvantaged groups suffer when they are under-counted in the census. Being undercounted also trans-lates into less government representation, for the SOUTHERNATLANTIC

number of congressional seats allotted to each state is 
based on the census counts.
Advocacy groups urged the census in 2000 and again 
in 2010 to sample the population and derive population sta-tistics from the samples. They argued that this would more accurately represent the true number of people in the United States. The United States Census Bureau contin-ued to conduct its census as it always has, trying to count each individual in its borders.
If a prosperous country such as the United States has 
problems conducting an accurate census, imagine the dif-ﬁ culties that must be overcome in less well-off countries. The cost, organization, and reporting of a census go beyond what many countries can afford or handle.
Several agencies collect data on world population. The 
United Nations records ofﬁ  cial statistics that national govern-ments assemble and report. The World Bank and the Popula-tion Reference Bureau also gather and generate data and report on the population of the world and of individual countries.
If you compare the population data reported by each 
of these sources, you will ﬁ  nd inconsistencies in the data. 
Data on population, growth rates, food availability, health conditions, and incomes are often informed estimates rather than actual counts. Figure 2.6

As we discussed in the ﬁ  eld note at the beginning of this 
chapter, the populations of China and India account for 40 percent of the world currently, and India is predicted to outpace China’s population in the 2030s.

In the late 1960s, alarms sounded throughout the 
world with the publication of Paul Ehrlich’s The Popula-
tion Bomb. Ehrlich and others warned that the world’s 
population was increasing too quickly—and was outpac-ing our food production! We can trace alarms over the burgeoning world population back to 1798, when British economist Thomas Malthus published An Essay on the Principles of Population. In this work Malthus warned that  Why Do Populations Rise or Fall in Particular Places?  45

the world’s population was increasing faster than the food 
supplies needed to sustain it. His reasoning was that food supplies grew linearly, adding acreage and crops incre-mentally by year, whereas population grew exponentially, compounding on the year before. From 1803 to 1826, Malthus issued revised editions of his essay and responded vigorously to a barrage of criticism.
The predictions Malthus made assumed food produc-
tion is conﬁ  ned spatially, that what people can eat within a country depends on what is grown in the country. We now know his assumption does not hold true; countries are not closed systems. Malthus did not foresee how globalization would aid the exchange of agricultural goods across the world. Mercantilism, colonialism, and capitalism brought interaction among the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Paciﬁ  c. Through global interaction, new agricultural methods developed, and commodities and livestock dif-fused across oceans. In the 1700s, farmers in Ireland grew dependent on a South American crop that was well suited for its rocky soils, the potato. T oday, wealthier countries that lack arable land, such as Norway, can import the major-ity of its foodstuffs, circumventing the limitations of their

lands. Each of these examples demonstrates that food pro-
duction is not conﬁ  ned spatially, as Malthus assumed.
Malthus assumed the growth of food production was 
linear, but food production has grown exponentially as the acreage under cultivation expands, mechanization of agri-cultural production diffuses, improved strains of seed are developed, and more fertilizers are used. In the twenty-ﬁ rst century, bioengineering continues to bring new 
hybrids, genetically modiﬁ  ed organisms, and countless 
herbicides and pesticides that enabled exponential growth in food production.Nonetheless, Malthus’s ideas continue to attract fol-
lowers. Neo-Malthusian scholars continue to share Mal-thus’s concerns, even if they do not agree with every detail of his argument, and continue to be alarmed at the con-tinuing rise in the world’s population. Neo-Malthusians point out that human suffering is now occurring on a scale unimagined even by Malthus. Although many demogra-phers predict the world population will stabilize later in the twenty-ﬁ  rst century, neo-Malthusians argue that over-population is a real problem that must be addressed now.

Population Growth at World, Regional, 
National, and Local Scales
Analysis of population growth and change requires 
attention to scale. In this section, we examine popula-tion growth at different scales, but we must be mindful that what happens at one scale can be affected by what is happening at other scales and in other places at the same time.
Keeping in mind that population change in one 
place can be affected rapidly by what is going on in a neighboring country or at the regional scale, one can gain some insights by looking at population change within the conﬁ ned territory of a country (or other administrative 
unit, such as a province or city). T o calculate the natural increase in a country’s population, simply subtract deaths from births. This is a simple statistic to calculate and comprehend. However, calculating the natural increase misses two other key components in a country’s popula-tion: immigration, which along with births adds to the total population, and emigration (outmigration), which along with deaths, subtracts from the total population. Using these four components, we can calculate demo-graphic change within a territory.
When we mapped population growth in Figure 2.7, 
we did not take into account emigration and immigra-tion. Other maps and tables of population growth you see may consider emigration and immigration. Statis-tics for each population trait can be calculated globally, by region, by country, or even by smaller locale. When studying population data across scales and across the world, we must constantly remind ourselves of exactly what is being calculated and for where. Otherwise, many of the statistics we read will seemingly be contradictory.
Population Growth at the Regional 
and National Scales
The world map of population growth rates (Fig. 2.7), dis-
played by country, conﬁ  rms the wide range of natural 
increases in different geographic regions. These variations have existed as long as records have been kept: countries and regions go through stages of expansion and decline at varying times. In the mid-twentieth century, the popula-tion of the former Soviet Union was growing vigorously. Thirty years ago, India’s population was growing at nearly 3.0 percent, more than most African countries; then India’s growth rate fell below that of Subsaharan Africa. T oday, Africa’s rate of natural increase still is higher than India’s (2.4 percent to 1.3 percent), but now Subsaharan Africa faces the impact of the AIDS epidemic, which is killing millions, orphaning children, reducing life expectancies, and curtailing growth rates.The map also reveals continuing high growth rates 
in Muslim countries of North Africa and Southwest Asia. Saudi Arabia has one of the highest growth rates in the world, but some smaller countries in this region are increasing even faster. For some time during the second half of the twentieth century, countries in this region saw their growth rates increase even as those in most of the rest of the world were declining. But more recently several of the fast-growing populations, for example, those of Iran and Morocco, have shown signiﬁ  cant 
declines. Demographers point to the correlation between high growth rates and the low standing of women: where cultural traditions restrict educational and professional opportunities for women, and men dominate as a matter of custom, rates of natural increase tend to be high.
South Asia is the most important geographic region 
in the population growth rate picture. The region includes the country that appears destined to overtake China as the world’s most populous: India. Only one country in this region has a growth rate lower than the world average: Sri Lanka. But Sri Lanka’s total popula-tion is only 20.8 million, whereas the fast-growing coun-tries, Pakistan and Bangladesh, have a combined population exceeding 333 million. India, as the map shows, is still growing well above the world average. The situation in East Asia, the world’s most populous region, is different. China’s ofﬁ  cial rate of natural growth has 
fallen well below 1.0 percent (0.5 in 2010), and Japan’s population is no longer growing. Southeast Asia’s natural growth rates remain higher, but this region’s total popu-lation is much lower than either East or South Asia; key countries, such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, have declining growth rates.
South America is experiencing signiﬁ  cant reductions 
in natural population growth rates, where those rates were alarmingly high just a generation ago. The region as a whole is still growing at 1.4 percent, but Brazil’s popula-tion, for example, has declined from 2.9 percent in the mid-1960s to 1.4 percent today. And the populations of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay are growing at rates well below the world average.
As Figure 2.7 shows, the slowest growing countries—
including those with declining rates of natural popula-tion increase—lie in the economically wealthier areas of the world extending from the United States and Canada across Europe and Japan. In the Southern Hemisphere, Australia, New Zealand, and Uruguay are in this category. Wealth is not the only reason for nega-tive population growth rates. Russia’s population is declining because of social dislocation in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union: deteriorating health conditions, high rates of alcoholism and drug use, and economic problems combine to shorten life expectancies c02Population.indd Page 48  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 48  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

(especially among males) and to lower birth rates. In 
recent years, Russia’s economy has improved, but its birth rate has remained low. Similar problems afﬂ  ict 
Ukraine and Kazakhstan, two of Russia’s neighbors, which also show slow or negative growth.
Between 1900 and 2000, the world population rose 
from 1.6 billion people to 6.1 billion, and in 2011, the world population reached 7 billion. The growth in world population is not a result of women having more children. Instead, the last century of population growth stems largely from longer life expectancies. In 1900, global life expectancy was 30 years, and by 2000, it was 65 years. Demographers now predict world population will stabi-lize at around 10 billion people by 2100.
Predictions of a stabilized global population are 
based on a combination of longer life expectancies coupled with lower fertility rates. Demographers measure whether a population can replace its deaths with births by looking at total fertility rates (TFRs). T o reach replacement 
levels—to keep a population stable over time without immigration—the women of childbearing age in a country need a TFR of 2.1. The TFR reports the average number of children born to a woman of childbearing age. In 2000, more than 60 countries, containing 45 percent of the world’s population, had fallen below replacement level (Fig. 2.8).
Demographers at the United Nations predict the 
TFR of the combined world will fall to 2.1 by 2030. The world TFR combines regions including Europe, where fertility levels are low (Fig. 2.9), and regions including Africa, where fertility levels are high. Predicting popula-tion growth is difﬁ  cult because so much depends on the decisions made by women of childbearing age. Demogra-phers and population geographers agree that two major trends are happening now that will inﬂ  uence how much the world population continues to grow. First is the aging population of Europe, China, and Japan, and second is the declining fertility rate in many developing countries including Brazil and Iran.
Both the aging population of developed countries 
and the declining fertility rates in developing countries lead to predictions that the global population will con-tinue to grow but at a lower rate. The United Nations reports the proportion of older to younger people in a country with the aging index, which is the number of people age 65 and older per 100 children ages 0–14. The aging index reveals an older Europe with 263 older people for every 100 children and a younger Africa with 37 older people for every 100 children.
Why are women having fewer children? In wealthier 
countries, more women are choosing to stay in school, work on careers, and marry later, delaying childbirth. The impact of the aging population of Europe can be seen in the number of elderly people each person in the working-age population supports through taxes.An aging population requires substantial social 
adjustments. Older people retire and eventually suffer health problems, so they need pensions and medical care. The younger workers in the population must work in order to provide the tax revenues that enable the state to pay for these services. As the proportion of older people in a country increases, the proportion of younger people decreases. Thus, fewer young workers are providing tax revenues to support programs providing services for more retired people. T o change the age distribution of an aging country and provide more taxpayers, the only answer is immigration: inﬂ  uxes of younger workers to do the work 
locals are unable or unwilling to do.
What will happen when a country resists immigra-
tion despite an aging population? Over the next half-century, Japan will be an interesting case study. Japan’s population is no longer growing, and projections indi-cate the Japanese population will decline as it ages. The population fell from a peak of 127.84 million in 2004 to 127.51 million in 2009. Japan predicts its population will fall below 100 million to 95.15 million by 2050. Japan was a closed society for hundreds of years, and even today, the Japanese government discourages immigra-tion and encourages homogeneity of the population. More than 98 percent of the country’s population is Japa-nese, according to government statistics. In August 
1999, the British newspaper The Guardian reported that the Japanese government’s efforts to maintain the homo-geneity of the population are often “lauded domestically as a reason for the country’s low crime rate” and strong industrial economy.
In developing countries, a combination of govern-
ment and nongovernment organizational programs encourage women to have fewer children. Some women are also choosing to have fewer children because of eco-nomic and social uncertainty in the developing world. T oday, TFRs are falling almost everywhere on Earth, in large part because of family planning. In some countries fertility rates are declining dramatically. Kenya’s TFR is now down to 4.6; China’s fell from 6.1 to 1.75 in just 35 years, and in 2010 dropped to 1.5. Once the government of Iran began to allow family planning, the TFR fell from 6.8 in 1980 to 1.8 in 2010.
There was a time when a low TFR seemed to be a 
desirable national objective, something that all govern-ments would surely want. However, long-term eco-nomic implications and demographic projections gave many governments pause. Countries need a young, vig-orous, working-age population in order to work and pay taxes to support the long-term needs of an aging popu-lation. When governments saw their population growth rates decline sharply, many took countermeasures. China softened its One-Child Only policy, Sweden, Russia, and other European countries provided ﬁ  nancial

TFRs and population decline? Despite declining popu-
lation growth rates and even negative growth rates (growth rates below 0.0) in a number of the world’s countries, the global population continues to rise. The worldwide TFR was 2.6 in 2007, above the replacement level of 2.1. Although the population bomb Ehrlich warned of is no longer ticking at the same rapid pace, the worldwide population continues to grow. The low TFRs incentives like long maternity leaves and state-paid day-care to prospective mothers, and even the Japanese found themselves in a national debate over family size and immigration. Still, such programs and debates have so far had limited success in encouraging sustained pop-ulation growth.
How can the worldwide population continue to 
increase when so many countries are experiencing low  Figure 2.8

and low population growth rates enumerated in this 
chapter are dwarfed by continued additions to the popu-lation in countries where growth rates are still relatively high, such as India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nigeria.
One way to easily grasp the growth rate in world 
population is to compare the population’ s rate of growth 
to its doubling time. Every rate of growth has a dou-bling time; for example, if you invest $100 at 10 per-cent, compounded annually (exponentially), it would take about seven years to double to $200, and then another seven years to become $400, and then another seven years to become $800. When the growth rate is 10 percent, therefore, the doubling time is around seven years.
T wo thousand years ago, the world’s population was 
an estimated 250 million. More than 16 centuries passed before this total had doubled to 500 million, the estimated Tropic of CancerArctic Circle

falling in many places, fears of global population doubling 
quickly are deﬁ  nitely subsiding. Many indicators, such as 
the slowing of the doubling time, suggest that the worst may be over, that the explosive population growth of the twentieth century will be followed by a marked and accel-erating slowdown during the twenty-ﬁ  rst century. The 
global growth rate is now down to 1.4 percent, perhaps slightly lower. But today the world’s population is 7 bil-lion, yielding an increase in world population that still exceeds 80 million annually at this growth rate.
As a result of falling TFRs in both the developing 
and developed world, demographers no longer caution about doubling time. With women having fewer chil-dren, many demographers are predicting the world may reach zero population growth in the next 50 years. In population in 1650. Just 170 years later, in 1820 (when Malthus was still writing), the population had doubled again, to 1 billion (Fig. 2.10). And barely more than a cen-tury after this, in 1930, it reached 2 billion. The doubling time was down to 100 years and dropping fast; the popu-lation explosion was in full gear. Only 45 years elapsed during the next doubling, to 4 billion (1975). During the mid-1980s, when the rate declined to 1.8 percent, the doubling slowed to 39 years. T oday, world population is doubling in 54 years, and the continuing slowdown in the estimated doubling rate is one of the bright spots in the problematic demographic picture.
For demographers and population geographers who 
study global population growth today, the concept of dou-bling time is losing much of its punch. With populations  Figure 2.9

Field Note
“My mind was on wine. I was in Bordeaux, France, walking down the street to the Bordeaux Wines Museum (Musée des Vins de Bordeaux) with a friend from the city. Hav-ing just ﬂ  own from Dakar, Senegal, after spending several 
weeks in Subsaharan Africa, I found my current surround-ings strikingly different. Observing the buildings and the people around me, I noticed that after having been among so many young children in Subsaharan Africa, the majority of the inhabitants I encountered in Bordeaux were adults. I turned to my friend and asked, ‘Where are all the children?’ He looked around, pointed, and replied, ‘There goes one now!’ In Bordeaux, in Paris, in all of France and the rest of Europe, there are fewer children and populations are aging (Fig. 2.9).”c02Population.indd Page 52  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 52  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 Why Do Populations Rise or Fall in Particular Places?  53
Population Growth within Countries
The information provided in Figure 2.7 is based on 
countrywide statistics. Signiﬁ  cant demographic varia-tions also occur within countries. Political geographers call countries states. State governments partition their countries into administrative units called States (United States), provinces (Canada), departments (France) or the like. In India, for example, States in the north record population growth rates far above the national average (Fig. 2.11). But other States, in the west and southwest region, have populations that are growing much more slowly. Women in southern India have higher female lit-eracy, greater land ownership rates, better access to health care, and more access to birth control methods. All of these factors keep the growth rates lower in the south than the north of India.
In the 1950s, India became the ﬁ  rst country in the 
world to institute a population planning program, before the fear of worldwide overpopulation and a global popula-tion bomb spread. In the 1960s, when census numbers revealed the extreme growth rates in the north, the Indian government instituted a national population planning program, encouraging States to join.
Despite the federal effort, rapid population growth 
continues, especially in the northern and eastern States. India is a federation of 28 States and 7 union territories, and the individual States differ greatly both culturally and politically. Social problems arose in some of the States where governments pursued the population planning campaign vigorously. During the 1970s, the Indian gov-ernment began a policy of forced sterilization of any man with three or more children. The State of Maharashtra sterilized 3.7 million people before public opposition led to rioting, and the government abandoned the program (Fig. 2.12). Other States also engaged in compulsory ster-ilization programs, with heavy social and political costs—eventually, 22.5 million people were sterilized.
The horrors of the forced sterilization program of 
the 1970s are haunting India again. In 2004, three dis-tricts in the State of Uttar Pradesh (India’s most popu-lous State with over 170 million people) instituted a policy of exchanging gun licenses for sterilization. The policy allowed for a shotgun license in exchange for the sterilization of two people and a revolver license in exchange for the sterilization of ﬁ  ve people. Abuse 
began almost immediately, with wealthy landowners sterilizing their laborers in exchange for gun licenses. Before the “guns for sterilization” policy, districts in Uttar Pradesh encouraged sterilization by providing access to housing and extra food for people who agreed to be sterilized.
T oday, most Indian State governments are using 
advertising and persuasion—not guns for sterilization—to encourage families to have fewer children. Posters urging fact, current predictions point to zero population growth globally by the end of the century, with population rising to 9.3 billion by 2050 and then leveling off around 10 billion people.
No single factor can explain the variations shown 
in Figure 2.7. Economic prosperity as well as social dis-location reduce natural population growth rates. Eco-nomic well-being, associated with urbanization, higher levels of education, later marriage, family planning, and other factors, lowers population growth. In the table presented in Appendix B, compare the indices for natu-ral population increase and the percentage of the popu-lation that is urbanized. In general, the higher the population’s level of urbanization, the lower its natural increase. Cultural traditions also inﬂ  uence rates of pop-ulation growth, Religion, for example, has a powerful impact on family planning and thus on growth rates, not only in Islamic countries but also in traditional Chris-tian societies (note the Roman Catholic Philippines’ growth rate) and in Hindu-dominated communities (such as India).

people to have small families are everywhere, and the gov-
ernment supports a network of family planning clinics even in the remotest villages. The southern States con-tinue to report the lowest growth rates, correlating with higher wealth and higher education levels and literacy rates of females in these States. The eastern and northern States, the poorer regions of India, continue to report the highest growth rates.
Our world map of growth rates is a global overview, a 
mere introduction to the complexities of the geography of population. The example of India demonstrates that what we see at the scale of a world map does not give us the complete story of what is happening within each country or region of the world. Both India and China have over 1 billion people, but as a result of the higher growth rates in India (1.64) and declining growth rates in China (.5), demographers predict India will become the most popu-lated country in the world in 2030.
The Demographic Transition
The high population growth rates now occurring in many poorer countries are not necessarily permanent. In Europe, population growth changed several times in the last three centuries. Demographers used data on baptisms and funerals from churches in Great Britain to study changes in birth and death rates of the population. They expected the rate of natural increase of the population—the difference between the number of births and the num-ber of deaths—to vary over different periods of time. Demographers calculated the crude birth rate (CBR), 
the number of live births per year per thousand people in the population (Fig. 2.13), and the crude death rate 
(CDR), the number of deaths per year per thousand peo-ple (Fig. 2.14).
The church data revealed that before the Industrial 
Revolution began in Great Britain in the 1750s, the coun-try experienced high birth rates and high death rates, with small differences between the two. The result was low population growth. After industrialization began, the death rates in Great Britain began to fall as a result of bet-ter and more stable access to food and improved access to increasingly effective medicines. With a rapidly falling death rate and a birth rate that remained high, Britain’s population explosion took place. From the late 1800s through two world wars in the 1900s, death rates contin-ued to fall and birth rates began to fall, but stayed higher than death rates, resulting in continued population growth but at a slower rate. Finally, in recent history, both the birth rate and death rate in Great Britain declined to low levels, resulting in slow or stabilized pop-ulation growth.
Demographers call the shift in population growth 
the demographic transition. The transition is typically 
modeled as shown in Figure 2.15. The model is based on the kind of shift that Britain experienced, but other places either have gone through a similar shift or are in the pro-cess of doing so. The initial low-growth phase, which in all places endured for most of human history, is marked by high birth rates and equally high death rates. In this phase, epidemics and plagues keep the death rates high among all sectors of the population—in some cases so high that they exceed birth rates. For Great Britain and the rest of Europe, death rates exceeded birth rates during the bubonic plague (the Black Death) of the 1300s, which hit in waves beginning in Crimea on the Black Sea, diffusing through trade to Sicily and other Mediterranean islands, and moving through contagious diffusion and the travel of rats (which hosted the vector, the ﬂ  ea, that spread the plague) north from the Mediterranean.
Once the plague hit a region, it was likely to return 
within a few years time, creating another wave of human suf-fering. Estimates of plague deaths vary between one-quarter and one-half of the population, with the highest death rates recorded in the West (where trade among regions was the greatest) and the lowest in the East (where cooler climates and less connected populations delayed diffusion). Across Europe, many cities and towns were left decimated. Histo-rians estimate the population of Great Britain fell from nearly 4 million when the plague began to just over 2 mil-lion when it ended.
Famines also limited population growth. A famine in 
Europe just prior to the plague likely facilitated the diffu-sion of the disease by weakening the people. Records of famines in India and China during the eighteenth and nine-teenth centuries document millions of people perishing. At other times, destructive wars largely wiped out population gains. Charts of world population growth show an increase in the world’s population from 250 million people 2000 years ago to 500 million people in 1650 and 1 billion people in 1820. However, the lines connecting these points in time should not trend steadily upward. Rather, they turn up and down frequently, reﬂ  ecting the impacts of disease, crop 
failures, and wars.
The beginning of the Industrial Revolution ush-
ered in a period of accelerating population growth in Europe. Before workers could move from farms to facto-ries, a revolution in agriculture had to occur. The eigh-teenth century marked the Second Agricultural Revolution, so named because the ﬁ  rst occurred thou-sands of years earlier (see Chapter 11). During the Sec-ond Agricultural Revolution, farmers improved seed selection, practiced new methods of crop rotation, selec-tively bred livestock to increase production and quality, employed new technology such as the seed drill, expanded storage capacities, and consolidated landhold-ings for greater efﬁ  ciencies. With more efﬁ  cient farming 
methods, the number of people needed in farming decreased and the food supply increased, thereby sup-porting a higher population overall.

In the 1800s, as the Industrial Revolution diffused 
through continental Europe, other advances also helped 
lower death rates. Sanitation facilities made towns and cities safer from epidemics, and modern medical prac-tices diffused. Disease prevention through vaccination introduced a new era in public health. The combined improvements in food supply and medical practice resulted in a drastic reduction in death rates. Before 1750 death rates in Europe probably averaged 35 per 1000 (birth rates averaged under 40), but by 1850 the death rate was down to about 16 per 1000.Birth rates fell at a slower rate, leading to a popula-
tion explosion. The increase in the rate of population growth in Europe spurred waves of migration. Millions of people left the squalid, crowded industrial cities (and farms as well) to emigrate to other parts of the world. They were not the ﬁ  rst to make this journey. Adventurers, explorers, merchants, and colonists had gone before them. In a major wave of colonization from 1500 through the 1700s, Euro-pean migrants decimated native populations through con-quest, slavery, and the introduction of diseases against which the local people had no natural immunity.c02Population.indd Page 56  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 56  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 Why Do Populations Rise or Fall in Particular Places?  57
When a second wave of European colonization began 
in Africa and Asia during the late 1800s, the Europeans 
brought with them their newfound methods of sanitation and medical techniques, and these had the opposite effect. By the mid-1900s, declining death rates in Africa, India, and South America brought rapid population increases to these regions. At this point, new alarms and cautions of worldwide overpopulation rang.
Although the global alarms continued to ring, they 
subsided for populations in Europe and North America when population growth rates began to decline in the ﬁ rst half of the 1900s. The cause was a signiﬁ  cant 
decline in birth rates. Populations continued to grow, but at a much slower rate. Many countries in Latin America and Asia experienced falling birth rates later in the twentieth century, which helped slow the global population growth rate.
Why have birth rates declined? Throughout the 
1900s, lower birth rates arrived ﬁ  rst in countries with 
greater urbanization, wealth, and medical advances. As more and more people moved to cities, both the econom-ics and the culture of large families changed. Instead of Tropic of Cancer

decisions by many women to have fewer or no children or 
to start having children at a later age have all lowered birth rates within a country.
In some parts of the world, countries are now experi-
encing exceptionally low TFRs. Low birth rates along with low death rates put the countries in a position of neg-ligible, or even negative, population growth. Birth rates are lowest in the countries where women are the most educated and most involved in the labor force.lending a hand on the family farm, children in urban areas were often seen as a drain on the family ﬁ  nances. At 
the same time, new opportunities—especially for women—were not always compatible with large families. Hence, many women delayed marriage and childbearing. Medical advances lowered infant and child mortality rates, lessen-ing the sense that multiple children were necessary to sustain a family.

Future Population Growth
It may be unwise to assume that the demographic cycles of 
all countries will follow the sequence that occurred in industrializing Europe or to believe that the still-signiﬁ  cant 
population growth currently taking place in Bangladesh, Mexico, and numerous other countries will simply sub-side. Nonetheless, many agencies monitoring global pop-ulation suggest that the populations of most (if not all) countries will stop growing at some time during the twenty-ﬁ  rst century, reaching a so-called stationary pop-
ulation level (SPL). This would mean that the world’s population would stabilize and that the major problems to be faced would involve the aged rather than the young.
Such predictions require frequent revision, how-
ever, and anticipated dates for population stabilization are often moved back. Only a few years ago, the United Nations predicted world population would stabilize at c02Population.indd Page 59  10/21/11  12:06 PM user f-400c02Population.indd Page 59  10/21/11  12:06 PM user f-400 F-400F-400
60 Chapter 2   Population
WHY DOES POPULATION COMPOSITION 
MATTER?
Maps showing the regional distribution and density 
of populations tell us about the number of people in coun-
tries or regions, but they cannot reveal two other aspects of those populations: the number of men and women and their ages. These aspects of population, the population 
composition, are important because a populous country where half the population is very young has quite different problems than a populous country where a large propor-tion of the population is elderly. When geographers study populations, therefore, they are concerned not only with spatial distribution and growth rates but also with popula-tion composition.
The composition is the structure of a population in 
terms of age, sex, and other properties such as marital status and education. Age and sex are key indicators of population composition, and demographers and geogra-phers use population pyramids to represent these traits visually.
The population pyramid displays the percentages of 
each age group in the total population (normally ﬁ  ve-year 
increments) by a horizontal bar whose length represents its share. Males in the group are to the left of the center line, females to the right.
A population pyramid can instantly convey the 
demographic situation in a country. In poorer coun-tries, where birth and death rates generally remain high, the pyramid looks like an evergreen tree, with wide branches at the base and short ones near the top 10 billion in 200 years. The United Nations changed its predictions based on lower fertility rates in many coun-tries. All agencies reporting population predictions have to revise their predictions periodically. In the late 1980s, for example, the World Bank predicted that the United States would reach SPL in 2035 with 276 mil-lion inhabitants. Brazil’s population would stabilize at 353 million in 2070, Mexico’s at 254 million in 2075, and China’s at 1.4 billion in 2090. India, destined to become the world’s most populous country, would reach SPL at 1.6 billion in 2150.
T oday these ﬁ  gures are unrealistic. China’s popula-
tion passed the 1.2 billion mark in 1994, and India’s reached 1 billion in 1998. If we were to project an optimis-tic decline in growth rates for both countries, China’s population would “stabilize” at 1.4 billion in 2025 and India’s at 1.7 billion in 2060, according to a 2011 United Nations report. But population increase is a cyclical phe-nomenon, and overall declines mask lags and spurts as well as regional disparities.
Examine Appendix B at the end of the book. Study the growth rate column. Which countries have the highest growth rates? Determine what stage of the demographic transition these countries are in, and hypothesize what may lead them to the next stage. Figure 2.15

 Why Does Population Composition Matter?  61
In countries with economic wealth, pyramid shapes 
change. Families become smaller, children fewer. A 
composite population pyramid for wealthier countries looks like a slightly lopsided vase, with the largest com-ponents of the population not at the bottom but in the middle. The middle-age bulge is moving upward, reﬂ ecting the aging of the population (Fig. 2.17) and the 
declining TFR. Countries with low TFR and high wealth, such as Italy, France, and Sweden, ﬁ  t into this pyramid model.(Fig. 2.16). The youngest age groups have the largest share of the population; in the composite pyramid shown here, the three groups up to age 14 account for more than 30 percent of the population. Older people, in the three highest age groups, represent only about 4 percent of the total. Slight variations of this pyramidal shape mark the population structure of such countries as Pakistan, Y emen, Guatemala, The Congo, and Laos. From age group 15 to 19 upward, each group is smaller than the one below it. Figure 2.16
Age–Sex Population Pyramids for Countries with High Population Growth Rates.

INFLUENCE POPULATION DYNAMICS?
The condition of a country’s population requires much 
more than simply knowing the total population or the growth 
rate. Also of signiﬁ  cance is the welfare of the country’s people across regions, ethnicities, or social classes. Among the most important inﬂ  uences on population dynamics are geographical differences in sanitation, the prevalence of diseases, and the availability of health care.Infant Mortality
One of the leading measures of the condition of a coun-try’s population is the infant mortality rate (IMR). Infant mortality is recorded as a baby’s death during the ﬁ  rst year 
following its birth (unlike child mortality, which records death between ages 1 and 5). Infant mortality is normally given as the number of cases per thousand, that is, per thousand live births.
Infant and child mortality reﬂ  ect the overall health 
of a society. High infant mortality has a variety of causes, c02Population.indd Page 62  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 62  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 How Does the Geography of Health Inﬂ  uence Population Dynamics? 63
the physical health of the mother being a key factor. In 
societies where most women bear a large number of babies, the women also tend to be inadequately nourished, exhausted from overwork, suffering from disease, and poorly educated. Often, infants die because they are improperly weaned. Demographers report that many children die because their parents do not know how to cope with the routine childhood problem of diarrhea. This condition, together with malnutrition, is the leading killer of children throughout the world. Poor sanitation is yet another threat to infants and children. Estimates are that more than one-ﬁ  fth of the world’s population lacks ready access to clean drinking water or hygienic human waste-disposal facilities.
The map showing the world distribution of infant mor-
tality (Fig. 2.18) reveals high rates in many poorer countries. The map shows infant mortality patterns at ﬁ  ve levels ranging from 100 or more per thousand (one death for every eight live births) to fewer than 15. Compare this map to that of overall crude death rate (CDR) in Figure 2.14, and the role of infant mortality in societies with high death rates is evident.
The lowest infant mortality rate among larger popu-
lations has long been reported by Japan, with 3.0 deaths per 1000 live births in a country of over 127 million people.

64 Chapter 2   Population
Some less populated countries show even lower IMRs. Sin-
gapore has over 4.5 million people and an incredibly low IMR of just under 3, and Sweden’s nearly 9 million people record an IMR of 2.8.
In 2008, 22 countries still reported an IMR of 100 or 
more, and several had rates of 125 or higher—that is, one death or more among every eight newborns. Sierra Leone and Afghanistan had the highest IMR: 165. Dreadful as these ﬁ  gures are, they are a substantial improvement over the situation 20 years ago (although they are not much improved since 1997). Globally, infant mortality has been declining, even in the poverty-stricken regions of the world.
Each of these observations about infant mortality 
rates considers what is happening within an entire coun-try. The IMR varies within countries and gives us a lens into variations in access to health care and health educa-tion within a country. A statistic typically varies by region, ethnicity, social class, or other criteria. The IMR of South Africa is 48 per 1000, an average of all the people within the country’s borders. The IMR for South African whites is near the European average; for black Africans it is nearer the African average; and for the Coloured and Asian population sectors it lies between these two ﬁ  gures. 
The reported average for South Africa does not tell ethnic and class differences within South Africa.
In the United States, in 2004, the IMR for African 
Americans was 13.6, above the countrywide average of 6.8 and the IMR of 5.7 for non-Hispanic whites. The risk fac-tors that lead to a high IMR afﬂ  ict African Americans at a 
much higher rate than non-Hispanic whites in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 88.9 percent of non-Hispanic whites but only 76.5 percent of African Americans received prenatal care starting in the ﬁ rst trimester of their pregnancy. Lower education levels 
for African American women also contributed to the higher IMR. One risk factor that contributes to high IMR, smok-ing during pregnancy, was higher for non-Hispanic whites. The Centers for Disease Control found that 13.8 percent of non-Hispanic whites smoked cigarettes during preg-nancy in 2004, and 8.4 percent of African American women smoked during pregnancy.
The IMR in the United States also varies by 
region, with the highest IMR in the South and the low-est in the Northeast (Fig. 2.19). Race, ethnicity, social

ries, causes the deaths of millions more. In some coun-
tries, more than one in ﬁ  ve children still die between their ﬁ  rst and ﬁ  fth birthdays, a terrible record in the twenty-ﬁ  rst century.
Life Expectancy
Another indicator of a society’s well-being lies in the life expectancy of its members at birth, the number of years, on average, someone may expect to remain alive. Figure 2.21 shows the average life expectancies of popu-lations by country and thus does not take into account gender differences. Women outlive men by about four years in Europe and East Asia, three years in Subsaharan Africa, six years in North America, and seven years in South America. In Russia today, the difference is approximately 12 years.
The map does reveal huge regional contrasts. At 
the start of the century, world average life expectancy was 68 for women and 64 for men. Not only are these levels exceeded in the wealthy countries of the West-ern world, but great progress has also been made in East Asia, where Japan’s life expectancies are the high-est in the world. With its low infant and child mortal-ity rates and low fertility rates, Japan’s life expectancy is predicted to rise to 106 by the year 2300. By con-trast, tropical Subsaharan African countries have the lowest life expectancies. In Subsaharan Africa, the spread of AIDS over the past three decades has low-ered life expectancies in some countries below 40, a level not seen for centuries.
Life expectancies can change in relatively short 
order. In the former Soviet Union, and especially in Rus-sia, the life expectancies of males dropped quite precipi-tously following the collapse of communism, from 68 to 62 years. In 2010, the United Nations estimated the life expectancy for males in Russia was 63. A 2010 report in Foreign Affairs credited “poor diet, smoking, sedentary lifestyles” and alcoholism as the main reasons why men in Russia have lower life expectancies than women.” In 2011, the United Nations estimated Russia’s life expectancy for females was 75, twelve years longer than the life expec-tancy of Russian men.
Life expectancy ﬁ  gures do not mean everyone lives 
to a certain age. The ﬁ  gure is an average that takes account of the children who die young and the people who survive well beyond the average. The dramatically lower ﬁ  gures 
for the world’s poorer countries primarily reﬂ  ect high 
infant mortality. A person who has survived beyond child-hood can survive well beyond the recorded life expec-tancy. The low life expectancy ﬁ  gures for the malnourished countries remind us again how hard hit children are in poorer parts of the world.class, education levels, and access to health care also vary by region in the United States, and these correla-tions are found for many health problems from diabetes to heart disease.
According to the Ofﬁ  ce of Minority Health and 
Health Disparities at the Centers for Disease Control in the United States, “The leading causes of infant death include congenital abnormalities, pre-term/low birth weight, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), prob-lems related to complications of pregnancy, and respira-tory distress syndrome. SIDS deaths among American Indian and Alaska Natives is 2.3 times the rate for non-Hispanic white mothers.”
Another measurement of the health of children 
early in life is the newborn death rate, a measurement of the number of children who die in the ﬁ  rst month of life 
out of every 1000 live births. Surprisingly, the United States has the second highest newborn death rate  in the 
world. The annual State of the World’s Mothers report explains that the high newborn death rate in the United States and in other wealthy countries is typically from premature births and low-birth-rate babies. In the poorer countries of the world, diarrhea and infections cause half of newborn deaths.
Figure 2.20 maps the Mother’s Index from the State 
of the World’s Mothers report. The Mother’s Index mea-sures 10 barometers of well-being for mothers and chil-dren. Although the United States has a high newborn death rate, its position on the Mother’s Index is high. The overwhelmingly low measurements for Subsaharan Africa on the Mother’s Index conﬁ  rms that poverty is a huge fac-tor in the health of women and children. Speciﬁ  cally, 
99 percent of newborn deaths and 98 percent of maternal deaths (deaths from giving birth) occur in the poorer countries of the world.
In the countries in the world experiencing violent 
conﬂ ict, the Mother’s Index plunges, and the chances of 
newborn survival fall. Examine Figure 2.20 again and note the position of countries that have violent conﬂ  ict or a 
recent history of conﬂ  ict: Iraq, Afghanistan, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Angola.
Child Mortality
Infants who survive their ﬁ  rst year of life still do not have a long life expectancy in the poorer areas of the world. The child mortality rate, which records the deaths of children between the ages of 1 and 5, remains staggeringly high in much of Africa and Asia, notably in the protein-deﬁ  cient tropical and subtropical zones. Kwashiorkor (also known as protein malnutrition), a malady resulting from a lack of protein early in life, afﬂ icts millions of children; marasmus, a condition that 
results from inadequate protein and insufﬁ  cient calo-c02Population.indd Page 65  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 65  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Inﬂ  uence on Health and Well-Being
Health and well-being are closely related to location and 
environment. People who live in Iceland (where mosqui-toes are rare) do not need to worry about contracting malaria, unless they travel to parts of the tropics where malaria prevails. People who live in close proximity to animals, including livestock, run a greater risk of catching certain diseases than do people who live in cities. When an outbreak of a particular disease occurs (for example “bird ﬂ u” in East Asia), its source and diffusion are studied by 
specialists in medical geography.Medical geographers study diseases, and they also 
use locational analysis to predict diffusion and prescribe prevention strategies. A medical geographer can answer questions such as: Where is the bird ﬂ  u most likely to dif-
fuse and under what time line if an outbreak occurs in New Y ork City? If a country receives enough funding to build 25 clinics for people in rural areas, where should these clinics be located so as to allow a maximum of patients to be able to reach them?
Diseases can be grouped into categories to make it 
easier to understand the risks they pose. About 65 per-cent of all diseases are known as infectious diseases ,  Figure 2.20

resulting from an invasion of parasites and their multipli-
cation in the body. Malaria is an infectious disease. The remainder can be divided into the chronic or degenera-tive diseases, the maladies of longevity and old age such as heart disease, and the genetic or inherited diseases  
we can trace to our ancestry, that is, the chromosomes and genes that deﬁ  ne our makeup. Sickle-cell anemia, 
hemophilia, and lactose intolerance are among these genetic diseases. These can be of special geographic interest because they tend to appear in certain areas and in particular populations, suggesting the need for special, local treatment.Three geographic terms are used to describe the spa-
tial extent of a disease. A disease is endemic when it pre-vails over a small area. A disease is epidemic when it spreads over a large region. A pandemic disease is global in scope.
Infectious Diseases
Infectious diseases continue to sicken and kill millions of people annually. Malaria, an old tropical disease, alone still takes more than a million lives annually and infects about 300 million people today. HIV/AIDS, an afﬂ  iction Tropic of CancerArctic Circle

that erupted in Africa only about 30 years ago, has killed 
about 25 million people since that time. These two mala-dies illustrate two kinds of infectious disease: vectored and nonvectored.
A vectored infectious disease such as malaria is trans-
mitted by a intermediary vector—in malaria’s case a mos-quito. What happens is that the mosquito stings an already-infected person or animal, called a host, and sucks up some blood carrying the parasites. These parasites then reproduce and multiply in the mosquito’s body and reach its saliva. The next time that mosquito stings someone, some of the parasites are injected into that person’s blood-stream. Now that person develops malaria as the parasites multiply in his or her body, and he or she is a host.Mosquitoes are especially effective vectors of 
infectious diseases ranging from yellow fever (another historic illness) to dengue fever (a newer disease that is fast spreading—see Chapter 1). But mosquitoes are only one kind of vector. Fleas, flies, worms, snails, and other vectors transmit such terrible diseases as sleep-ing sickness, river blindness, guinea worm, elephantia-sis, and numerous others. T ropical climates, where warm, moist conditions allow vectors to thrive, are the worst-afflicted areas of the world, but infectious dis-eases are a global phenomenon.
No disease in human history has taken more lives 
than malaria, and the battle against this scourge still is not won. On the day you read this, about 3000 people will die c02Population.indd Page 68  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 68  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

from malaria, the great majority of them in Africa and 
most of them children. What these numbers do not tell you is that an estimated 3 to 5 million people live lives that are shortened and weakened by malaria infection. If you do not die from malaria as a youngster, you are likely to be incapacitated or struggle in exhaustion with chronically severe anemia throughout your life (see Chapter 10 for a longer discussion of malaria).
Nonvectored infectious diseases, such as inﬂ  uenza, 
are transmitted by direct contact between host and victim. A kiss, a handshake, or even the slightest brush can trans-mit inﬂ  uenza, a cold, or some other familiar malady. Even standing close to another person who exhales and spreads tiny moisture particles can transmit the disease to you. HIV/AIDS (discussed below) is a nonvectored infectious disease that is transmitted primarily through sexual con-tact and secondarily through needle sharing in intrave-nous drug use.
Chronic and Genetic Diseases
Chronic diseases (also called degenerative diseases) are the afﬂ ictions of middle and old age, reﬂ  ecting higher life 
expectancies. Among the chronic diseases, heart disease, cancers, and strokes rank as the leading diseases in this cat-egory, but pneumonia, diabetes, and liver diseases also take their toll. In the United States 100 years ago, tuberculosis, Tropic of Cancer

the result can be serious metabolic malfunction. For 
example, some people suffer from a malady called primary lactose intolerance. If you suffer from this disorder, you do not have an adequate supply of one (or a set) of enzymes that you need to break down the milk sugar lactose.
AIDS
Low life expectancies in some parts of the world are caused by the ravages of diseases such as AIDS (Acquired Immune Deﬁ  ciency Syndrome)—a disease identiﬁ  ed in 
Africa in the early 1980s. Undoubtedly, AIDS had taken hold in Africa years earlier, perhaps decades earlier. But its rapid diffusion worldwide began in the 1980s, creat-ing one of the greatest health catastrophes of the past century. Nowhere has its impact been greater than in Africa itself.
Medical geographers estimate that in 1980 about 
200,000 people were infected with HIV (Human Immu-nodeﬁ  ciency Virus, which causes AIDS), all of them 
Africans. By 2007, the number worldwide exceeded 33.2 million according to the United Nations AIDS Program, with 68 percent (22.5 million) of all cases in Subsaharan Africa! The infection rate has been slowing, and some regions have experienced a downturn, but eastern Europe and Central Asia have recently seen a surge in HIV infection.
AIDS is a debilitating disease that weakens the body 
and reduces its capacity to combat other infections. It is spread through bodily contact that involves the exchange of bodily ﬂ  uids such as blood or semen. Sexual activity and shared needles can transmit it, but so can blood transfu-sions. Over a period of years, a person’s immune system is impaired, weight loss and weakness set in, and other afﬂ  ic-
tions, such as cancer or pneumonia, may hasten an infected person’s demise.
Over the past two decades, the AIDS pandemic has 
reached virtually all parts of the world, but its full dimen-sions are unknown. People infected by HIV do not imme-diately display visible symptoms of the disease; they can carry the virus for years without being aware of it, and during that period they can unwittingly transmit it to oth-ers. In its earliest stages a blood test is needed to conﬁ  rm 
HIV’s presence, but millions go untested. Add to this the social stigma many people attach to this malady, and it is evident that ofﬁ  cial statistics on AIDS lag behind the real numbers.
That is true not only in Africa but in other parts of 
the world as well; both India and China, for example, long denied that AIDS presents a serious health threat to their populations. Now China is reporting at least 650,000 infected, and the number in India may well exceed 5 million. Estimates of the number of cases in the United States surpass 1 million; in Middle and South pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, and heart diseases (in that order) were the chief killers. T oday, heart disease and cancer head the list, with stroke (cerebral hemorrhage) next and accidents also high on the list (T able 2.1). In the early 1900s, tuberculosis and pneumonia caused 20 per-cent of all deaths; today, they cause fewer than 5 percent. The diarrheal diseases, which were so high on the old list, are now primarily children’s maladies. T oday, the diar-rheal diseases are not even on the list of the 10 leading 
causes of death.
At the global scale, diseases of infancy have been 
largely defeated, and such infectious diseases as tuberculosis and pneumonia are less serious threats than they were. The battles against cancer and heart disease, however, are far from won. Recent decades have brought new lifestyles, new pressures, new consumption patterns, and exposure to new chemicals, and we do not know how these affect our health. In order to distribute adequate food supplies to populations in huge urban areas, we add various kinds of preservatives to foods without knowing exactly how they will affect our health in the long run. We substitute artiﬁ  cial ﬂ  avoring for 
sugar and other calorie-rich substances, but some of those substitutes have been proven to be dangerous. Despite all the sugar substitutes, obesity plagues a signiﬁ  cant percent-
age of the U.S. population, bringing with it heart disease and diabetes. Even the treatment of drinking water with chemicals is rather recent in the scheme of global popula-tion change, and we do not know its long-term effects. Future chronic diseases may come from practices we take for granted as normal now.
Genetic diseases are of particular interest to medical 
geographers because they are disorders that tend to be transferred from one generation to the next and display clustering that raises questions about environment and long-term adaptation. Prominent among these are meta-bolic diseases—the body’s inability to process all elements of the diet—in which enzymes play a key role. If the body fails to produce enough (or any) of a particular enzyme, TABLE 2.1

 How Does the Geography of Health Inﬂ  uence Population Dynamics? 71
America, nearly 2 million are infected. Southeast Asia 
now has as many as 6 million cases.
Nowhere is AIDS having the impact that it has had 
on Subsaharan Africa, however. In 2006, some 24 percent of people aged 15 to 49 were infected in Botswana, 20 per-cent in Zimbabwe, almost 19 percent in South Africa, and 17 percent in Zambia. These are the ofﬁ  cial data; medical geographers estimate that 20 to 25 percent of the entire population of several tropical African countries is infected. The United Nations AIDS program reports that more than 1.6 million people died of AIDS in Subsaharan Africa in 2007 alone. Geographer Peter Gould, in his book The 
Slow Plague (1993), called Africa a “continent in catastro-phe,” and the demographic statistics support his view-point. Life expectancy in Botswana and Swaziland has declined to 34 (and is projected to fall farther), and in Zimbabwe it is 36. In a continent already ravaged by other diseases, AIDS is the leading cause of death.
AIDS is reshaping the population structure of the 
countries hardest hit by the disease. Demographers look at the projected population pyramids for countries with high rates of infection and no longer see population pyramids—they see population chimneys. The shape of the projected population pyramid is altered to look more like a chimney than a pyramid, reﬂ  ecting the 
major impact AIDS plays on the younger population in the country and its future generations (Fig. 2.22). The United States Census Bureau projects that AIDS will cause higher rates of death among young women than young men. In countries with population chimneys, men will take younger and younger brides, thus increas-ing the rate of AIDS in younger females.
Geographers are engaging in ﬁ  eldwork to under-
stand the human toll of AIDS locally and within families. Geographer Elsbeth Robson studied the impact of AIDS in hard-hit Zimbabwe. She found that global processes such as the diffusion of AIDS and reductions in spending on health care (often mandated by structural adjustment programs) “shape young people’s home lives and structure their wider experiences.” In Subsaharan Africa, the num-ber of children orphaned when parents die from AIDS is growing rapidly (Fig. 2.23). In 2004, UNICEF reported that in just two years, between 2001 and 2003, the number of global AIDS orphans (children who have lost a parent to AIDS) rose from 11.5 million to 15 million. Robson found that in addition to the rising number of AIDS orphans, many young children, especially girls, are taken out of school to serve as caregivers for their relatives with AIDS (Figure 2.24). Robson found in her interviews with young caregivers that “more children are becoming young carers as households struggle to cope with income and labor losses through illness and mortality.”
There are few positives to report. The number of 
AIDS-related deaths is declining globally from a peak of 2.1 million in 2004 to 1.8 million in 2009. The greatest decline in AIDS-related deaths was in South Africa between 2004 and 2009, when AIDS-related deaths in Subsahran Africa diminished by 20 percent. The declin-ing death rate from AIDS is due to increased access to anti-retro viral drugs (ARVs) that slow the progression of the disease), better health-care access for people living with HIV , and a decline in the number of new infections since the late 1990s.
Uganda, once Africa’s worst afﬂ  icted country, has 
slowed the growth of AIDS through an intensive, govern-ment-sponsored campaign of propaganda and action—notably the distribution of condoms in even the remotest part of the country. Access to ARVs in Africa has increased markedly over the last decade. As a result of pressure from HIV/AIDS activists and governments, pharmaceutical companies have decreased prices of ARVs. T oday, over 5 million people in developing countries are being treated with ARVs. Nonetheless, the impact of AIDS will be felt in African economies and in African demographics for gener-ations to come. HIV/AIDS will constrain African economic development (see Chapter 10) and require world interven-tion to overcome.

HOW DO GOVERNMENTS AFFECT 
POPULATION CHANGE?
Over the past century, many of the world’s govern-
ments have instituted policies designed to inﬂ  uence the 
overall growth rate or ethnic ratios within the popula-
tion. Certain policies directly affect the birth rate via laws ranging from subsidized abortions to forced sterilization. Others inﬂ  uence family size through taxation or subven-
tion. These policies fall into three groups: expansive, eugenic, and restrictive.
The former Soviet Union and China under Mao 
Zedong led other communist societies in expansive

Shift scales in your mind, and take one state and choose one state to consider: how do you think IMR varies within this state? What other factors are involved at this scale and this level of general-ization to explain the pattern of IMRs?

“The day was so beautiful and the children’s faces so expres-sive I could hardly believe I was visiting an AIDS hospice village set up for children. The Sparrow Rainbow Village on the edges of Johannesburg, South Africa, is the product of an internationally funded effort to provide children with HIV / AIDS the opportunity to live in a clean, safe environ-ment. Playing with the children brought home the fragility of human life and the extraordinary impacts of a modern plague that has spread relentlessly across signiﬁ  cant parts 
of Subsaharan Africa.”

agreed to take part in my ﬁ  eldwork some years after I had started researching young carers in Subsaharan Africa. Since those early interviews in Zimbabwe I have been acutely aware of young carers’ invisibility—you can’t tell who is a young carer just by looking at them. Indeed, invisibility is a characteristic of many aspects of the social impacts of HIV / AIDS. This young person drew himself working in the ﬁ  elds and taking care of cattle. African young people help with farming and herding for many reasons, but for young caregivers, assisting their sick family members in this way is especially important.

73population policies, which encourage large families and raise the rate of natural increase. Ideological, anticapital-ist motives drove those policies, since abandoned in China. T oday, some countries are again pursuing expansive pop-ulation policies—because their populations are aging and declining. The aging population in Europe has encour-aged some countries to embark on policies to encourage (through tax incentives and other ﬁ  scal means) families to 
have more children.
Birth rates in Russia plummeted after the 1991 col-
lapse of the Soviet Union. The TFR in Russia in 1980 was 2.04, and now it is only 1.34. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin calls the demographic crisis Russia’s great-est current problem. The Russian government offers cash subsidies of $10,000 to women who give birth to a second or third child.
In response to concerns over Russia’s aging popula-
tion, the government of Ulyanovsk Province has held a National Day of Conception each September 12 since 2005. In 2007, government and businesses in Ulyanovsk Province offered the afternoon off for people to participate in the National Day of Conception. The government planned to award a free car to the proud parents of one of the children born 9 months later, on June 12—the Russian National Day. On June 12, 2008 in the Ulyanovsk Prov-ince, 87 children were born, about 4 times the average daily birth rate in the province. Russia experienced an increase in TFR in the ﬁ  rst half of 2008, but the ability to sustain a high TFR in the country will depend on many factors, including alleviating social problems, stabilizing incomes, and con-tinued government support.
In the past, some governments engaged in eugenic 
population policies, which were designed to favor one racial or cultural sector of the population over others. Nazi Germany was a drastic example of eugenics, but other countries also have pursued eugenic strategies, though in more subtle ways. Until the time of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, some observers accused the United States of pursuing social policies tinged with eugenics that worked against the interests of African Americans. Some argue that Japan’s nearly homogeneous culture is the result of deliberately eugenic social policies. Eugenic population policies can be practiced covertly through discriminatory taxation, biased allocation of resources, and other forms of racial favoritism.
T oday many of the world’s governments seek to 
reduce the rate of natural increase through various forms of restrictive population policies. These policies 
range from toleration of ofﬁ  cially unapproved means of 
birth control to outright prohibition of large families. c02Population.indd Page 73  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 73  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

today, China’s growth rate is 0.5 percent. The main goal 
of the one-child policy was achieved, but the policy also had several unintended consequences, including an increased abortion rate, an increase in female infanticide, and a high rate of orphaned girls (many of whom were adopted in the United States and Canada).
During the 1990s, under pressure to improve its 
human rights records and also with the realization that the population was quickly becoming gender (Fig. 2.26) and age imbalanced (Fig. 2.27), China relaxed its one-child policy. Several caveats allow families to have more China’s one-child policy, instituted after the end of the 
Maoist period in the 1970s, drastically reduced China’s growth rate from one of the world’s fastest to one of the world’s slowest (Fig. 2.25). Under the one-child policy, families that had more than one child were penalized ﬁ nancially, and educational opportunities and housing 
privileges were kept from families who broke the one-child mandate.
Population growth rates in China fell quickly under 
the one-child policy. In the 1970s, China’s growth rate was 3 percent; in the mid-1980s it was 1.2 percent; and,  Figure 2.25

than one child. For example, if you live in a rural area 
and your ﬁ  rst child is a girl, you can have a second child, and if both parents of the child are only children, they can have a second child. With these changes, the National Bureau of Statistics of China now estimates that the population growth rate in China will climb again over the next 10 years.
Limitations
Population policies are not independent of circumstances that can inﬂ  uence growth and decline. In the 1980s, the government of Sweden adopted family-friendly policies designed to promote gender equality and boost fertility rates. The programs focused on alleviating much of the cost of having and raising children. In Sweden, couples who work and have small children receive cash payments, tax incentives, job leaves, and work ﬂ  exibility that last up to eight years after the birth of a child. The policies led to a mini-birth-rate-boom by the early 1990s.
When the Swedish economy slowed shortly thereaf-
ter, however, so did the birth rate. The children born in 1991 made up a class of 130,000 students in the Swedish education system. But the children born three years later, in 1994, made up a class of only 75,000 students. The govern-ment had to build new classrooms for the temporary popu-lation boom, but then faced excess capacity when the boom subsided. Sweden’s population policies have helped to pro-duce a natural rate of increase that is a little higher than that in many other European countries, but these policies can achieve only so much. With a TFR still well below 2, the Swedish government continues to think about new ways to support families and promote birth rates. One imaginative, but not evidently successful, approach was suggested by a spokeswoman for the Christian Democrat Party, who urged Swedish television to show racier programming at night in hopes of returning the population to a higher birth rate!c02Population.indd Page 75  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 75  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
76 Chapter 2   Population
the government began a nationwide family planning 
program in 1970. When fundamentalist Muslim lead-ers objected, the government used a combination of coercion and inducement to negate their inﬂ  uence. By 
2000, Indonesia’s family planning program had lowered the growth rate to 1.6 percent, and today it stands at 1.4 percent.
When studying government policies on population, one of the most important things to remember is unintended conse-quences. Choose one country in the world where women have little access to education and are disempowered. Consider the previous section of this chapter on age composition, and determine how restrictive population policies in this country would alter the population composition of the country.Contradictions
Some areas of the world with low population growth rates (Fig. 2.9) are in the very heart of the Roman Cath-olic world. Roman Catholic doctrine opposes birth control and abortion. Adherence to this doctrine appears to be stronger in areas remote from the Vatican (headquarters of the Catholic Church). For example, the Philippines, thousands of miles from the Vatican, is Asia’s only Roman Catholic country. The Church and the Philippine State agree on abortion, as the Philip-pine constitution prohibits abortion. However, on the issue of artiﬁ  cial contraceptives, which the still power-ful Church opposes, the Philippine government dis-agrees with the Catholic Church. Instead, the Philippine government supports birth control in order to stem population growth.
Among Islamic countries, the geographic pattern 
is the opposite. Saudi Arabia, home to Mecca—the hearth of Islam—has one of the world’s fastest popula-tion growth rates (2.7 percent). But in Indonesia, thou-sands of miles from Mecca and near the Philippines, 
Summary
In the late 1700s, Thomas Malthus sounded warning bells about the rapidly growing population in Great Britain. He feared a massive famine would soon “check” the grow-ing population, bringing widespread suffering. Although the famine in Great Britain did not take place as he predicted, the rapidly growing worldwide population made many more follow Malthus’s trajectory, issuing similar warnings about the population explosion over the last two centuries.
The growth rate of the world population has certainly slowed, but human suffer-
ing is not over yet. Dozens of countries still face high death rates and high birth rates. Even in countries where the death rate is low, slowed population growth is often a result of horrid sanitary and medical conditions that lead to high infant and child mortality, diseases such as AIDS that ravage the population and orphan the young, or famines that governments deny and that global organizations cannot ameliorate.
Population pyramids illustrate that as wealthier countries worry about support-
ing their aging populations, poorer countries have problems of their own. A high birth rate in a poor country does not necessarily mean overpopulation—some of the highest population densities in the world are found in wealthy countries. Even poor countries that have lowered their birth rates and their death rates are constantly negotiating what is morally acceptable to their people and their cultures.
Geography offers much to the study of population. Through geography we can 
see differences in population problems across space, how what happens at one scale affects what goes on at other scales, and how different cultures and countries approach population questions.c02Population.indd Page 76  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 76  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

78In 1994, I was on my way to 
Rosenstiel Marine Center on Virginia Key, off the coast of Miami, Florida. I noticed an overcrowded boat, with about 70 people on board. The Haitians were ﬂ  eeing 
the most impoverished country in the Western Hemisphere. Most of the would-be illegal immigrants were men with perhaps half a dozen women and as many chil-dren. They jumped overboard prematurely when the Coast Guard approached, and some undoubtedly lost their lives; others made it to the beach and ran forthe road.
The Haitians the Coast Guard caught were sent 
home to Haiti with other illegal Haitian immigrants. The chance of getting caught is high, the travel is treacherous, and hundreds die off the coast of Florida each year. The hope of a job in the United States and the lack of hope in their lives and homes in Haiti compel them to try. The immigrants know that if they make it to shore and can ﬁ  nd their way to the homes of friends and family, they have a chance to ﬁ nd employment and live under the radar of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service (Fig. 3.1).Migration3CHAPTER

 Risking Lives for Remittances  79
Across the world, hundreds of thousands of migrants have ﬂ  ed their home-
lands by boat, train, car, or foot for opportunities in North America, Australia, 
China, and Europe. Immigrants are sometimes welcomed and sometimes turned away. In the 1970s, the United States government welcomed Haitian immigrants because most were educated and able to afford travel to the United States. In 1980, 25,000 Haitian and 125,000 Cuban immigrants reached south Florida by boat. The U.S. government considered this massive ﬂ  ow of migrants a humanitarian cri-sis because of the repressiveness of the governments in Haiti and Cuba at the time. President Carter admitted the Haitians and Cubans into the United States using the discretionary parole authority of the attorney general. Later, Congress passed legislation that allowed the 150,000 asylum-seekers who arrived from Haiti and Cuba to gain legal permanent residence and later apply for citizenship.
In 1981, President Reagan established an interdiction program through an 
agreement with the Haitian government. Since 1981, the United States Coast Guard is authorized to board any Haitian vessel, even those on the high seas out-side of the territorial sea of the United States. Once on board, the Coast Guard can interrogate passengers to see if they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Haiti. If so, the United States sends the immigrant to a third country in Latin America to seek asylum; if not, the United States returns the migrant to Haiti by Coast Guard vessel.
Governments greatly impact migration ﬂ  ows by opening and closing doors to 
migrants. In some cases, the policy is not as simple as the door being open or shut. In addition, governments can choose to treat two groups with similar claims dif-ferently. The United States returns the vast majority of interdicted Haitians. In 2005, it interdicted 1850 Haitians and considered refugee status for 9 of them through “credible fear hearings” at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. The United States granted refugee status to only 1 of the 9. Only 54 miles separate Haiti from Cuba, but since the Clinton administration the U.S. government has had a “wet foot, dry foot” policy toward Cuban immigrants that does not apply to Haitians. If Cuban immigrants are intercepted at sea, they are deported (wet foot), but if Cuban immigrants make it to land (dry foot), they have the right to stay.
Why are immigrants willing to risk their lives on overcrowded boats or by 
crossing treacherous deserts across parts of the U.S.-Mexican border? Economics provides part of the answer, but it does not explain the whole story. The Pew Hispanic Center found in a 2005 survey that the vast majority of undocumented (illegal) migrants from Mexico “were gainfully employed” in Mexico before they left for the United States. Perception is an overwhelming factor in migration: as long as migrants perceive a better life abroad, they will continue to migrate.
Migration ﬂ  ows vary by region, hometown (rural versus urban), gender, socio-
economic class, age, race, and ethnicity. Geographers who study gender and migration realize that the dynamics of individual households in the sending coun-tries determine who migrates, when they migrate, and where they go.
In 2007, the number of undocumented migrants in the United States peaked at 
12 million. In 2010, the number fell to 11.2 million as a result of the economic reces-sion in the United States. The goal of most undocumented migrants is to work in the United States and send money home to family. Monies migrants send home to family are called remittances. Haitians living in the United States, Canada, and the 
Caribbean sent home over $1 billion in remittances in 2007, a ﬁ  gure equivalent to 30 percent of Haiti’s gross domestic product and far outpacing the value of Haitian exports. A 2006 census in Haiti estimated that half the country’s population is younger than 20 and less than half of the children of school age attend elementary c03Migration.indd Page 79  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 79  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

school. In addition, among the working-age population, the unemployment rate in 
2006 was 33 percent according to the Haitian census. One of ﬁ  ve Haitian house-holds receives remittances from abroad.
The economies of many poorer countries in the Caribbean, Africa, Central 
and South America, and Eurasia depend in part on remittances sent to their citi-zens. In 2007, Mexican immigrants sent $23.98 billion in remittances home, up from $23.05 billion in 2006. Remittances to Mexico make up 19 percent of household incomes in urban areas and 27 percent of household incomes in rural areas of Mexico. Since 2007, the downturn in the American economy has gener-ated a new ﬂ  ow of money called reverse remittances: from Mexico to the United States. Unemployed, undocumented migrants in the United States asked families in Mexico for ﬁ  nancial support. Despite the economic downturn in the United States and reverse remittances, the Pew Center for Hispanic Research has not noted a return ﬂ  ow of migrants from the United States to Mexico. The likely reason is the high cost associated with migrating illegally from Mexico to the United States.
Not all immigrants are undocumented or illegal. Of the estimated 31.2 mil-
lion immigrants in the United States today, 20.4 million are legal immigrants (Fig. 3.2). C ountries recognize the need for immigrant labor, and many have policies 
allowing, indeed encouraging, legal immigrants to work under temporary visas to ﬁ ll a need. Thousands of people who work in the United States and Canada are

there on temporary visas to ﬁ  ll seasonal jobs in agriculture and forestry. In the 
United States, over 45,000 agricultural laborers legally enter the country each year under a program that allows unskilled laborers into the country, as long as no Americans want the jobs. Canada began to allow agricultural laborers into the country in 1966. In both Canada and the United States, the vast majority of legal agricultural laborers come from Mexico. Canadian companies travel to Mexico to recruit agricultural laborers from rural Mexico and laborers for the hotel industry from urban areas of Mexico.
Since September 11, 2001, many countries have cracked down on immigra-
tion, making legal and illegal immigration more difﬁ  cult. The United States has 
earmarked more money for building fences along its border with Mexico, hiring additional border patrols, and installing new technology to intercept would-be terrorists. The cultural landscape of the border region is changing. The govern-ment is erecting specially designed fences that are difﬁ  cult to climb, while at the 
same time ensuring the fences have spaces where people across the border can speak with each other. The new fences and security south of San Diego, California, are pushing illegal immigration farther east into the desert. The fences in the des-ert are marked by empty water bottles and memorials to Mexicans who have died trying to cross the border (Fig. 3.3).

world, and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) established freer trade among Mexico, the United States, and Canada, the free ﬂ  ow of people

is far from realized. In 1997, the U.S. government commissioned a barrier divid-
ing Nogales, Arizona, from Nogales, Mexico. The New Y ork Times reported that 
the architecture ﬁ  rm that designed the wall followed government require-
ments that it be aesthetically pleasing to “evoke the friendship” between the two countries while also making it “resistant to physical assault by means such as welding torches, chisels, hammers, ﬁ  rearms, climbing over or penetration with vehicles.” Illegal immigrants go to great lengths to ﬁ  nd their way into the 
United States; and similarly, the U.S. government goes to great lengths to deter illegal immigration.
In this chapter, we examine various types of migration and question why 
migrants choose to leave a particular place and why they go to another. We also examine the barriers governments erect to slow human migration, questioning why government policies shift and how policies affect migration ﬂ  ows. By employ-ing geographic concepts such as scale in our analysis of human migration, we seek to shed light on the nature and meaning of migration ﬂ  ows and to gain an appre-ciation for why people migrate, where they migrate, and how people, places, and landscapes change as a result of movement.
Key Questions  For Chapter 3
 1. What is migration?
 2. Why do people migrate?
 3. Where do people migrate?
 4. How do governments affect migration?
WHAT IS MIGRATION?
Movement is inherently geographical. Movement 
changes people, as well as the way they see themselves 
in the world. Movement changes places, including the places the people left and the places where they go. Human movement speeds the diffusion of ideas and innovations; it intensiﬁ  es spatial interaction and trans-forms regions; and it is often closely linked to environ-mental conditions.
The movement of humans takes several forms. 
Mobility ranges from local to global—from the daily to once in a lifetime. Mobility has increased markedly over the last century. With greater mobility, people broaden their perspectives and widen the horizons of others, thus encouraging further mobility. All movement involves leaving home. The three types of movement we discuss in this section vary based on time away from home. Cyclic 
movement involves shorter periods away from home; periodic movement involves longer periods away from home; and migration involves a degree of permanence the other two do not: with migration, the mover may never return “home.”Cyclic Movement
Cyclic movement involves journeys that begin at our home base and bring us back to it. The great majority of people have a daily routine that takes them through a reg-ular sequence of short moves within a local area. These moves create what geographers call activity spaces. The scale of activity space varies across societies. Y ou may go to classes every weekday and perhaps to a job as well, cre-ating a relatively conﬁ  ned and stable activity space, diver-siﬁ ed by shopping trips and social activities.
Commuting is also a cyclic movement. Commuting— 
the journey from home to work and home again—takes from minutes to hours and can involve several modes of transportation. The average North American com-muter travels a greater distance each day than the average Chinese villager does in a year. Advances in transporta-tion technology have expanded daily activity spaces. Cars and vast infrastructure enable people to commute over long distances. In Washington, D.C., commuters com-bine use of their cars, commuter trains, and the metro to travel upwards of 100 miles each way, each day, commut-ing not only from the surrounding suburbs, but also from c03Migration.indd Page 82  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 82  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Delaware, West Virginia, and central Virginia. By airplane, 
commuters arrive at work in Washington, D.C. from New Y ork City. Others, such as members of Congress, com-mute from their home state, keeping houses there and apartments in the Washington, D.C. area.
Another form of cyclic movement is seasonal move-
ment. Every autumn, hundreds of thousands of travelers leave their homes in Canada and the northern parts of the United States and seek the winter sun in Florida and other “Sunbelt” States, returning in the spring. This seasonal transfer has huge economic consequences (and electoral signiﬁ  cance) in depopulated Northern towns and bur-
geoning tourist centers in the South.
This kind of seasonal movement is a luxury. Another 
type of cyclic movement, nomadism, is a matter of survival, culture, and tradition. Nomadism is dwindling across the world, but it can still be found in parts of Asia and Africa. Westerners often envision nomadism as an aimless wan-dering across steppe and desert by small groups of rootless roamers, people who claim no territory and do not behave territorially. In reality, nomads need to know their territory well in order to ﬁ  nd water, food, and shelter in their cyclic movements. Nomadic movement is purposeful and takes place along long-familiar routes repeated time and again. The nomads move their animals to visit water sources and pastures that have served their ancestors for centuries. Weather conditions may affect the timing of their route, but barring obstacles such as fenced international borders or the privatization of long-used open country, nomads engage in cyclic movement.
Periodic Movement
Periodic movement, like cyclic movement, involves return-ing home. Periodic movement involves a longer period of time away from the home base than cyclic movement. One common type of periodic movement is migrant labor, which involves millions of workers in the United States and tens of millions worldwide. The need for migrant labor in the farm ﬁ  elds of California, Florida, and other parts of the United States creates a large ﬂ  ow of cross-border movers, many of whom eventually become immigrants.
A specialized form of periodic movement is trans-
humance, which is a system of pastoral farming where ranchers move livestock according to the seasonal avail-ability of pastures. This is a periodic form of movement because, unlike classic nomadism, it involves a long period of residential relocation. In Switzerland, for example, farmers drive cattle up mountain slopes to high, fresh pastures during the summer, and farm families follow the herds, taking up residence in cottages that are abandoned during the cold winter. In the “Horn” of Northeast Africa, hundreds of thousands of people follow their livestock from highland to lowland and back in search of pastures renewed by seasonal rainfall.Periodic movement takes on other forms as well. If 
you leave home to attend a college far away, you are liv-ing away from home for four (or more) years. Although you may retain a home address in your place of origin, you now spend the great majority of your time in your new abode (traveling home only for breaks), and your mobility cannot be categorized as cyclic.
Military service is another form of periodic move-
ment. In a given year, as many as 10 million U.S. citizens, including military personnel and their families, are moved to new locations where they will spend tours of duty that can last several years.
Migration
When movement results in permanent relocation across signiﬁ  cant distances, it is classiﬁ  ed as migration. The pro-
cess of migration involves the long-term relocation of an individual, a household, or larger group to a new locale outside the community of origin.
International migration, movement across coun-
try borders, is also called transnational migration. When a migrant leaves the home country, he or she is classiﬁ  ed as an emigrant (one who migrates out) of the home country. When the same migrant enters a new country, he or she is classiﬁ  ed 
as an immigrant (one who migrates in) of the new country. Emigration subtracts from the total population of a country, and immigration adds to the total population of a country.
Countries also experience internal migration—
migration that occurs within a single country’s borders. Mapping internal migration routes reveals patterns of well-deﬁ  ned streams of migrants that change over time. 
Early in the twentieth century, a major migration stream took tens of thousands of African American families from the South of the United States to the industrializing cit-ies of the Northeast and Midwest (Fig. 3.4). The advent and diffusion of mechanical cotton pickers resulted in fewer employment opportunities in the South. Southern states, where slavery was legal before the Civil War, enacted Jim Crow laws separating blacks and whites in schools, hospi-tals, public spaces, public transportation, and even cem-eteries. It is estimated that 5 million to 8 million African Americans migrated from the South to industrialized Northern cities between 1900 and 1970. Newly emanci-pated African Americans ﬂ  ed the segregated South and 
headed north to the growing industrial cities of Chicago, Detroit, and Baltimore.
Internal migration varies according to the mobility 
of the population. In mobile societies, internal migra-tion over long distances is common. In the United States, the ﬂ  ow of internal migration is not as simple as rural to urban. Rather, in the past few decades, inter-nal migrants have ﬂ  ocked to the economically dynamic regions of the Sunbelt and Far West (Fig. 3.5).

 Why Do People Migrate? 85
migrants have escaped from large cities and rural areas 
to move to medium-sized cities for retirement or fam-ily-friendly lifestyles; and wealthy individuals who seek solace and space have moved into environmentally attractive rural areas, trying to keep the area “rural,” while pushing out farmers.
Mobility within the U.S. depends on the country’s 
economy. After decades of increasing levels of mobil-ity, the U.S. population had the “least mobile period in postwar American society” following the downturn in the economy between 2007 and 2008. The mortgage cri-sis and higher unemployment rates led to a pronounced reduction in the long-distance moves, according to a study by the Brookings Institute. Would-be movers “were unable to ﬁ  nd ﬁ  nancing to buy a new home, buy-
ers for their existing homes, or a new job in more desir-able areas.”
International migrants also migrate internally 
within their destination country. Since the 1940s, mil-lions of migrants from Latin America have migrated to the American Southwest and Florida. Most migrants have stayed in these same basic regions, perhaps migrating part of the year to work in agricultural ﬁ  elds. 
In 1986, the U.S. government passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), legislation that gave amnesty and permanent residence to 2.6 million migrants who had been living in the United States for a long period of time. The newly legal migrants under IRCA could move anywhere, and during the 1990s, many moved to the Great Plains and Midwest and also to the South (Fig. 3.5). Migrants found the South attractive for the same reasons other Americans did. The warm climate and available jobs in the Sunbelt attracted migrants during the 1990s.
In Peru, which is a less mobile society than the 
U.S. society, the pattern of internal migration is gener-ally from rural to urban. Migrants have left rural areas and moved to Lima, the capital. Global and national investment capital is concentrated in Lima. The capi-tal represents the major focus of economic opportunity for the rural population. Lima receives the vast major-ity of Peru’s migrants, regardless of age, gender, or marital status.
Choose one type of cyclic or periodic movement and then think of a speciﬁ  c example of the kind of movement you 
chose. Now, determine how this movement changes both the home and the destination as a result of this cyclic or period movement.WHY DO PEOPLE MIGRATE?
Migration can be the result of a voluntary action, 
a conscious decision to move from one place to the next. It can also be the result of an involuntary action, a forced movement chosen by one group of people for another group of people. Forced migration involves the imposition of authority or power, producing invol-untary migration movements that cannot be understood based on theories of choice. Voluntary migration  
occurs after a migrant weighs options and choices, even if desperately or not so rationally, and can be analyzed and understood as a series of options or choices that result in movement.
The distinction between forced and volun-
tary migration is not always clear-cut. The enormous European migration to the United States during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is often cited as a prime example of voluntary migration. However, some European migration can be construed as forced. The British treatment of the Irish during their colonial rule over Ireland can be seen as political persecution, which is a cause for forced migration. During British colonial-ism in Ireland, the British took control of nearly all of the Irish Catholic lands and discouraged the operation of the Catholic Church in Ireland. Until 1829, the British enforced penal laws preventing Irish Catholics from buying land, voting, or carrying weapons. The mass exo-dus of migrants from Ireland to North America in the mid-1800s can be seen as forced, both because of the British treatment of the Irish and because of the potato famine, but it can also be seen as voluntary in that the Irish chose to go to North America.
At the scale of an individual region or country, we 
can question whether a decision to migrate is forced or voluntary. At the scale of the household, the decision to migrate is all the more complex. For certain members of a migrating household, the move may be under duress, and for others, the move may be a preferred choice. The neutral title “migrant” veils the complexities of decision making at the household scale. Geographic studies of gender in migration demonstrate that at the household scale, power relationships, divisions of labor, and gender identities all factor into migration flows. At the household scale, decisions are made, in geographer Victoria Lawson’s terms, in a “cooperative conflict bargaining process.” Who has a say in this pro-cess and how much of a say each individual has depend on gendered power relationships and responsibilities in the household.
Studies of gender and migration ﬁ  nd that, in 
many regions, men are more mobile than women and men migrate farther than women. Generally, men have more choices of employment than women, and women c03Migration.indd Page 85  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 85  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
86 Chapter 3   Migration
earn less than men in the jobs they ﬁ  nd at the destina-
tion. One study of migration in Mexican households found that strongly patriarchal households shield young women from migration, sending young men out to work. Mexican households without a strong patriarchy send young, unmarried women to the city or another country to gain employment.
Thus, geographers cannot easily describe migration 
ﬂ ows in terms of men and women or forced and voluntary. 
Ultimately, the decision or directive to migrate happens to an individual migrant within a household, place, country, region, and world, each of which has its own dynamics. The key difference between voluntary and forced migra-tion, however, is that voluntary migrants have an option—at the very least, where to go or what to do once there; forced migrants do not.
Forced Migration
The largest and most devastating forced migration in the history of humanity was the Atlantic slave trade, which carried tens of millions of Africans from their homes to South America, the Caribbean, and North America, with huge loss of life. The number of Africans sold into slavery will never be known, but estimates range from 12 million to 30 million. Figure 3.6 shows an approximation of the numbers involved, as well as the destinations of the trans-Atlantic African deportees.
Because slavery plays a major role in U.S. history, 
many students in the United States assume the vast major-ity of African slaves were forced across the Atlantic and into the southeastern United States. However, as the map shows, a considerable majority of Africans were forced across the Atlantic to the Caribbean region, to coastal Central America, and to Brazil.
The Atlantic slave trade began early in the sixteenth 
century, when Spain and Portugal brought Africans to the Caribbean. In the early decades of the seventeenth century, African slaves arrived in small numbers on plantations in coastal eastern North America. Wealth promised through plantation agriculture from the southeastern United States to Brazil created a demand for slaves by plantation owners, who paid European shippers for slaves, who in turn paid African raiders for slaves.

 Why Do People Migrate? 87
Of all crops produced on plantations in the Americas 
and Caribbean during the 1700s, sugar was the most 
important economically. Figure 3.6 reﬂ  ects the scram-
ble for sugar islands in the Caribbean, as the map names Spanish, British, Danish, French, and Dutch colonies in the Caribbean as destinations for slaves. Add the coffee, fruit, and sugar plantations in Brazil and the cotton plan-tations of the southeastern United States, and the destina-tions of slaves on the map make sense.
The terror and destruction of slave raiding afﬂ  icted 
large areas of Africa. Europeans and African raiders exploited much of West Africa from Liberia to Nigeria and inland to the margins of the Sahara. So many Africans were taken from the area that is now Benin in West Africa to Bahia in Brazil that signiﬁ  cant elements of the local cul-ture remained intact in the transition. T oday Bahia and Benin have strong ties, and cultural exchanges are growing stronger. The entire Equatorial African coastal region fell victim to the slave trade as well, when Portuguese slave trad-ers raided freely in the Portuguese domains of Angola and Mozambique. Arab slave raiders were active in East Africa and the Horn of Africa (present-day Somalia), penetrating Equatorial Africa and often cooperating with Europeans. Zanzibar, off the coast of mainland T anzania, long was a major slave market.
We know proportionately where slaves ended up, 
but we can never gauge the full impact of this horriﬁ  c 
period. In A Colonizer’s Model of the World, geographer James Blaut discussed the sheer loss to African civiliza-tions that occurred when Europeans and African raiders enslaved signiﬁ  cant populations. The Atlantic slave trade 
also changed the Caribbean, where on many islands the vast majority of people are of African-Caribbean descent, and few, if any, indigenous peoples remain. In combina-tion, the slave trade inﬂ  icted incalculable damage on 
African societies and communities, and changed the cul-tural and ethnic geography of Brazil, Central America, and the United States.
Although no forced migration in human history 
compares in magnitude to the Atlantic slave trade, other forced migrations have changed the world’s demographic map. For 50 years beginning in 1788, Great Britain shipped tens of thousands of convicts from Britain to Australia, where they had a lasting impact on the conti-nent’s population geography. In the 1800s, the U.S. gov-ernment took lands from thousands of Native Americans and forcibly moved tribes to other areas of the country, many far from their traditional homelands. In the Soviet Union during Stalin’s ruthless rule between the late 1920s and 1953, the government forcibly moved millions of non-Russians from their homes to remote parts of Central Asia and Siberia for political reasons. During the 1930s in Germany, the Nazis were responsible for a signiﬁ  cant 
forced migration of Jews from portions of western Europe that fell under their control.
Forced migration still happens today. It continues to 
occur, for example, in the form of countermigration, in which governments detain migrants who enter or attempt to enter their countries illegally and return the migrants to their home countries (Fig. 3.7). In 1957, Papa Doc

Duvalier controlled Haiti, pilfering wealth for his family 
and ruling with a private militia. Papa Doc died in 1971, and his son Jean-Claude Duvalier, called Baby Doc, took control. He continued to rule and steal from Haiti until his exile in 1986. Under these brutal dictators and in the turmoil since, thousands of Haitians have sought refuge in the United States.
Since 1981, the United States has interdicted, 
detained, and returned illegal Haitian migrants. The spike in 1991–1992 of over 37,000 Haitians interdicted followed a 1991 military coup d’etat, which overthrew democrati-cally elected President Aristide with military rule. Haiti remained unstable, and the second spike in the graph in 1994 marks the turmoil leading up to the reinstatement of Aristide as president in 1994, under U.S. pressure. Governance of the country ﬂ  ipped back to military rule in 2004. Before the January 2010 earthquake, Haiti was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Since the death of 250,000 people in the devastating earthquake, the situation in Haiti has only worsened. In response, the Department of Homeland Security granted all Haitian nationals who were in the United States as of January 12, 2010 an 18-month temporary protected status, which allowed them to remain in the United States while Haiti tries to recover from the tragedy of the earthquake and cope with a cholera outbreak.
Across the world from Haiti, for more than 30 years, 
people from Afghanistan have left the country in search of safety ﬁ  rst from civil war, then the T aliban, and cur-rently the instability of the Afghan War. Approximately 10 million Afghans have been refugees since 1979, ﬂ  eeing 
mainly to Pakistan and Iran. Policies toward Afghan refu-gees have shifted over time. The international commu-nity sends substantial aid to Pakistan to help the Pakistani government serve the Afghan refugee population within their borders.
After the T aliban took control of Afghanistan in 
1994, support for Pakistan waned and the Pakistan gov-ernment forced the repatriation of thousands of Afghans. Since September 11, 2001, the international commu-nity, led by the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR), has helped Pakistan and Iran repa-triate nearly 5 million refugees to Afghanistan. Currently, 3 million Afghans are registered refugees in Iran and Pakistan, and approximately 1 million more Afghans in Pakistan are not registered as refugees. The repatriation of Afghans continues and is complicated by the current war and the fact that over half the Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran were born there . . . not in Afghanistan.
Push and Pull Factors in Voluntary Migration
Why do people choose to migrate? Researchers have been intrigued by this question for more than a century. Studies of voluntary migration ﬂ  ows indicate that the intensity 
of a migration ﬂ  ow varies with such factors as similarities between the source and the destination, the effectiveness of the ﬂ  ow of information from the destination back to the source, and the physical distance between the source and the destination.
Over a century ago, British demographer Ernst 
Ravenstein sought an answer to the question of why people voluntarily migrate. He studied internal migra-tion in England, and on the basis of his data he proposed several laws of migration, many of which are still rel-
evant today including:
 1. Every migration ﬂ  ow generates a return or countermi-
gration.
 2. The majority of migrants move a short distance.
 3. Migrants who move longer distances tend to choose 
big-city destinations.
 4. Urban residents are less migratory than inhabitants of 
rural areas.
 5. Families are less likely to make international moves 
than young adults.
Ravenstein also posited an inverse relationship between 
the volume of migration and the distance between source and destination; that is, the number of migrants to a destination declines as the distance they must travel increases. Ravenstein’s idea is an early observation of the gravity model, which predicts interaction between 
places on the basis of their population size and distance between them. The gravity model assumes that spatial interaction (such as migration) is directly related to the populations and inversely related to the distance between them—an assumption that had more meaning in an age before airplane travel and the Internet. In mathematical terms, the equation for the gravity model is the multi-plication of the two populations divided by the distance between them.
Although the gravity model gives us a guide to 
expected migration, migration is not as simple as a math-ematical equation. When an individual, family, or group of people makes a voluntary decision to migrate, push and pull factors come into play. Push factors are the conditions and perceptions that help the migrant decide to leave a place. Pull factors are the circumstances that effectively attract the migrant to certain locales from other places, the decision of where to go. A migrant’s deci-sion to emigrate from the home country and migrate to a new country results from a combination of push and pull factors, and these factors play out differently depending on the circumstance and scale of the migration. Because a migrant is likely to be more familiar with his or her place of residence (source) than with the locale to which he or she is moving (destination), a migrant will likely perceive c03Migration.indd Page 88  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 88  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 Why Do People Migrate? 89
push factors more accurately than pull factors. Push fac-
tors include individual considerations such as work or retirement conditions, cost of living, personal safety and security, and, for many, environmental catastrophes or even issues like weather and climate. Pull factors tend to be vaguer and may depend solely on perceptions con-strued from things heard and read rather than on experi-ences in the destination place. Often, migrants move on the basis of excessively positive images and expectations regarding their destinations.
When considering pull factors, the principle of 
distance decay comes into play (Fig. 3.8). Prospective migrants are likely to have more complete perceptions of nearer places than of farther ones, which conﬁ  rms the 
notion that the intensity of human activity, process, or function declines as distance from its source increases. Since interaction with faraway places generally decreases as distance increases, prospective migrants are likely to feel much less certain about distant destina-tions than about nearer ones. This leads many migrants to move to a locale closer to home than they originally contemplated.
Migration streams may appear on maps as long, 
unbroken routes, but in fact they often consist of a series of stages, a phenomenon known as step migration. A peasant family in rural Brazil, for example, is likely to move ﬁ  rst to a village, then to a nearby town, later to a city, and ﬁ  nally to a metropolis such as São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro. At each stage a new set of pull factors comes into play.Not all migrants from one place follow the same 
steps. When 1000 people leave a village and migrate to a town in a given year, most, if not all, of them may dream of making it to, and in, the “big city.” But only about 500 may actually move from town to city, and of these, only 200 eventually reach the metropolis that impelled them to move in the ﬁ  rst place. Along the way the majority are captured by intervening opportunity. This happened during the Great Migration when African Americans by the tens of thousands migrated northward after World War I to seek work in growing cities like Chicago and Cleveland. Many found employment in St. Louis and Cincinnati; that is, they encountered intervening oppor-tunities along their northbound routes.
Along any route of migration, whether direct, in 
steps, or interrupted by intervening opportunity, a volun-tary migrant weighs push and pull factors.
Types of Push and Pull Factors
What speciﬁ  c factors impel people to pull up stakes and 
leave the familiar for the uncertain? What speciﬁ  c factors 
help migrants choose a destination? Research has shown that typically a combination of factors, not just one, leads to deciding it is time to move and deciding where to go. Any single factor can be either a push for the migrant to leave the home country or a pull to the new country, and which factor matters most depends on the migrant and the circumstances surrounding the decision to migrate.
Legal Status
Migrants can arrive in a country with (legally) or without (illegally) the consent of the host country. Each country around the world determines who is allowed to migrate to their country and under what circumstances. If you apply for and receive a work visa from another country, you are legally allowed to live in the country and work there for the time allotted on the visa, which is usually a period of months or years. Having a visa makes you a legal migrant because you have your documents, your visa, to show your legal right to be in the place. If you do not have a visa, you are an illegal, or undocumented, migrant in the country. Undocumented or illegal migrants choose quite different options for ﬁ  nding their way into the country than legal 
migrants do, simply because they do not want to be caught for fear of deportation, being sent back home.
Economic Conditions
Poverty has driven countless millions from their home-lands and continues to do so. Perceived opportunities in destinations such as western Europe and North America impel numerous migrants, both legal and illegal, to cross the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, and the Rio Grande  Figure 3.8

in search of a better life. Lower economic positions of 
migrants in their host countries can lead to exploitation by employers and others. The United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families recognizes the precari-ous position of migrant workers: they need to work and do not want to be deported. The convention establishes stan-dards of treatment for migrant workers. Fifty-eight states, most of which are countries that send more migrants than they receive, have ratiﬁ  ed or signed the convention. Even though no member of the European Union and only 4 of 19 states in the G-20 states have signed it (the 20 largest economies in the world including the European Union, which primarily receive migrants), the convention’s state-ments on human trafﬁ  cking and the right of migrant 
workers to equal wages are inﬂ  uencing the migration pol-
icies of some states.
Power Relationships
Gender, ethnicity, race, and money are all factors in the decision to migrate. Power relationships already embed-ded in society enable the ﬂ  ow of migrants around the 
world. Employers who hire migrant workers often have perceptions of what kinds of migrants would work best for them.
Women in the Middle East hire Southeast Asian 
women to work as domestic servants, housekeepers, and nannies. Geographer Paul Boyle points out that by hir-ing women from abroad, the female head of household establishes a relationship in which the employee’s “ethnic-ity and citizenship status differentiates them from their female employer and this inﬂ  uences the power relation-
ships that underpin the working arrangements.” In their study of placement agencies that help people hire domes-tic workers, Stiell and England found that in T oronto, Canada, placement agencies portrayed certain ethnicities according to scripted stereotypes. For instance, workers from the Caribbean went from being portrayed as “docile, jolly and good with children” to being depicted as “difﬁ  -
cult, aggressive and selﬁ  sh.” Soon after, employers sought 
to hire women from the Philippines whom, at the time, placement agencies portrayed as “‘naturally’ docile, sub-servient, hard-working, good natured, domesticated, and willing to endure long hours of housework and child-care with little complaint.”
Race is also a factor in the hiring of migrant work-
ers. For example, carpet companies in Dalton, Georgia, the carpet capital of the world, began hiring Mexican workers after the 1986 passage of IRCA because they saw them as hard workers who were loyal to one com-pany. In the same time frame, North and South Carolina also experienced surges in the Mexican migrant popula-tion. Geographer Jamie Winders cites the work of sev-eral researchers in the South whose research “raises 
the issue of displacement of black workers by Mexican migration—a topic hinted at by many studies but addressed by few.” Issues of race and migrant status in hiring can spill over into neighborhoods as they have recently in Raleigh, North Carolina. In the last 10 years conﬂ icts have arisen over affordable housing between 
the African Americans who lived in the neighborhoods and Mexican migrants who moved into the neighbor-hoods for the same affordable housing.
Geographer Paul Boyle also cites power relation-
ships based on money in the growing migration industry, whereby migration ﬂ  ows are contractually arranged in 
order to ﬁ  ll labor needs for particular economic sectors 
throughout the world. Contractors give migrants advances on their income, help them migrate to the new country or region within a country, and then take migrants’ wages in order to pay for advances and other needs the contractor supplies to the migrants.
Political Circumstances
Throughout history oppressive regimes have engendered migration streams. Desperate migrants ﬂ  ed Vietnam by 
the hundreds of thousands after the communists took control of the country in 1975. In 1972 Uganda’s dictator, Idi Amin, expelled 50,000 Asians and Ugandans of Asian descent from his country. The Cuban communist dicta-torship expelled more than 125,000 Cubans in 1980 in the “Mariel Boatlift.” Politically driven migration ﬂ  ows are 
marked by both escape and expulsion.
Armed Conﬂ  ict and Civil War
The dreadful conﬂ  ict that engulfed the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s drove as many as 3 million people from their homes, mostly into western Europe. Many people became permanent emigrants, unable to return home. During the mid-1990s, a civil war engulfed Rwanda in Equatorial Africa, a conﬂ  ict that pitted militant Hutu against the minority T utsi and “moderate” Hutu. The car-nage claimed an estimated 800,000 to 1 million lives and produced huge migration ﬂ  ows into neighboring Zaïre (now Congo) and T anzania. More than 2 million Rwandans ﬂ ed their homeland.
Environmental Conditions
A major example of migration induced by environmental conditions is the movement of hundreds of thousands of Irish citizens from Ireland to the New World during the c03Migration.indd Page 90  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 90  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

1840s. The potato blight destroyed the potato crop, cre-
ating famine. Under colonial control of Great Britain at the time, Irish farmers had no recourse to British political policies that only served to worsen the loss of the potato crop. For example, in 1847, the British enacted the Poor Laws in Ireland, which placed the burden of providing for the Irish poor (who had lost their potato crops) on landlords and small farmers. Starving workers and small farmers could not pay the taxes the landlords demanded, and the Poor Laws only served to exacerbate the famine. Understanding Great Britain’s colonial role in Ireland before, during, and after the potato famine reminds us that environmental conditions rarely operate in a social vacuum. The potato famine and the migration ﬂ  ow of 
Irish to their chief destinations, the United States and Canada, altered the demographics of both Ireland (the source) and the United States and Canada.
Environmental crises including earthquakes, hurri-
canes, and volcanic eruptions also stimulate migrations. For example, a surge of migration follows major earth-quakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters. Because many migrants return, the net outﬂ  ow gener-
ated by such momentary crises is usually small, but not always. Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses, the popu-lation of New Orleans fell by 11 percent as a result of the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the economic recession since. The proportion of children in New Orleans’ population also fell, from 27 percent in 2000 to 23 percent in 2007. Mapping where children live in New Orleans reﬂ  ects another trend in post-Katrina New Orleans: families with children in the New Orleans region are moving out of the city center and close-in sub-urbs and into the farther suburbs and exurbs, including Belle Chasse (Fig. 3.9).
Some environmental crises, such as volcanic erup-
tions, bring long-term environmental changes to the landscape, making return migration difﬁ  cult, if not impos-sible. For example, the Caribbean island of Montserrat had a small population of about 10,000 prior to a volcanic eruption that began in 1995. The volcano has been active since then, prompting a migration ﬂ  ow. Geographer Jason 
Dittmer studied how drastically the physical and cultural landscapes of Montserrat have changed since the onset of volcanic activity. Dittmer explains that roughly half the island has been proclaimed an Exclusion Zone, a region that includes the capital city of Plymouth (Fig. 3.10). People are not allowed in this zone of active volcanic activ-ity. The people who remained must now live in the north-ern part of the island where the soils are thin, the land is rocky, and making a living is difﬁ  cult. Over 7000 people 
migrated off the island, and the remaining 3000 migrated to the northern coast of the island, where the effects of the volcano are less felt.
Culture and Traditions
People who fear that their culture and traditions will not survive a major political transition, and who are able to migrate to places they perceive as safer, will often do so. When the British partitioned South Asia into a mainly Hindu India and an almost exclusively Muslim Pakistan, millions of Muslim residents of India migrated across the border to the new Islamic state, and millions  Why Do People Migrate? 91c03Migration.indd Page 91  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 91  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
Guest Field Note
Plymouth, Montserrat
 Figure 3.10This photo shows the damage caused by the 1995 eruption of the Sourfriere Hills volcano on the 
Caribbean Island of Montserrat. In the foreground you can see the gray volcanic ash clogging the roadbed, and in the background the abandoned capital city of Plymouth. Many buildings cannot even be entered because the ash has buried their ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oors or caved in their ceilings. This scene 
illustrated for me the complexities of migration in the face of natural disasters. Many Montser-ratians ﬂ  ed to the United States when Plymouth was destroyed and were given “temporary pro-
tected” immigration status. The U.S. government told Montserratian refugees to leave in 2005—not because the volcanic crisis was over or because the housing crisis caused by the volcano was solved. Rather, the U.S. government expected the volcanic crisis to last at least 10 more years; so, the Monsterratians no longer qualiﬁ  ed as “temporary” refugees.

of Hindus migrated from Pakistan to secular India—an estimated 8 million in all. In the 1990s after decades of Soviet obstruction, more than 2 million Jews left the former Soviet Union for Israel and other destinations. The decline in minority white power and uncertain political conditions in South Africa during the mid-1990s impelled many whites to emigrate to Australia, Europe, and North America. Technological Advances
For some migrants, emigration is no longer the dif-ﬁ cult and hazardous journey it used to be. Although 
most migrants, especially refugees, still move by foot, some use modern forms of transportation and commu-nication, the availability of which can itself encourage migration.
92c03Migration.indd Page 92  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 92  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 Where Do People Migrate? 93
Gone is the time when would-be emigrants waited 
months, even years, for information about distant 
places. News today travels faster than ever, including news of job opportunities and ways to reach desired destinations. T elevision, radio, cellular phone, and tele-phone stimulate millions of people to migrate by relay-ing information about relatives, opportunities, and already established communities in destination lands. Advances in communication technology strengthen the role of kinship links as push or pull factors. When deciding where to go, a migrant is often pulled to places where family and friends have already found suc-cess. Thus, T urks quickly heard about Germany’s need for migrant labor after World War II. Algerians knew where the most favorable destinations were in France in the same time period.
When a migrant chooses a destination and writes, 
calls, or communicates through others to tell family and friends at home about the new place, the migrant helps create a positive perception of the destination for family and friends, and may promise help with migra-tion by providing housing and assistance obtaining a job. Geographers call flows along and through kinship links chain migration. When a migrant reassures fam-
ily and friends that a new community has been formed, a place where they can feel home, this encourages fur-ther migration along the same chain. Chains of migra-tion built upon each other create immigration waves  
or swells in migration from one origin to the same  destination.
Think about a migration ﬂ  ow within your family, whether 
internal, international, voluntary, or forced. The ﬂ  ow can 
be one you experienced or one you only heard about through family. List the push and pull factors. Then, write a letter in the ﬁ  rst person (if you were not involved, pretend you were your grandmother or whomever) to another family member at “home” describing how you came to migrate to the destination.
WHERE DO PEOPLE MIGRATE?
It is tempting to reduce the ﬂ  ow of migration to 
simple economics: a chance for a job in another place trumps the lack of a job at home. However, migration is much more complicated than that. Migration depends on various push and pull factors, ranging from persecution in civil war to environmental disaster, from disempower-ment in the home to discrimination in the country, and each migration ﬂ  ow is helped or hampered by existing 
networks and governmental actions.
In this section of the chapter, we examine where 
people migrate, that is, the destinations they choose. At the global, regional, and national scales, we can see sev-eral major migration ﬂ  ows over the past 500 years, ﬂ  ows 
where hundreds of thousands of people migrated along the same general path. We focus on the destinations in these major migration ﬂ  ows. As we discuss migration 
ﬂ ows at the global, regional, and national scales in this 
chapter, remember that these ﬂ  ows give only an overview of migration. At the local and household scales, each indi-vidual or family migration required life-altering decisions, and those decisions fostered global change.
Global Migration Flows
Before 1500, long-distance, global-scale migration occurred haphazardly, typically in pursuit of spices, fame, or exploration. T o put exploration in perspective, note that a complete map of the world’s continents did not exist until the early 1800s. European explorers, who included surveyors and cartographers, played a major role in ﬁ  nally 
mapping the world. On the heels of exploration came European colonization, a physical process whereby the 
colonizer takes over another place, putting its own gov-ernment in charge and either moving its own people into the place or bringing in indentured outsiders to gain con-trol of the people and the land. First, Europeans colonized the Americas and the coasts of Africa and parts of Asia from the 1500s to the 1800s. Then, Europeans colonized interior Africa and Asia starting in the late 1800s and into the 1900s.
The past ﬁ  ve centuries have witnessed human 
migration on an unprecedented scale, much of it gener-ated by European colonization. The major ﬂ  ows of global 
migration from 1500 on are shown in Figure 3.11. The migration ﬂ  ows include movements from Europe to North America (1); from Southern Europe to South and Central America (2); from Britain and Ireland to Africa and Australia (3); from Africa to the Americas during the period of slavery (4); and from India to eastern Africa, Southeast Asia, and Caribbean America (5).
Among the greatest human migrations in recent 
centuries was the ﬂ  ow from Europe to the Americas. 
Emigration from Europe (1 and 2 in Fig. 3.11) began slowly. Before the 1830s, perhaps 2.75 million Europeans left to settle overseas. The British went to North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa (3). From Spain and Portugal, many hundreds of thousands of Europeans emigrated to Middle and South America.

colonial settlements grew, even in coastal areas of present-
day Angola, Kenya, and Indonesia. The rate of European emigration increased sharply between 1835 and 1935, with perhaps as many as 75 million departing for colo-nies in Africa and Asia, and for economic opportunities in the Americas. Although millions of Europeans even-tually returned to their homelands, the net outﬂ  ow from 
Europe was enormous, as evidenced by the sheer number of Canadians and Americans who identify themselves as being of European ancestry.
As already discussed, the Americas were the des-
tination of another mass of immigrants: African slaves. African slaves were among the very ﬁ  rst non-American Indian settlers in this country (4). Although this migra-tion is mapped as just one of the eight major migration streams, its immense and lasting impact on both sides of the Atlantic sets it apart from all the others.
Even as the Atlantic slave trade was in progress, 
European colonialism generated major migrations in other places in the world. The British, who took control over South Asia, transported tens of thousands of “indentured” workers from present-day India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to East and South Africa (see symbol (5) on Fig. 3.11). T oday, people of South Asian ancestry are substantial minorities in South Africa, Kenya, and T anzania. South Asian immigrants in eastern and southern Africa became c03Migration.indd Page 94  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 94  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

business leaders in the region. T oday, South Asians con-
trol a disproportionate share of commerce and hold much of the wealth in the region, which has become a major source of ethnic friction.
Long before the British arrived in India, Hindu 
inﬂ uences radiated into Southeast Asia, reaching the 
Indonesian islands of Java and Bali. Later, the British renewed the Indian migration stream, bringing South Asians to the Malay Peninsula (including Singapore) and to their Paciﬁ  c holdings including Fiji (Fig. 3.11).
The British were also instrumental in relocating 
Asians, mainly from India, to such Caribbean countries as T rinidad and T obago and Guyana, the trans-Paciﬁ  c stream labeled 5 in Fig. 3.11. The Dutch were pivotal in the migration of many Javanese from what is today Indonesia to the former Dutch dependency of Suriname along the same route.
Regional Migration Flows

continents. Migration also occurs at a regional scale  
with migrants going to a neighboring country to take 
advantage of short-term economic opportunities, to reconnect with their cultural group across borders, or to ﬂ  ee political conﬂ  ict or war.
Economic Opportunities
T o understand migration ﬂ  ows from one poor country to another, it is not sufﬁ  cient to analyze the ﬂ  ow at the global scale. We need to understand where the region ﬁ  ts into 
the global interaction picture and to see how different locations within the region ﬁ  t into interaction patterns at both the global and regional scales. Cities in the devel-oping world are typically where most foreign investment goes, where the vast majority of paying jobs are located, and where infrastructure is concentrated. These port cities become islands of economic development within larger undeveloped regions. Geographers call these cities islands of development (Fig. 3.12).
Within the region of West Africa, the oil-pro-
ducing areas of Nigeria are islands of development. In the mid-1970s, poorer people in T ogo, Benin, Ghana, and the northern regions of Nigeria, perceiving that economic life was better in coastal Nigeria, were lured to the coast for short-term jobs while the oil economy was good. The migrants, usually young men, worked as much as they could and sent almost all of the money they earned home as remittances to support their fami-lies. They worked until the oil economy took a fall in the early 1980s, and at that point, the Nigerian government decided the foreign workers were no longer needed. The Nigerian government forcibly pushed out 2 million foreign workers.
Global economic processes and the lasting effects of 
European colonialism certainly played a role in this West African migration ﬂ  ow. If we study such a ﬂ  ow only at 
the global scale, we see migrants moving from one poor country to another poor country. But if we use both the global and regional scales to study this ﬂ  ow, we under-stand regional economic inﬂ  uences and the pull of islands 
of development in Nigeria.
European colonialism also had an impact on 
regional migration ﬂ  ows in Southeast Asia. Europe’s colonial occupation of Southeast Asia presented eco-nomic opportunities for the Chinese. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, millions of Chinese laborers ﬂ ed famine and political strife in southern China to

work as contract laborers in Southeast Asia (Fig. 3.13). 
Many remained, and today their descendants consti-tute a Chinese minority in Southeast Asian countries that accounts for substantial portions of the popula-tion: 14 percent in Thailand, 32 percent in Malaysia, and 76 percent in Singapore. The Chinese minority in Indonesia accounts for only about 3 percent of the total population, but Indonesia has more than 200 mil-lion people, so its Chinese minority is one of Southeast Asia’s largest clusters. Over time, the Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia became leaders in trade, commerce, and ﬁ  nance in Southeast Asia, taking an economic posi-tion much like that of Southern Asians in eastern and southern Africa.
Reconnection of Cultural Groups
Regional migration flows also center on reconnecting cultural groups across borders. A migration stream with enormous consequences is the flow of Jewish immigrants to Israel. At the turn of the twentieth cen-tury, fewer than 50,000 Jewish residents lived in what was then Palestine. From 1919 to 1948, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland held control over Palestine, and Britain encouraged Jews, whose ancestors had fled more than a thousand years earlier from the Middle East to Europe, to return to the region. By 1948, as many as 750,000 Jews resided in Palestine, when the United Nations intervened to partition the area and establish the independent state of Israel. The original boundaries of the new state are shown in orange in Figure 3.14. Following the division of the land between the newly created Israeli state and the state of Palestine, another migration stream began when 600,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were pushed out of Israeli territories. Palestinians sought refuge in neighboring Jordan, Egypt, Syria, and beyond.
Through a series of wars, Israel expanded its area 
of territorial control (Fig. 3.14) and actively built settle-ments for new Jewish immigrants in Palestinian territories  Where Do People Migrate? 97c03Migration.indd Page 97  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 97  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
98 Chapter 3   Migration
Before the East German government built the Berlin 
Wall and the Iron Curtain divided Western and Eastern Europe, several million Germans ﬂ  ed Soviet-controlled 
East Germany into what was then West Germany. And millions of migrants left Europe altogether to go to the United States (1.8 million), Canada (1.1 million), Australia (1 million), Israel (750,000), Argentina (750,000), Brazil (500,000), Venezuela (500,000), and other countries. As many as 8 million Europeans emigrated from Europe in the postwar stream.
Even before Cuba became a communist state, thou-
sands of Cuban citizens applied annually for residency in the United States. Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba in 1959. During the 1960s, while the Cuban government was establishing the Communist Party of Cuba and for-malizing a communist state, the number of Cuban immi-grants in the United States swelled. The U.S. government formalized the ﬂ  ow as the Cuban Airlift, an authorized 
movement of persons desiring to escape from a commu-nist government. The vast majority of Cuban immigrants arrived and remained in the greater Miami area. In south-ern Florida Cubans developed a core of Hispanic culture, and in 1973, Dade County, Florida declared itself bicul-tural and bilingual.
In 1980 another massive, organized exodus of Cubans 
occurred, which brought more than 125,000 Cubans to U.S. shores. Special legislation allowed the large group to become naturalized citizens over time. The Cuban inﬂ  ux 
persisted throughout the 1980s, and then in 1994, over 30,000 Cubans ﬂ  ed for the United States. By that point, the 
Soviet Union had collapsed, and the Soviet Union’s ﬁ  nan-
cial support for the Cuban government had dwindled. The 1994 exodus pushed diplomats in both the United States and Cuba to come to an agreement on Cuban migration. In 1995, the U.S. government established the wet foot–dry foot policy, which stemmed the ﬂ  ow of Cuban migrants to 
the United States.
National Migration Flows
National migration ﬂ  ows can also be thought of as internal migration ﬂ  ows. Historically, two of the major migration ﬂ  ows before 1950 occurred internally, that is, within a single country rather than across interna-tional borders. In the United States, a massive migra-tion stream carried the center of population west and more recently also south, as Figure 3.16 shows. As the American populace migrates westward, it is also shift-ing from north to south, to reﬂ  ect migration ﬂ  ows from 
south to north and back again. After the American Civil War, and gaining momentum during World War I, mil-lions of African Americans migrated north to work in the industrial Northeast and Midwest. This internal migra-tion ﬂ  ow continued during the 1920s, declined during (Fig. 3.15). Jewish immigrants from the Eurasian region continue to migrate to Israel. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, thousands of Jews who had been unable to practice their religion in the Soviet Union migrated to Israel. T oday Israel’s popu-lation of 7.4 million, including about 1 million Arab Israelis, continues to grow through immigration as well as substantial natural increase.
Conﬂ  ict and War
At the end of World War II, as many as 15 million Germans migrated westward from their homes in Eastern Europe, either voluntarily or because they were forced to leave.

Field Note
“Just a few miles into the West Bank, not far from Jerusalem, 
the expanding Israeli presence could not be missed. New settlements dot the landscape, often occupying strategic sites that are also easily defensible. These ‘facts on the ground’ will certainly complicate the effort to carve out a stable territorial order in this much-contested region. That, of course, is the goal of the settlers and their supporters, but it is salt on the wound for those who contest the Israeli right to be there in the ﬁ  rst place.”c03Migration.indd Page 99  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 99  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
100 Chapter 3   Migration
the depression years of the 1930s, and then resumed its 
upward climb.
In the 1970s, the trend began to reverse itself: African 
Americans began leaving the North and returning to the South. The reversal had several causes. Although the civil rights movement in the 1960s did not change conditions in the South overnight, it undoubtedly played a role in the reverse migration. Disillusionment with deteriorating living conditions in the Rustbelt of the urban North and West, coupled with growing economic opportunities in Southern cities, also drew African Americans southward. African Americans who lived in Northern cities migrated to Southern cities, not to rural areas, as the urban econo-mies of the Sunbelt began to grow.
Russia also experienced a major internal migration, 
but in Russia, people migrated east, from the heartland of the Russian state (near Moscow and St. Petersburg) to the shores of the Paciﬁ  c. This eastward migration signiﬁ  cantly altered the cultural mosaic of Eurasia, 
and understanding this migration ﬂ  ow helps us under-stand the modern map of Eurasia. During the tsarist (1800s–1910s) and communist periods (1920s–1980s), Russian and Soviet rulers tried to occupy and consoli-date the country’s far eastern frontier, moving indus-tries eastward, building railroads and feeder lines, and establishing Vladivostok on the Paciﬁ  c Coast as one of the world’s best equipped naval bases. As Russia and then the Soviet Union expanded outward and to the east, the country incorporated numerous ethnic minorities into the country.
During the communist period, the Soviet govern-
ment also employed a policy of Russification, which sought to assimilate all the people in the Soviet territory into the Russian culture. One way the Soviets pushed for Russiﬁ  cation was by encouraging people of Russian heri-
tage to move out of Moscow and St. Petersburg and ﬁ  ll 
in the country. By 1980, as many as 30 million Russians had moved out toward the borders. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, some people moved back to their original homelands, but the map will long carry the impact of Russia’s eastward expansion.
Mexico offers a more recent example of internal 
migration. As many as 1 million Mexicans successfully cross into the United States each year, both legally and ille-gally. Many Mexicans emigrate from the northern areas of Mexico into the southern areas of the United States. In the northern Mexican State of Zacatecas, an estimated one out of every two people is currently living in the United States. As a result, the northern areas of Mexico are experiencing a labor shortage. In response, Mexican workers from areas farther south in the country are migrating northward to ﬁ ll the labor shortage, especially in Mexico’s agricultural 
sector. Many Mexicans migrating north within the country are Huichol Indians, one of Mexico’s indigenous popula-tions. Ironically, the Huichol in northern Mexico are expe-riencing the same kind of substandard living conditions, lack of acceptance by locals, and exploitation by employers that the Mexicans from the north are experiencing in the United States.
Guest Workers
The countries of Europe that were major participants in World War II lost millions of young men in the long con-ﬂ ict. After the war, European countries, rebuilding their 
economies with the help of the U.S.-sponsored Marshall Plan, found themselves in need of laborers. T wo ﬂ  ows of 
migration into Western European countries began: ﬁ  rst 
within the European region, as workers from poorer European countries and regions migrated to economically growing areas, and second from outside of Europe, as mil-lions of foreign workers immigrated from North Africa (the majority to France) and T urkey (mostly to Germany) as well as from the Caribbean region, India, and Africa (many to the United Kingdom).
Western European governments called the labor 
migrants guest workers. The laws allowing guest work-
ers into Europe assumed the workers would ﬁ  ll the void left by those who died during World War II, and then they would return to their home countries. Instead, the guest workers stayed both because they wanted to and because they were needed. T wo to three generations of T urks have now been born in Germany, making them far more than “guests.” The German government, which had for decades deﬁ  ned German citizens as those of German descent, allowed T urks to become citizens of the country in 2005.
Not only in Germany, but in countries around the 
world, millions of guest workers live outside of their home country and send remittances from their jobs home. Guest workers often work as agricultural laborers or in service industries, including hotels, restaurants, and tourist attractions. The home states of these workers are fully aware that their citizens have visas and are working abroad. In many instances, the economies of the home countries come to rely on the remittances, and the home governments work with destination countries and with the international labor organization to protect the rights of the guest workers.
Despite the legal status of guest workers and the 
work of governments and international organizations to protect them, many employers abuse them because guest workers are often unaware of their rights. Long hours and low pay are common, but guest workers continue to work because the money is better than they would ordi-narily receive and because they are supporting families at home.c03Migration.indd Page 100  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 100  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 Where Do People Migrate? 101
When the need for labor declines, destination 
governments can squeeze out guest workers. Nigeria, 
as noted earlier, did exactly that in the early 1980s when the government sent foreign workers from other areas of West Africa home, often by force. Similarly, the government of the home country can pull out its guest workers, bringing them home when conditions in the destination region become perilous. For example, over 30,000 Indonesians were working in the Middle East before the 2003 Iraq War; the Indonesian govern-ment decided to pull its workers home just before the war began.
Guest workers are legal, documented migrants 
who have work visas, usually short term. Often the des-tination governments extend the visas if certain sec-tors of the economy still need laborers. Whether short or long term, the international ﬂ  ow of guest workers changes the ethnic, linguistic, and religious mosaic of the places where they go. In Europe, for example, guest workers from T urkey, North Africa, South Asia, and other former colonial holdings have altered the cul-tural landscape of the region. New temples, mosques, restaurants, grocery stores, shops, and service industries geared toward migrants have taken root in Europe’s cul-tural landscape.
Refugees
Y ou may have seen a story on the televised news show-ing thousands upon thousands of poor people ﬂ  eeing a 
crisis in their home region or country by walking. They put their few earthly possessions and their babies on their backs and walk. They walk to another town. They walk beyond their country’s border. They walk to a ref-ugee camp without adequate food, water, or amenities. International agencies attempt desperate relief efforts while disease spreads, dooming infants and children and emaciating adults. As they walk, they remember all they are leaving behind: the only life they have known. But in the midst of war and persecution, it is too hard to hold onto this life. So, they walk.
The vast majority of refugees do not make it far 
from home. The United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that 83 percent of refugees ﬂ ee to a country in the same region as their home coun-
try. The world’s refugee population has grown steadily since the 1951 establishment of the Refugee Convention, which established an international law specifying who is a refugee and what legal rights they have. The main goal of the 1951 Refugee Convention was to help European refu-gees following the end of World War II. The UNHCR helped to repatriate (return to their homeland) most of the refugees from World War II.In 1970, the United Nations reported 2.9 million 
persons were refugees; the majority were Palestinian Arabs dislocated by the creation of the state of Israel and the armed conﬂ  icts that followed. In 1980, the global ref-ugee total had nearly tripled, to over 8 million. By 2010, the UNHCR reported 15.2 million refugees (not count-ing Palestinian refugees in Jordan and Syria), ﬂ  eeing from 
their homes and across country borders.
The United Nations agency that monitors the refu-
gee problem is the key organization supporting refugees. It organizes and funds international relief efforts and negotiates with governments and regimes on behalf of the refugees. But UNHCR is not alone in tracking this global problem; other ofﬁ  ces often contradict UNHCR’s data, 
arguing that the situation is even worse than the United Nations suggests.
The 1951 Refugee Convention deﬁ  nes a refugee  
as “a person who has a wellfounded fear of being perse-cuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, member-ship of a particular social group, or political opinion.” Countries interpret this deﬁ  nition in different ways, especially since the phrase “wellfounded” leaves much room for judgment.
Perhaps the biggest problem with the UN deﬁ  ni-
tion has to do with internally displaced persons (called IDPs, sometimes called internal refugees). Internally displaced persons are people who have been displaced within their own countries, such as the victims of Hurricane Katrina, but they do not cross international borders as they ﬂ  ee. IDPs tend to remain undercounted, if not almost invisible. In 2010, UNHCR estimated that 27 million people (in addition to the 15.2 million inter-national refugees) are IDPs—forced to abandon their homes. The United Nations and international law dis-tinguish between refugees , who have crossed one or more 
international borders during their move and encamped in a country other than their own, and internally displaced 
persons  (IDPs), who abandon their homes but remain in 
their own countries.
Because the status of a refugee is internationally 
deﬁ ned and recognized and comes with legal rights, the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and states in the world must distinguish between refugees and migrants who may be just as poor or desperate but who do not qualify for refugee status. When a refugee meets the ofﬁ cial criteria, he or she becomes eligible for assistance, 
including possible asylum, which is the right to protec-tion in the ﬁ  rst country in which the refugee arrives. Other migrants do not have the right to asylum. Refugee status can extend over decades and become the very basis for a way of life, as has happened in the Middle East. In Jordan, Palestinian refugees have become so integrated into the host country’s national life that they are regarded as permanent refugees, but in Lebanon other Palestinians c03Migration.indd Page 101  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 101  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
102 Chapter 3   Migration
wait in refugee camps for resettlement and still qualify as 
temporary refugees.
The United Nations helps ensure that refugees and 
internally displaced persons are not forcibly returned to a homeland where persecution is still continuing. Once the violence subsides in a place and the conditions improve, the UNHCR helps return refugees to their homelands, a process called repatriation.
In the 1990s, hostilities broke out between the Hutu 
and T utsi ethnic groups in Rwanda that led to a genocide killing hundreds of thousands and a disastrous exodus of more than one million refugees who ﬂ  ed to neighboring 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (then called Zaire), T anzania, and Uganda. The T utsi–Hutu strife in Rwanda spread to neighboring Burundi and dislocated tens of thousands. After the civil war in Rwanda calmed down in 1996, the UNHCR and the World Health Organization watched and aided as 500,000 Rwandans returned from across the border in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Fig. 3.17).
Regions of Dislocation
The refugee situation changes frequently as some refu-gees return home, conditions permitting, and as other new streams suddenly form. Y et we can make certain general-izations about the overall geography of refugees. T oday, the region of North Africa and Southwest Asia, including Iraq and Afghanistan, generates more than half of the refu-gees worldwide. Subsaharan Africa comes in second with about 20 percent of the world’s refugees (Fig. 3.18).

 Where Do People Migrate? 103
In 2010 the United Nations reported that festering 
war and conﬂ  ict in the world was diminishing the num-
ber of refugees who were repatriated (returned home) each year. The High Commissioner on Refugees stated that a majority of the world’s refugees had been refugees (and not repatriated) for more than ﬁ  ve years. Most refugees move 
without any more goods than they can carry with them. When the United States and its allies began their retalia-tory bombing in Afghanistan following the terrorist attack on New Y ork and Washington in September 2001, tens of thousands of Afghan refugees climbed across mountain passes to reach the relative safety of Pakistan, able only to bring a few personal belongings. Most refugees make their ﬁ  rst “step” on foot, by bicycle, wagon, or open boat. 
Refugees are suddenly displaced, limiting their options, and most have few resources to invest in their journey. As a result, the vast majority of the world’s refugees come from relatively poor countries and travel to neighboring coun-tries that are also poor. The impact of refugee ﬂ  ows is cer-tainly felt most in the poorest countries of the world.
North Africa and Southwest Asia
This geographic region, extending from Morocco in the west to Afghanistan in the east, contains some of the world’s longest-lasting and most deeply entrenched conﬂ  icts that 
generate refugees. A particularly signiﬁ  cant set of refugee 
problems center on Israel and the displaced Arab popula-tions that surround it. Conﬂ  ict in Afghanistan has lasted 
more than 30 years, generating the largest refugee ﬂ  ow in 
the world today. Instability in the Persian Gulf in 1991 and again since 2001 accounts for the second largest refugee ﬂ ow in the world. In sum, over half of the refugees world-
wide today come from Afghanistan and Iraq alone.
The Gulf War of 1991 and the current war in Iraq 
have generated millions of refugees in the region. In 1991, in the aftermath of the Gulf War that followed Iraq’s inva-sion of Kuwait, a signiﬁ  cant percentage of the Kurdish population of northern Iraq, threatened by the surviving military apparatus and under Baghdad’s control, aban-doned their villages and towns and streamed toward and across the T urkish and Iranian borders. The refugee move-ment of Iraq’s Kurds involved as many as 2.5 million people and riveted world attention to the plight of people who are condemned to such status through the actions of others. It led the United States and its allies to create a secure zone for Kurds in northern Iraq in the hope of persuading dis-placed Kurds in T urkey and Iran to return to their coun-try. But this effort was only partially successful. The events surrounding the Gulf War severely dislocated the Kurdish people of Iraq; as Figure 3.18 shows, many remain refugees in T urkey as well as Iran. The current war in Iraq has gen-erated over 2 million refugees, most of whom are living in neighboring Syria and Jordan, and over 1.5 million IDPs.
During the 1980s, Afghanistan was caught in the 
Soviets’ last imperialist campaign and paid an enormous price for it. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan at the end of 1979, in support of a puppet regime, as well as Afghan resistance, generated a double migration stream that carried millions westward into Iran and eastward into 
Pakistan. At the height of the exodus, 2.5 million Afghans were  estimated to be living in camps in Iran, and some 
3.7 million gathered in tent camps in Pakistan’s northwest-
ern province and in southern Baluchistan. The Soviet inva-sion seemed destined to succeed quickly, but the Russian generals underestimated the strength of Afghan opposition. U.S. support for the Muslim forces in the form of weapons supplies helped produce a stalemate and eventual Soviet withdrawal, but this was followed by a power struggle among Afghan factions. As a result, most of the more than 6 million refugees in Iran and Pakistan, about one-quarter of the country’s population, stayed where they were.
In 1996, the T aliban, an Islamic Fundamentalist 
movement that began in northwest Pakistan, emerged in Afghanistan and took control of most of the country, imposing strict Islamic rule and suppressing the factional conﬂ icts that had prevailed since the Soviet withdrawal. 
Although several hundred thousand refugees moved back to Afghanistan from Pakistan, the harsh T aliban rule cre-ated a countermigration and led to further refugee move-ment into neighboring Iran, where their number reached 2.5 million. Eventually, Afghanistan became a base for anti-Western terrorist operations, which reached a climax in the attack on the United States on September 11, 2001. Even before the inevitable military retaliation began, and despite efforts by both Pakistan and Iran to close their borders, tens of thousands of Afghan refugees ﬂ  ooded across, intensify-
ing a refugee crisis that is now nearly a quarter-century old.
Amidst the crises in Israel/Palestine, Iraq, and 
Afghanistan, nearly every country in Southwest Asia is currently experiencing the impact of refugees.
Africa
Africa’s people are severely afﬂ  icted by dislocation, not just 
in terms of the 2 million refugees accounted for by interna-tional relief agencies, but also millions more are internally displaced persons. The impact of refugee and IDP ﬂ  ows 
in Subsaharan Africa is exacerbated by extreme poverty, corruption, and disease in many parts of the region. For Africans who live in countries experiencing civil war or brutal dictatorships, each day is a humanitarian crisis.
During the last decade of the twentieth century and 
the ﬁ  rst years of the twenty-ﬁ  rst, several of the world’s largest refugee crises occurred in Subsaharan Africa. In the 1990s and early 2000s, refugee ﬂ  ows in West, Central, and East Africa combined to put Subsaharan Africa at the head of the world’s refugee ﬂ  ows. In 2011, the number of refugees in Subsaharan Africa pales in comparison to the number in North Africa and Southwest Asia.
Although Subsaharan Africa is not politically stable, 
most refugees from the crises in West Africa were repatriated. c03Migration.indd Page 103  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 103  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

of hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming into Guinea and Ivory Coast. The UNHCR reported more than 1.5 mil-lion refugees in West Africa in 1997. In 2011, the number of refugees in West Africa declined to under 200,000 as a result of improved political stability and repatriation. The largest refugee ﬂ  ows in Subsaharan Africa now come out of Central and East Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan, and Somalia.
Sudan, which began a second civil war in 1983, dem-
onstrates the complexities of refugee crises in Subsaharan Africa today. The conﬂ  ict in Sudan was originally between the north, which is largely Arab and Muslim, and the south, which is majority black African and Christian or animist (the south has since seceded and is now South Sudan). Sudan, a country drawn by European colonialism, was home to traditional religions in the south, Christianity brought by Western missionaries in the south, and Islam brought by North African traders in the north.
The government in Khartoum, located in the Muslim 
north, waged a campaign of genocide toward ethnic groups in the Christian and animist south during the  Figure 3.18

north-south civil war, which lasted from 1983 to 2005. 
The government of Sudan funded the Janjaweed militia, which practiced a scorched earth campaign, burning vil-lages throughout the south. 
The civil war between north and south in Sudan 
caused immense damage. Over 2.2 million people died in the ﬁ  ghting or starved as a result of the war. More than 
5 million people were displaced, with over 1.6 million ﬂ eeing to neighboring Uganda alone. Both sides of the 
Sudanese civil war interfered with the efforts of interna-tional agencies to help the refugees.In 1999, Sudan began exporting oil, which is extracted 
from southern Sudan. Global attention to the humanitar-ian crisis of the Sudanese civil war prompted the northern government to agree to a compromise. In 2002, the north and south brokered a temporary peace deal, but shortly thereafter, violence began in the Darfur region in western Sudan. The entire north of Sudan is largely Muslim, but only two-thirds of the northerners speak Arabic as their native language. The other one-third are Muslim but are not ethnically Arab. The non-Arab Muslims are part of at least 30 different ethnic groups in the Darfur region of Tropic of CancerArctic Circle

western Sudan. The Arab Muslim government (located in 
the north) began a campaign of genocide early in this cen-tury against the non-Arab Muslims in Darfur. The govern-ment of Sudan funds the militia known as the Janjaweed. The Janjaweed is waging a genocide campaign against the non-Arab, Muslim, darker-skinned Africans in Darfur—a campaign that includes killing over 400,000, raping women and girls, taking lands and homes from Africans, and displacing 2.5 million people (Fig. 3.19).
In 2004, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell 
labeled the Janjaweed’s actions in Darfur genocide. The 
1948 Convention on Genocide deﬁ  nes genocide as “acts 
committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.” The inter-national community is trying to negotiate an end to the government-backed campaign in Darfur. The United Nations Security Council met in Kenya in 2004 trying to ﬁ  nd a solution and eventually passed a resolution con-demning the Sudanese government and threatening puni-tive damages against the government for their actions in Darfur. T wo members of the Security Council, China and Pakistan, abstained from the vote because each of these countries relies on oil imports from Sudan.
In 2005, northern and southern Sudan signed the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which called for the south to hold a referendum, a vote of all the people, on whether to break off from the north and form a new coun-try. Conﬂ  ict continued in Darfur. Under international pressure in 2008, China began to pressure the Sudanese government to end the violence in Darfur, but the Chinese government also refuses to recognize the Janjaweed’s rela-tionship with the Sudanese government.
In 2011, South Sudan voted in a referendum to 
secede from Sudan. In July 2011 the north and south formally separated. Ironically, the new border, which was created as a solution to a civil war and refugee crisis has already generated new refugee ﬂ  ows in the region. 
The long-lasting refugee and IDP crisis in Sudan help us understand the complexity of political conﬂ  ict and 
migration ﬂ  ows in Subsaharan Africa. The Muslim  Figure 3.19

against Muslim conﬂ  ict in Darfur demonstrates that 
political conﬂ  ict is not just religious; it is also ethnic and political.
Mixed into this extremely local conﬂ  ict are regional 
and global-scale debates about what to do. Regionally, the African Union, an organization committed to ﬁ  nd-
ing African solutions to African problems, has com-mitted Nigerian and Rwandan troops to Darfur to try to solve the crisis. The African Union is supported with American and European monies and military strategiz-ing. Regionally, neighboring countries have not helped create stability for the country. Since 1998, over 5.4 million people have died in violence in neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. Violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was partially spurred by the instability created as a result of refugee ﬂ  ows from 
the 1994 war in neighboring Rwanda. The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is certainly bleak. In 2009, attacks by the rebel group Lord’s Resistance Army in the northeastern portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have generated over 1 million refugees. The refugees have ﬂ  ed to South Sudan, a new country that recently experienced civil war and humani-tarian crisis, to escape their own oppressive government.
South Asia
In terms of refugee numbers, South Asia is the third-rank-ing geographic realm, mainly because of Pakistan’s role in accommodating Afghanistan’s refugees. During the Soviet intrusion in the 1980s, the UNHCR counted more than 3 million refugees; during the 1990s, the total aver-aged between 1.2 and 1.5 million. That number rose when Allied retaliation against terrorist bases began in October 2001. T oday, Afghanistan has an enormous refugee cri-sis with 3 million refugees living outside of Afghanistan, mostly in Pakistan and Iran.
The other major refugee problem in South Asia 
stems from a civil war in Sri Lanka. This conﬂ  ict, aris-
ing from demands by minority T amils for an indepen-dent state on the Sinhalese-dominated and -controlled island, has cost tens of thousands of lives and has severely damaged the economy. The United Nations reports that about 200,000 people are internally displaced. The United Nations, European Union, and the Canadian government are working to repatriate the IDPs, particu-larly in the northern provinces of Sri Lanka. An estimated 100,000 internally displaced persons are uprooted in Sri Lanka today.
Southeast Asia
Southeast Asia is a reminder that refugee problems can change quickly. Indochina was the scene of one of the twentieth century’s most desperate refugee crises when a stream of between 1 and 2 million people ﬂ  ed Vietnam in the aftermath of the long war that ended in 1975. In the early 1990s, Cambodia produced an exodus of 300,000 refugees escaping from their country’s seem-ingly endless cycle of violence, ending up in refugee camps on the Thailand side of the border. T oday, the largest camps in this realm are for IDPs in Myanmar (formerly Burma). Victims of the 2004 tsunami, the 2008 cyclone, and the repressive rule of generals who are seeking to subjugate the country’s minorities seek refuge in the camps. The UNHCR explains that esti-mating the number of IDPs in Myanmar is difﬁ  cult 
because securing information from Myanmar’s closed society is difﬁ  cult.
Europe
In the 1990s, the collapse of Yugoslavia and its associated conﬂ icts created the largest refugee crisis in Europe since 
the end of World War II. In 1995, the UNHCR reported the staggering total of 6,056,600 refugees, a number that some observers felt was inﬂ  ated by the Europeans’ unusu-ally liberal interpretations of the United Nations’ rules for refugee recognition. Nevertheless, even after the cessa-tion of armed conﬂ  ict and the implementation of a peace 
agreement known as the Dayton Accords, the UNHCR still reports over 100,000 IDPs in the area.
Other Regions
The number of refugees and internally displaced per-sons in other geographic realms is much smaller. In the Western Hemisphere, only Colombia has a serious inter-nally displaced person problem, numbering between 3.4 and 4.9 million people, caused by the country’s chronic instability associated with its struggle against narcotics. Large areas of Colombia’s countryside are vulnerable to armed attack by “narcoterrorists” and paramilitary units; these rural areas are essentially beyond government con-trol, and thousands of villagers have died in the crossﬁ  re. 
Hundreds of thousands more have left their homes to seek protection.
People who abandon their familiar surroundings 
because conditions have become unlivable perform an ultimate act of desperation. In the process, the habits of civilization vanish as survival becomes the sole imperative. Refugee and internally displaced person populations are a barometer of the world’s future.

migrant. You look at your access to transportation and the

HOW DO GOVERNMENTS 
AFFECT MIGRATION?
The control of immigration, legal and illegal, the 
granting of asylum to asylum-seeking refugees, and the 
fate of cross-border refugees, permanent and temporary, have become hot issues around the world. In Europe, right-wing political parties whip up anti-immigrant senti-ment. In California, the state government demands fed-eral monies to provide services for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants; if the federal government cannot control its borders, they argue, states should not have to foot the bill. In Cuba, the Castro regime has used migra-tion as a threat: in August 1994, Castro threatened to open Cuba’s doors to a ﬂ  ood of emigrants who would invari-ably all ﬂ  ee to the United States. And in the United States today, the federal government faces reproach both from those who want to stop the ﬂ  ow of migration from Mexico and those who argue for opening the United States’ doors for migrants from humanitarian crises, including Haiti.
Efforts to restrict migration ﬂ  ows are nothing new. 
Media coverage, political debates, and political wrangling only make it seem so. In the fourteenth century, China built the Great Wall in part as a defensive measure but also as a barrier to emigration (by Chinese beyond the sphere of their authorities) and immigration (mainly by Mongol “barbarians” from the northern plains). The Berlin Wall, the Korean DMZ (demilitarized zone), the fences along the Rio Grande—all are evidence of governments’ desire to control the movement of people across their borders.
Legal Restrictions
T ypically, the obstacles placed in the way of potential immigrants are legal, not physical. Restrictive legisla-tion on immigration appeared in the United States in 1882, when Congress approved the Oriental Exclusion Acts (1882–1907). Congress designed immigration 
laws to prevent the immigration of Chinese people to California. In 1901, the Australian government approved the Immigration Restriction Act, which ended all non-white immigration into the newly united country. In particular, the Australian government was targeting Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian immigrants. The act also prohibited immigration by South Paciﬁ  c Islanders 
who worked on Australia’s large sugar plantations. The Australian government furthered action against the plan-tation workers (the Kanakas) by deporting the South Paciﬁ  c Islanders by the end of 1906. These immigration 
policies created what is known as the White Australia 
Policy, which remained in effect until modiﬁ  cation in 1972 and again in 1979.
Waves of Immigration 
in the United States
Changes in a country’s migration policies are reﬂ  ected in 
the number of people entering the country and the origin 
of the immigrants (see Fig. 3.20). The United States expe-rienced two major waves of immigration before 1930 and is in the midst of another great wave of immigration today. Major changes in the government’s migration policies are reﬂ ected in this graph. Push factors are also reﬂ  ected in 
Figure 3.20, as people in different regions found reasons to leave their home and migrate to the United States.
During the 1800s, the United States opened its 
doors to immigration. Most of the immigrants arrived from Europe, especially Northern Europe (Scandinavia) and western Europe (including Ireland, Great Britain, Germany, and France). In the later part of the 1800s, a greater proportion of Europeans who immigrated to the United States came from Southern and eastern Europe (including Italy, Spain, Portugal, Russia, and Poland).
Following World War I, political tides in the 
United States turned toward isolationism—staying out of entanglements abroad. In addition, Congress feared growing migration from eastern and Southern Europe. Many whites in the United States at the time saw migrants from eastern and southern Europe as darker skinned and as an inferior race of whites. In this context, Congress passed restrictive legislation in 1921, deter-ring immigration from southern and eastern Europe. Congress set immigration quotas, whereby each year, European countries could permit the emigration to the United States of 3 percent of the number of its nationals living in the United States in 1910. In 1910, the great-est proportion of immigrants in the United States came from northern and western Europe, thus the quotas allowed migration from northern and western Europe and severely restricted immigration from southern and eastern Europe (Fig. 3.20).
In 1924, Congress altered the Immigration Act by 
lowering the quota to 2 percent and making 1890 the base year, further reducing the annual total to 150,000 immi-grants and further discouraging eastern and southern European migration.
The rapid fall in total immigration to the United States 
is clear in Figure 3.20. Just prior to the Great Depression, Congress passed the National Origins Law in 1929, whereby Congress continued to limit immigration to 150,000 per year. Congress also tied immigration quotas to the national c03Migration.indd Page 108  9/15/11  7:36 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 108  9/15/11  7:36 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
origins of the U.S. population in 1920. As a result of this 
provision, Congress in effect prevented the immigration of Asians. With these laws in effect and the Great Depression in full swing, immigration slowed to a trickle during the 1930s. In some years emigration actually exceeded immigration in the United States.
After 1940, Congress modiﬁ  ed the restrictions on 
immigration to the United States. In 1943, Congress gave China equal status to that of European countries and in 1952 granted Japan a similar status. In 1952, immigration began to rise again (Fig. 3.20) after Congress passed a new Immigration and Nationality Act. Congress designed the act to incorporate all preceding legislation, establishing quotas for all countries and limiting total immigration to 160,000. However, far more than 160,000 immigrants entered the country as refugees, thereby ﬁ  lling quotas 
for years ahead. Estimates vary, but more than 7 million immigrants may have entered the United States as refu-gees between 1945 and 1970.
By 1965, Congress recognized the 1952 act as a fail-
ure and abolished the quota system. Congress set new limits, which are also reﬂ  ected in Figure 3.20. The United 
States allowed 170,000 immigrants per year from coun-tries outside of the Western Hemisphere and 120,000 from countries in the Americas. Refugee policies and guest worker policies over the last three decades allowed many more immigrants than these limitations.
The United States and Australia are not the only 
countries that have restricted immigration. Many coun-tries practice selective immigration, in which individuals with certain backgrounds (criminal records, poor health, subversive activities) are barred from entering.
Other countries have speciﬁ  c requirements. For 
example, South Africa long demanded “pure” European descent; New Zealand favored persons of British birth and parentage; Australia’s assisted passage program favored immigrants from Britain, the Netherlands, Malta, and Italy; Brazil preferred people with a farming background; and Singapore courts ﬁ  nancially secure persons of Chinese 
ancestry. T oday South American countries place limits on the number of immigrants who may cross their borders, and several countries are instituting quota systems. Figure 3.20

110 Chapter 3   Migration
Post–September 11
Since September 11, 2001, government immigration 
policies have incorporated security concerns. Prior to that date, the U.S. border patrol was concerned primarily with drug trafﬁ  cking and human smuggling. The new govern-ment policies affect asylum-seekers, illegal immigrants, and legal immigrants.
After September 11, the George W. Bush admin-
istration cracked down on asylum-seekers (a refugee requests entry into the U.S. from his or her home country, and an asylum seeker requests protection from a port of entry in the U.S.). In the aftermath of 9/11, on March 15, 2003,the U.S. government marked 33 countries as coun-tries where al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups operate, and the government automatically detained anyone from one of these 33 countries who entered the United States looking for asylum under a policy called “Operation Liberty Shield.” On March 25, Human Rights Watch argued against the policy, stating that it created “a blan-ket suspicion of links to terrorism based on nationality alone.” On April 17, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security quietly terminated “Operation Liberty Shield.”
Post-September 11 government security poli-
cies have also affected illegal immigrants. The Justice Department currently has a policy that allows it to detain any illegal immigrant, even if the person has no known ties to terrorist organizations. This policy stems from the department’s concern that terrorists may use Haiti as a “staging point.” The idea behind this law is that terror-ists could travel to Haiti temporarily and then illegally migrate from Haiti to the United States to commit ter-rorist attacks. Similarly, the government fence-building along the United States–Mexican border (discussed at the beginning of this chapter) is a response in part to the con-cern that terrorists will use Mexico as a staging ground to immigrate illegally and commit terrorist attacks.
In addition to focusing on asylum-seekers and illegal 
immigration, the post–September 11 world is concerned with legal immigration. The 9/11 Commission Report, released in 2004, discusses the issue of terrorists using fab-ricated or altered papers to migrate to the United States. The 9/11 terrorists entered the United States using visas. The Commission reported that the Federal Aviation Administration ﬂ  agged more than half of the 9/11 hijackers with the proﬁ  ling system they had in place. However, the policy at the time was to check the bags of those ﬂ  agged, 
not the people themselves. The Commission explains, “For terrorists, travel documents are as important as weapons.” It therefore recommends stepping up inspections and ques-tioning at travel checkpoints, seeing these checkpoints as “a chance to establish that people are who they say they are and are seeking access for their stated purpose, to intercept identiﬁ  able suspects, and to take effective action.”
People and organizations opposed to the post–
September 11 policies counter that raising fences and detaining people will not combat terrorism; rather, it will intensify hatred of the U.S. government, thus promoting terrorism. Organizations such as Human Rights First, Amnesty International, and the Migration Policy Institute claim that the new government crackdowns have violated civil liberties and have done nothing to make Americans safer. Others opposed to the new border regulations argue that the crackdown has only slowed trafﬁ  c and the ﬂ  ow of 
business and tourism, and has utterly failed to slow illegal immigration.
Regardless of which side of this debate you choose, 
we can all agree that concern about migration will con-tinue to shape security policy in the United States, Europe, and beyond in the decades to come.
One goal of international organizations involved in aiding refugees is repatriation—return of the refugees to their home countries once the threat against them has passed. Take the example of refugees from the Darfur region of Sudan. Think about how their land and their lives have changed since they became refugees. You are assigned the daunting task of repatriating refugees from Darfur to Sudan once a peace solution is reached. What steps would you have to take to rediscover a home for these refugees?
Summary
In the last 500 years, humans have traveled the globe, mapped it, connected it through globalization, and migrated across it. In this chapter, we discussed major global, regional, and national migration ﬂ  ows. Migration can occur as a result of a conscious decision, resulting in a voluntary migration ﬂ  ow, or migration can occur under duress, resulting in forced migration. Both kinds of migration have left an indelible mark on c03Migration.indd Page 110  9/15/11  7:36 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 110  9/15/11  7:36 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

As the world’s population mushrooms, the volume of migrants will expand. In an 
increasingly open and interconnected world, neither physical barriers nor politically motivated legislation will hold back tides that are as old as human history. Migrations will also further complicate an already complex global cultural pattern—raising ques-tions about identity, race, ethnicity, language, and religion, the topics we turn to in the next four chapters.

The signs with the Tata Corpor-
ation’s logo were everywhere on the landscape of the city of Hyderabad in India (Fig. 4.1): a Tata corporate building across the street from our ﬂ  at; Tata emblazoned 
on the grill of trucks through out the city; Tata sky satellite dishes bring-ing television into homes; Tata International consulting buildings in the high-tech district of the city.
I asked my host what the Tata Corporation was 
and where the name came from. He explained, “Tata is a family name. The Tata family are members of the Parsi religion, and they own many businesses through-out India and the world.”
I was surprised I had not heard of the Tata family 
before, but I had heard about the Parsi. The Parsi are an ethnic group and a religion. The Parsi are followers of the Zoroastrian religion and came to India from Persia (present-day Iran) sometime between the eighth and tenth centuries.
According to Indian folklore, the Parsi were 
looking for a place of refuge as they ﬂ  ed from Persia (present day Iran). They sent word to a Hindu ruler in western India that they wanted to settle there. The Hindu ruler sent the Parsi a bowl full of milk to sym-bolize that they should not come to India because the western states were already full. Legend has it that the Parsi leader placed a gold ring in the bowl of milk and returned it to symbolize they would bring wealth to the region without displacing the people.

Around 1500 years ago, the Parsi soon settled in western India, primarily in the 
city of Mumbai (historically Bombay).
India is overwhelmingly Hindu (85 percent), but the followers of the Parsi reli-
gion, who make up 0.00046 percent of the Indian population because there are fewer than 60,000 Parsi in the Indian population of 1.3 billion people, control a large share of the Indian economy. The Tata Group recorded revenues of $67 bil-lion in 2010. In addition to the Tata family, the Godrej Group, which produces soap, appliances, and ofﬁ  ce equipment, and the Wadias Company, which produces textiles and owns an airline, are both companies Parsi families in India established and lead.
How did such a small group of families become major players ﬁ  rst in the 
Indian economy and now in the global economy? Some Indian economists point to a positive relationship the Parsi had with the British when India was a colony of Great Britain. Others point to the tight-knit Parsi community that beneﬁ  ted ﬁ  nan-
cially early on through the establishment of India’s cotton industry and then grew that wealth into many other sectors over time.
The ﬁ  nancial success of the Parsi in India cannot be ascribed to a single cause. 
The cohesive community of the Parsi and the maintenance of cultural practices that keep the Parsi together and culturally separate from the dominant Hindu cul-ture were deﬁ  nitely factors in the Parsi success. These same traits now threaten to 
destroy the Parsi culture because the number of Parsi people is dwindling.
A local culture such as the Parsi is maintained through the preservation of 
cultural traits and practices. Today, however, one core cultural practice among the Parsi threatens the existence of the culture itself. According to an edict set down by Parsi religious leaders in 1918, the Parsi religion recognizes as members only the children who are born of two Parsi parents. Although some Parsi do accept the children who are born to a Parsi father and non-Parsi mother as a member of the Parsi community, children born of Parsi women who are married to non-Parsi (called “outsiders” by the Parsi) are not accepted as members of the community.
This is signiﬁ  cant today because the Parsi have a very high literacy rate of 98 
percent in India, and many Parsi women are highly educated, have good jobs, and choose either not to marry or to have children late, thus reducing fertility rates, or to marry outside of the Parsi community. In addition, thousands of Parsi, both women and men, have migrated to the United States and Europe over the past few decades.
One Parsi high priest sees the historical lack of intermarriage as a major rea-
son the Parsi were able to keep their culture and religion in a world surrounded by Hindu followers. Parsi in India today question whether to count the women married to “outsiders” and the children born to them. Not counting these women and children, the Parsi population in India has declined since 1980 from 100,000 to 56,000.
The local culture of the Parsi is highly engaged in the global economy, and 
today the Parsi are struggling to maintain their culture and sustain their sense of community in a changing world.
In an era of globalization, popular culture diffuses around the globe, being 
embraced by some and rejected by others, all the while inﬁ  ltrating every corner of 
the globe. Local cultures persist, and in many places the communities thrive, but they face constant pressure from larger cultural groups and from the enveloping popular culture. In the face of these pressures, some members of local cultures have clung more tightly to their customs, some have let go, and others have forged a balance between the two.

Key Questions For Chapter 4
 1. What are local and popular cultures?
 2. How are local cultures sustained?
 3. How is popular culture diffused?
 4. How can local and popular cultures be seen in the cultural 
landscape?
WHAT ARE LOCAL AND POPULAR 
CULTURES?
A culture is a group of belief systems, norms, and val-
ues practiced by a people. Although this deﬁ  nition of cul-
ture sounds simple, the concept of culture is actually quite 
complex. A group of people who share common beliefs can be recognized as a culture in one of two ways: (1) the people call themselves a culture or (2) other people (including aca-demics) can label a certain group of people as a culture. T raditionally, academics label cultural groups as folk cul-tures or as part of popular culture. The idea is that the folk 
culture is small, incorporates a homogeneous population, is typically rural, and is cohesive in cultural traits, whereas popular culture is large, incorporates heterogeneous pop-ulations, is typically urban, and experiences quickly chang-ing cultural traits. Instead of using this polarity of folk and popular cultures, some academics now see folk and popular cultures as ends of a continuum, deﬁ  ning most cultures as ﬁ tting somewhere between folk and popular.
We ﬁ  nd folk culture to be a limiting concept because 
it requires us to create a list of characteristics and look for cultures that meet the list. This methodology of deﬁ  ning 
folk cultures leaves much to be desired. Once we have our list of characteristics, we must ask ourselves, are the Amish a folk culture? Are the Navajo a folk culture? And it is in this very process that we get frustrated with the concept of folk culture. It is not how we academics deﬁ  ne a culture 
that matters, it is how the people deﬁ  ne themselves that counts.
We are interested in questions such as: do the Amish 
have a group identity, and what cultural practices do they share? How do the Amish navigate through popular culture and defend their local customs? Why do a group of Americans in a small town identify themselves as Swedish Americans and hold festivals to commemorate important Swedish holidays, while other Swedish Americans in other parts of the country function completely unaware of the Swedish holidays? Why do certain ethnic holidays such as St. Patrick’s Day transcend ethnicity to be celebrated as a part of popular culture?
In this chapter, we chose to use the concept of local cul-
ture rather than folk culture. A local culture is a group of peo-ple in a particular place who see themselves as a collective or a community, who share experiences, customs, and traits, and who work to preserve those traits and customs in order to claim uniqueness and to distinguish themselves from others.The variety of ways people choose to accept, reject, 
or alter the diffusion of popular cultural practices is remarkable. Some local cultures rely primarily on religion to maintain their belief systems, others rely on commu-nity celebrations or on family structures, and still others on a lack of interaction with other cultures.
Local cultures are constantly redeﬁ  ning or reﬁ  ning 
themselves based on interactions with other cultures (local and popular) and diffusion of cultural practices (local and popular). Local cultures also affect places by establishing neighborhoods, building churches or community centers to celebrate important days, and expressing their material and nonmaterial cultures in certain places.
The material culture of a group of people includes 
things they construct, such as art, houses, clothing, sports, dance, and foods. Nonmaterial culture includes beliefs, practices, aesthetics (what they see as attractive), and val-ues of a group of people. What members of a local culture produce in their material culture reﬂ  ects the beliefs and 
values of their nonmaterial culture.
Unlike local cultures, which are found in relatively 
small areas, popular culture is ubiquitous and can change in a matter of days or hours. Popular culture is practiced by a het-erogeneous group of people: people across identities and across the world. Like local culture, popular culture encom-passes music, dance, clothing, food preferences, religious practices, and aesthetic values. The main paths of diffusion of popular culture are the transportation, marketing, and com-munication networks that interlink vast parts of the world (see Chapter 14 for further discussion of these networks).
Fashions diffuse incredibly quickly today. When Kate 
Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, graced Westminster Abbey in a lace wedding gown designed by Sarah Burton for the House of Alexander McQueen at an estimated cost of $65,000, dress designers around the world interpreted or copied the gown within hours (Fig. 4.2). Fewer than ten hours after the wedding aired at 5:30 a .m. Eastern Time, 
dress designers at Kleinfeld Bridal Salon in New Y ork had replicated Middleton’s dress, and they started selling it for $3500 within 48 hours.
In popular culture, fashion trends spread quite quickly 
through the interconnected world; it is a classic case of hierarchical diffusion. Hierarchical diffusion can occur through a hierarchy of places. The hierarchy in the fashion world typically begins with the runways of major fashion houses in world cities, including London, Milan, Paris, and 
c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 114  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 114  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
New Y ork, which act as the hearth, the point of origin. The 
next tier of places includes ﬂ  agship stores for the fashion house and editorial headquarters of fashion magazines, also located in global cities. Department store brands interpret the runway fashions for consumption by a larger audience, and the suburban mall receives the innovation. Hierarchical  What Are Local and Popular Cultures? 115
diffusion can also occur through a hierarchy of people. In this case, a designer is the hearth, models are the next tier, celebrities and editors and writers of major magazines fol-low, and subscribers to fashion magazines follow in close order. Finally, anyone walking through a shopping mall can become a “knower” in the diffusion of a fashion innovation.
We do not see local and popular cultures as being ends 
of a continuum; rather, we see both operating on the same plane, affecting people and places in different ways across different scales. For example, you may go to a major depart-ment store, such as T arget or Wal-Mart and see Hutterites or Mennonites dressed in distinctive local clothing in the midst of the ultimate in popular culture: a major interna-tional department store. T raditions, such as painting henna on one’s hands or practicing mystical Kabbalah beliefs, are carried from centuries-old customs of local cultures to the global popular culture through a popular culture icon or through the corporations (such as the media industry) that work to construct popular culture (Fig. 4.3).

116 Chapter 4  Local Culture, Popular Culture, and Cultural Landscapes
Both local cultures and popular cultures are con-
stantly navigating through a barrage of customs diffused 
from each other and across scales, through a complex of political and economic forces that shape and limit their practices, and through global communications and trans-portation networks that intricately link certain parts of the world and distance others.
In this chapter, we focus on how local cultures are 
sustained despite the onslaught of popular culture, how popular culture diffuses and is practiced in unique ways in localities of the world, and how local and popular cultures are imprinted on the cultural landscape.
Employing the concept of hierarchical diffusion, describe how you became a “knower” of your favorite kind of music—where is its hearth, and how did it reach you?
HOW ARE LOCAL CULTURES SUSTAINED?
During the 1800s and into the 1900s, the U.S. gov-
ernment had an ofﬁ  cial policy of assimilation. It wanted to assimilate indigenous peoples into the dominant cul-ture in order to make American Indians into “Americans” rather than “Indians.” Canadians, Australians, Russians, and other colonial powers adopted similar policies toward indigenous peoples, using schools, churches, and govern-ment agents to discourage native practices. In the United States, the federal government forced tribal members to settle in one place and to farm rather than hunt or ﬁ  sh. 
Public and missionary school teachers punished tribal members for using their native language.
Government agents rewarded the Indians they 
deemed most “American” with citizenship and paid jobs. The federal government even employed East Coast women from 1888 until 1938 to live on reservations and show the native women how to be “good housewives” by teaching them Victorian ways of cooking, cleaning, and sewing.
T oday, several churches and governments have apol-
ogized for assimilation policies. In 2008, the governments of Australia and Canada each ofﬁ  cially apologized to their 
indigenous populations: Aboriginals in Australia and First Nations and Inuit in Canada.
The Australian Parliament unanimously passed a 
motion stating, “We apologize for the laws and policies of successive parliaments and governments that have inﬂ icted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our 
fellow Australians.” Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologized speciﬁ  cally for the government’s 
policy of taking Aboriginal children from their homes and placing them in residential schools—a policy that lasted from the 1800s until the late 1960s.
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper likewise 
cited the disastrous outcomes of the assimilation policies in his apology to Canada’s 1.3 million indigenous people. Prime Minister Harper apologized for the abuse and the lasting negative effects of Canada’s residential schools, stating: “We now recognize that it was wrong to separate children from rich and vibrant cultures and traditions, that it created a void in many lives and communities, and we apologize for having done this. We now recognize that, in separating children from their families, we undermined the ability of many to adequately parent their own children and sowed the seeds for generations to follow.” Speaking to the indigenous people seated in the House of Commons, he continued, “Not only did you suffer these abuses as children, but as you became parents, you were powerless to protect your own children from suffering the same experi-ence, and for this we are sorry.”
The United States government has not formally apol-
ogized to American Indians for the policy of assimilation. American Indians in the United States are working to push back assimilation and popular culture by reviving the cus-toms of their local cultures. Many tribes are teaching younger generations their language, reviving their tradi-tional religion, and eating the foods and herbs of their lands, the foods and herbs on which their ancestors depended.
Local cultures are sustained through customs. A cus-
tom is a practice that a group of people routinely follows. People have customs regarding all parts of their lives, from eating and drinking to dancing and sports. T o sustain a local culture, the people must retain their customs. The customs change in small ways over time, but they are main-tained despite the onslaught of popular culture.
Researcher Simon Harrison recognizes that local 
cultural groups purposefully and often fervently deﬁ  ne 
themselves as unique, creating boundaries around their culture and distinguishing themselves from other local cultures. In the age of globalization, where popular cul-ture changes quickly and diffuses rapidly, Harrison ﬁ  nds 
that local cultures typically have two goals: keeping other cultures out and keeping their own culture in.
For example, a local culture can create a boundary 
around itself and try to keep other cultures out in order to avoid “contamination and extinction.” Harrison uses the example of the Notting Hill carnival in London to describe how Londoners from the West Indies (the Caribbean) claimed the festival as their own, in conjunc-tion with an increasing sense of collective West Indies cul-tural identity. The festival did not begin as a West Indies celebration, but as people from the West Indies shared experiences of “unemployment, police harassment and poor housing conditions” during the 1970s, they began to deﬁ ne themselves as a local culture and redeﬁ  ned the fes-
tival as a West Indian celebration.c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 116  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 116  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
A local culture can also work to avoid cultural 
appropriation, the process by which other cultures adopt 
customs and knowledge and use them for their own bene-ﬁ t. Harrison explains that cultural appropriation is a 
major concern for local cultures because people outside the local culture often privatize the cultural knowledge of a local culture, such as natural pharmaceuticals or musical expression, to accumulate wealth or prestige. Local cul-tures can thus work to keep their customs and knowledge to themselves, to avoid cultural appropriation.
Around the world, local cultures desire to keep popular 
culture out, keep their culture intact, and maintain control over customs and knowledge. Geographers also recognize that through these actions, places become increasingly important. When deﬁ  ning a place (such as a town or neighborhood) or a space for a short amount of time (such as an annual festival) as quintessentially representing the local culture’s values, mem-bers of a local culture reinforce their culture and their beliefs.
Rural Local Cultures
Members of local cultures in rural areas often have an eas-ier time maintaining their cultures because of their isola-tion. By living together in a rural area, members of a local culture can more easily keep external inﬂ  uences on the 
outside. It is no accident that we ﬁ  nd Anabaptist groups, 
such as the Hutterites, the Amish, and the Mennonites, living in rural areas of South Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, respectively.
 Figure 4.4

© Erin H. Fouberg.For the past ﬁ  ve centuries, many Anabaptist groups 
have migrated to rural areas beyond these three states (often 
ﬂ eeing persecution) with the expressed purpose of living apart 
and staying together. During the Protestant Reformation, Anabaptists broke from both the Catholic Church and the new Protestant churches. Followers of the new religion were called Anabaptists, meaning baptized again, because of their belief in adult baptism, despite having been baptized as infants in the Protestant or Catholic religions.
Anabaptists broke from the state as well as the church; 
they stressed paciﬁ  sm and soon suffered persecution. Fleeing persecution, Anabaptists migrated east to Moravia and Austria, and then to Russia and the Ukraine. Continually moving to rural areas to live apart, alone, and avoid persecu-tion, a group of Anabaptists called the Hutterites, named for leader Jacob Hutter, eventually migrated to North America in the second half of the 1800s.
Old Order Anabaptist groups are shown in stereo-
typical ways in the popular media, but major differences exist across Old Order Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites, and Brethren. The Hutterites are the only Anabaptist group who live communally (Fig. 4.4). Rather than living with immediate family on a farmstead, Hutterites live in colonies of about 100 people, with individuals ranging in age from infant to elderly. More than 425 colonies are located in Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Saskatchewan, Montana, and Alberta (Fig. 4.5). In their book On the Backroad to Heaven, Donald Kraybill and Carl 
Bowman explain that the lynchpin of each colony is the  How Are Local Cultures Sustained? 117c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 117  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 117  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401

Hutterite religion. Members of the colony join together 
every night for a 30-minute service as well as on Sundays. The most prominent position in a colony is held by the minister, who speaks in archaic German, reading sermons written in the sixteenth century.
Unlike the Amish, Hutterites readily accept tech-
nologies that help them in their agricultural pursuits. Hutterite colonies were generally slow to accept technol-ogies such as cameras and cell phones out of concern that they would encourage individualistic behaviors or under-mine the Hutterite religion. T oday, it is relatively com-mon for young adult Hutterites to use Internet dating sites designed for their local culture to ﬁ  nd suitable mar-
riage partners in colonies in other states or countries.Colonies assign separate jobs and tasks to men and 
women, which reinforces a patriarchal social structure. Kraybill and Bowman explain that marriages happen across colonies, and women move to their husband’s colony after marrying. If a Hutterite woman from Alberta meets a Hutterite man from North Dakota through an Internet dating site, and they eventually decide to marry, the Canadian woman will move to the United States. As a result, a single colony is usually composed of only one or two surnames. Moving to their husband’s colony perpetu-ates women’s weak political position in the colony. Women are expected to rear many children, averaging ﬁ  ve or six currently, but the colony as a whole is responsible for rais-ing and disciplining the child.HUDSON

Hutterite colonies specialize in diversiﬁ  ed agricul-
ture, raising feed, food, and livestock on up to 10,000 acres. 
Hutterite men often barter with neighboring farmers to ﬁ  x 
machinery, trade goods, and lend help. The minister and other male leaders in the colony work with lawyers and bankers to keep the colony corporation operating smoothly and proﬁ  tably. The most economically successful colonies have created products used in agriculture that they produce in their shops and sell to other farmers. One colony pro-duces stainless steel animal feeders, and another markets its own animal feed. Some colonies also invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in computerized milking systems for their dairy operations, computerized systems for feeding and raising hogs, or even in livestock processing plants.
Groups of Mennonites migrated from the East Coast 
of the United States in search of rural farmland. Geographer Dawn Bowen traced the migration of Mennonites, ﬁ  nding 
their desire to farm in rural areas leading them to the north-ern reaches of Alberta, Canada, to turn forestlands into farmlands and as far away as Bolivia to ﬁ  nd a place where they can farm, form their own schools, and practice their religion without pervasive pressures from popular culture. Rurality enables local cultures to deﬁ  ne their own space, to create a place, town, or rural landscape that reﬂ  ects their 
values, and to practice customs relatively unfettered.
Historically, the economic activities of American 
Indian tribes, such as whale or bison hunting, salmon ﬁ  sh-
ing, or growing wild rice, were the focal point of daily life, and numerous customs and festivals revolved around it. In the early 1800s in North America, Plains Indians tribes migrated during the year based on the bison; they made tools, shelter, and clothing out of the bison, and held dances and ceremonies that surrounded the bison hunt. When a local culture discontinues its major economic activity, it faces the challenge of maintaining the customs that depended on the economic activity and, in turn, sustaining its culture. T oday, when a local culture decides to reengage in a traditional economic activity or other cultural custom, it can no longer decide in isolation. The tribe must navigate through varying opinions among its members, limitations imposed by governments, and perceptions of other cultures.
The Makah American Indians
In the late 1990s, the Makah American Indians of Neah Bay, Washington, did what environmentalists considered unthinkable: they reinstated the whale hunt. The Makah hunted whales for 1500 years, but the United States gov-ernment stopped them in the 1920s because the gray whale had become endangered. In 1994, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) removed the east-ern North Paciﬁ  c gray whale from the endangered list.
In 1999, when the Makah reinstated the whale hunt, 
tribal members interviewed by journalists spoke to their traditional culture as their reason for returning to the whale hunt (Fig. 4.6). They needed to return to their past,  How Are Local Cultures Sustained? 119

they said, to understand their ancestors, to re-create and 
solidify their local culture. In the midst of a popular cul-ture onslaught, the Makah sought refuge in their past.
Although the Makah wanted to hunt whales as their 
ancestors did, their 1999 hunts took place in a completely different context than that of a century before. This time, the Makah hunted whales under the watchful eye of the International Whaling Commission; they faced numer-ous protests by Green Peace and local environmentalists; and they found themselves in federal court with the George W. Bush administration on their side supporting the reinstatement of the whale hunt.
The Makah wanted to hunt with their traditional 
canoes and harpoons because they wanted to hunt as the tribe’s elders and ancestors did. However, in the context of the twentieth and twenty-ﬁ  rst centuries, the choice of tools for the Makah’s hunt was not up to them alone. Actors at the regional, national, and global scale inﬂ  uenced not only 
whether the Makah could hunt whales but also the methods they used in their hunt. The International Whaling Commission dictated that the Makah hunt gray whales with a.50 caliber riﬂ  e, arguing the riﬂ  e would kill the whale more quickly and humanely than the harpoons their ancestors used. In May 1999 the Makah hunted and killed a gray whale, using a.50 caliber riﬂ  e. Soon after, the Makah whale hunt was put on hold, as cases calling for a cessation of the hunt made their way through the courts. In 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court decided the Makah must submit a waiver request of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and in 2005 the Makah did so. As of April 2011, the Makah’s request was still under review by the Northwest Regional Ofﬁ  ce of NOAA.
American Indians are not the only Americans look-
ing to the customs of their ancestors to reinvigorate their local cultures. Throughout the rural United States, small towns were built by immigrants from Europe, and many local cultures have deﬁ  ned entire small towns as places to maintain their culture and to teach others about their cus-toms and beliefs.
Little Sweden, U.S.A.
The residents of Lindsborg, Kansas, proclaim their town Little Sweden, U.S.A. Geographer Steven Schnell asked why a town of 3300, which a few decades ago had little or no sign of Swedishness on its landscape, transformed itself into a place where Swedish culture is celebrated every day in gift stores on Main Street and in buffets in restaurants (Fig. 4.7).
Cynics would argue the reason is purely economic, but 
there is more to it than that. Certainly, Lindsborg beneﬁ  ts 
economically from tourists who ﬂ  ock to buy Swedish trinkets and celebrate Swedish festivals. Nonetheless, as Schnell found on a daily basis the people of Lindsborg beneﬁ  t from 
promoting a sense of a shared history and a common place in this world. In the 1930s, the townspeople shared stories about the roles of Swedes in American history and the importance of their Swedishness to Lindsborg. From that base, the townspeople began to celebrate their Swedish heritage in the 1950s, highlighting the “everyday existence” (the local cul-ture) of the Swedes who immigrated to Lindsborg. During festivals today, the townspeople, whether Swedish or not, dress up in the peasant clothes Swedish immigrants wore in the 1800s. Geographer James Shortridge refers to this as neolocalism, seeking out the regional culture and reinvigo-rating it in response to the uncertainty of the modern world.
The Makah, the Hutterites, and the people of 
Lindsborg have something in common: each is inundated with a pulsating popular culture that challenges their place in the world. Each has chosen to maintain or reconnect with its local culture. For the Hutterites, the goal is to maintain what they have, to adopt only those technologies that advance their agricultural pursuits and ban those that chal-lenge their religion. Central concerns for the Makah include thinking in their own language, embracing their history, and coming to know who they are despite what others have done to subvert their identity. The people of Lindsborg seek to celebrate the Swedish immigrants who made the place unique and connect with others around them.
Urban Local Cultures
Some local cultures have successfully built a world apart, a place to practice their customs, within a major city by con-structing tight-knit ethnic neighborhoods. Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn, New Y ork, and Italian Americans in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts, maintain their dis-tinct local cultures in urban environments.
Runners of the New Y ork City Marathon can see the 
ethnic neighborhoods of New Y ork City’s boroughs ﬁ  rst-
hand. Running through Brooklyn, they pass through a predominantly Mexican neighborhood full of Mexican ﬂ ags and mariachi bands, followed in sharp contrast by a 
Hasidic Jewish neighborhood with streets lined with men and boys on one side and women and girls on another all dressed in clothes modeled after eighteenth-century Russian and Polish fashions (Fig. 4.8).
In the North End of Boston, the Italian community 
still celebrates the feast days of Italian saints. T welve reli-gious societies, each focusing on an Italian saint, hold festi-vals between June and September. Members of the society march through the North End holding a statue of their saint, collecting money and adorning the saint with it. The Romaband, an Italian band that has been in existence since 1919, leads each society through the streets of the North End. The march ends with a street celebration, including vendors selling everything from fried calamari to hot dogs.
Having their own ethnic neighborhood enables mem-
bers of a local culture in an urban area to set themselves apart and practice their customs. Schools, houses of wor-ship, food stores, and clothing stores all support the aesthet-ics and desires of members of the local culture.

challenge to local cultures in cities is the migration of mem-
bers of the popular culture or another local culture or ethnic group into their neighborhood. The local cultures in Brooklyn and the North End work to maintain their culture and customs as young artists and professionals move into their respective neighborhoods. Rents and housing costs are climbing in each neighborhood, and the cultural landscapes are starting to reﬂ  ect the neighborhood’s new residents. A new arts community is inundating the Hasidic neighbor-hood of Brooklyn called Williamsburg. T oday, you will ﬁ  nd 
art galleries, artistically painted old warehouses converted into residences, and even a new brewery. In Boston’s North End, young professionals are taking advantage of the neigh-borhood’s favorable location, choosing apartments in the North End so they can walk to their jobs in the city center. T oday, you will ﬁ  nd apartments being renovated to appeal to the North End’s newest residents.Local Cultures and Cultural Appropriation
Local cultures, whether rural or urban, often ﬁ  nd them-
selves trying to keep their customs for themselves, to pre-vent others from appropriating their customs for eco-nomic beneﬁ  t. Anthropologists and geographers have 
studied how others are using local cultural knowledge, customs, and even names. For example, the estate of Crazy Horse (a Lakota Indian leader) sued a brewery that produced Crazy Horse beer.
The process through which something (a name, a 
good, an idea, or even a person) that previously was not regarded as an object to be bought or sold becomes an object that can be bought, sold, and traded in the world market is called commodiﬁ  cation. One need look no 
further than eBay to see commodiﬁ  cation. Newspapers 
frequently report on bizarre objects, such as a wafﬂ  e

Lindsborg, Kansas
Lindsborg, Kansas, founded by Swedish Luther-
ans in 1869, has remade itself in recent decades as “Little Sweden, U.S.A.” Swedish gift shops, restaurants, and ethnic festivals, along with faux-Swedish storefronts, all attract visitors interested in the Swedish American heritage. Here you see a Dala horse, a traditional Swedish folk craft that has been adopted as the town symbol. Note, too, the Swedish and American ﬂ ags ﬂ  ying in the background. Most visitors to 
the town assume one of two things: either the town is an island of nineteenth-century culture passed on unchanged for generations, or it is a crock of Disneyesque fakery cooked up to draw in gullible tourists. The fascination of ﬁ  eldwork 
is that it undermines any such simpliﬁ  cations. I 
found ethnicity here to be complex, quirky, ever-changing, and very much a part of the people’s lives. Swedishness in Lindsborg has been invented and reinvented time and time again through the decades, as people con-stantly look for answers to that most basic of questions: who am I?

purportedly half eaten by President Barack Obama, 
being commodiﬁ  ed in Internet space.
Commodiﬁ  cation affects local cultures in numerous 
ways. First, their material culture, their jewelry and clothing, their food and games, can be commodiﬁ  ed by themselves or by nonmembers. Similarly, their nonmaterial culture, their religion, language, and beliefs, can be commodiﬁ  ed, often by nonmembers selling local spiritual and herbal cures for ail-ments. Local cultures may be commodiﬁ  ed as a whole, with tourist buses “observing” the Amish culture of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, or trekking with “traditional” Nepalese guides on spiritual journeys through the Himalayas.
When commodiﬁ  cation occurs, the question of 
authenticity follows. When local cultures or customs are commodiﬁ  ed, usually one image or experience is typecast 
as the “authentic” image or experience of that culture, and it is that image or experience that the tourist or buyer desires. However, local cultures are dynamic, and places and people change over time. T o gain an “authentic” sense of place, people need to experience the complexity of a place directly rather than the stereotype of a place. An “authentic” local culture does not ﬁ  t into a single experi-
ence or image; rather, an “authentic” local culture is one that is complex and not stereotyped.
The act of stereotyping local culture is quite confusing 
for the members of the local culture because rarely is there consensus that all things must be done in one traditional way. T ourists in Lancaster County, for example, may be dis-appointed to see some Amish driving tractors across their ﬁ elds. European, Canadian, American, or Australian trek-
kers in Nepal desire the same “authentic” experience that a travel pamphlet shows when trekking across the Himalayas.

Authenticity of Places
During the process of colonization, Europeans tagged the 
cultures they encountered as either savage or mystic. “Authentic” tourist destinations are designed to exploit the mystical in local cultures. A South African theme park, The Lost City (built on the site of the resort Sun City), capitalizes on mystical images of Africa described in a legend, thereby “freez-
ing” the continent to a time that never existed (Fig. 4.9).
A local culture need not be “mystical” in order to cre-
ate an authentic place. The city of Branson, Missouri, is capitalizing on a local culture in the Ozarks that melds a number of people and perceptions in one place so that tour-ists can consume the place. Geographer Johnathan Bascom studied the processes by which the city of Branson has effec-tively tapped its local customs, such as food preferences, his-tory, and music, to create an “authentic” identity for Branson that sets it apart from neighboring towns. Branson becomes “authentic,” and surrounding towns that try to capitalize on their rural, country heritage become “copies.”
Guinness and the Irish Pub Company
Theme parks and entertainment venues overtly choose a stereotype and perpetuate it, but a discerning tourist or consumer may be aware of what is occurring. Often, the act of corporations commodifying the mystique of local cultures to drive proﬁ  ts is less obvious to the consumer. The Guinness Brewing Company of Dublin, Ireland, cre-ated a business plan nearly 20 years ago aimed at capital-izing on the global mystique of the traditional Irish pub. Guinness saw the sales of its stout beer declining in Ireland and the United Kingdom and decided to go global.
Guinness formed a partnership with the Irish Pub 
Company, which has ofﬁ  ces in Dublin, Atlanta, the United Arab Emirates, and Australia. The Irish Pub Company studied traditional Irish pubs and created ﬁ  ve 
Irish pub prototypes—including Irish Country Cottage, Victorian Dublin, traditional pub, Gaelic (based on what pubs would have looked like had they existed over 2000 years ago in Ireland), and Irish Brewery. For exam-ple, a hotel owner in Naples, Florida, or a businessper-son in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (Fig. 4.10) works  How Are Local Cultures Sustained? 123

Along with the pub, the Irish Pub Company provides food recommendations, training, music sug-gestions, and notably, Irish bartenders trained in their Dublin “pub school.” The Irish Pub Company also sells bric-a-brac (Irish antiques and reproductions) to give the place the feel of an Irish pub.

“The Dingle Peninsula in Ireland was long one of 
the more remote parts of the country, and even its largest town, Dingle, was primarily an agricul-tural village just a few decades ago. As I walked through the streets of town, I noticed the color-ful inns and houses of the older town. The ‘Little Bridge Pub’ on the corner of this intersection in the older town is an ‘authentic’ pub, the kind that the Irish Pub Company works to replicate.”

The commodiﬁ  cation of local customs freezes cus-
toms in place and time for consumption, with claims of “authenticity” abounding. The search for “authentic” local cultures implies an effort to identify peoples who are seemingly untouched by change or external inﬂ  u-
ence. However, all local cultures (rural and urban) are dynamic, and all have been touched by external inﬂ  u-
ences throughout their existence (Fig. 4.12). The search for an “authentic” local culture merely perpetuates myths about local cultures. Members of local cultures are constantly renegotiating their place in this world and making sense of who they are in the midst of the popular culture onslaught.
What is the last place you went to or the last product you purchased that claimed to be “authentic?” What are the challenges of defending the authenticity of this place or product while refuting the authenticity of other similar places or products?HOW IS POPULAR CULTURE DIFFUSED?
Extraordinary changes have occurred since 1900 in 
the time it takes for people, innovations, and ideas to dif-fuse around the globe. The innovation of agriculture took nearly 10,000 years to diffuse around the world. In much more recent times, the diffusion of developments such as the printing press or the Industrial Revolution was mea-sured over the course of 100 years or more.
During the twentieth century, however, the pace of 
diffusion shrank to months, weeks, days, and in some cases even hours. Simultaneously, the spatial extent of diffusion has expanded, so that more and more parts of the Earth’s surface are affected by ideas and innovations from faraway places. For example, the social networking site Facebook, which Mark Zuckerberg launched in 2004, passed 500 mil-lion subscribers worldwide in 2010 and adds many new members each day. Canada grew from 2 million to 7 mil-lion Facebook subscribers in 2007, and by 2010, had over 15 million subscribers, accounting for 45.48 percent of the population. With enough subscribers to be the third most populated country in the world, and with instant communi-cation, news travels quickly through the Facebook network.
The map of Facebook users (Fig. 4.13) highlights 
the interconnectedness of individuals around the world, and it also points out the lack of interconnection between c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 126  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 126  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401

individuals in China and North Korea with the rest of the 
world via this social media tool. In 2009, China banned Facebook, T witter, and Google. Only about one-third of China’s 1.3 billion people have Internet access. Chinese who want to use Facebook have to use proxy servers to get around the government’s ban. Chinese social networks have grown in place of Facebook. In 2011, the social net-work Renren boasted 165 million Chinese users.In 2005 and 2006, Chinese entrepreneur Wang Xing 
launched the Chinese social network Xiaonei (“on cam-pus”), which copied Facebook down to the color scheme. Wang sold Xiaonei in 2006 for $4 million. Oak Paciﬁ  c 
Interactive got a steal, as the company is estimated to be worth several billion dollars today. They renamed the site Renren, which means “everybody” (Fig. 4.14). Renren is not merely a copy of Facebook, however. Renren is credited

with innovating social gaming and advertising. In fact, the 
popular Facebook game FarmVille launched a year after HappyFarmer launched on Renren. Advertisers, including Lay’s, pay to place their products in Renren’s games. In HappyFarmer, a player can plant Lay’s potatoes and take them to a Lay’s potato chip factory.
China allows Renren and its competitor, Kaixin001, 
to operate because they have agreed to the political cen-sorship mandated by the Chinese government. For exam-ple, according to Fast Company, Renren censors “a range of sensitive keywords, including terms related to the Dalai Lama, the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and Chinese dissidents including 2010 Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo.” Renren users report that they receive a warning message when they update their status or post a comment that is censored by Renren.
Controlling information ﬂ  ow is increasingly difﬁ  cult 
in China, and many argue that despite being censored, Renren and its competitors allow for freer ﬂ  ow of ideas 
than previously possible in communist China. 
T ransportation and communication technologies 
have altered distance decay. No longer does a map with a bull’s-eye surrounding the hearth of an innovation describe how quickly the innovation will diffuse to areas around it (Fig. 4.15 top). Rather, what geographer David Harvey called time–space compression explains how quickly innovations diffuse and refers to how interlinked two places are through transportation and communica-tion technologies (Fig. 4.15 bottom).
In the past few decades, major world cities have 
become much closer to each other as a result of modern 
technologies, including airplanes, high-speed trains, express-ways, wireless connections, fax machines, e-mail, and tele-phone. Places that lack transportation and communications technologies are now more removed from interconnected places than ever. All of the new technologies create the infrastructure through which innovations diffuse. Because the technologies link some places more closely than others, ideas diffuse through interconnected places rapidly rather than diffusing at constant rates across similar distances.
Hearths of Popular Culture
Popular culture diffuses hierarchically in the context of time–space compression, with diffusion happening most rapidly across the most compressed spaces. As we saw in the last section, even local customs practiced for centuries in one place can be swept up into popular culture. How does a custom, idea, song, or object become part of popular cul-ture? It is relatively easy to follow the communications, transportation, and marketing networks that account for the diffusion of popular culture, but how do we ﬁ  nd the 
hearths of popular culture, and how do certain places estab-lish themselves as the hearths of popular culture? Figure 4.15a, b
Distance Decay and Time–Space Compression. With 
distance decay, the likelihood of diffusion decreases as time and distance from the hearth increases. With time–space compres-sion, the likelihood of diffusion depends on the connectedness (in communications and transportation technologies) among places.

 How Is Popular Culture Diffused? 129
Establishing a Hearth
All aspects of popular culture—music, sports, television, 
and dance—have a hearth, a place of origin. T ypically, a hearth begins with contagious diffusion: developers of an idea or innovation may ﬁ  nd they have followers who dress as they do or listen to the music they play. A multitude of American musical groups (REM, Hootie and the Blowﬁ  sh, 
Vertical Horizon) began as college bands or in college towns. They play a few sets in a campus bar or at a campus party and gain followers. The group starts to play to bars and campuses in nearby college towns, and soon they sell self-made compact discs at their concerts.
Bands that begin on college campuses or in college 
towns and build from their base typically follow the path of building a hearth for their sound’s diffusion ﬁ  rst through 
contagious diffusion and then through hierarchical diffu-sion. College towns like Athens, Georgia, Burlington, Vermont, Seattle, Washington, and Charlottesville, Virginia, are the perfect nesting spaces for new bands. The Dave Matthews Band created and perfected their sound in Charlottesville, Virginia, in the early 1990s. Lead singer and guitarist Dave Matthews was born in South Africa and landed in Charlottesville as a young adult after living in Johannesburg, New Y ork, and London (Fig. 4.16).
Matthews was a bartender at Miller’s in Charlottesville 
when he met Ross Hoffman, a local songwriter who men-tored Matthews in song writing. The Dave Matthews Band was formed when Matthews invited Carter Beuford (drums), LeRoi Moore (saxophone, who died in 2008), Stefan Lessard (bass), and Boyd Tinsley (violin) to join him in creating a demo of some of his songs. The Dave Matthews Band’s ﬁ  rst live show was in Charlottesville on Earth Day in April 1991. The band played bars throughout the Charlottesville area from 1991 through 1993. Manager Coran Capshaw followed the path of diffusion carved by the Grateful Dead and Phish, through a grassroots cam-paign of word of mouth (contagious diffusion).
Hierarchical diffusion of the band soon followed, 
through the hierarchy of college towns in the United States (Fig. 4.17). The Dave Matthews Band played 200 nights a year in fraternities, sororities, bars, and clubs throughout the American Southeast, following the same circuit as college band Hootie and the Blowﬁ  sh. The 
band encouraged fans to record their music and send it to friends, helping to establish audiences for the band in college towns far removed from Charlottesville.
Their ﬁ  rst album, released in 1993, was on the 
band’s own independent label. It hit the college charts, and a union with RCA soon followed with their second album, Under the T able and Dreaming, released in 1994. As 
Entertainment magazine explained in 1995, “By playing nearly 200 gigs a year and releasing their own CDs, they built up such a zealous following that when Under the T able entered the album chart at No. 34, neither MTV nor most of America had even heard of them.” The band’s ﬁ rst video was not released until three months after the 
song “What Would Y ou Say” hit the Billboard charts.
The band became broadly popular after 1995 and 
began playing large arenas throughout the United States and in Australia. The band continues to rely on its fan base for support. Manager Capshaw and the Dave Matthews Band were early adopters of using the Internet to stay connected with fans. T oday, the ofﬁ  cial Dave Matthews 
Band fan club has over 80,000 online members, each of whom pays $35 a year to belong.
The music of groups such as the Dave Matthews 
Band, Phish, Grateful Dead, and Jimmy Buffet also dif-fuses relocationally, as fans follow the musicians along their concert routes, living in their cars and selling tie-died shirts and beaded necklaces out of the backs of their cars in the parking lots of concert venues. The action of following the bands for years (an estimated 500 to 1000 fans traveled to every Grateful Dead concert) leads fans to create their own customs and culture. Like other acts of pilgrimage (see Chapter 7 on religion), environmental effects can be grave. Prior to their ﬁ  nal concert, Phish 
(breaking up for the second time) used their website to plead to fans to leave their beloved rural Vermont as they found it. T oday, Reverb, a nonproﬁ  t organization, helps 
bands, including the Dave Matthews Band, create envi-ronmentally conscious concerts by having bands purchase carbon offset credits for each of their concerts, supporting

up Reverb Eco-Villages at concert venues to encourage eco-friendly behaviors among fans.
Manufacturing a Hearth
The question of whether a college band “makes it” depends greatly on the choices and actions of record pro-ducers and music media corporate giants. Certain corpo-rations, such as Viacom, the parent company of MTV , generate and produce popular culture, pushing innova-tions in popular culture through the communications infrastructure that links them with the rest of the world. Geographer Clayton Rosati studied the infrastructure of MTV and its role in the production of popular culture and geographies of popular culture. In his study, he found that MTV produces popular culture by opening globalized spaces to local culture, thereby globalizing the local. Rosati explained that “MTV’s incorporation of rap music and Hip Hop expressive forms into its pro-duction since 1997” helped produce music celebrities and opened the MTV space to “artists and forms that were often formerly relegated to street corners, block parties and mixtapes—broadening the uniﬁ  cation of 
popular aspirations with the machinery of the industrial production of culture.”
A 2001 documentary produced by PBS entitled 
The Merchants of Cool looks at the roles corporations and marketing agencies play in creating popular culture. By conducting focus groups with teenagers (the main demographic for innovations in popular culture), by amassing enormous databases of what teenagers do and like, by sending “cool hunters” (“cool” kids themselves) out to talk with other “cool” kids about what is “cool,” and by rummaging through teenagers’ bedrooms (as Rosati noted MTV does for casting its reality shows), MTV and marketing companies are creating what is cool, what is new in popular culture. In the process of producing The Merchants of Cool, producers interviewed 
Sharon Lee, one of the founding partners of Look-Look, a research company specializing in youth culture. Lee explained how trends in popular culture are spread from the hearth:
Actually it’s a triangle. At the top of the triangle there’s the innovator, which is like two to three percent of the population. Underneath them is the trend-setter, which we would say is about 17 percent. And what they do is they pick up on ideas that the innovators are doing and they kind of claim them as their own. Underneath them is an early adopter, which is questionable exactly what their percentage is, but they kind of are the layer above mainstream, which is about 80 percent. And what they do is they take what the trend-setter is doing and they make it palatable for mass consumption. They take it, they tweak it, they make it more acceptable, and that’s

 How Is Popular Culture Diffused? 131
when the mass consumer picks up on it and runs with it 
and then it actually kills it.
This description is a perfect story of the hierarchical dif-fusion of traits and trends in popular culture.
With these kinds of infrastructure behind the pro-
duction of popular culture, we may expect popular cul-ture to act as a blanket, evenly covering the globe. Even as popular culture has diffused throughout the world, it has not blanketed the world, hiding all existing local cultures underneath it. Rather, one aspect of popular culture (such as music or food) will take on new forms when it encounters a new locality and the people and local culture in that place. Geographers and anthropol-ogists call this the reterritorialization of popular cul-ture: a term referring to a process in which people start to produce an aspect of popular culture themselves, doing so in the context of their local culture and place, and making it their own.
Reterritorialization of Hip Hop
Hip Hop and rap grew out of the inner cities of New Y ork and Los Angeles during the 1980s and 1990s. Places such as Compton (Los Angeles) and the Bronx and Harlem (New Y ork) came to represent the hearths of Hip Hop. These neighborhoods as well as places in Detroit and Atlanta that later served as the basis for the Midwestern and Southern hearths became the authentic spaces of Hip Hop and rap. Neighborhood venues became the best place to enjoy an authentic perfor-mance, and the lyrics reﬂ  ected the importance of local places to the music itself.
The Hip Hop from these hearths diffused abroad, 
especially to major cities in Europe. MC Solaar (Fig. 4.18), Die Fantastischen Vier, and Jovanotti each made Hip Hop their own by writing music that connected with the youth of their country (France, Germany, and Italy, respectively). As Hip Hop diffused throughout Europe, it mixed with existing local cultures, experiences, and places, reterritori-alizing the music to each locale.
In Southeast Asia, Indonesia serves as a good exam-
ple of the process of reterritorialization. Imported Hip Hop diffused ﬁ  rst to a small group of people in Indonesia; 
then, Indonesians began to create Hip Hop music. Through the creation of their own music, Indonesian Hip Hop artists integrated their local culture with the prac-tices of the “foreign” Hip Hop hearth to create a hybrid that was no longer foreign.
As Hip Hop has diffused and grown, artists have 
addressed the major concerns of their local cultures in their lyrics. Hip Hop artists in the United States wrote about social issues in the 1980s and 1990s, and some wrote about violence, crime, and surviving during the gangsta rap of the 1990s. Some artists write more about having fun and partying. In France and Germany,  Figure 4.18

American Hip Hop music diffused ﬁ  rst to immigrants 
living in major cities. In France, for example, some of the ﬁ  rst Hip Hop artists were African, Arab, and Spanish immigrants writing about the racism they experienced in France.
The results of reterritorialization are seen in the 
ways Hip Hop artists around the world use the texts and music from their own local cultures, national cultures, and libraries to sample (mix) in their music. Hip Hop artists outside of the United States typically write and perform in their own language or dialect with reference to Hip Hop terms used by artists in the United States.
Replacing Old Hearths with New: Beating Out 
the Big Three in Popular Sports
Baseball, football, and basketball are historically the big 
three sports in the United States. During the 1800s and 1900s, they all beneﬁ  ted from advances in transporta-tion technology, communication technology, and insti-tutionalization. First, the railroad interconnected cities across the country, allowing baseball teams to compete and baseball to diffuse. The telegraph enabled newspa-pers to report baseball scores, which added to the sport’s following. In the late 1880s, electric lighting made bas-ketball a nighttime spectator sport, played inside gym-nasiums. The founding of the National Football League in 1920 helped institutionalize (by creating institutions to support it, formalize it, and regulate it) the sport of football, with rules for the game remaining relatively unchanged since then.
During much of the twentieth century, the big three 
dominated sports popular culture. Figures including Mark McGwire, Michael Jordan, and Brett Favre found their ways onto Wheaties boxes and reached icon status. In the last decades of the twentieth century, advertising contracts and corporate sponsorship padded and eventu-ally surpassed the salaries of the biggest sports heroes.
While the big three continued to draw millions of 
fans and huge crowds to their venues, a growing number of alternative sports captured the imagination of young sports fans. Popular ﬁ  lms (including Endless Summer) of 
the 1960s immortalized the freedom of surﬁ  ng. In the 
1970s, sidewalk surﬁ  ng, now known as skateboarding, dif-
fused from its hearth in Southern California. In the 1980s, snowboarding found a following and initially met strong resistance on ski slopes in the United States.
The debut of ESPN’s X Games in 1995 and the pro-
liferation of video games involving extreme sports pro-pelled previously alternative sports into popular culture. Snowboarding debuted as a winter Olympic sport in 1998. Video games sparked interest in the sports for kids who had never shown any interest in sports. T ony Hawk, the famous vert (a skateboarding ramp that looks like an enormous pipe cut in half—also called a halfpipe) skate-boarder, worked with Activision to create several versions of T ony Hawk’s Pro Skater, with average annual sales of $180 million. In 2001, sales relating to video games were higher than the movie industry’s box ofﬁ  ce receipts. That 
same year, baseball took a back seat to skateboarding, with more children under the age of 18 skateboarding than playing baseball.
Extreme sports greats, like T ony Hawk, gain cor-
porate sponsors, create their own brands, and sign lucrative advertising deals. Hawk, who retired from competitive skate boarding in 1999, reportedly still earns more than $12 million a year through his skate-boards and clothing lines, his video games, and his stints as spokesperson for Heinz, Hershey, and Frito-Lay. Hawk combined popular sports with popular music, creating his Boom Boom Huck Jam tour that features famous skateboarders, BMX bike riders, and motorcy-cle stunt drivers, neatly choreographed and enhanced by alternative live music. T ony Hawk, Inc., employs 30 people to oversee Hawk’s branded products, which had sales of over $200 million in 2009.
Advertisers who court the 12–34 age demographic, 
fans looking for athletes who are outside of the excess of major league sports, and fans who desire a sport that is different from their parents’ sport drove the expansion of extreme sports into mainstream popular culture. Marketers and business analysts refer to Hawk as the godfather of extreme sports. He discovered Shaun White as a 7-year-old in a skateboard park and helped White become a professional skateboarder. Shaun White has won more than a dozen medals in the X games for skate-boarding and snowboarding and two gold medals in the Winter Olympics for snowboarding (Fig. 4.19). The cash prizes for winning a professional snowboarding competi-tion are low, and Forbes reports it is rare for skateboard-ers or snowboarders to bring in more than $100,000 a year in prize money.
Shaun White has followed the path carved by T ony 
Hawk. White’s endorsement and product deals with Burton, Red Bull, Oakley, Ubisoft and T arget earn him more than $9 million a year. White invented a snow-boarding trick called the Double McT wist 1260 on a half-pipe that Red Bull spent $500,000 to build in the back country of Silverton, Colorado. White had to helicopter into this top-secret location to practice and develop the trick in preparation for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Forbes named White the top-grossing athlete of the Vancouver Olympics.
Researchers Maureen Smith and Becky Beal have 
studied how MTV’s television show Cribs creates mascu-line identities. They found that in the current economy, “marketing lifestyles and desires is central to selling prod-ucts, which has opened new and multiple masculinity markets.” Marketers use sports to “sell trucks, beer, fast

food, ﬁ  nancial advice, and a number of other products and 
lifestyles, including fashion and skin care.”
Like new music or other forms of popular culture, 
extreme sports become more popular, mainstream, and 
commodiﬁ  ed. Once that happens, the fan base turns its 
attention to a new extreme sport, and the corporate spon-sors begin to tap into the new popular sport, helping it follow the same path to popular, mainstream, and com-modiﬁ  ed status.
One of the best known recent examples of this 
trend is the popularization of Ultimate Fighting. In the early 1990s, advertising executives and sports promoters drew from a long history of mixed martial arts ﬁ  ghts in 
Brazil to produce a series of ﬁ  ghts in the United States among different martial arts and boxing experts to see who was the best ﬁ  ghter. The new ﬁ  ghts, called mixed martial arts, grew a fan base through live matches and pay per view on cable television. The early mixed martial arts ﬁ  ghts had few rules including no headbutting and no weight classes.
The fan base grew quickly, and by 1993, the 
Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) formed to serve as a professional organization for mixed martial arts (Fig. 4.20). The sport continued to grow during the 1990s, with the establishment of rules over time allot-ments for matches, the institutionalization of promo-tions and marketing, and the growth in popularity of a reality television show called The Ultimate Fighter. The Fight Network reports the UFC has diffused to “over 130 countries, territories, and jurisdictions, reaching 430 million homes worldwide, in 20 different lan-guages.” UFC has deals in China and India to broadcast ﬁ ghts. In China, UFC is working to build a fan base through a Chinese UFC website (ufc.cn) and a Chinese version of The Ultimate Fighter reality show. The rules of the UFC, including 7 weight classes and speciﬁ  cations 
for the ﬁ  ghting arena called “the Octagon” or “the Cage,” have been institutionalized as the basis for ulti-mate ﬁ  ghting worldwide. References to ultimate ﬁ  ght-
ing and ultimate ﬁ  ghters (such as Chuck Liddell’s appearance on HBO’s Entourage) are diffusing into other aspects of popular culture, spreading both the commodi-ﬁ cation and the popularization of the sport.
Identity and the desire to remain outside of popu-
lar culture will continue to spur the creation of extreme sports to rival the big three. In discussing MTV’s pro-duction of culture, Rosati explained that the founda-tion of industrial capitalism is not simply “meeting the existing needs of the public.” Rather, industrial capi-talism demands that corporations continue to produce goods that “become socially desirable.” The need for corporations to create the “new” so that they have something to sell that is “socially desirable” applies to MTV and the music industry, as well as to major sports promoters and marketers. Skateboarding and ultimate fighting will be followed by the next extreme sport and the next, as long as corporations can spur the con-sumption of the new.
Stemming the Tide of Popular Culture—Losing 
the Local?
The assimilation policies practiced by American, Canadian, 
Russian, Australian, and New Zealand governments were ofﬁ cial policies designed for the express purpose of disrupting c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 133  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 133  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
134 Chapter 4  Local Culture, Popular Culture, and Cultural Landscapes
and changing indigenous, local cultures. Western, demo-
cratic governments no longer have ofﬁ  cial policies of assimi-lation. Y et, for people in many local cultures and in regions that are not hearths of popular culture, popular culture itself can feel like a policy of assimilation.
Popular media such as music, television, and ﬁ  lm 
from the United States and the United Kingdom diffuse quickly. American and British products can now be seen and heard around the world. If you turn on the television in Harare, Zimbabwe, you can easily ﬁ  nd reruns of a 
10-year-old American television show, or a contemporary CNN broadcast. If you go to a cinema in Seoul, South Korea, you can choose among several just released American ﬁ  lms shown in English with Korean subtitles.
The inﬂ  uence of Europe, the United States, Japan, 
and South Korea in global popular culture makes many people feel threatened by cultural homogenization. At the global scale, North America, western Europe, Japan, India, and South Korea exert the greatest inﬂ  uence on 
popular culture at present. Each region acts as a major hearth for certain aspects of popular culture. North America inﬂ  uences are mainly in movies, television, 
music, sports, and fast food. Japan’s inﬂ  uences are primar-
ily in children’s television programs, electronic games, and new entertainment technologies. Western Europe’s inﬂ uences are in fashion, television, art, and philosophy. 
South Korea’s inﬂ  uences are in television dramas, movies, and popular music, and India’s inﬂ  uence on popular cul-ture is mainly in movies.
The rapid diffusion of popular culture can cause 
consumers to lose track of the hearth of a good or idea. For example, Americans may think of the Nintendo Wii as an American product because of its popularity through-out the country. The Nintendo Wii, like most video game consoles and games, was created in Japan. Japanese video designer Shigeru Miyamoto, who also created Donkey Kong, Mario Brothers, and the Legend of Zelda, led the design of the interactive Wii for Nintendo.
Japan is known for its innovation in video games, and 
neighboring South Korea has made a mark on popular culture from television to popular music. In 1995, Chinese television stations began broadcasting South Korean tele-vision dramas. The South Korean dramas typically aired late at night, often after midnight, but they quickly gained a large following in China. The Chinese government changed a law that restricted Korean content on television to 15 percent of air time, and in response South Korean popular television dramas took off in China. An entire wave of South Korean popular culture, including televi-sion shows movies, fashions, and music diffused through China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Hallyu (also called Hanryu) are waves of South Korean popular culture that move quickly through Asia and have resulted in signiﬁ  -
cant growth in the South Korean entertainment and tour-ism industries (Fig. 4.21).
Beginning with television dramas and movies, 
Hallyu expanded to music in the early part of this cen-tury. South Korean popular music, known as K-pop, has followed the same path of diffusion. The Chinese gov-ernment allowed Korean band H.O.T . to play in a sta-dium in Beijing in 2002. T oday, K-pop bands including Super Junior (called SuJu) and Girls Generation, K-pop recording artists including Rain and BoA, and Korean movie stars, including Bae Y ong Joon, have fans through-out East Asia, Southeast Asia, and increasingly in the Middle East.
Ironically, South Korea was quite protective of its 
entertainment industry in the post-World War II era, for fear that Japan, which formerly colonized South Korea, would export its entertainment industry to South Korea and overpower South Korea’s entertainment industry. Hallyu has diffused not only to China but also to Japan. In turn, millions of Japanese and Chinese are taking Korean

 How Is Popular Culture Diffused? 135
Field Note
“Just days before the Japanese tsunami in 
2011, I walked out of the enormous Lotte department store in Seoul, South Korea and asked a local where to ﬁ  nd a marketplace with handcrafted goods. She pointed me in the direction of the Insa-dong traditional market street. When I noticed a Starbucks’ sign written in Korean instead of English, I knew I must be getting close to the tradi-tional market. A block later, I arrived on Insa-dong. I found quaint tea shops and boutiques with hand crafted goods, but the market still sold plenty of bulk made goods, including souvenirs like Korean drums, chopsticks, and items sporting Hallyu stars. Posters, mugs, and even socks adorned with the faces of members of Super Junior smiled at the shop-pers along Insa-dong.”

language classes, traveling and studying abroad in South Korea, and adopting South Korean fashions.
A 2009 article in T ourism Geographies describes the 
diffusion and proliferation of Hallyu in Asia:
Having ﬁ  rst penetrated the Chinese mainland, the 
Korean cultural phenomenon of Hallyu, in particu-lar Korean television, has spread throughout the East and South-east of Asia, including Japan, Hong Kong, T aiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines and later even to the Middle East and East Europe. The infatuation with Korean popular culture and celebrities has not stopped at popular media consump-tion but has also led to more general interest in popular music, computer games, Korean language, food, fashion, make-up and appearance, and even plastic surgery.
When popular culture displaces or replaces local culture, it will usually be met with resistance. In response to an inﬂ ux of American and British ﬁ  lms, the French govern-
ment heavily subsidizes its domestic ﬁ  lm industry. French 
television stations, for example, must turn over 3 percent of their revenues to the French cinema. The French gov-ernment also stemmed the tide of American and British music on the radio by setting a policy in the 1990s requir-ing 40 percent of on-air time to be in French. Of the 40 percent, half must be new artists. These policies directly beneﬁ  ted the French Hip Hop industry. By performing in 
French, the new artists received quite a bit of air time on French radio. Through policies and funding, the French government has helped maintain its cultural industries, but in countless other cases, governments and cultural institutions lack the means or the will to promote local cultural productions.
Concern over the loss of local distinctiveness and 
identity is not limited to particular cultural or socio-economic settings. We ﬁ  nd such concern among the dominant societies of wealthier countries, where it is reﬂ ected in everything from the rise of religious funda-
mentalism to the establishment of semiautonomous communes in remote locations. We ﬁ  nd this concern among minorities (and their supporters) in wealthier countries, where it can be seen in efforts to promote local languages, religions, and customs by constructing barriers to the inﬂ  ux of cultural inﬂ  uences from the dominant society. We ﬁ  nd it among political elites in poorer countries seeking to promote a nationalist ide-ology that is explicitly opposed to cultural globaliza-tion. And we ﬁ  nd it among social and ethnic minorities in poorer countries that seek greater autonomy from regimes promoting acculturation or assimilation to a single national cultural norm.
Geographers realize that local cultures will inter-
pret, choose, and reshape the inﬂ  ux of popular culture. c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 135  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 135  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
136 Chapter 4  Local Culture, Popular Culture, and Cultural Landscapes
People interpret individual cultural productions in very 
different ways, depending on the cultural context in which they view them. What people choose to adopt from popu-lar culture, how they reterritorialize it, and what they reject help shape the character and culture of people, places, and landscapes.
Think about your local community (your college campus, your neighborhood, or your town). Determine how your local community takes one aspect of popular culture and makes it your own.
HOW CAN LOCAL AND POPULAR 
CULTURES BE SEEN IN THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE?
The tension between globalized popular culture 
and local culture can be seen in the cultural land-
scape, the visible imprint of human activity on the landscape. Human imprint includes everything from how people have changed and shaped the environment to the buildings, signs, fences, and statues people erect. Cultural landscapes reflect the values, norms, and aes-thetics of a culture. On major roadways in North American towns and suburbs, the landscape is a series of big box stores, gas stations, and restaurants that reflect popular culture (Fig. 4.22). As you drive down one of these roadways, one place looks like the next. Y ou drive past TGIFridays, Applebees, Wal-Mart, T arget, and McDonald’s. Then, several miles down the road, you pass another conglomeration (clustering) of the same stores. Geographer Edward Relph coined the word placelessness to describe the loss of uniqueness 
of place in the cultural landscape to the point that one place looks like the next.
Cultural landscapes begin to blend together, converg-
ing cultural landscapes in three dimensions: (1) particular architectural forms and planning ideas have diffused around the world; (2) individual businesses and products have become so widespread that they now leave a distinc-tive landscape stamp on far-ﬂ  ung places; and (3) the 
wholesale borrowing of idealized landscape images, though not necessarily fostering convergence, promotes a blurring of place distinctiveness.
The global diffusion of the skyscraper provides a 
clear illustration of the ﬁ  rst point—particular architectural

forms and planning ideas have diffused around the world 
(Fig. 4.23). In the second half of the 1800s, with advance-ments in steel production and improved costs and efﬁ  -
ciencies of steel use, architects and engineers created the ﬁ rst skyscrapers. The Home Insurance Building of 
Chicago is typically pointed to as the ﬁ  rst skyscraper. The fundamental difference between a skyscraper and another building is that the outside walls of the skyscraper do not bear the major load or weight of the building; rather, the internal steel structure or skeleton of the building bears most of the load.
From Singapore to Johannesburg and from Caracas 
to T oronto, the commercial centers of major cities are dominated by tall buildings, many of which have been designed by the same architects and engineering ﬁ  rms. 
With the diffusion of the skyscraper around the world, the cultural landscape of cities has been profoundly impacted. Skyscrapers require substantial land clearing in the vicin-ity of individual buildings, the construction of wide, straight streets to promote access, and the reworking of transportation systems around a highly centralized model. Skyscrapers are only one example of the globalization of a particular landscape form. The proliferation of skyscrap-ers in T aiwan, Malaysia, and China in the 1990s marked the integration of these economies into the major players in the world economy (Fig. 4.24). T oday, the growth of skyscrapers in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, signals the world city status of the place.Reading signs is an easy way to see the second dimen-
sion of cultural landscape convergence: the far-ﬂ  ung stamp 
of global businesses on the landscape. Walking down the streets of Rome, you will see signs for Blockbuster and Pizza Hut. The main tourist shopping street in Prague hosts Dunkin’ Donuts and McDonald’s. A tourist in Munich, Germany, will wind through streets looking for the city’s famed beer garden since 1589, the Hofbräuhaus, and will happen upon the Hard Rock Café, right next door (Fig. 4.25). If the tourist had recently traveled to Las Vegas, he may have déjà vu. The Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas, built in 2003, stands across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. The storefronts in Seoul, South Korea, are ﬁ lled with Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, and Outback 
Steakhouses. China is home to more than 3200 KFC res-taurants, and its parent company Yum! controls 40 percent of the fast-food market in China.
Marked landscape similarities such as these can be 
found everywhere from international airports to shop-ping centers. The global corporations that develop spaces of commerce have wide-reaching impacts on the cultural landscape. Architectural ﬁ  rms often specialize in building one kind of space—performing arts centers, medical laboratories, or international airports. Property management companies have worldwide holdings and encourage the Gap, the Cheesecake Factory, Barnes and Noble, and other companies to lease space in all of their holdings.

courts, begin to look the same even though they are sep-
arated by thousands of miles.
The third dimension of cultural landscape conver-
gence is the wholesale borrowing of idealized landscape images across the world. As you study the cultural landscape, you may notice landscape features transplanted from one place to another—regardless of whether the landscape fea-ture even “ﬁ  ts.”The strip in Las Vegas, Nevada, represents an 
extreme case of this tendency, with various structures designed to evoke different parts of the planet. The popu-lar Venetian Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas replicates the Italian city of Venice, including canals. The Las Vegas Sands Corporation, a casino developer and owner, built the Venetian Hotel and Casino across the Paciﬁ  c from Las Vegas in Macao in 2007. The port city of Macao was once c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 138  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 138  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
 How Can Local and Popular Cultures Be Seen in the Cultural Landscape?  139
The borrowing of landscape is not conﬁ  ned to 
grand-scale projects like the Venetian. A more common 
borrowed landscape in North America is the town cen-ter. T own centers popping up in suburbia in North America have a similar look-one that is familiar if you have walked on Main Street, U.S.A. at Disneyland or  Figure 4.25

Disney World, or if you have visited the centers of any 
number of “quaint” historic towns on the eastern sea-board. Each town center is designed to make you think of all things American and to feel immediately “home” in the place.
In less obvious ways, cultural borrowing and mix-
ing is happening all around the world. This idea is behind the global-local continuum concept. This notion emphasizes that what happens at one scale is not independent of what happens at other scales. Human geography is not simply about documenting the differ-ences between places; it is also about understanding the processes unfolding at different scales that produce those differences. What happens in an individual place is the product of interaction across scales. People in a local place mediate and alter regional, national, and global processes, in a process called glocalization. The charac-ter of place ultimately comes out of a multitude of dynamic interactions among local distinctiveness and wider-scaled events and inﬂ  uences.
Cultural Landscapes of Local Cultures
What makes travel interesting for most people is the presence of variety in the cultural landscape. T ravel beyond the tourist sites and the main roads, and one will easily ﬁ  nd landscapes of local cultures, even in wealthy countries including the United States and Canada. By studying local cultural landcapes, you can gain insight into the social structures of local cultures. In everything from the houses to the schools to the churches to the cemeteries, a local cultural landscape reveals its foundation.
Founders and early followers of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints created the Mormon landscape of the American West as they migrated west-ward under persecution and in search of a place where they could practice their religion freely. The Mormon Church began in New Y ork, and then Joseph Smith and his followers moved westward to Independence, Missouri. From there, Mormons migrated westward to present-day Salt Lake City, Utah. The easiest place to see the foundations of the Mormon cultural landscape are in the small towns established by Mormons through-out Utah and stretching into Arizona, Nevada, and Idaho (Fig. 4.27).
Geographers, including Donald Meinig, Richard 
Francaviglia, and Allen Noble, have studied the Mormon landscape and discerned the roots of the Mormon culture in the local landscape. If you drove from Chicago west to Las Vegas and traveled through the rural areas of Nebraska and Utah on your path, you would immediately notice one fundamental difference in the landscape: farmsteads in the plains replaced by farming villages in

the west. In the Great Plains, the Homestead Act encour-
aged farmers to establish single farmsteads where a farm family lived alone on their 160 acres and the nearest neighbor was down the dirt road. In the rural Mormon landscape, early settlers established farming villages where houses clustered together and croplands sur-rounded the outskirts of the village (Fig. 4.28). Clustering houses together in a farming village allowed Mormons to protect each other because the religious followers were experiencing persecution in the East and because the settlers’ fears were raised by stories of Indians attacking villages in the West. Equally importantly, through clus-tering they sought to join together for services in each village’s chapel.

Guest Field Note
Paragonah, Utah
I took this photograph in the village of Paragonah, Utah, in 
1969, and it still reminds me that ﬁ  eldwork is both an art and a science. People who know the American West well may immediately recognize this as a scene from “Mormon Coun-try,” but their recognition is based primarily on their impres-sions of the place. “It is something about the way the scene looks,” they may say, or “it feels like a Mormon village because of the way the barn and the house sit at the base of those arid bluffs.” These are general impressions, but how can one prove that it is a Mormon scene? That is where the science of ﬁ  eld-
work comes into play. Much like a detective investigating a crime scene, or a journalist writing an accurate story, the geographer looks for proof. In this scene, we can spot several of the ten elements that comprise the Mormon landscape. First, this farmstead is not separate from the village, but part of it—just a block off of Main Street, in fact.
Next we can spot that central-hall home made out of brick; then there is that simple, unpainted gabled-roof barn; and 
lastly the weedy edge of a very wide street says Mormon Country. Those are just four clues suggesting that pragmatic Mor-mons created this cultural landscape, and other ﬁ  eldwork soon conﬁ  rmed that all ten elements were present here in Par-agonah. Like this 40-year old photo, which shows some signs of age, the scene here did not remain unchanged. In Paragonah and other Mormon villages, many old buildings have been torn down, streets paved, and the landscape “cleaned up”—a reminder that time and place (which is to say history and geography) are inseparable.

United States and Canada, including symmetrical brick houses that look more similar to houses from the East Coast than to other pioneer houses, wide streets that run due north–south and east–west, ditches for irrigation, poplar trees for shade, bishops storehouses for storing food and necessities for the poor, and unpainted fences. Because the early Mormons were farmers and were clustered together in villages, each block in the town was quite large, allowing for one-acre city lots where a farmer could keep livestock and other farming supplies in town. The streets were wide so that farmers could easily turn a cart and horses on the town’s streets.
The morphology (that is, the size and shape of a 
place’s buildings, streets, and infrastructure) of a Mormon village tells us a lot, and so too, can the shape and size of a local culture’s housing. In Malaysia, the Iban, an indigenous people, live along the Sarawak River in the Borneo region of Malaysia. Each long house is home to an extended family of up to 200 people. The family and the long house function as a community, sharing the rice farmed by the family, supporting each other through frequent flooding of the river (the houses are built on stilts), and working together on the porch that stretches the length of the house. The rice paddies surrounding each long house are a familiar shape and form throughout Southeast Asia, but the Iban long house tells you that you are experiencing a different kind of place-one that reflects a unique local culture.
Focus on the cultural landscape of your college campus. Think about the concept of placelessness. Determine whether your campus is a “placeless place” or whether the cultural landscape of your college reﬂ  ects the unique iden-
tity of the place. Imagine you are hired to build a new stu-dent union on your campus. How could you design the building to reﬂ  ect the uniqueness of your college?

Advances in transportation and communications technology help popular culture dif-fuse at record speeds around the world today. Popular culture changes quickly, offering new music, foods, fashions, and sports. Popular culture envelopes and inﬁ  ltrates local 
cultures, presenting constant challenges to members of local cultures. Some members of local cultures have accepted popular culture, others have rejected it, and still others have forged a balance between the two.
Customs from local cultures are often commodiﬁ  ed, propelling them into popular 
culture. The search for an “authentic” local culture custom generally ends up promot-ing a stereotyped local culture or glorifying a single aspect of that local culture. Local culture, like popular culture, is dynamic, and the pursuit of authenticity disregards the complexity and ﬂ  uidity of cultures.c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 143  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 143  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
144Identity: Race, Ethnicity, 
Gender, and SexualityCHAPTER
Field Note Building Walls
Traveling on the Indonesian island of 
Bali, I saw a brick-making facility and stopped to visit. Boys and women were building bricks by hand, in the hot sun. I watched young boys scoop wet mud from a quarry by a creek into their wheelbar-rows. They poured the mud into wooden forms. Once the bricks began to dry and harden in the sun, someone had to turn the bricks repeatedly to prevent them from cracking.
The woman in Figure 5.1 worked ten hours a day, six 
days a week, turning, stacking, and restacking bricks to pre-vent them from cracking. For her work, she earned about 45 cents (U.S.) per hour.
More than a century ago, bricks were made this way 
in the United States. Today, the brick-making industry in the United States makes use of a great deal of technol-ogy and robotics to manufacture bricks. Instead of using the sun to bake the bricks, brick-making factories in the United States employ enormous tunnel-shaped kilns. The Mississippi Business Journal described how bricks 
are made in one factory: “Clay and water go in one end of the new 590 foot tunnel kiln and brick pallets will roll out the other end as robots and employees work side by side.”
What hit me harder than the difference in tech-
nology between the two countries is the difference in labor. In Bali, women and boys make bricks. In the United States, the vast majority of brick-makers are men, aided by machines. One company estimated that 98 percent of its operations’ employees in the factory are men. What

makes brick-making a job for women and boys in Bali and a job for men and robots 
in the United States? Does being a brick-maker mean different things in each of 
these places?
Throughout the world, different cultures and societies have different 
ideas about what jobs are appropriate for men and what jobs are appropriate for women. Geographers, especially those who study gender, realize people have created divisions of labor that are gendered. Geographers Mona Domosh and Joni Seager deﬁ  ne gender as “a culture’s assumptions about the differences 
between men and women: their ‘characters,’ the roles they play in society, what they represent.” Divisions of labor are one of the clearest ways in which societ-ies are gendered.
In Bali, brick-making is still done by hand by boys and women. The industry is 
not technologically sophisticated, and bricks are made one by one. Even beyond brick-making facilities, most of the factory jobs in Indonesia and in poorer coun-tries of the world go to women instead of men. Factory managers in these areas often hire women over men because they see women as an expendable labor pool. Researcher Peter Hancock studied gender relations and women’s work in facto-ries in Indonesia and reported, “Research in different global contexts suggests that factory managers employ young women because they are more easily exploited, less likely to strike or form membership organizations, are comparatively free from family responsibilities, and more adept at doing repetitive and delicate tasks associated with assembly line work.”
In many societies in poorer countries, families see young women as ﬁ  nan-
cial supporters of their families. Thus, many women migrate from rural areas and travel to cities or central industrial locales (such as export production zones—EPZs) to produce and earn a wage that is then sent home to support the schooling of their brothers and younger sisters (until these girls are also old enough to leave home and work). In Indonesia and in neighboring Malaysia and the Philippines, many women temporarily migrate to the Middle East to work as domestics: cook-ing, cleaning, and providing childcare in order to send money home to support the family. In the United States, rarely does an oldest daughter migrate to the city to labor in a factory so she can pay for her younger brothers’ schooling.
Although public education in the United States is free and open to boys and 
girls, American society still has gendered divisions of labor. The few women who work in brick-manufacturing facilities in the United States are typically assigned to tasks that require little lifting—such as gluing pieces of the various types of brick the company produces to boards so that salespeople can use them as samples. A long-standing assumption in American society is that work requiring heavy lifting needs to be completed by men and that good-paying, unionized jobs need to go to men because men are the “heads of the household.” Times are changing and gen-dered work is being increasingly challenged, but assumptions about gender still have an impact on the labor market.
Society creates boxes in which we put people and expect them to live. These 
boxes are in a sense stereotypes embodying assumptions we make about what is expected from or assumed about women, men, members of certain races or eth-
nic groups, and people with various sexual preferences. By creating these boxes, society can assign entire professions or tasks to members of certain categories, for example “women’s work,” thereby gendering the division of labor. Places, notably the kitchen of a home or a store in the mall, can also be gendered. People are constantly negotiating their personal identities, ﬁ  nding their ways through 
all the expectations placed on them by the boxes society puts around them, and c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 145  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 145  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

modifying and reinforcing the social relations that create the places where they 
work and live.
Rarely do the social relations that create gendered divisions of labor focus only 
on gender. The social relations in a place also create boxes for other identities. In this chapter, we focus on gender, race, ethnicity, and sexuality. We examine how people and society construct identities, how place factors into identity, and how geography reﬂ ects and shapes power relationships among different groups of people.
Key Questions For Chapter 5
 1. What is identity, and how are identities constructed?
 2. How do places affect identity, and how can we see identities in places?
 3. How does geography reﬂ  ect and shape power relationships among groups?
WHAT IS IDENTITY, AND HOW ARE 
IDENTITIES CONSTRUCTED?
A man gets off the airplane, walks to the baggage car-
ousel to ﬁ  nd his suitcase, and is greeted by dozens of black 
suitcases. He walks to the parking garage to ﬁ  nd his car and sees a sea of black cars that all look the same. The nar-rator intones, “Maintain your identity. Drive a Saab.”
Identities are marketed through cars, clothing, club 
memberships, jewelry, and houses. Advertisements often convey the impression that we can purchase our identity. Y et, identity is much more personal than what we drive, wear, belong to, or where we live. Geographer Gillian Rose deﬁ  nes identity as “how we make sense of ourselves.” 
How do each of us deﬁ  ne ourselves? We construct our own identities through experiences, emotions, connections, and rejections. We work through derivations and delineations to ﬁ  nd an identity that meshes with who and where we are at any given time. An identity is a snapshot, an image of who we are at that moment. Identities are ﬂ  uid, constantly 
changing, shifting, and becoming. Place and space are inte-gral to our identities because our experiences in places and our perceptions of places help us make sense of who we are.
In addition to deﬁ  ning ourselves, we deﬁ  ne others and 
others deﬁ  ne us. One of the most powerful ways to construct an identity is by identifying against other people. T o iden-tify against, we ﬁ  rst deﬁ  ne the “Other,” and then we deﬁ  ne 
ourselves in opposing terms. Edward Said wrote thought-fully about how Europeans, over time, constructed an image of regions that are now commonly called the Middle East and Asia. He described the circumstances that led Europe-ans to deﬁ  ne this area as the “Orient,” a place with suppos-edly mystical characteristics that were depicted and repeated in European art and literature. In a similar vein, geographer James Blaut wrote eloquently about how Europeans came to deﬁ ne Africans and Americans as “savage” and “mystical.” Through these images of the “Other,” which developed during periods of European exploration and colonialism, Europeans deﬁ  ned themselves as “not mystical” or “not sav-
age” and, therefore, as “civilized.” These ideas are still part of our vernacular speech even today, as seen in references to “the civilized world” or a time “before civilization” Phrases such as these invariably carry with them a sense of superior-ity in opposition to an “Other.”
One of the most powerful foci of identity in the mod-
ern world is the state. State nationalism has been such a powerful force that in many contexts people think of them-selves ﬁ  rst and foremost as French, Japanese, or American. Nationalist identities are a product of the modern state sys-tem, so we defer consideration of this form of identity to the chapter focused on the rise of the state system (Chapter 8). But nationalist identities coexist with all sorts of other identities that divide humanity—identities that can trump state nationalism in certain contexts and certain scales of interaction. Language and religion can function as foci of identity, and we will turn to these in the next two chapters. This chapter takes up several other important foundations of identity—those based on race, gender, ethnicity, and sex-uality. We look at issues of identity construction, place, and scale by way of an analysis of race. We examine ethnicity and sexuality as identities that are shaped by and that shape place. Our concluding discussion in this chapter looks at power relationships through the lenses of gender and ethnicity.
Race
Race provides an excellent example of the ways in which geo-graphic context shapes axes of identity. The various “races” to which people refer are the product of ways of viewing minor genetic differences that developed as modern humans spread around the world. The physical attributes that are seen as signiﬁ  cant have changed across time and space. In c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 146  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 146  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

position was (however shakily) based to the vastness of the 
overseas possessions, covertly (or not so covertly) conveying the idea that if, say, English lords were naturally superior to other Englishmen, no matter: these other Englishmen were no less superior to the subjected natives.
The stories the commoners heard about the “mysti-
cal” and “savage” “Others” fostered feelings of superiority. One of the easiest ways to deﬁ  ne the “Other” is through skin color because it is visible. Differences in the color of skin, then, became the basis for a fundamental social divide.
What society typically calls a “race” is in fact a com-
bination of physical attributes in a population. Differences in skin color, eye color, and hair color likely result from a long history of adaptation to different environments. Sun-light stimulates the production of melanin, which protects skin from damaging ultraviolet rays; the more melanin that is present, the darker the skin will be. Many believe that this helps to explain why, over the millennia, humans living in low latitudes (closer to the equator, from tropical Africa through southern India to Australia) had darker skins. Another, not incompatible, theory holds that the produc-tion of vitamin D, which is a vitamin necessary to live a healthy life, is stimulated by the penetration of ultraviolet rays. Over the millennia, natural selection in higher lati-tudes, closer to the North and South Poles, favored those with the least amount of pigmentation. People with less pigmentation could more easily absorb ultraviolet rays, which, in the higher latitudes, are sparse in winter months with the amount of sunlight is lower and less direct. When humans absorb ultraviolet light, their bodies in turn pro-duce vitamin D, which is a necessary nutrient for survival.
Whatever may be said about the link between envi-
ronment and the development of particular physical char-acteristics, it is important to recognize that skin color is not a reliable indicator of genetic closeness. The indigenous peoples of southern India, New Guinea, and Australia, for example, are about as dark-skinned as native Africans, but native Africans, southern Indians, and Aboriginal Austra-lians are not closely related genetically (Fig. 5.3). Thus there is no biological basis for dividing the human spe-cies into four or ﬁ  ve groups based on skin color. Instead, those racial categories are the product of how particular cultures have dominantly viewed skin color.
The racial distinctions used in a place today are 
drawn from categories of skin color that are rooted in the cultural history, power relationships, and politics of a place over the past few centuries. Geographer Benjamin Forest gives us a global overview of racial distinctions:
In Britain, the term “black” refers not only to Afro-Caribbeans and Africans, but also to individuals from the Indian subcontinent. In Russia, the term “black” is used to describe “Caucasians,” that is, people such as Chechens from the Caucasus region. In many parts of Latin America, particularly Brazil, “racial” classiﬁ  cation is really a kind precolonial Africa, lines of division sometimes reﬂ  ected 
differences in skin tones among people whom Europeans all came to view as “black” during the colonial period. Y et modern ways of dividing people into races have become so pervasive that we ﬁ  nd ourselves continually ﬁ  lling out cen-sus forms, product warranty information, surveys, medical forms, and application forms that ask us to “check” a box identifying ourselves by races, for example “white,” “black,” “Asian” (Fig. 5.2). Such practices tend to naturalize and rein-force modern ways of viewing race.
Where did society get the idea that humans fall into dif-
ferent, seemingly unchangeable categories of race? Through-out history, societies in different parts of the world have drawn distinctions among peoples based on their physical characteristics, but many of societies’ modern assumptions about race grew out of the period of European exploration and colonialism. Y et as Benedict Anderson notes, even before the Age of Exploration and colonialism, wealthy Europeans deﬁ ned themselves as superior to those living elsewhere, sug-
gesting that socioeconomic differences can fuel the sense of superiority attached to race known as racism. With the onset 
of the colonial era, however, even the nonwealthy in colo-nizing countries came to deﬁ  ne themselves as superior to the people in the colonies. Anderson explains:
Colonial racism was a major element in that conception of “Empire” which attempted to weld dynastic legitimacy and national community. It did so by generalizing a principle of innate, inherited superiority on which its own domestic

race, we are often asked to choose race “boxes” for ourselves. This page of the 2010 United States Census asks the individ-ual, “What is this person’s race?” and directs the individual to “Mark one or more races to indicate what you consider yourself to be.”

of class placement, in which members of the wealthy upper 
class are generally considered as “white,” members of the middle class as mixed race or Mestizo, and members of the lower class as “black.” Indeed, because racial classiﬁ  cations 
are based on class standing and physical appearance rather than ancestry, “the designation of one’s racial identity need not be the same as that of the parents, and siblings are often classiﬁ  ed differently than one another.”
In each of these cases, and in countless others, peo-
ple have constructed racial categories to justify power, economic exploitation, and cultural oppression.
Race and Ethnicity in the United States
Unlike a local culture or ethnicity to which we may choose to belong, race is an identity that is more often assigned. 
In the words, once again, of Benjamin Forest: “In many respects, racial identity is not a self-consciously con-structed collection of characteristics, but a condition which is imposed by a set of external social and histori-cal constraints.” In the United States, racial categories are reinforced through residential segregation, racialized divisions of labor, and the categories of races recorded by the United States Census Bureau and other government and nongovernmental agencies.
Deﬁ nitions of races in the United States histori-
cally focused on dividing the country into “white” and “nonwhite,” but how these categories are understood has changed over time (Figure 5.4). For example, when immi-gration to the United States shifted from northern and western Europe to southern and eastern Europe in the early twentieth century, the United States government Field Note
“We were traveling in Darwin, Australia, in 1994 and decided to walk away from the modern downtown for a few hours. Darwin is a multicultural city in the midst of a region of Australia that is largely populated by Aboriginals. At the bus stops on the outskirts of the city, Aboriginals reached Darwin to work in the city or to obtain social services only offered in the city. With a language barrier between us, we used hand gestures to ask the man in the white shirt and his son if we could take their picture. Gesturing back to us, they agreed to the picture. Our continued attempts at sign language soon led to much laughter among the people waiting for the next bus.”

and many countries in Central and South America and the 
Caribbean. In our example above, the black person from Brazil who was classiﬁ  ed as “Hispanic” should not have 
been under this deﬁ  nition. The predominant language in Brazil is Portuguese, not Spanish.
In 2000, the United States Census categorized “His-
panic” as an ethnicity rather than a race. In the boxes pro-vided by the United States Census Bureau, a person can now be “White, non-Hispanic,” “White, Hispanic,” “Black, non-Hispanic,” “Black, Hispanic,” and so forth (T able 5.1).
In 2010, the United States Census recognized that 
“Hispanic” excludes people from Latin America who are not native Spanish speakers. The Census also recognized that some people, including United States Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, prefer the term “Latina” or “Latino” to “Hispanic.” In 2010, the United States Cen-sus Bureau described the Hispanic ethnicity as “Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin,” and continued to list Hispanic as an ethnicity and not a race.and the public at large had to redeﬁ  ne what constituted 
“white” so that people with olive-colored skin from the Mediterranean would count as “white.”
As a result of immigration and differences in fertility 
rates, the United States is becoming increasingly “non-white.” At the same time, how Americans deﬁ  ne “race” 
is changing. Before 2000, the United States Census clas-siﬁ ed “Hispanic” as a race. This categorization was cho-
sen because people in Latin America, like North America, represent different races. Before the 2000 census a white person from Venezuela, a black person from Brazil, and a native person from Bolivia were all classiﬁ  ed as “His-panic.” This example demonstrates the arbitrary nature of racial and ethnic classiﬁ  cations. In this example, coming 
from Latin America “trumped” all other identities and the person was deﬁ  ned as “Hispanic.” Hispanic, then, is not a race. It is better deﬁ  ned as an ethnicity. However, the word “Hispanic” means coming from a country where Spanish is the predominant language, including Spain, Mexico,

respondents prefer the term ‘Hispanic,’ 21% prefer the 
term ‘Latino’ and the rest have no preference.”
In the United States, 64 percent of the Hispanic pop-
ulation is of Mexican origin, and 9 percent of people who deﬁ ne themselves as Hispanic are of Puerto Rican descent. 
In the 2000 and 2010 censuses, all persons who deﬁ  ned 
themselves as Hispanic also deﬁ  ned themselves by a racial category. By combining race and ethnicity boxes, statisticians can still separate the American population into “White, non-Hispanic” and “everyone else.” According to the data pro-jections provided after the 2010 Census, the population of “everyone else” will surpass (in numbers) the “White, non-Hispanic” population around in 2042 (T able 5.2).With the evolution in understanding of race and 
ethnicity, it is sometimes difﬁ  cult to choose the right term to describe an individual or group of people. In this chapter and in the rest of the textbook, we use the most precise description as possible. Instead of a generic term “Hispanic,” if we are talking about a group of immigrants from Bolivia, we call the people immigrants from Bolivia. If we discuss a study about Cree Indians in Canada, we describe the Cree tribe, not a generic term First Nations. In general references, we use the term “Hispanic” instead of “Latino” or “Latina” in accordance with a 2008 Pew Research survey. The survey of Americans who deﬁ  ned 
themselves as “Hispanic” or “Latino,” found “36% of

In 2000, the United States Census Bureau began to calculate race and Hispanic origin sepa-
rately, allowing people to place themselves in one or more race categories plus one of two Hispanic origin categories (Hispanic or Non-Hispanic). According to the race categories provided in the 2010 census estimates, starting in 2042, the “White, non-Hispanic” popu-lation will no longer be the majority population in the United States.

 What Is Identity, and How Are Identities Constructed?  151
The researchers reported that all ﬁ  ve measures 
showed a decrease in residential segregation for African 
Americans between 1980 and 1990 and another such decrease between 1990 and 2000. A report after the 2010 census found that residential segregation for African Americans peaked in the 1960s and 1970s and declined again between 2000 and 2010. Between 2000 and 2010, residential segregation did increase in fewer than 10 of 102 metropolitan areas with populations of 500,000 or more. In 2010, the most residentially segregated large metropolitan area for African Americans was Milwaukee, Wisconsin (Fig. 5.5).
In 2000, when using an average of all ﬁ  ve measures 
of segregation, the most residentially segregated met-ropolitan area for American Indians and Alaska Natives was Phoenix-Mesa, Arizona, and the least residentially segregated is Oklahoma City. In 2000, the four least resi-dentially segregated metropolitan areas (with at least 3 percent of the population American Indian) were all in Oklahoma.
Grouping Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific 
Islanders, researchers of the 2000 report found 30 Residential Segregation
Racism has affected the distribution of African Ameri-cans, American Indians, and others throughout the history of the United States. During the past century, some of the most dramatic geographic impacts of racism could be found at the neighborhood scale. Historically, states, cities, and towns passed laws that promoted resi-dential segregation by disallowing the migration of cer-tain racial groups into particular neighborhoods. Laws passed during and after the civil rights movement of the 1960s in the United States made it illegal to legislate residential segregation. Despite these changes, many cities in the United States remain strongly segregated along racial lines.
Geographers Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton 
deﬁ ned residential segregation as the “degree to which 
two or more groups live separately from one another, in different parts of the urban environment.” Massey and Denton deﬁ  ned different kinds of residential segregation in a 1988 article, explaining that residential segregation is complex because:
groups may live apart from one another and be “segre-gated” in a variety of ways. Minority members may be distributed so that they are overrepresented in some areas and underrepresented in others, varying on the charac-teristic of evenness. They may be distributed so that their exposure to majority members is limited by virtue of rarely sharing a neighborhood with them. They may be spatially concentrated within a very small area, occu-
pying less physical space than majority members. They may be spatially centralized, congregating around the urban core, and occupying a more central location than the majority. Finally, areas of minority settlement may be tightly clustered to form one large contiguous enclave, or 
be scattered widely around the urban area.
A special report issued by the United States Census 
Bureau in 2002 statistically analyzed, charted, and mapped residential segregation in metropolitan areas of the coun-try, using the following ﬁ  ve statistical measurements of 
segregation: evenness, exposure, concentrated, central-ized, and clustered. These ﬁ  ve measurements directly cor-respond to the ﬁ  ve types of segregation outlined by Massey 
and Denton.
In the 2002 Census Bureau report, the authors 
reported on the levels of residential segregation in metro-politan areas of the United States between 1980 and 2000. They found that overall residential segregation by race/ethnicity is on the decline. For each of the four identities they researched—American Indians and Alaska Natives; Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Paciﬁ  c Islanders; Black/
African Americans; and Hispanics/Latinos—they calcu-lated ﬁ  ve statistical measures of residential segregation.

accounting for at least 3 percent of the total urban popula-

The numbers and maps produced by the Census 
Bureau based on 2000 data and from Brookings Insti-tute demographer William Frey based on the 2010 data show the outcomes of a variety of stories, but they do not tell us the stories. Why does residential segregation persist in some places and not in others? In some of the most segregated cities, people know where the “other” lives and will purposefully choose to live in neighbor-hoods with people like themselves instead. Real estate agents and community leaders may consciously or sub-consciously direct people to their “own” neighborhoods (blockbusting and redlining are discussed in Chapter 9). In some cities, race is related to class, making it difﬁ  -
cult to afford a higher class neighborhood that is also populated by another race. In other cities, people may choose to live in a blighted neighborhood because it is their neighborhood, one they have helped create and that reﬂ  ects their culture.metropolitan areas with at least 3 percent of the popu-lation fitting one of these identities. Based on calcu-lations for all five statistics of residential segregation, the most residentially segregated metropolitan area for Asians/Pacific Islanders was San Francisco, followed by New Y ork and Los Angeles. The data and maps change depending on how statistics are calculated. A report after the 2010 census examined Asian segrega-tion using a dissimilarity index with white populations in 102 large metropolitan areas. The report based on the 2010 census data found Buffalo/Niagra Falls to be the most segregated for Asians (not including Pacific Islanders) based on the dissimilarity index and consid-ering all large metropolitan areas, not only those with at least 3% of the population being Asian.
Baltimore, Maryland (Fig. 5.6) is one of the more res-
identially integrated cites in the United States for Asians and also for Hispanics/Latinos. The report based on the 2000 census found that the cities with the highest number of Hispanic residents experienced the greatest degree of residential segregation. They focused their analysis on the 36 large metropolitan areas with an Hispanic population

 What Is Identity, and How Are Identities Constructed?  153
New immigrants to a city often move to low-income 
areas that are being gradually abandoned by older immi-
grant groups. This process is called succession. In New 
Y ork, Puerto Ricans moved into the immigrant Jewish neighborhood of East Harlem in the early twentieth cen-tury, successively assuming a dominant presence in the neighborhood. With the inﬂ  ux of Puerto Ricans, new 
names for the neighborhood developed, and today it is frequently called Spanish Harlem or El Barrio (meaning “neighborhood” in Spanish). As the Puerto Rican popu-lation grew, new storefronts appeared, catering to the Puerto Rican population, such as travel agencies (special-izing in ﬂ  ights to Puerto Rico), specialty grocery stores, 
and dance and music studios.
Like the immigrant ﬂ  ow from Puerto Rico, the 
large-scale immigrant ﬂ  ow from the Dominican Repub-
lic that began in 1965 resulted in a distinct neighborhood and cultural landscape. Dominican immigrants landed in the Washington Heights/Inwood neighorhood of upper Manhattan, a neighborhood previously occupied by immigrant Jews, African Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans. Miyares reports that although a Jewish cultural landscape persists, including a Jewish university, syna-gogues, and Jewish delicatessens, the cultural landscape of Washington Heights is clearly Dominican—from store signs in Spanish to the presence of the colors of the Dominican ﬂ  ag (Fig. 5.7).
New Y ork is unique because of the sheer number and 
diversity of its immigrant population. The city’s cultural landscape reﬂ  ects its unique population. As Miyares explains:
Since the overwhelming majority of New York City’s population lives in apartments as opposed to houses, it is often difﬁ  cult to discern the presence of an ethnic group by 
looking at residential housescapes. However every neigh-borhood has a principal commercial street, and this is often converted into an ethnic main street. It is commonly through business signs that immigrants make their pres-ence known. Names of businesses reﬂ  ect place names from the home country or key cultural artifacts. Colors of the national ﬂ  ag are common in store awnings, and the ﬂ  ags 
themselves and national crests abound in store décor. Key religious symbols are also common. Immigrants are so prevalent and diverse that coethnic proprietors use many kinds of visual clues to attract potential customers.
Throughout the process, new immigrants need not 
change the facades of apartment buildings to reﬂ  ect their 
culture. Instead, many new immigrants focus their atten-tion on the streetscapes, creating businesses to serve their community and reﬂ  ect their culture.
The Caribbean presence in the city is so strong that 
some people think that new Hispanic migrants to New Y ork City simply have to adapt to Caribbean cultural Identities Across Scales
The way we make sense of ourselves in an increas-ingly globalized world is complex. We have different identities at different scales: individual, local, regional, national, and global. At the individual scale, we may see ourselves as a daughter, a brother, a golfer, or a student. At the local scale, we may see ourselves as members of a community, leaders of a campus organization, or resi-dents of a neighborhood. At the regional scale, we may see ourselves as Southerners, as north Georgians, as Atlantans, as Yankees living in the South, or as migrants from another region of the world. At the national scale, we may see ourselves as American, as college students, or as members of a national political party. At the global scale, we may see ourselves as Western, as educated, as relatively wealthy, or as free.
One way to view an individual’s various identities is 
to treat them as nested, one inside of the other; the appro-priate identity is revealed at the appropriate scale. In this vein, each larger territorial extent of geographic space has its own corresponding set of identities. T oday, more geog-raphers see identities as ﬂ  uid, intertwined, and context 
dependent rather than as neatly nested. Identities affect each other in and across scales, and the ways places and peoples interact across scales simultaneously affect identi-ties within and across scales.
The Scale of New York City
One way scale affects identity is by helping to shape what is seen—what identity is apparent to others and to our-selves at different scales. T o demonstrate this idea, we can shift our focus from residential segregation in all large metropolitan areas in North America to one enor-mous metropolitan area, New Y ork City. New Y ork has a greater number and diversity of immigrants than any other city in the United States. At the scale of New Y ork, we can see how identities change so that we are no longer simply Hispanic (as the Census enumerates us); we are Puerto Rican or Mexican or Dominican from a certain neighborhood.
The point is that the people in New Y ork are much 
more diverse than the box on census forms labeled “Hispanic” would suggest. In a chapter called “Chang-ing Latinization of New Y ork City,” geographer Inés Miyares highlights the importance of Caribbean cul-ture to New Y ork. The majority of New Y ork’s 2.2 mil-lion “Hispanics” are Puerto Ricans and Dominicans (together accounting for over 65 percent of Hispanics in the city). As the majority Hispanic culture, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans have had a profound impact on New Y ork’s cultural landscape.c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 153  21/11/11  11:21 AM user f-404c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 153  21/11/11  11:21 AM user f-404 user f-404user f-404
and neighborhoods. The overarching category “His-
panic” tells us even less about diversity when one moves up to the scale of the United States, but as long as that category persists in the Census, people will be encouraged to think about it as a meaningful basis for understanding social differences.
Recall the last time you were asked to check a box for your race. Does that box factor into how you make sense of yourself individually, locally, regionally, nationally, and globally? What impact might it have on how other people view you?norms. Miyares cautions, however, that not all Hispanics in the city are categorically assimilated into the Caribbean culture. Rather, the local identities of the Hispanic popu-lations in New Y ork vary by “borough, by neighborhood, by era, and by source country and entry experience.” Since 1990, the greatest growth in the Hispanic population of New Y ork has been Mexican. Mexican migrants have set-tled in a variety of ethnic neighborhoods, living alongside new Chinese immigrants in Brooklyn and Puerto Ricans in East Harlem. The process of succession continues in New Y ork, with Mexican immigrants moving into and succeeding other Hispanic neighborhoods, sometimes producing tensions between and among the local cultures.
In New Y ork and in speciﬁ  c neighborhoods such as 
East Harlem, the word Hispanic does little to explain the 
diversity of the city. At these scales, different identities are claimed and assigned, identities that reﬂ  ect local cultures Guest Field Note
Washington Heights, New York
It is a warm, humid September morning, and the 
shops along Juan Pablo Duarte Boulevard are already bustling with customers. The Dominican ﬂ  ag waves 
proudly from each corner’s trafﬁ  c signal. Calypso and salsa music ring through the air, as do the voices of Dominican grandmothers negotiating for the best prices on fresh mangos and papayas. The scents of fresh empanadas de yuca and pastelitos de pollo waft from street vendor carts. The signage, the music, the language of the street are all in Span-ish and call out to this Dominican community. I am not in Santo Domingo but in Washington Heights in upper Manhattan in New York City.
Whenever I exit the “A” train at 181st Street and 
walk toward St. Nicholas Avenue, renamed here Juan Pablo Duarte Boulevard for the founding father of the Dominican Republic, it is as if I have boarded a plane to the island. Although there are Dominicans living in most neighborhoods of New York’s ﬁ  ve boroughs, 
Washington Heights serves as the heart and soul of the community. Dominicans began settling in Washington Heights in 1965, replacing previous Jewish, African American, and Cuban residents through processes of invasion and succession. Over the past 40 years they have established a vibrant social and economic enclave that is replenished daily by transnational connections to the residents’ homeland. These transnational links are pervasive on the landscape, and include travel agencies advertising daily ﬂ  ights to Santo Domingo and Puerto Plata 
and stores handling cargas, envios , and remesas  (material and ﬁ  nancial remittances) found on every block, as well as farmacias  
(pharmacies) selling traditional medicines and botanicas  selling candles, statues, and other elements needed by practitioners 
of Santería, a syncretistic blending of Catholicism and Yoruba beliefs practiced among many in the Spanish Caribbean.

 How Do Places Affect Identity, and How Can We See Identities in Places?  155
often at the canton level—a small geographically deﬁ  ned 
area that distinguishes cultural groups within the state. 
So, which Swiss are Swiss Americans? The way Swiss Americans see Switzerland as part of who they are may 
not exist in Switzerland proper (Fig. 5.8). Ethnicity sways and shifts across scales, across places, and across time. A map showing all recognizable ethnic areas would look like a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with thousands of often-overlapping pieces—some no larger than a neigh-borhood, others as large as entire countries.
Ethnic identity is greatly affected by scale and place. 
In 2002, the Washington Post reported about the thriv-ing South Asian community in Fairfax County, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. In South Asia, the coun-tries of Pakistan and India have a history of animosity, and people identify themselves by country within the region of South Asia and by areas within each country. However, in Fairfax County, Virginia, a world apart from India and Pakistan, many South Asians identify with each other. A South Asian video rental store rents both Pakistani and Indian movies. South Asian grocery stores carry foods from both countries and areas within the countries. The geographical context of suburban Washington, D.C. fos-ters a collective South Asian identity.
Cultural groups often invoke ethnicity when race can-
not explain differences and antagonism between groups. Just as “racial conﬂ  icts” are rooted in perceptions of dis-tinctiveness based on differences in economics, power, language, religion, lifestyle, or historical experience, so too are “ethnic conﬂ  icts.” A conﬂ  ict is often called ethnic when a racial distinction cannot easily be made. For example, using physical appearance and skin color, an observer can-not distinguish the ethnic groups in many of the conﬂ  icts HOW DO PLACES AFFECT IDENTITY, AND 
HOW CAN WE SEE IDENTITIES IN PLACES?
The processes of constructing identities and iden-
tifying against an “Other,” just like any other social 
or cultural process, differ from place to place and are rooted in places. When we construct identities, part of what we do is to infuse place with meaning by attach-ing memories and experiences to the place. This process of infusing a place “with meaning and feeling” is what Gillian Rose and countless other geographers refer to as “developing a sense of place.” Like identity, our sense of place is ﬂ  uid; it changes as the place changes and as we change.
What is of particular interest to geographers is 
how people deﬁ  ne themselves through places. Our sense of place becomes part of our identity, and our identity affects the ways we deﬁ  ne and experience place. Rose explains:
One way in which identity is connected to a particular place is by a feeling that you belong to that place. It’s a place in which you feel comfortable, or at home, because part of how you deﬁ  ne yourself is symbolized by certain qualities of that place. The geographer Relph, for exam-ple, has even gone so far as to claim that “to be human is to live in a world that is ﬁ  lled with signiﬁ  cant places: to be human is to have to know your place.”
The uniqueness of a place can become a part of who we are.
Ethnicity and Place
Ethnicity offers a good example of how identities affect places and how places affect identities. The idea of eth-
nicity as an identity stems from the notion that people are closely bounded, even related, in a certain place over time. The word ethnic comes from the ancient Greek word eth-nos, meaning “people” or “nation.” Geographer Stuart Hall explains, “Where people share not only a culture but an ethnos, their belongingness or binding into group and 
place, and their sense of cultural identity, are very strongly deﬁ ned.” Hall makes clear that ethnic identity is “histori-
cally constructed like all cultural identities” and is often considered natural because it implies ancient relations among a people over time.
This deﬁ  nition may sound simple, but the concept 
of ethnicity is not. In the United States, for example, a group of people may deﬁ  ne their ethnicity as Swiss 
American. Switzerland is a state in Europe. The people in Switzerland speak four major languages and other minor ones. The strongest identities in Switzerland are most  Figure 5.8

others have created distinct patterns of settlement and 
ethnically imprinted cultural landscapes.
The town of Mexicali is the capital of the State of 
Baja California (located in Mexico, just south of the State of California in the United States). Not far from the cen-tral business district of Mexicali lies one of the largest Chinatowns in Mexico. A 1995 study of the Mexicali Chi-natown by geographer James R. Curtis showed that it has been the crucible of Chinese ethnicity in the Mexicali Val-ley throughout much of the twentieth century. Chinese began arriving in 1902, and by 1919 more than 11,000 Chinese were either permanent or temporary residents of the valley. They established a thriving Chinatown in the heart of Mexicali that served as the uncontested center of Chinese life in the region for decades (Fig. 5.9).
The Chinese of Mexicali were prominent players in 
the social and economic life of the city during the twenti-eth century. They owned and operated restaurants, retail trade establishments, commercial land developments, currency exchanges, and more. By 1989 they owned nearly 500 commercial or service properties. In an effort to sustain their cultural traditions and add to the cultural around the world. The adversaries in post–World War II conﬂ icts in Northern Ireland, Spain, the former Yugosla-
via, Sri Lanka, Ivory Coast, or Rwanda cannot be identiﬁ  ed 
racially; thus “ethnicity” becomes the marker of difference.
In some instances, the term ethnicity is reserved for 
a small, cohesive, culturally linked group of people who stand apart from the surrounding culture (often as a result of migration). Like other aspects of culture, ethnicity is a dynamic phenomenon that must be understood in terms of the geographic context and scales in which it is situated.
Chinatown in Mexicali
The border region between the United States and Mexico is generally seen as a cultural meeting point between Mex-icans and Anglo Americans. Y et the ethnic composition of people in the border region is more varied than Mexican and Anglo. Through migration, people from Germany, Russia, India, China, Japan, and countless other places also live in the cities and rural areas of the United States–Mexico border region. Over time some of the migrants to this region have blended into the larger community, and

themselves, and what kinds of problems they confront. 
For example, early studies examining gay neighborhoods in San Francisco and London focused on how gay men created spaces and what those spaces meant to gay identi-ties. Speciﬁ  c studies have also focused on the role of gay 
pride parades in creating communities and the political struggle for access to other parades such as St. Patrick’s Day parades in some cities. Other studies examine the role gays and lesbians play in the gentriﬁ  cation of neighbor-
hoods in city centers (a topic we explore in Chapter 9).
T oday, geographers studying sexuality are focusing 
not only on the distributions and experiences of people in places but also on the theories behind the experiences, the theories that explain and inform our understanding of sexu-ality and space. Many of the geographers who study sexual-ity are employing queer theory in their studies. By calling the theory queer theory, Elder, Knopp, and Nast explain that social scientists (in geography and other disciplines) are appropriating a commonly used word with negative conno-tations and turning it in a way that “highlights the contextual nature” of opposition to the heteronormative and focuses on the political engagement of queers with the heteronorma-tive. Geographers are also concentrating on extending ﬁ  eld-
work on sexuality and space beyond the Western world of North America and Europe to the rest of the world, explor-ing and explaining the local contexts of political engagement.
In 2000, the United States Census Bureau counted 
the number of same-sex households in the United States. In 2010, the Census added same-sex marriage to their counts. These data, by census tract—a small area in cit-ies and a larger area in rural America—made it possible for Gary Gates and Jason Ost to publish The Gay and 
Lesbian Atlas. Their detailed maps of major cities in the United States show concentrations of same-sex house-holds in certain neighborhoods of cities (Fig. 5.10), such as Adams-Morgan and DuPont Circle in Washington, D.C., and the West Village and Chelsea in Manhattan (Fig. 5.11). T aking the Census data by county, we can see a pattern of same-sex households in the United States, with concentrations in cities with well-established gay and les-bian neighborhoods. And we can also see the presence of same-sex households throughout the country, throughout states where same-sex unions are illegal.
In the 2010 census, the government tallied the number of households where a same-sex couple (with or without chil-dren) lived. Study the map of same-sex households in New York by census tract in Figure 5.10. How would the map change if sexuality were one of the “boxes” every person ﬁ lled out on the census?life of the city, they established the China Association, which plays an active role in Mexicali’s social and civic life.
Mexicali’s Chinatown is experiencing a transforma-
tion, as Chinese residents have dispersed to the edges of the city and beyond (many because they can afford to move out of town now). Relatively few Chinese continue to live in the city’s Chinatown; some have even moved across the border to Calexico (a city of 27,000 on the California side of the border), while retaining business interests in Mexicali. Y et Mexicali’s Chinatown contin-ues to play an important symbolic and functional role for individuals of Chinese ancestry in the area, who are still shaping the region’s social and economic geography. Even in regions where an ethnic population is small in number, if they have a group identity and consciousness they can have a lasting effect on the cultural landscape.
Identity and Space
Another way of thinking about place is to consider it as a cross section of space. Doreen Massey and Pat Jess deﬁ  ne 
space as “social relations stretched out” and place as “par-ticular articulations of those social relations as they have come together, over time, in that particular location.” Part of the social relations of a place are the embedded assumptions about ethnicity, gender, and sexuality, about what certain groups “should” and “should not” do socially, economically, politically, even domestically. Geographers who study iden-tities, such as gender, ethnicity, race, and sexuality, realize that when people make places, they do so in the context of surrounding social relationships. We can, for example, create places that are gendered—places seen as being appropriate for women or for men. A building can be constructed with the goal of creating gendered spaces within it, or a building can become gendered by the way people make use of it.
Sexuality and Space
Sexuality is part of humanity. Just as gender roles are culturally constructed, so too do cultures decide sexual norms. In their installment on “Sexuality and Space” in Geography in America at the Dawn of the 21st Century, geog-raphers Glen Elder, Lawrence Knopp, and Heidi Nast argue that most social science across disciplines is writ-ten in a heteronormative way. This means that the default subject in the minds of the academics who write studies is heterosexual, white, and male. These geographers and many others are working to ﬁ  nd out how heternormative ideas inﬂ  uence understandings of places and cultures, and 
how the practices of peoples who do not conform to these ideas inﬂ  uence the development of places.
Geographers’ initial forays into the study of sexual-
ity focused largely on the same kinds of questions posed by those who ﬁ  rst took up the study of race, gender, and ethnicity. Geographers ask where people with shared identity live and gather, what they do to create a space for c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 157  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 157  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Field Note
“It’s July 26, 2011, and I happen to be in New 
York City the weekend just after the State of New York legalized same-sex marriages. I cut it close getting to the airport so I could catch the ﬁ rst part of the annual Gay Pride parade. The 
parade, which started on the edge of the Chel-sea neighborhood at 36th Street, traveled down 5th Avenue toward where I took this photograph near Union Square and ended in the West Vil-lage. Always a boisterous, celebratory event, the parade has a special feel this year as celebrants cheer what many describe as one of the great civil rights victories of the current era.”

 How Does Geography Reﬂ  ect and Shape Power Relationships Among Groups of People?  159
people of all races, ethnicities, and sex, some charge that 
the United States Census Bureau continues to undercount minority populations (see Chapter 2).
Throughout the world, the work of women is often 
undervalued and uncounted. When the United States and other state governments began to count the value of goods and services produced within state borders, they did so with the assumption that the work of the house-hold is reserved for women and that this work does not contribute to the productivity of the state’s economy. The most commonly used statistic on productivity, the gross national income (the monetary worth of what is produced within a country plus income received from HOW DOES GEOGRAPHY REFLECT AND 
SHAPE POWER RELATIONSHIPS AMONG GROUPS OF PEOPLE?
Power relationships are assumptions and structures 
about who is in control and who has power over others. 
Power relationships affect identities directly, and the nature of those effects depends on the geographical con-text in which they are situated. Power relationships also affect cultural landscapes by determining what is seen and what is not. Massey and Jess contend power is central to the study of place: “the power to win the contest over how the place should be seen, what meaning to give it; the power, in other words, to construct the dominant imagina-tive geography, the identities of place and culture.”
Power relationships do much more than shape the 
cultural landscape. Power relationships can also subjugate entire groups of people, enabling society to enforce ideas about the ways people should behave or where people should be welcomed or turned away—thus altering the distribution of peoples. Policies created by governments can limit the access of certain groups. Jim Crow laws in the United States once separated “black” spaces from “white” spaces, right down to public drinking fountains. Even without government support, people create places 
where they limit the access of other peoples. For example, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Catholics and Protestants deﬁ ned certain neighborhoods as excluding the “other” 
through painting murals, hanging bunting, and painting curbs (Fig. 5.12). In major cities in the United States, local governments do not create or enforce laws deﬁ  ning cer-
tain spaces as belonging to members of a certain gang, but the people themselves create spaces, much like the people of Belfast do, through grafﬁ  ti, murals, and building colors.
Just Who Counts?
The statistics governments collect and report reﬂ  ect the 
power relationships involved in deﬁ  ning what is valued and what is not. Think back to the Constitution of the United States prior to the Fourteenth Amendment, when the government enumerated a black person as three-ﬁ  fths of 
a white person. Until 1924, the U.S. government did not recognize the right of all American Indians to vote even though the Fifteenth Amendment recognized the right to vote regardless of race in 1870. The U.S. government sepa-rated American Indians into those who were “civilized” enough to be citizens and those who were not (“Indians not taxed”) until 1924, when it recognized the citizenship of all American Indians born in the United States. Not until 1920 did enough states ratify the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which recognized the right of all Americans to vote regardless of sex. Despite progress in counting  Figure 5.12

in nearly all cultures and places around the world. A 2004 
report from the United Nations stated that two-thirds of the 880 million illiterate adults in the world are women and that women account for 70 percent of the world’s poorest citizens.
The World’s Women 2010 reported regional varia-
tions in agriculture employment for women. In Africa, for example, the proportion of women employed in agricul-ture ranges from a low of 19 percent in countries in south-ern Africa to a high of 68 percent in countries in eastern, middle, and western Africa. In Northern Africa, 42 per-cent of women are employed in agriculture and 41 percent of women are employed in services. In Asia, employment of women in agriculture ranges from 11 percent in eastern Asia, where 76 percent of women are employed in the ser-vice sector, to South Asia with 55 percent of women work-ing in agriculture and 28 percent in the service sector.
Although the number of women working in indus-
tries globally is small relative to the proportion of men, it is rising. Employment of women in the industrial sec-tor was slowed by the global economic downturn of the 2000s, as well as by mechanization, which leads to job reductions and hence to layoffs of women workers. In the maquiladoras of northern Mexico (see Chapter 10), for example, many women workers lost their jobs when labor markets contracted between 2001 and 2002, and then again between 2008 and 2010.
As the foregoing discussion has highlighted, many 
women engage in “informal” economic activity—that is, private, often home-based activity such as tailoring, beer brewing, food preparation, and soap making. Women who seek to move beyond subsistence activities but cannot enter the formal economic sector often turn to such work. In the migrant slums on the fringes of many cities, infor-mal economic activity is the mainstay of communities.investments outside the country), does not evaluate work in the home. The gross national income (GNI) includes neither the unpaid labor of women in the household nor, usually, the work done by rural women in less wealthy countries.
Scholars estimate that if women’s productivity in the 
household alone were given a dollar value by calculating what it would cost to hire people to perform these tasks, the gross national income (GNI) for all countries of the world combined would grow by about one-third. In poorer coun-tries, women produce more than half of all the food; they also build homes, dig wells, plant and harvest crops, make clothes, and do many other things that are not recorded in ofﬁ  cial 
statistics as being economically productive (Fig. 5.13).
Despite these conditions, the number of women in 
the “ofﬁ  cial” labor force is rising while the proportion of 
men in the labor force globally declined between 1990 and 2010. In The World’s Women 2010: Trends and Statistics , the 
United Nations reported “women are predominantly and increasingly employed in the services sector” of the formal economy. Combining paid work with work in the infor-mal economy and unpaid domestic work, “women work longer hours than men do.” The proportion of women in the labor force grew in all regions reported by the United Nations except Asia and eastern Europe. In South Amer-ica, for example, the percent of women in the labor force rose from 38 in 1990 to 59 in 2010. In North Africa, the participation of women in the labor force increased from 23 percent in 1990 to 29 percent in 2010 while over the same time period in Subsaharn Africa, women accounted for 60 and 62 percent of the labor force.
Even though women are in the ofﬁ  cial labor force in 
greater proportions than ever before, they continue to be paid less and have less access to food and education than men  Figure 5.13

inﬂ uenced by geographically speciﬁ  c social and envi-
ronmental circumstances.
Fieldwork is often the best way to understand how 
power structures in society create vulnerable groups at 
the local scale, and how those vulnerable groups might be affected by particular developments. Through ﬁ  eldwork 
and interviews, geographers can see differences in vulner-ability within groups of people.
Geographer Sarah Halvorson, for example, studied 
differences in the vulnerabilities of children in northern Pakistan. She examined the vulnerability of children to diarrheal diseases by paying attention to “constructions of gender, household politics, and gendered relationships that perpetuate inherent inequalities and differences between men and women and within and between social groups.”
Halvorson studied 30 families, 15 of whom had a 
low frequency of diarrhea and dysentery and 15 of whom had a high frequency of these diseases. Through her ﬁ  eld-
work, Halvorson came to understand that several tangible resources, including income and housing, and several intan-gible resources, such as social status and position within the family structure, all inﬂ  uenced the vulnerability of children to diarrheal diseases in northern Pakistan. Halvorson found that people with higher incomes generally had lower disease rates, but that income was not the only relevant factor (Fig. 5.14). The least vulnerable children and women were those who had higher incomes and an established social network of support. In cases where income was low, if a woman had a strong social network, her children were more likely to be in the low-disease group.
Geographer Joseph Oppong recognized that the spa-
tial analysis of a disease can reveal what populations are most vulnerable in a country. In North America and Europe, Statistics showing how much women produce and 
how little their work is valued are undoubtedly interest-ing. Y et, the work geographers who study gender have done goes far beyond the accumulation of such data. Since the 1980s, geographers have asked why society talks about women and their roles in certain ways and how these ideas, heard and represented throughout our lives, affect geo-graphic circumstances and how we understand them. For example, Ann Oberhauser and her co-authors explained that people in the West tend to think that women are employed in the textile and jewelry-making ﬁ  elds in 
poorer countries because the women in these regions are “more docile, submissive, and tradition bound” than women in more prosperous parts of the world. A geogra-pher studying gender asks where these ideas about women come from and how they inﬂ  uence women’s work possi-
bilities and social positions in different places—key ele-ments in making places what they are.
Vulnerable Populations
Power relations can have a fundamental impact on which populations or areas are particularly vulner-able to disease, death, injury, or famine. Geographers use mapping and spatial analysis to predict and explain what populations or people will be affected most by natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanoes, hurri-canes, and tsunamis or by environmental policies. The study of vulnerability requires thinking geographically because not all people and places are affected in the same way by social, political, economic, or environ-mental change. Rather, vulnerability is fundamentally Guest Field Note
One of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity among children under 
the age of ﬁ  ve in developing countries is waterborne disease. My research has focused on building an understanding of the factors that contribute to the vulnerability of young children to this signiﬁ  cant public health problem. I have conducted my research in communities located in the relatively remote Kara-koram Range of northern Pakistan. Of interest to me is the microenvironment of water-related disease risk, and in particular, the factors at the household and local scale that inﬂ  uence the prevalence and severity of childhood illness. One of the primary methodological strategies that I employ in this research involves household microstudies, which entail in-depth interviews with family members (primarily mothers who are the principal child health providers), child health histories, and structured observations. One of the most important ﬁ  ndings of 
this research in these mountain communities, in my opinion, is that the educa-tion, social networks, and empowerment of women are all critical to breaking the cycle of disease impacts and to ensuring long-term child survival.

AIDS, according to his research. Oppong also found that 
women in polygamous relationships in the Muslim part of northern Ghana had lower HIV/AIDS rates. Oppong offers two theories to explain why women Muslims in polygamous relationships had lower HIV/AIDS rates: ﬁ  rst, 
as a matter of cultural practice, most Muslims tend to avoid sexual promiscuity, and second, Muslims in Ghana practice circumcision, which helps lower the rate of HIV/AIDS transmission in that part of the country.
Fieldwork helps geographers apply vulnerabil-
ity theory to understand how existing spatial structures, power relationships, and social networks affect the sus-ceptibility of people to diseases and and other hazards around the world.HIV/AIDS is much more prevalent among homosexual and bisexual men than among heterosexual men and women. In Subsaharan Africa, women have much higher rates of HIV/AIDS than men. As Oppong explains, “AIDS as a global problem has unique local expressions that reﬂ  ect the spatial distribution and social networks of vulnerable social groups.”
According to Oppong, in most of Subsaharan Africa, 
HIV/AIDS rates are highest for women in urban areas and for women who work as sex workers. However, in Ghana, HIV/AIDS rates were lower for women in the urban area of Accra. Oppong postulates that women in Accra have lower HIV/AIDS rates because they have greater access to health care than women in rural areas. Women in rural areas who were not treated for malaria had higher incidences of HIV/162 Chapter 5   Identity: Race, Ethnicity, Gender, and Sexuality

Women in Subsaharan Africa
Migration ﬂ  ows, birth rates, and child mortality rates 
affect the gender composition of cities, states, and regions. 
Some regions of the world have become male-dominated, whereas other regions have become female-dominated—at least numerically.
Much of Subsaharan Africa, especially rural areas, 
is dominated numerically by women. In this region of the world, most rural to urban migrants are men. Domosh and Seager point out that men leave rural areas to work in heavy industry and mines in the cities, “while women are left behind to tend the farms and manage the household econ-omy. Indeed parts of rural South Africa and Zimbabwe have become feminized zones virtually depopulated of men.”
In the large region of Subsaharan Africa, women out-
number men in many rural areas. Women in Subsaharan Africa have heavy responsibilities, coupled in many places with few rights and little say (Fig. 5.15). Women produce an estimated 70 percent of the region’s food, almost all of it without the aid of modern technology. Their back-breaking hand-cultivation of corn and other staples is an endless task. As water supplies decrease, the exhausting walk to the nearest pump gets longer. Firewood is being cut at ever-greater distances from the village, and the task of hauling it home becomes more difﬁ  cult every year. As 
men leave for the towns, sometimes to marry other wives and have other children, the women left in the villages often struggle for survival.
Even though a woman in this position becomes the 
head of a household, if she goes to a bank for a loan she may well be refused; traditional banks throughout much of Africa do not lend money to rural women.

T oday, the country where women hold the highest 
proportion of legislative seats is neither Uganda nor South 
Africa. Rather, another African country, Rwanda, is the ﬁ  rst 
country in the world where women hold more than 50 per-cent of the legislative seats. Women passed the 50 percent mark in the 2008 election in Rwanda (Figure 5.17). Rwanda suffered a bloody civil war in the 1990s and over 800,000 people died (one-tenth of the population at the time), a majority of whom were men. Immediately after the war, women accounted for more than 70 percent of the popula-tion of the country. T oday, women account for 55 percent of the voting-age population. The Rwandan constitution, adopted in 2003, recognizes the equality of women and set a quota of at least 30 percent women in all govern-ment decision-making bodies. Of the 80 legislative seats in Rwanda, 24 are reserved for women. In these 24 seats, the only candidates are women and only women can vote.
Dowry Deaths in India
On a 2004 Oprah! show, the talk show hostess interviewed journalist Lisa Ling about her travels through India and her reports on dowry deaths in India. The Chicago audi-ence looked stunned to discover that thousands of girls in India are still betrothed through arranged marriages and that in some extreme cases, disputes over the dowry, which is the price to be paid by the bride’s family to the groom’s father, have led to the death of the bride. The bride may be brutally punished, often burned, or killed for her father’s failure to fulﬁ  ll a marriage agreement. children, she might wish to apply for title to the land she has occupied and farmed for decades, but in many places land titles are not awarded to women.
Y oung girls soon become trapped in the cycle of female 
poverty and overwork. Often there is little money for school fees; what is available ﬁ  rst goes to pay for the boys. As soon as she can carry anything at all, the girl goes with her mother to weed the ﬁ  elds, bring back ﬁ  rewood, or fetch water (Fig. 5.16). She will do so for 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, during all the years she remains capable of working. In East Africa, cash crops such as tea are sometimes called “men’s crops” because the men trade in what the women produce. When the government of Kenya tried to increase the productivity on the tea plantations in the 1970s and 1980s, the govern-ment handed out bonuses—not to the women who did all of the work but to the men who owned title to the land!
Since the 1990s, women have lobbied for greater 
representation in governments in southern and east-ern Africa. Uganda was a leader in afﬁ  rmative action for women by setting up a quota or guarantee that women must hold at least 20 percent of the legislative seats. In South Africa, Apartheid, the systematic oppression of the majority black population by the minority white popu-lation, ended in 1994. The South African government established a constitution with universal suffrage (voting rights) in 1997. The constitution does not include an afﬁ  r-
mative action policy for women’s representation in the parliament. Instead, major political parties, starting with the African National Congress (ANC) reserved a certain percentage of their seats won for women.Field Note
“I am ﬁ  lled with admiration for the women car-rying water on their heads up the bank from the Niger River. Other women are at the water’s edge, ﬁ lling their buckets. These women are perform-
ing a daily ritual requiring incredible endurance and strength. Once they carry their buckets to their dwellings, they will likely turn to preparing the evening meal.”

in fewer dowry deaths in the short run in India. An article 
in The Times of India in 2010 explained police in the city of 
Chennai, where the information technology boom is in full swing, reported that a rise in dowry deaths was likely a result of increasing materialism among the middle class and an ensuing feeling of desperation for more goods and cash, coupled with men in less powerful positions, which had led to more men acting out violently.
Understanding shifting gender relations and power 
structures in India is not at all easy. Just as some statis-tics point to an improving place of women in Indian society, other statistics conﬁ  rm India still has a prefer-ence for males overall. India’s 2011 census reported a sex ratio of 940 girls for every 1,000 boys, which looks to be an improvement over the 2001 sex ratio of 933 girls for every 1,000 boys. However, the sex ratio for children 0 to 6 years old in India was at a record low of 914 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2011. The 2011 census data sur-prised many because between 2001 and 2011, while India gained unprecedented economic growth, the number of girls ages 0 to 6 dropped from 927 in 2001 to 914 in 2011. Many pregnant women in India, especially in northern states, undergo gender-determining tests (ultrasound and amniocentesis) and elect to have abortions when the fetus is a girl. Girls who make it to birth may suffer female infanticide as many parents fear the cost of dowries and extend little social value to girls.
In India and elsewhere, directing the attention of 
people in far-ﬂ  ung places to social ills—moving the issues up in scale—has the potential to create change. Y et prob-lems cannot really be solved unless power relations shift at the family, local, regional, and national scales. As the num-ber of women and men in the middle class in urban India continues to rise, love marriages will continue to rise, as well. The number of dowry deaths, arranged marriages, and divorces in the country will continue to ﬂ  uctuate as 
power relations shift across gender and scales.
Shifting Power Relations among Ethnic Groups
In Chapter 4, we discussed local cultures that deﬁ  ne them-
selves ethnically. The presence of local ethnic cultures can be seen in the cultural landscapes of places we discussed in Chapter 4: “Little Sweden” in Kansas or the Italian North End in Boston. In many places, more than one ethnic group lives in a place, creating unique cultural landscapes and revealing how power relations factor into the ways ethnicities are constructed, revised, and solidiﬁ  ed, where 
ethnic groups live, and who is subjugating whom.
Three urban geographers, John Frazier, Florence 
Margai, and Eugene T ettey-Fio, tracked the ﬂ  ow of peo-ple and shifts in power relations among the multiple eth-nic groups that have lived in Alameda County, California, in their book Race and Place: Equity Issues in Urban America. Only a small fraction of India’s girls are involved in dowry deaths, but the practice is not declining. According to the Indian government, in 1985, the number was 999; in 1987, 1786 women died at the hands of vengeful husbands or in-laws; in 1989, 2436 perished; in 2001, more than 7000 women died; and in 2009, it was reported that 8383 women died from dowry deaths. These ﬁ  gures report 
only conﬁ  rmed dowry deaths; many more are believed to occur but are reported as suicides, kitchen accidents, or other fatal domestic incidents.
The power relationships that place women below 
men in India cannot simply be legislated away. Govern-ment entities in India (federal as well as State) have set up legal aid ofﬁ  ces to help women who fear dowry death and 
seek assistance. In 1984, the national legislature passed the Family Courts Act, creating a network of “family courts” to hear domestic cases, including dowry disputes. But the judges tend to be older males, and their chief objective, according to women’s support groups, is to hold the fam-ily together—that is, to force the threatened or battered woman back into the household. Hindu culture attaches great importance to the family structure, and the family courts tend to operate on this principle.
Recognizing that movement away from arranged 
marriages and dowries among the Indian population is slow in coming, the journalist and talk show host took the issue of dowry deaths to the global scale —to generate 
activism in the West and create change at the local scale in India. Ling explained that the place of women in India has changed little. She described women as a ﬁ  nancial 
burden on the bride’s family, who must save for a sizable dowry to marry off the woman. Ling describes the dowry as a ﬁ  nancial transaction; through marriage the burden 
of the woman moves from the bride’s family to her hus-band’s family. Y et Winfrey and Ling interviewed a woman in India to show that global change can help make local change possible. Nisha Sharma was to marry in front of 1500 guests in a town just outside of the capital of New Delhi. On her wedding day, the groom’s family demanded $25,000 in addition to the numerous luxury items they had already received as dowry (including washing machines, a ﬂ at screen TV , and a car). Nisha’s father refused to pay, the 
man’s family became violent, and Nisha called the police on her cell phone. She has become a local hero and is also an example in the West of how to beat the dowry deaths using global technology, in this case, a cell phone.
India is starting to see the impact of its booming econ-
omy and growing proportion of educated young women and men in well paid jobs on marriage. The number of love marriages is on the rise (Fig. 5.18), and many couples in love marriages are meeting on-line in India. The number of divorces is also on the rise with 1 in 1,000 marriages ending in divorce in India today, which is one of the lowest divorce rates in the world but is also double the country’s divorce rate ﬁ  ve years ago. These changes will not necessarily result c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 165  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 165  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Chinese Exclusion Act, which prohibited immigration of 
Chinese in 1882. Chinese exclusion efforts persisted for decades afterward in Alameda County and resulted in the city of Oakland moving Chinatown several times.
During the 1910s, the economy of the region grew 
again, but the city of Oakland limited the Chinese residents to Chinatown, using ethnic segregation to keep them apart from the rest of the population. Frazier, Margai, and T ettey-Fio described how Oakland’s Chinatown was dictated by law and not elected by choice:
At a time when the Chinese were beneﬁ  ting from a better economy, the “whites only” speciﬁ  cations of local zoning and neighborhood regulations forced separatism that segregated the Oakland Chinese into the city’s Chinatown. What today The county borders San Francisco and includes the geo-graphic areas of Berkeley and Oakland. Latinos populated the region prior to the Gold Rush. After 1850, migrants from China came to the county. The ﬁ  rst Asian migrants to the county were widely dispersed, but the ﬁ  rst African 
Americans lived in a segregated section of the county.
Areas with multiple ethnicities often experience an 
ebb and ﬂ  ow of acceptance over time. When the economy is booming, residents are generally more accepting of each other. When the economy takes a downturn, residents often begin to resent each other and can blame the “Other” for their economic hardship (for example, “they” took all the jobs). In Alameda County, much of the population resented Chinese migrants when the economy took a downturn in the 1870s. The United States government passed the ﬁ  rst  Figure 5.17

educated, are not residentially segregated from the white 
population. However, the newer immigrants from Asia (mainly Southeast Asia—during and following the Viet-nam War) are segregated from whites residentially, mixing much more with the African American population in inner-city neighborhoods. Here, Asians experience a high rate of poverty, much like the Hispanic and African American populations in the same regions of the county do.
In California and in much of the rest of the United 
States, the “Asian” box is drawn around a stereotype of what some call the “model minority.” Frazier and his col-leagues explain the myth of the model minority: the myth “paints Asians as good, hardworking people who, despite their suffering through discrimination, harassment, and exclusion, have found ways to prosper through peaceful means.” Other researchers have debunked the myth by is sometimes presented as an example of Chinese unity and choice was, in fact, place dictated by law.
Until World War II, the Chinese were segregated 
from the rest of Oakland’s population. When the war began, residents of Alameda County, like much of the rest of the United States, focused on the Japanese population in the county, persecuting, segregating, and blaming them. After World War II, the ethnic population of Asians in Alam-eda County became more complex. The Asian population alone doubled in the decade between 1980 and 1990 and diversiﬁ  ed to include not only Chinese and Japanese but 
also Koreans, Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Laotians. In Alameda County today, as in much of the rest of the United States, the ﬁ  rst wave of immigrants from Asia (mainly from China, India, and Korea), who came to the region already GREENLAND

dustrialization (see Chapter 11). As plants closed and white 
laborers left the neighborhoods, a Hispanic population migrated into southeastern Los Angeles. A housing crunch followed in the 1980s, as more and more Hispanic migrants headed to southeastern Los Angeles. With a cheap labor supply now readily available in the region again, companies returned to southeastern Los Angeles, this time focusing on smaller-scale production of textiles, pharmaceuticals, furni-ture, and toys. In addition, the region attracted industrial toxic-waste disposal and petrochemical reﬁ  ning facilities.
In his study of the region, Curtis records the changes to 
the cultural landscape in the process. He uses the term barri-oization (derived from the Spanish word for neighborhood, barrio) to describe a change that saw the Hispanic population of a neighborhood jump from 4 percent in 1960 to over 90 percent in 2000. With the ethnic succession of the neighbor-hood from white to Hispanic, the cultural landscape changed to reﬂ  ect the culture of the new population. The structure of the streets and the layout of the housing remained largely the same, giving the Hispanic population access to desig-nated parks, schools, libraries, and community centers built by the previous residents and rarely found in other barrios in Southern California. However, the buildings, signage, and landscape changed as “traditional Hispanic housescape ele-ments, including the placement of fences and yard shrines as well as the use of bright house colors” diffused through the barrios. Curtis explains that these elements were added to existing structures, houses, and buildings originally built by the white working class of southeastern Los Angeles.
The inﬂ  ux of new ethnic groups into a region, the 
replacement of one ethnic group by another within neigh-borhoods, changes to the cultural landscape, the per-sistence of myths such as the “model minority” myth of Asians, and an economic downturn can create a great deal of volatility in a city.
On April 29–30, 1992, the City of Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia, became engulfed in one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in United States history. During the two days of rioting 43 people died, 2383 people were injured, and 16,291 people were arrested. Property damage was estimated at approxi-mately $1 billion, and over 22,700 law enforcement personnel were deployed to quell the unrest. According to the media, the main catalyst for the mass upheaval was the announce-ment of a “not guilty” verdict in the trial of four white Los Angeles police ofﬁ  cers accused of using excessive force in the videotaped arrest of Rodney King, a black motorist. T o the general public, the Los Angeles riots became yet another symbol for the sorry state of race relations between blacks and whites in the United States. Y et, a geographic perspective on the Los Angeles riots helps us understand that they were not simply the product of localized reactions to police bru-tality, but reﬂ  ected sweeping economic, political, and ethnic changes unfolding at regional and even global scales.
The riots took place in South Central Los Angeles. 
Like the region of southeast Los Angeles (described above), the South Central area was once a thriving industrial region demonstrating statistically the different levels of economic success experienced by various Asian peoples, with most success going to the ﬁ  rst wave of migrants and lower paying jobs going to newer migrants. Both groups are burdened with a myth that stereotypes them as the “model minority.”
Power Relations in Los Angeles
Over the last four decades, the greatest migration ﬂ  ow 
into California and the southwestern United States has come from Latin America and the Caribbean, especially Mexico. The 2010 Census reported a 43 percent increase in the Hispanic or Latino population of the country. The City of Los Angeles had over 3.79 million people, 48.48 percent of whom were Hispanic. The Hispanic popula-tion in the city grew from 39.32 percent of the population in 1990 to 48.48 percent by 2010.
The area of southeastern Los Angeles County is today 
“home to one of the largest and highest concentrations of Latinos in Southern California,” according to a study by geographer James Curtis. Four decades ago, this area of Los Angeles was populated by working-class whites who were segregated from the African American and Hispanic popu-lations through discriminatory policies and practices. Until the 1960s, southeastern Los Angeles was home to corpora-tions such as General Motors, Bethlehem Steel, and Weiser Lock. During the 1970s and 1980s, corporations began to close as the United States went through a period of dein- Figure 5.18
Mumbai, India. Arranged marriages were the norm not long 
ago in India, and the family of the bride was expected to pro-vide a dowry to the groom’s family. Arranged marriages are still widespread in parts of rural India, but in urban areas they are rapidly giving way to love marriages follow romantic courtships.  
Evidence of this cultural shift is not hard to ﬁ  nd on the streets of India’s major cities.

Geographer James Johnson and his colleagues 
explored the impact of economic loss on the ethnic and 
social geography of South Central Los Angeles. They found that the population of the area was over 90 percent African American in 1970, and by 1990, the population was evenly split between African Americans and Hispanics. This change in population composition was accompanied by a steady inﬂ  ux of Korean residents and small-business own-ers who were trying to ﬁ  nd a niche in the rapidly changing urban area (Fig. 5.19).with dependable, unionized jobs employing the resident population. In the 1960s, however, the population of South Central Los Angeles was working-class African Ameri-can, and the population of southeastern Los Angeles was working-class white. After 1970, South Central Los Ange-les experienced a substantial decrease in the availability of high-paying, unionized manufacturing jobs when plants closed and relocated outside of the city and even outside the country. The people of South Central Los Angeles lost over 70,000 manufacturing jobs between 1978 and 1982 alone!

170 Chapter 5   Identity: Race, Ethnicity, Gender, and Sexuality
Geographers who study race, ethnicity, gender, or sexu-
ality are interested in the power relations embedded in a place from which assumptions about “others” are formed or reinforced. Consider your own place, your campus, or your locality. What power relations are embedded in this place?Johnson and his colleagues argued that the Los 
Angeles riots were more than a spontaneous reaction to a verdict. They were rooted in the growing despair and frustration of different ethnic groups competing for a decreasing number of jobs in an environment of declin-ing housing conditions and scarce public resources. At a time when signiﬁ  cant unemployment is affecting com-
munities all over the United States, their work shows the importance of looking beyond the immediate catalysts of particular news events to the local, national, and global geographical contexts in which they unfold.
Summary
Identity is a powerful concept. The way we make sense of ourselves is a personal journey that is mediated and inﬂ  uenced by the political, social, and cultural contexts in which 
we live and work. Group identities such as gender, ethnicity, race, and sexuality are con-structed, both by self-realization and by identifying against and across scales. When learning about new places and different people, humans are often tempted to put places and people into boxes, into myths or stereotypes that make them easily digestible.
The geographer, especially one who spends time in the ﬁ  eld, recognizes that how 
people shape and create places varies across time and space and that time, space, and place shape people, both individually and in groups. James Curtis ably described the work of a geographer who studies places: “But like the popular images and stereotypical portrayals of all places—whether positive or negative, historical or contemporary—these mask a reality on the ground that is decidedly more complex and dynamic, from both the economic and social perspectives.” What Curtis says about places is true about people as well. What we may think  to be positive identities, such as the myths of “Orientalism” 
or of the “model minority,” and what we know are negative social ills, such as racism and dowry deaths, are all decidedly more complex and dynamic than they ﬁ  rst seem.

Field Note What Should I Say?
In stores throughout Brussels, Belgium, you can see the capital city’s bilingualism 
all around you—literally. From McDonald’s to health insurance ofﬁ  ces (Fig. 6.1) to the metro, signs in Brussels are posted in duplicate, with one in Flemish (a variant of Dutch) and one in French.
Walking into a travel agency in Brussels one afternoon, I immediately noticed 
the signs in duplicate: two signs towered over the woman behind the counter; two signs advertised a new budget airline carrier that would be serving the Brussels air-port; two signs labeled the restrooms; and two signs announced the travel agency’s hours of operation. Figure 6.1

 What Should I Say? 173
I debated for a minute whether to speak to the person behind the counter 
in French or Flemish. She was speaking Flemish with the person in front of me, 
but I decided to use French since my knowledge of that language is better. The student from Italy who stood behind me in line apparently had no such debate. She stepped up to the counter, asked her question in English, and received a reply in excellent English.
Many geographers are initially drawn to the discipline through maps. 
However, maps, especially at the world or continental scale, generalize so much information that they hide the complexities of everyday life. Once you become a geographer, you begin to question every map you examine. Look at the European map of languages (Fig. 6.2), and zero in on Belgium. The map shows a neat line dividing Flemish speakers (a Germanic language) in the northern region of Flanders from French speakers (a Romance language) in the southern region of Wallonia.
Behind this neat line on the language map is a complicated, at times con-
tentious, linguistic transition zone. To understand language patterns in Belgium, we must also study the issue at the local scale. Although the bilingual capital of Brussels is located in the Flemish-speaking north (Flanders), for an estimated 85 percent of the locals, French is the mother tongue (Fig. 6.3).
In Belgium, economic differences between linguistic groups have been a divi-
sive issue for generations. During the nineteenth century, French speakers con-trolled the industrial economy and government of the country. The concentration of industry in southern Belgium strengthened their position. The French-speaking elite in Brussels and other Flemish cities began a process of “Frenchiﬁ  cation.” They 
promoted French and used it when interacting with their counterparts in other countries. By the twentieth century, a majority of the people in Brussels spoke French, although people in the areas surrounding Brussels continued to speak Flemish.
Many people in northern Belgium (surrounding Brussels) opposed the growing 
Frenchiﬁ  cation of Flanders. The leaders of the Flemish movement initially sought 
linguistic rights, speciﬁ  cally the right of Flemish speakers to use their language in 
public affairs, court proceedings, and schools. Yet they were constantly frustrated with the opposition of French speakers to their demands. By the 1920s, the Flemish leadership began calling for the country to be partitioned along linguistic lines so that those living in northern Belgium could control their own affairs.
By the 1960s, a ﬁ  xed partition scheme came into being, which divided the 
country into Flemish-speaking Flanders in the north and French-speaking Wallonia in the south. The government recognizes Brussels as a distinct region, a bilingual capital, but places strict limits on the use of French in the rest of northern Belgium.
The partitioning process produced upheavals throughout the country. The 
experience helped strengthen the sense of Flemish identity and fueled a counter-movement among the French Walloons. With language-group identity on the rise, conﬂ  icts between linguistic “communities” became a central feature of Belgian 
political life. After the 1960s, Belgian heavy industry became less competitive, and the country’s economy shifted to high technology, light industry, and services, with much of the new economy concentrating in Flemish-speaking Flanders. As a result, the economic power in Belgium ﬂ  ipped, with the French-speaking indus-
trial south taking a back seat to the Flemish-speaking north. Today, Wallonia has an unemployment rate of 14 percent, and economists consider unemployment in Wallonia to be structural, making it difﬁ  cult for the economy or job market to c06Language.indd Page 173  9/12/11  11:08 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 173  9/12/11  11:08 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

bounce back. Flanders, on the other hand, has an unemployment rate below 6 per-
cent, which gives it one of the lower unemployment rates in Europe.
The vast majority of power and decision making rests with the individual 
governments of Flanders and Wallonia rather than in a centralized government in Brussels. With their newfound wealth, many in Flanders wanted to see a greater federalization of the country, which would put even more power in each of the two regions. Today, no political party in Belgium operates at the national scale. Wallonia and Flanders each have their own political parties that vie for power in their respective regions. Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that it took Belgium nine months to form a government after the spring 2007 elections. In June 2010, Belgium held regional elections, and a moderate separatist party won the most parliamentary seats in the more prosperous Flanders region. The New 
Y ork Times quoted the political leader of the separatist Flemish nationalist party as saying, “We do not want a revolution. We do not want to declare Flanders inde-pendent overnight. But we do believe in a gradual evolution.”
Brussels is going in another direction entirely, serving as the principal capital 
of the European Union (EU). Brussels is home to the EU Council and Commission. Moreover, much of the committee work done by the European Parliament takes place in Brussels (the formal home of the Parliament is in Strasbourg, France). The role Brussels serves as the European Union capital may prevent Belgium from split-ting into two countries. Both Flanders and Wallonia have vested interests in Brussels, so neither would abandon it lightly. And the French-speaking majority in Brussels has little interest in casting its lot with the region in which it is situated—Flanders. Some have proposed making Brussels a capital district for the European Union, much as the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) serves in the United States.
The example of Belgium gives us a multitude of insights into language. 
Language questions are often politicized. Language frequently is tied to other identity issues such as socioeconomic status. And while all of the debates about c06Language.indd Page 175  9/12/11  11:08 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 175  9/12/11  11:08 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

national and local language preservation abound, English continues to expand as a 
global language for commerce, trade, and popular culture.
In this chapter, we question what languages are and examine the roles lan-
guages play in cultures. We study the spatial distribution of the world’s languages and learn how languages diffuse, change, and even become extinct. Finally, we examine how language contributes to making places unique.
Key Questions For Chapter 6
 1. What are languages, and what role do languages play in cultures?
 2. Why are languages distributed the way they are?
 3. How do languages diffuse?
 4. What role does language play in making places?
WHAT ARE LANGUAGES, AND WHAT ROLE 
DO LANGUAGES PLAY IN CULTURES?
A scene in Quentin T arantino’s cult classic movie 
Pulp Fiction shows Vincent and Jules in the front seat of the 
car talking about France. Vincent, trying to demonstrate his knowledge of French culture, turns to Jules and says, “Y ou know what they call a . . . . a . . . . a quarter pounder with cheese in Paris?” Jules replies, “They don’t call it a quarter pounder with cheese?” Vincent, ever the expert, explains in a few choice words that France uses the metric system and that the French would not know what a quar-ter pounder is. Then, he explains, “They call it a ‘royale’ with cheese.” Jules, surprised, asks, “What do they call a Big Mac?” Vincent explains, “Well a Big Mac is a Big Mac, but they call it ‘Le Big Mac.’”
This humorous exchange shows the juxtaposition of 
two opposing forces in our globalized world: globalization of culture and preservation of local and national culture. Are the two contradictory, or can we have globalization of restaurants, food, music, and culture while preserving local languages?
Language is a fundamental element of local and 
national culture. The French government has worked dil-igently, even aggressively, to protect the French language, dating back to 1635 and the creation of the Académie Française, an institution charged with standardizing and protecting the French language. Since the 1970s, diffu-sion of globalized terms into France has posed an enor-mous challenge for the Académie Française.
With the support of many French people, the French 
government passed a law in 1975 banning the use of foreign words in advertisements, television, and radio broadcasts, and ofﬁ  cial documents, unless no French equivalent could be found. In 1992, France amended its constitution to make French the ofﬁ  cial language. In 1994, the French govern-
ment passed another law to stop the use of foreign (mainly English) words in France, with a hefty ﬁ  ne imposed for vio-lators. The law mandates French translations for globalized words, requiring the use of ofﬁ  cial French terms in ofﬁ  cial 
communications rather than le meeting, le weekend, le drugstore, or le hamburger. The Internet, where 49.9 per-cent of Internet users browse in English or Chinese (Fig. 6.4), has posed another set of challenges for the Académie Française. Many of the translations the Académie requires are somewhat cumbersome. For example, the ofﬁ  cial 
translation of e-mail was “courrier electronique,” but the Académie shortened it to “courriel.”
In addition to demonstrating the conﬂ  icting forces 
of globalized language and local or national language, the example of France reveals that language is much more than a way of communicating. A language is a set of sounds and symbols that is used for communication. But language is also an integral part of culture, reﬂ  ecting and shaping it.
Language and Culture
Language is one of the cornerstones of culture; it shapes our very thoughts. We can use vast vocabularies to describe new experiences, ideas, and feelings, or we can create new words that represent these things. Who we are as a culture, as a people, is reinforced and redeﬁ  ned 
moment by moment through shared language. Language reﬂ ects where a culture has been, what a culture values, 
even how people in a culture think, describe, and expe-rience events.Perhaps the easiest way to understand the role of language in culture is to examine people who have experienced the loss of language under pressure from oth-ers. During colonization, both abroad and within coun-tries, colonizers commonly forced the colonized people c06Language.indd Page 176  9/12/11  11:08 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 176  9/12/11  11:08 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

to speak the language of the colonizer. These language 
policies continued in many places until recently and were enforced primarily through public (government) and church (mission) schools.
American, Canadian, Australian, Russian, and New 
Zealand governments each had policies of forced assimila-tion during the twentieth century, including not allowing indigenous peoples to speak native languages. For example, the United States forced American Indians to learn and speak English. Both mission schools and government schools enforced English-only policies in hopes of assimilating American Indians into the dominant culture. In an interview with the producers of an educational video, Clare Swan, an elder in the Kenaitze band of the Dena’ina Indians in Alaska, eloquently described the role of language in culture:
No one was allowed to speak the language—the Dena’ina language. They [the American government] didn’t allow it in schools, and a lot of the women had married non-native men, and the men said, “You’re American now so you can’t speak the language.” So, we became invisible in the community. Invisible to each other. And, then, because we couldn’t speak the language—what happens when you can’t speak your own language is you have to think with someone else’s words, and that’s a dread-ful kind of isolation [emphasis added].
Shared language makes people in a culture visible to each other and to the rest of the world. Language helps to bind a cultural identity. Language is also quite personal. Our thoughts, expressions, and dreams are articulated in our language; to lose that ability is to lose a lot.
Language can reveal much about the way people 
and cultures view reality. Some African languages have no word or term for the concept of a god. Some Asian lan-guages have no tenses and no system for reporting chron-ological events, reﬂ  ecting the lack of cultural distinction 
between then and now. Given the American culture’s pre-occupation with dating and timing, it is difﬁ  cult for many in the United States to understand how speakers of these languages perceive the world.
Language is so closely tied to culture that people use 
language as a weapon in cultural conﬂ  ict and political strife. In the United States, where the Spanish-speaking popula-tion is growing (Fig. 6.5), some Spanish speakers and their advocates are demanding the use of Spanish in public affairs. In turn, people opposed to the use of Spanish in the United States are leading countermovements to promote “Ofﬁ  cial 
English” policies, where English would be the ofﬁ  cial lan-
guage of government. Of course, Spanish is one of many non-English languages spoken in the United States, but it overshadows all others in terms of number of speakers and is therefore the focus of the ofﬁ  cial English movement (T able 6.1). During the 1980s, over 30 different States con-
sidered passing laws declaring English the State’s ofﬁ  cial

country between France and Great Britain. Government 
documents and even scholarly journals are printed in both English and French. Most of the country’s French speak-ers live in the province of Quebec. The majority of people in Quebec speak French at home.
Since the 1970s, the Quebecois (people of Quebec) 
have periodically called for more independence for their province within Canada, even voting on secession at times. Although a majority has never voted for secession, the provincial government has passed several laws requir-ing and promoting the use of French in the province. In 1977, the Quebec government compelled all businesses language. Some 30 States today have declared English the ofﬁ cial language of the State either by statute or by amend-
ing the State constitution (one law was subsequently over-turned by the courts). A few States have passed English-plus laws, encouraging bilingualism for non-English speakers, and a few other States are ofﬁ  cially bilingual, including 
Hawai’i (Hawai’ian and English), or have bi-lingual educa-tion, including New Mexico (Spanish and English).
In Quebec, Canada, the focus is on passing laws 
that promote the use of the province’s distinct version of the French language. The country of Canada is ofﬁ  -
cially bilingual, a reﬂ  ection of the colonial division of the  Figure 6.5

in the province to demonstrate that they functioned in 
French. Upon passage of this law, many businesses and individuals moved out of the province of Quebec into neighboring Ontario. In 1993, the Quebec government passed a law requiring the use of French in advertising (Fig. 6.6). The Quebec law allows the inclusion of both French and English (or another language) translations on signage, as long as the French letters are twice the size of the other language’s letters.Not all of Quebec’s residents identify with the 
French language. Within the province, a small propor-tion of people speak English at home, others speak indig-enous languages, and still others speak another language altogether—one associated with their country of origin. When the Quebec Parliament passed several laws pro-moting French during the 1980s and 1990s, members of Canada’s First Nations, including the Cree and Mohawk, who live in Quebec, expressed a desire to remain part of

in many (or nearly all) aspects are Serbian and Croatian, 
Hindi and Urdu, Spanish and Portuguese, and Navajo and Apache.
Given the complexities of distinguishing languages 
from dialects, the actual number of languages in use in the world remains a matter of considerable debate. The most conservative calculation puts the number at about 3000. However, most linguists and linguistic geographers today recognize between 5000 and 7000 languages, including more than 600 in India and over 2000 in Africa.
Standardized Language
Language is dynamic: new discoveries, technologies, and ideas require new words. T echnologically advanced soci-eties are likely to have a standard language , one that is 
published, widely distributed, and purposefully taught. In some countries, the government sustains the standard language through ofﬁ  cial state examinations for teachers 
and civil servants. Ireland promotes the use of the Irish (Celtic) language by requiring all government employees to pass an Irish-language examination before they can be hired. The phrase “the King’s English” is a popular refer-ence to the fact that the English spoken by well-educated people in London and its environs is regarded as British Received Pronunciation (BRP) English—that is, the standard.
Who decides what the standard language will be? 
Not surprisingly, the answer has to do with inﬂ  uence 
and power. In France, the Académie Française chose the French spoken in and around Paris as the ofﬁ  cial, stan-
dard language during the sixteenth century. In China, the government chose the Northern Mandarin Chinese heard in and around the capital, Beijing, as the ofﬁ  cial 
standard language. Although this is China’s ofﬁ  cial stan-
dard language, the linguistic term Chinese actually incor-porates many variants. The distinction between the stan-dard language and variations of it is not unique to China; it is found in all but the smallest societies. The Italian of Sicily is quite different from the Italian spoken north of Venice, and both tongues differ from the standard Italian spoken in Florence and T uscany, the region where many leaders of the Italian Renaissance wrote and published in what became the standard Italian language.
Dialects
Variants of a standard language along regional or ethnic lines are called dialects. Differences in vocabulary, syntax (the way words are put together to form phrases), pronunci-ation, cadence (the rhythm of speech), and even the pace of speech all mark a speaker’s dialect. Even if the written form of a statement adheres to the standard language, an accent Canada should Quebec secede from the country. During the same period, Quebec has experienced a ﬂ  ow of inter-
national migrants, many of whom seek residence in Quebec as a way to enter Canada and North America at large. These new immigrants must learn French under Quebec law.
Quebec, like any other place, is susceptible to 
change. Calls for independence in Quebec are waning since the separatist political party has captured fewer seats in recent parliamentary elections for the province. Nonetheless, the Quebecois still feel a connection to France. The province even has a presence in Paris in the Maison Quebec (House of Quebec), an embassy-like entity of the province. As people, ideas, and power ﬂ  ow through 
the province, change will continue. Y et, the province’s laws, programs, presence in France, and the desire of the Quebecois to remain loyal to their French language will at the very least keep the language alive as the province continues to experience change.
What Is a Language?
Many geography textbooks differentiate languages based on a criterion of mutual intelligibility. Mutual intel-ligibility means that two people can understand each other when speaking. The argument goes that if two of us are speaking two different languages, say Spanish and Portuguese, we will not be able to understand each other, but if we are speaking two dialects of one language, we will achieve mutual understanding. Y et linguists have rejected the criterion of mutual intelligibility as strongly as geog-raphers have rejected environmental determinism.
First, mutual intelligibility is almost impossible to 
measure. Even if we used mutual intelligibility as a cri-terion, many languages would fail the test. Famous lin-guist Max Weinreich once said that “a language is a dialect with an army.” Think about it. How could we possibly see Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese Chinese as dialects of the same language, when two people speaking the lan-guage to each other cannot understand what each other is saying? Both can read the standard form of Chinese that has been built up by a strongly centralized Chinese gov-ernment. But the spoken dialects are not mutually intel-ligible. Y et, we see Chinese as one language because of the weight of political and social institutions that lie behind it.
A further complication with the mutual intelligibil-
ity test is revealed in Scandinavia, where, for example, a Danish speaker and a Norwegian speaker (at least if they come from Oslo) will be able to understand what each other is saying. Y et we think of Danish and Norwegian as distinct languages. Having a Norwegian language helps Norwegians identify themselves as Norwegians rather than as Danes or Scandinavians. Other languages that are recognized as separate but are mutually intelligible c06Language.indd Page 180  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 180  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

limits as isoglosses. An isogloss is a geographic bound-
ary within which a particular linguistic feature occurs, but such a boundary is rarely a simple line. Usually, outlying areas of usage extend beyond the isogloss. Fuzzy iso-glosses may signify that the dialect has expanded or con-tracted. Linguists who study dialects examine pronuncia-tions, vocabularies, use of colloquial phrases, and syntax to determine isoglosses.
Linguistic geographer Hans Kurath published 
atlases of dialects in the United States, deﬁ  ning Northern, 
Southern, and Midland dialect in the eastern part of the country. In the mid-1900s, Kurath drew distinct isoglosses among the three dialects, based on pronunciation of cer-tain sounds and words. A more recent study of American dialects by linguist Bert Vaux used a 122-question online survey to map dialects in the United States. Maps of the soda, pop, and coke question (Fig. 6.7) and the hero, sub, poor-boy question reveal the prominent dialects of New England and the deep South, the fuzzy border between the two regions (Kurath’s Midland dialect), the mixture of dialects in much of the rest of the country, and a few scat-tered areas outside the dialect regions where one or the other dialect dominates.can reveal the regional home of a person who reads the statement aloud. In the United States, the words “horse” and “oil” are written the same way in New England and in the South, but to the Southerner, the New Englander may be saying “hahse,” and to the New Englander, the Southerner seems to be saying “all.”
Linguists think about dialects in terms of dialect 
chains, distributed across space. Dialects nearest to each other geographically will be the most similar (greater spatial interaction), but as you travel across the space, the dialects become less intelligible to each other because less interaction occurs. If all of these dialects are part of one language, which one of the dialects is the language? This question points to another challenge in deﬁ  ning languages. 
Is one of the many English dialects in the world the one, true English? Language is actually an umbrella for a collec-tion of dialects, and we tend to see one of these dialects as the “true” language only because it is the one we speak or because it is the one a government claims as the standard.
Frequently, dialects are marked by actual differ-
ences in vocabulary. A single word or group of words can reveal the source area of the dialect. Linguistic geogra-phers map the extent of particular words, marking their

182 Chapter 6   Language
Linguist Bert Vaux’s study of dialects in American English 
points to the differences in words for common things such as soft drinks and sandwiches. Describe a time when you said something and a speaker of another dialect did not understand the word you used. Where did the person with whom you were speaking come from? Was the word a term for a common thing? Why do you think dialects have differ-ent words for common things, things found across dialects, such as soft drinks and sandwiches?WHY ARE LANGUAGES DISTRIBUTED 
THE WAY THEY ARE?
The ﬁ  rst step in mapping the distribution of world 
languages is to classify languages. Linguists and linguistic 
geographers classify languages in terms that are also used in biology and for the same reasons: like species, some lan-guages are related and others are not. At the global scale, we classify languages into language families. Within a single language family, the languages have a shared but fairly distant origin. We break language families into sub-families (divisions within a language family), where the

commonalities are more deﬁ  nite and their origin is more 
recent. Subfamilies consist of individual languages, whose spatial extent is smaller, and every individual language has its dialects, whose territorial extent is smaller still.
Deﬁ  nition and Debate
Although language families and subfamilies seem to be a logical way to classify languages, the classiﬁ  cation of lan-
guages is subject to intense debate. Deﬁ  ning a language 
family is a daunting challenge: some linguists argue that there are not just a few, but many dozens of language fam-ilies. So when you study Figure 6.8, be aware that this is only one depiction of the world’s geography of languages today. This map shows the distribution of some 20 lan-guage families, among which the Indo-European lan-guage family has the widest distribution and claims the largest number of speakers. What you see here, of course, results from a combination of contiguous as well as relo-cation diffusion: Indo-European languages spread from a western source in all directions into Eurasia, but colo-nialism also transplanted Indo-European languages to the Americas, Africa, and Australia.
Even when it comes to individual languages, com-
plicated issues arise. English is the most widely spoken

Southeast Asia had been well established.
Language Formation
In the process of classifying languages, linguists and linguistic geographers study relationships among lan-guages, looking for similarities and differences within and among languages. One way to ﬁ  nd and chart simi-larities among languages is to examine particular words, looking for sound shifts over time and across languages. A sound shift  is a slight change in a word across languages 
within a subfamily or through a language family from the present backward toward its origin. For example, Italian, Spanish, and French are all members of the Romance lan-guage subfamily of the Indo-European language family. One way linguists and linguistic geographers can deter-mine this is by looking at sound shifts for single words across time (all three languages are derived from Latin) and across languages. For example, the Latin word for milk, lacte, became latta in Italian, leche in Spanish, and 
lait in French. Also, the Latin for the number eight, oto, became otto, ocho, and huit, respectively. Even if linguists 
did not already know that Italian, Spanish, and French are languages rooted in Latin, they could deduce a con-nection among the languages through the sound shifts of particular words.
More than two centuries ago William Jones, an 
Englishman living in South Asia, undertook a study of Sanskrit, the language in which ancient Indian religious and literary texts were written. Jones discovered that the vocabulary and grammatical forms of Sanskrit bore a striking resemblance to the ancient Greek and Latin he learned while in college. “No philologer [student of words] could examine all three,” Jones wrote, “with-out believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.” His idea was a revolutionary notion in the 1700s.
During the nineteenth century Jakob Grimm, a 
scholar and a writer of fairy tales, suggested that sound shifts might prove the relationships between languages in a scientiﬁ  c manner. He explained that related languages have similar, but not identical, consonants. He believed these consonants would change over time in a predictable way. Hard consonants, such as the v and t in the German 
word vater, softened into vader (Dutch) and father 
(English). Using Grimm’s theory that consonants became softer as time passed and sounds shifted, linguists realized that consonants would become harder as they went “back-wards” toward the original hearth and original language.
From Jones’s notions and Grimm’s ideas came the 
ﬁ rst major linguistic hypothesis, proposing the existence 
of an ancestral Indo-European language called Proto-Indo-European. Discovery of a Proto-Indo-European Indo-European language, its speakers encircling the world with more than 300 million in North America, 70 million in Britain and Ireland, 25 million in Australia and New Zealand, and tens of millions more in South Africa, India, and elsewhere in the postcolonial world. Hundreds of millions of people speak versions of English as a sec-ond or third language. Our map cannot reﬂ  ect this, but 
the Indo-European family has actually diffused even more than Figure 6.8 suggests.
 Sometimes you will see Chinese listed as the 
language with more speakers than any other, but herein lies still another complication. Although Figure 6.8 shows China and neighboring areas to be the heart-land of the Sino-Tibetan language family, “Mandarin” Chinese, called Putonghua in China, is in common use by less than half of China’s population of 1.34 billion. A detailed language map of China reveals more than 1400 dialects, most of them mutually incomprehensible. What unites the “People of Han” is not their ability to understand each other’s spoken word, but their abil-ity to read the characters in which Chinese is written. When you watch television in China, you will see news reports and other programs subtitled by Chinese char-acters, so that even if the local news anchor speaks in a dialect, the viewer can read and understand what is being said. But this does not mean that a billion Chinese speak Mandarin.
At the other end of the scale, the world map of 
languages shows several language families spoken by dwindling, often marginally located or isolated groups. The Indo-European languages of European coloniz-ers surround the language families of Southeast Asia. Languages in the Austro-Asiatic language family sur-vive in the interior of eastern India and in Cambodia and Laos. Languages in the Austronesian family are numerous and quite diverse, and many of the individual languages are spoken by fewer than 10 million people. Remoteness helps account for the remaining languages in the Amerindian language family. These languages remain strongest in areas of Middle America, the high Andes, and northern Canada.
If we look carefully at the map of world language 
families, some interesting questions arise. Consider, for example, the island of Madagascar off the East African coast. The primary languages people in Madagascar speak belong not to an African language family but to the Austronesian family, the languages of Southeast Asia and the Paciﬁ  c Islands. Why is a language from this family spoken on an island so close to Africa? Anthropologists have found evidence of seafarers from the islands of Southeast Asia crossing the Indian Ocean to Madagascar. At the time, Africans had not sailed across the strait to Madagascar, so no African languages diffused to the island, preserving the Southeast Asian settlements and language for centuries. Later, Africans began to come to

and Finnish, T urkish and Mongolian), the Dravidian lan-
guages of India, and the Afro-Asiatic language family, in which Arabic is dominant (Fig. 6.8).
Locating the Hearth of Proto-Indo-European
German linguist August Schleicher was the ﬁ  rst to com-pare the world’s language families to the branches of a tree (Fig. 6.9). In the mid-nineteenth century, he suggested that new languages form through language divergence, which occurs when spatial interaction among speakers of a language breaks down and the language fragments ﬁ  rst 
into dialects and then into discrete tongues. The process of language divergence has happened between Spanish and Portuguese and is now happening with Quebecois French. Each new language becomes a new leaf on a tree, its branches leading back to the hearth, the trunk of the tree. Through backward reconstruction, linguists and lin-guistic geographers can ﬁ  nd how languages ﬁ  t together and where the branches were once joined. T racing backward far enough, researchers can ﬁ  nd the hearth of a language family.
If linguists and linguistic geographers can ﬁ  nd 
the hearth of the Proto-Indo-European language, they will ﬁ  nd a major part of the tree’s trunk. Finding the trunk is a daunting task, for reconstructing even a small branch of the language tree is complicated. Languages do not change only through divergence (the splitting of branches); they also change through convergence and extinction. If peoples with different languages have con-sistent spatial interaction, language convergence can take place, collapsing two languages into one. Instances of language convergence create special problems for researchers because the rules of reconstruction may not apply or may be unreliable. 
Language extinction creates branches on the tree 
with dead ends, representing a halt in interaction between the extinct language and languages that continued (Fig. 6.10). Languages become extinct either when all 
descendants perish (which can happen when an entire peo-ple succumb to disease or invaders) or when descendants choose to use another language, abandoning the language of their ancestors. The process of language extinction does not occur overnight; typically, it takes place across genera-tions, with degrees of bilingualism occurring in the interim.
T racking the divergence, convergence, extinction, 
and locations of the languages derived from Proto-Indo-European, linguists theorize that the hearth of the Proto-Indo-European language was somewhere in the vicinity of the Black Sea or east-central Europe. From this hearth, Proto-Indo-European speakers dispersed, vocabularies grew, and linguistic divergence occurred, spurring new languages. By analyzing the vocabulary of the Proto-Indo-European language, linguists and geographers can discern the environment and physical geography of the language’s hearth and also deduce aspects of the peoples’ culture and language would give us the hearth of ancient Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. A single Proto-Indo-European hearth would link modern languages from Scandinavia to North Africa and from North America through parts of Asia to Australia. Several research tasks followed from this hypothesis. First, the vocabulary of the proposed ancestral language had to be reconstructed. Second, the hearth of the language had to be located. Third, the routes of diffu-sion needed to be traced.
Reconstructing the Vocabulary of Proto 
Indo-European and Its Ancient Ancestor
Linguists use a technique called backward reconstruc-
tion to track sound shifts and hardening of consonants “backward” toward the original language. If it is possible to deduce a large part of the vocabulary of an extinct lan-guage, a language without any native speakers, it may be feasible to go even further and re-create the language that preceded it. This technique, called deep reconstruction, has yielded some important results.
The work of two Russian scholars in particular has 
had great impact on the deep reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European language and even the ancestral language of the Proto-Indo-European language. Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky began working in the 1960s, each using deep reconstruction to re-create ancient languages. Using words they assumed to be the most sta-ble and dependable parts of a language’s vocabulary, such as those identifying arms, legs, feet, hands, and other body parts, and terms for the sun, moon, and other elements of the natural environment, they reconstructed an inventory of several hundred words. Remarkably, they worked inde-pendently, each unaware of the other’s work for many years. When they ﬁ  nally met and compared their inventories, they found that the inventories were amazingly similar. The scholars agreed that they had established some key charac-teristics not only of the Proto-Indo-European language but also of its ancient ancestor, the Nostratic language.
The Nostratic vocabulary the researchers recon-
structed revealed much about the lives and environments of its speakers. Apparently, they had no names for domesti-cated plants or animals, so Nostratic speakers were hunter-gatherers, not farmers. The Nostratic words for dog and wolf turned out to be the same, suggesting that the domes-tication of wolves may have been occurring at the time people were speaking Nostratic. The oldest known bones of dogs excavated at archaeological sites date from about 14,000 years ago, so Nostratic may have been in use at about that time, well before the First Agricultural Revolution.
Nostratic is believed to be the ancestral language 
not only of Proto-Indo-European, and thus the Indo-European language family as a whole, but also of the Kartvelian languages of the southern Caucasus region, the Uralic-Altaic languages (which include Hungarian c06Language.indd Page 185  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 185  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

moved approximately 18 kilometers (11 miles). This means 
farmers would have completely penetrated the European frontier in about 1500 years, which is close to what the archaeological record suggests. But some of the nonfarm-ing societies in their path held out, and their languages did not change. Thus, Etruscan did not become extinct until Roman times, and Euskera (the Basque language) survives to this day as a direct link to Europe’s prefarming era.
In 1991, the agriculture theory received support 
from analyses of the protein (that is, gene) content of indi-viduals from several thousand locations across Europe. This research conﬁ  rmed the presence of distance decay 
in the geographic pattern: certain genes became steadily less common from southern T urkey across the Balkans and into western and northern Europe. This pattern was interpreted as showing that the farming peoples of Anatolia moved steadily westward and northward (Fig. 6.11). With established farming providing a more reliable food supply, population could increase. As a result, a slow but steady wave of farmers dispersed into Europe and mixed with nonfarming peoples, diluting their genetic identity as the distance from their source area increased.
Despite the genetic gradient identiﬁ  ed in Europe, 
some linguistic geographers continue to favor the dis-persal hypothesis, which holds that the Indo-European languages that arose from Proto-Indo-European were ﬁ rst carried eastward into Southwest Asia, next around the 
Caspian Sea, and then across the Russian-Ukrainian plains and on into the Balkans (Fig. 6.12). As is so often the case, there may be some truth in each hypothesis. If Anatolia were the hearth, the diffusion of Proto-Indo-European could have occurred both westward across southern Europe and in the broad arc shown in Figure 6.12.economy. Judging from the reconstructed vocabulary of Proto-Indo-European, it appears that the language dates back to a people who used horses, developed the wheel, and traded widely in many goods.
Tracing the Routes of Diffusion of Proto-
Indo-European
Several major theories hypothesize how, why, and where 
languages diffuse over time. Each theory varies according to the main impetus for diffusion, and each theory leads us back to different hearths. One commonality among the theories is a focus on Europe. When studying the diffu-sion of Proto-Indo-European, the focus is typically on Europe for two reasons: one, it is clear that the language diffused into Europe over time; and two, a signiﬁ  cant 
body of historical research and archaeology focuses on the early peopling of Europe.
The presence of Europe’s oldest languages (Celtic) in 
the far west supports the idea that newer languages arrived from the east. But how and where did they spread through Europe? The conquest theory provides one explana-tion. This theory holds that early speakers of Proto-Indo-European spread from east to west on horseback, overpow-ering earlier inhabitants and beginning the diffusion and differentiation of Indo-European tongues. The sound shifts in the derivative languages represent a long period of diver-gence in languages as one moves west through Europe.
An alternative agricultural theory proposes that Proto-
Indo-European diffused westward through Europe with the diffusion of agriculture. Citing the archaeological record, Luca Cavalli-Sforza and Albert Ammerman proposed that for every generation (25 years) the agricultural frontier  Figure 6.10

reading between the two languages is easier than 
speaking between them.
The Germanic languages (English, German, 
Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish) reﬂ  ect the expansion 
of peoples out of northern Europe to the west and south. Some Germanic peoples spread into areas domi-nated by Rome, and at the northern and northeast-ern edges of the Roman Empire their tongues gained ascendancy. Other Germanic peoples spread into areas that were never part of an ancient empire (present-day Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the northern part of the Netherlands). The Germanic character of English bears the imprint of a further migration—that of the Normans into England in 1066, bringing a Romance tongue to the British Isles. The essential Germanic character of English remained, but many new words were added that are Romance in origin.
The Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, Czech, 
Slovak, Ukrainian, Slovenian, Serbo-Croatian, and Bulgarian) developed as Slavic people migrated from a base in present-day Ukraine close to 2000 years ago. Slavic tongues came to dominate much of eastern Europe over the succeeding centuries. They, too, over-whelmed Latin-based tongues along much of the east-ern part of the old Roman Empire—with the notable exception of an area on the western shores of the Black Sea, where a Latin-based tongue either survived the Slavic invasion or was reintroduced by migrants. That tongue is the ancestor of the modern-day Romance lan-guage: Romanian.
Language and Politics
A comparison of Europe’s linguistic and political maps shows a high correlation between the languages spoken and the political organization of space. The Romance languages, of Romanic-Latin origin, domi-nate in five countries, including Romania. The east-ern boundaries of Germany coincide almost exactly with the transition from Germanic to Slavic tongues. Even at the level of individual languages, boundar-ies can be seen on the political map: between French and Spanish, between Norwegian and Swedish, and between Bulgarian and Greek.
Although Figure 6.2 shows a signiﬁ  cant correlation 
between political and linguistic boundaries in Europe, there are some important exceptions. The French lin-guistic region extends into Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy, but in France, French coexists with Basque in the southwest, a variant of Dutch in the north, and a Celtic tongue in the northwest. The Celtic languages survive in the western region of France called Brittany (Breton), in the northern and western parts of Wales (Welsh), in western Ireland (Irish Gaelic), and in the western We still do not know where the Proto-Indo-
European language was born, or the location of its hearth. Like all other languages that gave rise to language fami-lies, Proto-Indo-European has deeper roots that link it to languages outside of the Indo-European family. Some scholars have even suggested that Nostratic (and its con-temporaries, variously named Eurasiatic, Indo-Paciﬁ  c, 
Amerind, and Austric) is a direct successor of a proto-world language that goes back to the dawn of human his-tory, but this notion is highly speculative. The inset in Figure 6.9 reminds us how little of the human language tree we know with any certainty.
The Languages of Europe
The map of world languages (Fig. 6.8) demonstrates how widely spread the Indo-European language family is across the globe, dominating Europe, signiﬁ  cant parts 
of Asia (including Russia and India), North and South America, Australia, and portions of Southern Africa. About half the world’s people speak Indo-European lan-guages. The Indo-European language family is broken into subfamilies including Romance, Germanic, and Slavic. And each subfamily is broken into individual lan-guages, such as English, German, Danish, and Norwegian within the Germanic subfamily.
The language map of Europe (Fig. 6.2) shows 
that the Indo-European language family prevails in this region, with pockets of the Uralic family occurring in Hungary (the Ugric subfamily) and in Finland and adja-cent areas (the Finnic subfamily), and a major Altaic lan-guage, T urkish, dominating T urkey west of the Sea of Marmara.
Celtic people brought Indo-European tongues into 
Europe when they spread across the continent over 3000 years ago. Celtic speech survives at the western edges of Europe, but in most places Celtic tongues fell victim to subsequent migrations and empire building. These his-torical developments led to the creation of a European linguistic pattern characterized by three major subfami-lies: Romance, Germanic, and Slavic.
The Subfamilies
The Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian, 
Romanian, and Portuguese) lie in the areas of Europe that were once controlled by the Roman Empire. Over time, local languages mixed with Latin, which the Roman Empire introduced to the region. The Romance languages that have much in common because of their Latin connection, but they are not mutually comprehensible. Spanish and Portuguese remain closely related to each other, but even there, c06Language.indd Page 189  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 189  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
190 Chapter 6   Language
Studying language subfamilies helps us under-
stand migration and settlement patterns in Subsaharan 
Africa. The oldest languages of Subsaharan Africa are the Khoisan languages, which include a “click” sound. Although they once dominated much of the region, Khoisan languages were marginalized by the invasion of speakers of the Bantu languages. Studying the languages in the Bantu subfamily, we can see that the languages are still closely related, with similar preﬁ  xes and vocab-ularies. Similarities among the Bantu languages mean that the languages have been in Subsaharan Africa for a shorter time—typically, the longer a language has been in a place, the more likely sounds will have shifted and languages splintered.
Linguistic diversity is evident not just at the world 
regional scale, but at the country scale. Nigeria encom-passes several subfamilies of the Niger-Congo fam-ily, and its population includes speakers of two major Subsaharan African language families. Indeed, Nigeria’s 141 million people speak more than 500 different lan-guages. The three most prominent languages are dis-tributed regionally: Hausa is in the north and is spoken by some 35 million, Y oruba is in the southwest and is spoken by 25 million and Ibo is in the southeast and is spoken by more than 25 million people (Fig. 6.15). Of the remaining languages spoken in Nigeria, the vast majority are spoken by fewer than one million people. These minor languages persist because daily survival, community, and culture are tied closely to the local scale in Nigeria. Even people who leave their hometowns for work send money back to their hometown associations to support their culture and economy.
Were it not for British colonialism, the country of 
Nigeria would never have existed. The diverse people of this place have been amalgamated into the Nigerian Highlands and islands of Scotland (Scots Gaelic). The use of Romanian extends well into Moldavia, signifying a 
past loss of national territory. Greek and Albanian are also Indo-European languages, and their regional distribution corresponds signiﬁ  cantly (though not exactly) with state 
territories. Figure 6.2 underscores the complex cultural pattern of eastern Europe: German speakers in Hungary; Hungarian speakers in Slovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia; Romanian speakers in Greece and Moldavia; T urkish speakers in Bulgaria; and Albanian speakers in Serbia.
Although the overwhelming majority of Europeans 
and Russians speak Indo-European languages, the Uralic and Altaic language families are also represented. Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian are major languages of the Uralic family, which, as Figure 6.8 shows, extends across Eurasia to the Paciﬁ  c Coast. The Altaic family to which T urkish 
belongs is equally widespread and includes T urkish, Kazakh, Uigur, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek languages.
One language on the map of Europe stands out 
for two reasons: ﬁ  rst, it covers a very small land area, 
and second, it is in no way related to any other lan-guage family in Europe. Did you ﬁ  nd it? This tantaliz-
ing enigma is the Basque language, Euskera. Isolated in the Andorra Mountain region between Spain and France, the Basque people and their Euskera language survived the tumultuous history of Europe for thou-sands of years—never blending with another language or diffusing from the Andorra region. (Some recent genetic evidence points to a link between Euskera and an extinct language in the Middle East.) The Basques have a strong identity tied to their language and inde-pendent history, an identity that was cemented by the horrid treatment they received under fascist dictator Francisco Franco, who ruled Spain during and after World War II. After Franco died in 1975, a Basque sep-aratist group demanded autonomy within Spain. The Spanish government recognized Basque autonomy in its 1979 constitution, granting the Basque region its own parliament, giving their language ofﬁ  cial status, and transferring some taxation and education powers from the capital to the Basque region. A group of Basque sep-aratists continue to demand more, waging a campaign 
of violence against Spanish targets and even moderate Basque leaders (Fig. 6.13).
Languages of Subsaharan Africa
The world map of language families masks the extreme fragmentation of languages in parts of the world such as Subsaharan Africa. In Subsaharan Africa, the map of world language families reﬂ  ects the dominance of the Niger-
Congo language family. By including language subfami-lies, we can gain a more meaningful picture of Subsaharan Africa’s linguistic diversity (Fig. 6.14). Figure 6.13

only six years) unable to function in local Nigerian society. 
Nigeria is having serious doubts about its relationship with the English language brought there by the colonists who arbitrarily established their multilinguistic and multieth-nic country in the ﬁ  rst place.
Education also affects the distribution of languages across the globe and within regions and countries. Thinking about dif-ferent regions of the world, consider how education plays a role in the distribution of English speakers. Who learns English in each of these regions and why? What role does education play in the global distribution of English speakers?borders for less than a century. European colonists are responsible for the arbitrary borders of most of Africa—borders that ignore cultural divides. When Nigeria gained its independence in 1962, the government decided to adopt English as the “ofﬁ  cial” language, as the three 
major regional languages are too politically charged and thus unsuitable as national languages.
When Nigeria’s children go to school, they ﬁ  rst must 
learn English, which is used for all subsequent instruction. Certainly, the use of English has helped Nigeria avoid some conﬂ icts based on language, but Nigerian educators, espe-
cially in the north, are having second thoughts about the policy. Upon entering school, children who have grown up speaking a local language are suddenly confronted with a new, unfamiliar tongue. The time and energy spent learn-ing English takes away from learning other subjects. Moreover, for many students, knowledge of English is irrelevant when they emerge from school (as many do after  Figure 6.14

Gutenberg Bible (the sacred text for Christians), which 
brought the scriptures out of churches and monasteries. The Gutenberg press diffused quickly in the century fol-lowing—throughout Europe and beyond. The printing press allowed for an unprecedented production of written texts, in languages besides Latin. Gutenberg’s press made it possible to print the Bible in one’s own language, such as French or German, rather than Latin, helping to standard-ize European languages. The Luther Bible played this role for German, as did the King James Bible for English.
The rise of relatively large independent states was 
equally important (see Chapter 8), for these political enti-ties had a strong interest in promoting a common culture, often through a common language (such as French or Dutch). Political elites who were literate and had access to written texts brought peoples together and played a key role in distributing printed texts. Moreover, as the leaders of countries such as England and Spain sought to expand their inﬂ  uence overseas through mercantilism and colo-
nialism, they established networks of communication and interaction, helping to diffuse certain languages over vast portions of Earth’s surface.
Since 1500, the world has experienced several waves 
of globalization ranging from European colonialism to American-led globalization, resulting in widespread cultural, linguistic, political, and economic interaction. HOW DO LANGUAGES DIFFUSE?
Just a few thousand years ago most habitable parts of 
Earth were characterized by a tremendous diversity of languages. W ith the rise of empires, of larger-scale, more 
technologically sophisticated literate societies, some lan-guages began to spread over larger areas. By 2000 years ago, languages such as Chinese and Latin had successfully dif-fused over large regions. The Han Empire in China and the Roman Empire in Europe and North Africa knit together large swaths of territory, encouraging the diffusion of one language over the regions. The most powerful and wealthi-est people were the ﬁ  rst to learn Chinese and Latin in these empires, as they had the most to lose by not learning the languages. Local languages and illiteracy continued among the poor in the empires, and some blending of local with regional languages occurred. When the Roman Empire dis-integrated, places within the region discontinued interac-tion, prompting a round of linguistic divergence.
In the late Middle Ages, the invention of the 
Gutenberg printing press and the rise of nation-states worked to spread literacy and stabilize certain lan-guages through widely distributed written forms. Johann Gutenberg perfected the printing press, inventing the movable type printing press, the Gutenberg press, in Germany in 1440. In 1452, Gutenberg printed the ﬁ  rst c06Language.indd Page 192  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 192  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

mixture of two or more languages. When people speak-
ing two or more languages are in contact and they com-bine parts of their languages in a simpliﬁ  ed structure and vocabulary, we call it a pidgin language.
The ﬁ  rst widely known lingua franca was a pidgin 
language. During the 1200s seaborne commerce in the Mediterranean Sea expanded, and traders from the ports of southern France (the Franks) revitalized the ports of the eastern Mediterranean. But the local traders did not speak the seafarers’ language. Thus began a process of convergence in which the tongue of the Franks was mixed with Italian, Greek, Spanish, and Arabic. The mixture came to be known as the Frankish language, or lingua franca, and it served for centuries as the common tongue of Mediterranean commerce.
The term lingua franca is still used to denote a com-
mon language used for trade and commerce that is spoken by peoples with different native tongues. Arabic became a lingua franca during the expansion of Islam, and English did so in many areas during the colonial era. English is the only linguistic common denominator that binds together multi-lingual India—both in India itself and among those from the subcontinent who have migrated to other areas (Fig. 6.16).T rade and commerce stimulate the formation of new, hybrid languages to facilitate such interaction, but other, local languages collapse under the onslaught of change. Although new languages are created through trade and interaction over time, local languages with few native speakers are becoming extinct. Globalization is shrink-ing the world’s linguistic heritage. Anthropologist Wade Davis estimates that half of “the world’s 7000 languages are endangered.” Davis argues that most languages are lost because one group dominates another and the domi-nant language is privileged, which is “driving vibrant peo-ples and languages out of existence.”
Lingua Franca
Even before the expansion of trade encouraged the global diffusion of languages such as English and Spanish, regional trade encouraged people speaking different tongues to ﬁ  nd ways to communicate with one another. A lingua franca is a language used among speakers of dif-
ferent languages for the purposes of trade and commerce. A lingua franca can be a single language, or it can be a

Poland in Europe; and Lesotho in Africa. Even these 
countries, however, have small numbers of people who speak other languages; for example, more than a half-million Koreans live in Japan. In fact, as a result of migration and diffusion, no country is truly monolingual today. English-speaking Australia has more than 180,000 speakers of Aboriginal languages. Predominantly Portuguese-speaking Brazil has some 1.5 million speak-ers of Amerindian languages.
Countries in which more than one language is in 
use are called multilingual states. In some of these countries, linguistic fragmentation reﬂ  ects strong cul-tural pluralism as well as divisive forces. This is true in former colonial areas where colonizers threw together peoples speaking different languages, as happened in Africa and Asia.
Multilingualism takes several forms. In Canada 
and Belgium, the two major languages each dominate particular areas of the country. In multilingual India, the country’s ofﬁ  cial languages generally correspond with the country’s States (Fig. 6.17). In Peru, centuries of acculturation have not erased the regional identities of the American Indian tongues spoken in the Andean Mountains and the Amazonian interior, and of Spanish, spoken on the coast.
Ofﬁ  cial Languages
Countries with linguistic fragmentation often adopt an ofﬁ cial language  (or languages) to tie the people 
together. In former colonies, the ofﬁ  cial language is often 
one that ties them to their colonizer, as the colonizer’s language invariably is one already used by the educated and politically powerful elite. A State adopts an ofﬁ  cial 
language in the hope of promoting communication and interaction among peoples who speak different local and regional languages.
Many former African colonies have adopted 
English, French, or Portuguese as their ofﬁ  cial language, 
even though they have gained independence from for-mer imperial powers. Thus, Portuguese is the ofﬁ  cial 
language of Angola, English is the ofﬁ  cial language of 
Nigeria and Ghana, and French is the ofﬁ  cial language of 
Côte d’Ivoire.
Such a policy is not without risks. As we noted earlier 
in this chapter in the case of Nigeria, the long-term results of using a foreign language may not be positive. In some countries, including India, citizens objected to using a lan-guage (English in India) that they associated with colonial repression. Some former colonies chose not just one but two ofﬁ  cial languages: the European colonial language plus one of the country’s own major languages. English and Hindi are ofﬁ  cial languages of India. Similarly, A different sort of a lingua franca in wide use today 
is Swahili, the lingua franca of East Africa. Through centuries of trade and interaction, Swahili developed from an African Bantu language mixed with Arabic and Persian, encompassing 100 million speakers from south-ern Somalia to northern Mozambique and from coastal Kenya and T anzania to Uganda and the East African Great Lakes region. Swahili has a complex vocabulary and structure, and while millions of East Africans com-municate in the language, most still learn and speak a local language as their ﬁ  rst or primary language. Swahili has 
gained prominence since 2000 because of its status as the most widely used African language on the Internet. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has a Swahili language website, and Wikipedia offers pages of its free encyclopedia in Swahili.
Over time a pidgin language may gain native speak-
ers, becoming the ﬁ  rst language children learn in the home. When this happens, we call it a creolized or Creole language. A Creole language is a pidgin language that has developed a more complex structure and vocabulary and has become the native language of a group of people. The word Creole stems from a pidgin language formed in the Caribbean from English, French, and Portuguese languages mixed with the languages of African slaves. The language became more complex and became the ﬁ  rst 
language of people in the region, replacing the African languages.
Pidgin and Creole languages are important unify-
ing forces in a linguistically divided world. They tend to be simple and accessible, and therefore disseminate rapidly. In Southeast Asia a trade language called Bazaar Malay is heard from Myanmar (Burma) to Indonesia and from the Philippines to Malaysia; it has become a lingua franca in the region. A simpliﬁ  ed form of Chinese also serves as a language of commerce even beyond the bor-ders of China.
Multilingualism
In a world of some 200 political entities and several thou-sand languages, most countries cope, to varying degrees, with multilingualis—the use of more than one language by 
sectors of the population. In the United States, the cur-rent issue of Spanish as a second language is only the most recent manifestation of a debate that is as old as the coun-try itself. Canada is ofﬁ  cially a bilingual state, but quite a few Canadians speak a language other than English or French at home.
T o be sure, a few virtually monolingual states—
countries where almost everyone speaks the same lan-guage—do exist. These include Japan in Asia; Uruguay in South America; Iceland, Denmark, Portugal, and c06Language.indd Page 194  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 194  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 How Do Languages Diffuse?   195
The European Union is not a country, but it rec-
ognizes 23 ofﬁ  cial languages, and the United Nations 
has 6 ofﬁ  cial languages. In each of these cases, the international organization offers simultaneous transla-tion among the ofﬁ  cial languages to any member of the parliament (European Union) or the general assembly (United Nations) who requests it. Each international organization also publishes paper documents and main-tains its website in all ofﬁ  cial languages.
Global Language
What will the global language map look like 50 years from now? More and more people are using English in a vari-ety of contexts. English is now the standard language of international business and travel (the lingua franca), much of contemporary popular culture bears the imprint of English, and the computer and telecommunications rev-olution relies heavily on the use of English terminology. Does this mean that English is on its way to becoming a global language?English and Swahili are ofﬁ  cial languages of T anzania. 
In Mauritania, French and Arabic are ofﬁ  cial languages. 
But this solution was not always enough. When India gave Hindi ofﬁ  cial status, riots and disorder broke out 
in non-Hindi areas of the country. Kenya, which at ﬁ  rst 
made English and Swahili its ofﬁ  cial languages, decided to drop English in the face of public opposition to rules requiring candidates for public ofﬁ  ce to pass a test of their ability to use English.
The ofﬁ  cial languages in a country are a reﬂ  ec-
tion of the country’s history. In Peru, Spanish and the Amerindian language Quechuan have ofﬁ  cial status 
and are found in distinct regions. In the Philippines, English (spoken primarily in Manila) and a creolized Spanish called Pilipino are both ofﬁ  cial languages. 
Tiny Singapore, the city-state at the tip of the Malay Peninsula, has four ofﬁ  cial languages: English, Chinese, Malay, and T amil (an Indian tongue). India is the coun-try with the largest number of ofﬁ  cial languages—22 if we include both ofﬁ  cial languages listed in the country’s constitution and ofﬁ  cial languages proclaimed by States within India.

circumstances, the role of English as an international 
language of commerce will grow.
We must be careful in this conclusion, however. 
Anyone looking at the world 200 years ago would have predicted French as the principal language of cross-cultural communication in the future. Times are different now, of course. The role of English in the computer revolution alone makes it hard to imagine a fundamental shift away from the dominance of English in international affairs. Y et, economic and politi-cal influences on language use are always in flux, and nothing is inevitable.
Choose a country in the world. Imagine you become a strong leader of a centralized government in the country. Pick a language used in the country other than the tongue spoken by the majority. Determine what policies you could put in place to make the minority language an ofﬁ  cial language of the country. What reactions would your initiative generate? Who would support it and who would not?If global language means the principal language 
people use around the world in their day-to-day activi-ties, the geographical processes we have examined so far emphatically do not point to the emergence of English as a global tongue. Population growth rates are gener-ally lower in English-speaking areas than they are in other areas, and little evidence shows people in non-English speaking areas willing to abandon their local language in favor of English. Indeed, since language embodies deeply held cultural views and is a basic fea-ture of cultural identity, many people actively resist switching to English.
Y et if global language means a common language 
of trade and commerce used around the world, the pic-ture looks rather different. Although not always wel-
comed, the trend throughout much of the world is to use English as a language of cross-cultural communi-cation—especially in the areas of science, technology, travel, business, and education (Fig. 6.18). Korean scholars are likely to communicate with their Russian counterparts in English; Japanese scientiﬁ  c journals are increasingly published in English; Danish tourists visit-ing Italy may use English to get around; and the meet-ings of most international ﬁ  nancial and governmental institutions are dominated by English.

“English is an important part of the curriculum even at a small school for deaf children in remote Bhu-tan.  The children and I began com-municating by writing questions to each other on the blackboard.  Their English is quite good, and I am reminded once again of the incred-ible global reach of English, despite its idiosyncrasies. In English, light is pronounced as if it were lite, the past tense of the verb to read is read, but the past tense of the word to lead is led.”

  What Role Does Language Play in Making Places? 197
explains that some of the most interesting toponyms 
are manufactured, such as T ruth or Consequences, 
New Mexico, which voted to change its name to honor a 1950s radio game show. Stewart’s ﬁ  nal category of toponyms is shift names. Shift names include relocated names, examples of relocation diffusion and typically found in migrant communities (Lancaster, England to Lancaster, Pennsylvania).
Knowing Stewart’s ten categories of toponyms at 
the very least helps us understand that a story lies behind every toponym we encounter in our travels. The stories of toponyms quite often have their roots in migration, move-ment, and interaction among people. When languages diffuse through migration, so too do toponyms. Studying the toponyms in a place can tell us much about the histori-cal migration of peoples. George Stewart’s classic book on toponyms reveals many clusters of migrants and cor-responding toponyms. Often the toponyms remain long after the migrants moved on. Clusters of Welsh toponyms in Pennsylvania, French toponyms in Louisiana, and Dutch toponyms in Michigan reveal migration ﬂ  ows and 
also can provide insight into language change and evolu-tion of dialects.
Toponyms and Globalization
Brazil provides an interesting case study of migration ﬂ ows and toponyms. Most Brazilian toponyms are 
Portuguese, reﬂ  ecting the Portuguese colonization of the land. Amid the Portuguese toponyms sits a cluster of German toponyms in the southern state of Santa Catarina. The map of the state is marked by the place-naming activities of German immigrants. For example, the German word for ﬂ  ower is “Blume,” and several last names in German begin with “Blum.” The German immigrants had a fondness for the tropical ﬂ  owers 
they saw in Brazil: southern Brazil is therefore dotted with towns named Blumenau, Blumberg, Blumenhof, Blumenort, Blumenthal, and Blumenstein. Brazilian toponyms also reveal the enormous ﬂ  ow of forced migration from West Africa to Brazil during the slave trade. The Brazilian State of Bahia has a number of top-onyms that originated in West Africa, especially Benin and Nigeria.
The toponyms we see on a map depend in large part 
on who produced the map. Some embattled locales have more than one name at the same time. Argentineans refer to a small cluster (archipelago) of islands off the southeast coast of South America as the Malvinas, but the British call the same cluster of islands the Falkland Islands. In 1982, Argentina invaded the Malvinas, but the British forces fought back, and the islands remain under British control. British, American, and other allies call and map the islands as the Falklands, but Argentineans continue to WHAT ROLE DOES LANGUAGE PLAY 
IN MAKING PLACES?
The cultural geographer Yi-Fu T uan has studied the 
role and function of language in the shaping of places. He 
researched the way people use language as a tool to give perceptual meaning to areas on the Earth’s surface, large and small. Each place has a unique location and consti-tutes a reﬂ  ection of human activities, ideas, and tangible, durable creations. T uan argued that by simply naming a place, people in effect call that place into being, and thereby impart a certain character to it.
Geographers call place-names toponyms. Such 
names often refer to the social processes going on in a par-ticular area, and these may determine whether a toponym is passed down or changed, how the people will interpret the history of a place, and how the people will see a place. T uan contrasts the examples of “Mount Prospect” and “Mount Misery” to help us understand that a name alone can color the character of a place and even the experiences of people in a place. If you planned to travel to “Mount Prospect,” your expectations and even your experiences might well be quite different than a trip to “Mount Misery.”
The Ten Toponyms
A toponym can give us a quick glimpse into the history of a place. Simply by knowing who named the place and how the name was chosen helps us understand the uniqueness of a place. In his book, Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States  
(1982), English professor George Stewart recognized that certain themes dominate American toponyms. Stewart developed a classiﬁ  cation scheme focused on ten basic types of place-names, including: descriptive (Rocky Mountains), commendatory (Paradise Valley, Arizona), 
and possession (Johnson City, T exas) (T able 6.2). Stewart

call and map the islands as the Malvinas. The war ended in 
a matter of weeks, but the underlying dispute lingers, and so do both names.
Changing Toponyms
T uan explained that when people change the toponym of a place, they have the power to “wipe out the past and call forth the new.” For example, people in a small town in Wales feared the loss of the Welsh language and despised the role the English had played in diminish-ing the use of the Welsh language. They also wanted to boost their local economy by attracting tourists to their town. A century ago, the people renamed their town with a Welsh word unpronounceable by others: Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysilio gogogoch (Fig. 6.19). The name accurately describes the town in northern Wales, “The Church of St. Mary in the hollow of white hazel near the rapid whirlpool by the church of St. T ysilio of the red cave.” Since 1988, Wales has had an ofﬁ  cial policy of teaching both Welsh and English in the schools in order to preserve and boost usage of the Welsh language. Pronouncing the name of this town correctly is now a benchmark for students learn-ing Welsh, and the residents of the town take pride in their ability to pronounce it. Figure 6.19

T oponyms are part of the cultural landscape. 
Changes in place-names give us an idea of the layers of 
history, the layers of cultural landscape in a place. For example, on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, where Clare Swan (whom we cited earlier in this chapter) is from, the changing place-names give us insight into iden-tity questions in the place. Natives in one town on the Kenai Peninsula called their home Nanwalek in the early 1800s; when the Russians came in and took over the pen-insula, they changed the name to Alexandrof. Americans mapped Alaska and then made it a State, and in the pro-cess, they changed the name to English Bay. In 1991, the townspeople changed the name of their home back to Nanwalek. When you arrive in Nanwalek, you will see native people, see signs of the Russian Orthodox religion, hear them speak English, and then talk with the native people who are reviving their native language and cul-ture. The changes in the place-name provide insight into the cultural landscape.
Postcolonial Toponyms
The question of changing toponyms often arises when power changes hands in a place. When African colonies became independent countries, many of the new gov-ernments immediately changed the toponyms of places named after colonial ﬁ  gures. The new governments c06Language.indd Page 198  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 198  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 What Role Does Language Play in Making Places?   199
In the same time frame, South Africa experienced 
a major revolution that also resulted in a fundamen-
tal change in governance. T oday, the government of South Africa is wrestling with pressures for and against toponym changes. The government restructured the country’s administrative framework, creating nine provinces out of four and giving some of the new prov-inces African names (Mpumalanga for the new Eastern T ransvaal, Gauteng for a new central province). One of the old provinces, Natal, has become Kwazulu-Natal. The government also changed some names of towns and villages, but South Africa’s map still includes many names from the Boer-British and Apartheid periods. Name changes can evoke strong reactions from people, and the South African government is trying to move slowly and carefully to avoid arousing emotions in their still-divided country.
Memorial Toponyms
People can choose to change a toponym to memorialize an important person or event. Hundreds of parks in the United States are named Memorial Park for hundreds of such persons and events. T owns or government agencies can vote to change the name of a school, a library, or a public building to memorialize people who have played a role in shaping the place or who have had an enormous inﬂ uence on people in the place.
Certain events such as decolonization or a politi-
cal revolution can spur changes in toponyms, and so too can revolutions in thought and behavior. The civil rights movement of the 1960s in the United States left many lasting impressions of people and events, especially in the South, where many protests, sit-ins, and marches occurred. Geographer Derek Alderman explains that, in recent decades, African Americans in the South have “taken a particularly active role in reconstructing commemorative landscapes—from call-ing for the removal of Confederate symbols from pub-lic places to the building of memorials and museums honoring the civil rights movement.” Streets are often the focal point of commemoration in the cultural land-scape because so many people travel along them daily, serving as a constant reminder of the person or event being memorialized.
Alderman studied the practice of changing street 
names to memorialize Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK), the major African American leader of the civil rights movement. Although streets named after MLK are found throughout the United States, the greatest con-centration of memorial streets are in the South, espe-cially in Georgia (King’s home state) and Mississippi (Fig. 6.20). Alderman studied the distribution of MLK streets in the South, comparing their locations with census data on race and socioeconomics. He found renamed several countries: Upper Volta to Burkina Faso, Gold Coast to Ghana, Nyasaland to Malawi, and Northern and Southern Rhodesia to Zambia and Zimbabwe, respectively. Countries in Asia also chose new toponyms to mark their independence and sepa-rate themselves from their past: East Pakistan became Bangladesh, and the Netherlands East Indies became Indonesia.
Newly independent countries also changed the 
names of cities and towns to reﬂ  ect their independence. 
Thus, Leopoldville (named after a Belgian king) became Kinshasa, capital of the Congo; Salisbury, Zimbabwe, named after a British leader, became Harare; and Lourenço Marques, Mozambique, commemorating a Portuguese naval hero, became Maputo. However, newly independent countries did not wipe all colonial names and references from their maps. Etoile (the Congo), Colleen Bawn (Zimbabwe), and Cabo Delgado (Mozambique) remain on the postcolonial map.
Postrevolution Toponyms
Independence prompts name changes, and so too do changes in power through coups and revolutions. During his reign, authoritarian dictator, General Mobutu Sese Seko, changed the name of the Belgian Congo in Subsaharan Africa to Zaïre. At ﬁ  rst, other governments and international agencies did not take this move seri-ously, but eventually they recognized Mobutu’s Zaïre. Governments and companies changed their maps and atlases to reﬂ  ect Mobutu’s decision. The government of 
Zaïre changed the name of their money from the franc to the zaïre, and they even changed the name of the Congo River to the Zaïre.
In 1997, the revolutionary leader Laurent Kabila 
ousted Mobutu and established his regime in the capital, Kinshasa. Almost immediately, he renamed the country. Zaïre became the Democratic Republic of the Congo (reﬂ ecting the colonial name). Again, governments and 
companies reacted, changing their maps and atlases to reﬂ ect Kabila’s decision.
Recent revolutions in power in Russia and South 
Africa led to many changes in toponyms in these coun-tries. When the Soviet Union began, the communist gov-ernment changed many places named for tsars who were in power before them, replacing them (of course) with Soviet names. Once the Soviet Union collapsed, a new round of name changes occurred, often going back to T sarist-era names. In the new Russia, Leningrad reverted to St. Petersburg, Sverdlovsk went back to Y ekaterinburg (its name under the tsars), and Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd (for the river). Reformers, nationalists, and lingering communists argued bitterly over the toponym changes, and many people continued to address their mail according to their city’s former name.c06Language.indd Page 199  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 199  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

1983 and Disneyland Paris in 1990, both places that capi-
talize on the success of Disneyland and Disneyworld in the United States. As corporations spread their names and logos to other places, they seek to “brand” places, creating or re-creating places that consumers associate with places of the same brand.
In recent years, the activities of corporations 
with a global reach have been stamped on the land-scape. Stadiums are especially susceptible to this form of commodiﬁ  cation: FedEx Field, MCI Center, Fleet Center, and Coors Field are perfect examples. In 2004, the Metropolitan T ransit Authority in New Y ork City proposed renaming the metro stops, bridges, and tun-nels after corporate sponsors. Instead of the Lincoln T unnel, we could be traveling through the T arget T unnel, and instead of stopping at Times Square, we could be stopping at Disney Times Square (which, ironically is already named for a company—the New 
York Times).
This place was ﬁ  rst named by Gabrielino Indians. In 1769, 
Spanish Franciscan priests renamed the place. In 1850, English speakers renamed the place. Do not use the Internet to help you. Use only maps in this book or in atlases to help you deduce what this place is. Maps of European exploration and colonialism will help you the most. Look at the end of the chapter summary for the answer.that although MLK streets are found in both cities and rural areas, “MLK streets are located—whether by choice or by force—in census areas that are generally poorer and with more African Americans than citywide averages.” (Fig. 6.21) Alderman tempers this finding with a caution that not all MLK streets are located in poorer areas of cities. Even when MLK streets are located in depresssed areas, the African American pop-ulation may have purposefully chosen a street because it runs through an African American neighborhood. Alderman’s subsequent studies explore the scale of the city and the contested views of what kinds of streets should be named for MLK—be they residential, com-mercial, major thoroughfares (perhaps those that con-nect white and African American neighborhoods), or residential streets in largely African American neigh-borhoods.
The presence of streets named for civil rights lead-
ers in the cultural landscapes of the American South cre-ates a signiﬁ  cant counterbalance to the numerous places 
of commemoration named for leaders of the Confederacy during the Civil War (see Chapter 1).
Commodiﬁ  cation of Toponyms
The practice of commodifying (buying, selling, and trad-ing) toponyms is growing, especially in areas largely within the fold of popular culture. International media corpora-tions that reach across the globe bring known names to new places, drawing consumers to the place based on what they have heard or experienced elsewhere. For example, the Disney Corporation opened T okyo Disneyland in  Figure 6.20

Greenville, North Carolina
Greenville, North Carolina, changed West Fifth 
Street to Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in 1999. Originally, African American leaders wanted all of Fifth Street renamed—not just part of it—but residents and business owners on the east-ern end strongly opposed the proposal. After driving and walking down the street, I quickly realized that King Drive marked an area that was predominantly black with limited commercial development, whereas East Fifth was mostly white and more upscale. When I interviewed members of Greenville’s African American com-munity, they expressed deep frustration over the marginalization of the civil rights leader. In the words of one elected ofﬁ  cial, “The accomplishments of Dr. King were important to all Americans. A whole man deserves 
a whole street!” Naming streets for King is a controversial process for many cities, often exposing continued racial tensions and the potential for toponyms to function as contested social boundaries within places.

201Summary
The global mosaic of languages reﬂ  ects centuries of divergence, convergence, extinction, and diffusion. Linguists and linguistic geographers have the interesting work of uncov-ering, through deep reconstruction, the hearths of the world’s language families. Some languages, such as Basque, defy explanation. Other languages are the foci of countless studies, many of which come to differing conclusions about their ancient origins.
As certain languages, such as English and Chinese, gain speakers and become 
global languages, other languages become extinct. Some languages come to serve as the lingua franca of a region or place. Governments choose ofﬁ  cial languages, and through public schools, educators entrench an ofﬁ  cial language in a place. Some countries, faced with the global diffusion of the English language, defend and promote their national language. Whether requiring signs to be written a certain way or requiring a television station to broadcast some proportion of programming in the national language, gov-ernments can preserve language, choose a certain dialect as the standard, or repel the diffusion of other languages.
Regardless of the place, the people, or the language used, language continues to 
deﬁ ne, shape, and maintain culture. How a person thinks about the world is reﬂ  ected in 
the words used to describe and deﬁ  ne it.

Field Note Dying and Resurrecting
When I made my ﬁ  rst trip to the Soviet Union in 1964, the world was divided into 
West and East in the Cold War. I was cataloging the unique cultural landscape in my mind as my group drove along a road from Leningrad to Moscow: I was look-
ing for evidence of communism on the landscape. The rural areas were ﬁ  lled with 
state and collective farms. To me, the most interesting aspect of the landscape was the multitude of churches in ruins.
In every town we passed, and in many villages along the way, churches lay in 
ruins, their roofs collapsed, their steeples toppled. The bells were gone; where stained-glass windows once adorned the churches there were now gaping holes (Fig. 7.1). My host did not want me to photograph the churches.
“Why let them collapse?” I asked, “Why not remove them altogether?” He 
pointed his ﬁ  nger to emphasize his point, “Religion causes conﬂ  ict. We had many 
religions in the Soviet Union, and they set Soviet against Soviet. And the Orthodox

Church opposed our communist victory. That’s what these useless relics are for. 
They remind the people of our victory and their freedom.”
When the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was established in 1924, 
the communist regime led by Vladimir Lenin inherited a multicultural empire orig-inally forged by ruthless tsars whose cruelties precipitated the revolution in the ﬁ rst place. The Soviet Union (short for USSR) extended from Eastern Europe to the 
Paciﬁ  c Ocean and from the Arctic to Central Asia. It was territorially the largest 
state in the world and culturally one of the most diverse.
Planners of the Soviet Union ofﬁ  cially recognized the cultural diversity 
of the country by creating “republics” mostly named after the dominant peo-ple within the boundaries of each republic, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, and Russia. Culturally, the Soviet Union favored Russia, which was evidenced by the country’s policy of Russiﬁ  cation. Through 
Russiﬁ  cation, the Soviet Union sought to spread the Russian language and cul-
ture throughout the entire Soviet Union. Politically, the Soviet Union believed its people would show less allegiance to their republics and more allegiance to the Soviet Union if power rested in the local rather than the republic scale. Each republic had a diversity of people within its boundaries. The Republic of Russia, for example, included 70 distinct territories, which largely corresponded with ethnic groups.
Culturally, the Soviet Union also espoused an ofﬁ  cial policy of atheism with 
the goal of discouraging and suppressing religious practice. This was no easy task: among Soviet citizens were many millions of adherents to numerous faiths ranging from Christianity to Buddhism and from Islam to Judaism. In the Russian Republic, the Russian Orthodox Church was at the heart of Slavic culture.
The Russian Orthodox Church posed the greatest potential challenge to 
communist rule, so Soviet leaders set about arresting religious leaders, closing churches, seizing church bells and other religious paraphernalia. As a result, much of the Russian Orthodox Church’s architectural heritage and artistic legacy was lost. The Soviet government forced schools to teach the “evils” of religious belief. Many churches, such as the one in Figure 7.1, were simply left to decay; others were converted to “practical” uses such as storage sheds and even livestock barns.
In more remote corners of the Soviet Union, where Islam was ﬁ  rmly estab-
lished, the communist rulers tolerated Islamic practice among the old, but not among the young, who were indoctrinated into the tenets of Marxism. The Soviets appeared to regard Buddhism as a lesser threat; the mostly Buddhist Kalmyks did not face the same pressure. Jewish citizens saw their synagogues close, but close-knit communities often managed to stay below the communist radar. In any case, the Soviet planners believed that time would slowly but surely erase the imprints of the empire’s many faiths.
By the 1960s, when I took this photo, it seemed as though the Soviet plan 
to diminish religion would succeed. In the mainly Muslim republics, Islam was tightly controlled and in retreat, but Islamic structures tended to be preserved as museums or libraries. However, in the Russian Republic, Moscow showed little residue of centuries of Orthodox Christianity. In 1931 the Soviet regime decided to destroy one of Moscow’s great monuments, the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. The Soviet government planned to build a palace to commemorate Soviet lead-ers on the site. The government never built the palace, and the large pit that was to contain its foundation marked the site for decades. Russian geographer Dmitri Sidorov described the pit as “Russia’s most famous geographical symbol for the failed communist endeavor.”c07Religion.indd Page 204  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 204  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 What Is Religion, and What Role Does It Play In Culture? 205
WHAT IS RELIGION, AND WHAT ROLE 
DOES IT PLAY IN CULTURE?
Religion and language lie at the foundation of cul-
ture: both confer and reﬂ  ect identity. Like languages, reli-
gions are constantly changing. Although religious leaders 
and bureaucracies sometimes attempt to slow the pace of change, religions nevertheless change over time.
Religions diffuse through expansion diffusion, 
including both contagious and hierarchical, and reli-gions also diffuse through relocation diffusion. In any of these cases, leaders or followers of a religion interact with people who do not espouse the religion, and the interac-tions sometimes lead to conversion. Spatial interaction occurs because of migration, missionary efforts, and even conquest. Along these paths, major religions of the world have diffused.
The cultural landscape is marked by religion—
most obviously by church, synagogues, temples, and mosques, cemeteries and shrines, statues and symbols (Fig. 7.2). Other more subtle markers of religion dot the landscape as well. The presence or absence of stores selling alcohol or of signs depicting the human form in particular ways reﬂ  ect prevailing religious views. Religion is also proclaimed in modes of dress (veils, turbans) and personal habits (beards, ritual scars). The outward display of religious beliefs often reveals the inward structure of a religion. For example, in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, in 1991, the government proclaimed that possessing a beard would be a condi-tion for the appointment of judges. The beard require-ment is an outward display of religion, and it also shows the inward structure of Islam in Pakistan, where women are not in a place of judicial power.
Religion is an extraordinarily difﬁ  cult concept to 
deﬁ ne. In the chapter “Geography of Religion and Belief 
Systems,” written for Geography in America, geographers Robert Stoddard and Carolyn Prorak deﬁ  ne religion as 
“a system of beliefs and practices that attempts to order life in terms of culturally perceived ultimate priorities.” Stoddard and Prorak explain that the idea of “perceived ultimate priorities” is often expressed in terms of “should”: people explain and justify how they and others “should” behave based on their religious beliefs. From eating habits to dress codes, religions set standards for how adherents “should” behave (Fig. 7.3). “Shouldness” goes beyond religion to other belief systems, but in this chapter we focus on formal religions, their distribution, and their role in making and shaping places and cultures. The idea that a “good” life has rewards and that “bad” behavior risks pun-ishment has an enormous inﬂ  uence on cultures, on how 
people behave, and on how people perceive and evaluate the behavior of others.When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russians soon proved that 
they had not forgotten their faith. The Russian Orthodox Church revived dra-
matically, churches were rebuilt and reopened, Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Savior was re-created, and church leaders once again took their place in national affairs. Religion is a durable, perhaps the most durable, element of cul-
ture at all scales, and religious beliefs and behavior are intertwined with pol-itics, economics, and other components of culture. In this chapter we study the origins, diffusions, and transformations of the world’s great religions, their regional patterns and cultural landscapes. As we will ﬁ  nd, religion can unite and divide, ﬂ  ourish and stagnate, surge and fade. Understanding the changing map of world religions and the role of religion in culture is essential to appreciating human geography.

“Each religion approaches the disposition of 
the deceased in different ways, and cultural landscapes reﬂ  ect religious traditions. In largely 
Christian, western regions, the deceased are buried in large, sometimes elaborate cemeter-ies. The Hindu faith requires cremation of the deceased. Wherever large Hindu communities exist outside of India, you will see crematori-ums, the equivalent of a Hindu funeral home.”Field Note

 What Is Religion, and What Role Does It Play In Culture? 207
Religion manifests itself in many different ways. 
We can see religion in the worship of the souls of ances-
tors who are thought to inhabit natural objects such as mountains, animals, or trees; in the belief that a certain living person possesses special abilities granted by a super-natural power; and in the belief in a deity or deities, as in the great world religions. In some places, societies are so infused with religion that religious tradition strongly inﬂ uences behaviors during waking hours through ritual 
and practice and even during periods of sleep in prescrib-ing the orientation of the body.
Across the multitude of religions, some religious 
practices such as ritual and prayer are common. Rituals may mark important events in people’s lives: birth and death, attainment of adulthood, or marriage. Rituals are typically expressed at regular intervals in a routine manner, as is done on certain days in the Christian and Jewish worlds, certain times of the day in the Muslim world, or according to certain astronomical events in the Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, and Christian worlds. A common ritual is prayer, whether at mealtime, at sunrise and sundown, at night upon retiring, or in the morning when arising.
Although religious beliefs and prescriptions inﬂ  u-
ence many societies, in other places, religion, at least in its organized form, has become less signiﬁ  cant in the lives of people. Secularism is the indifference to or rejection of 
formal religion. The most secular countries in the world today are in Europe. A 2009 Pew survey asked people in 56 countries how important religion is in their lives. Among the wealthiest countries surveyed, the United States stood out as the highest, with 57 percent of Americans sur-veyed saying religion is very important in their lives. Only 13 percent of people surveyed in France, 8 percent in Sweden, and 7 percent in the Czech Republic agreed that religion is very important in their lives. Regionally, survey respondents in Subsaharan Africa, South Asia, Southwest Asia, and South America more strongly agreed that reli-gion is very important in their lives: 98 percent in Senegal, 97 percent in Bangladesh, 95 percent in Indonesia, and 78 percent in Brazil reported religion to be very important in their lives.
Although survey respondents in Europe largely did 
not see religion as very important in their lives today, religion certainly had a critical role in the history of Europe. During the Middle Ages and into the colonial period, the Christian church was a dominant force polit-ically, economically and culturally in Europe. Because Christianity was a major part of life in Europe for cen-turies, much of the art, architecture, history, customs, and cultural norms derive from Christian beliefs and teachings (Fig. 7.4). Even if your society is secular and regardless of your religious beliefs, what you eat, when you work, when you shop, and what you are allowed to do are inﬂ  uenced by religion.Regardless of the religion, the number of adherents, 
or the place, organized religion has a powerful effect on human societies. It has been a major force in combat-ing social ills, sustaining the poor, promoting the arts, educating the deprived, and advancing medical knowl-edge. However, religion has also blocked scientiﬁ  c study, 
encouraged the oppression of dissidents, supported colonialism and exploitation, and condemned women to an inferior status in many societies. Religion is, if noth-ing else, one of the most complex and often controversial aspects of the human condition.

208 Chapter 7  Religion
Describe how religion and language affect and change each 
other to shape cultures. Consider what happens to a soci-ety’s religion and language when a different religion or lan-guage diffuses to the place.
WHERE DID THE MAJOR RELIGIONS 
OF THE WORLD ORIGINATE, AND HOW DO RELIGIONS DIFFUSE?
Despite the wide variety of religions found around 
the world, they are commonly classiﬁ  ed into three catego-
ries based on their approaches to the concept of divinity. Adherents of monotheistic religions worship a single deity, a God or Allah. Believers in polytheistic religions worship more than one deity, even thousands. Animistic religions are centered on the belief that inanimate objects, such as mountains, boulders, rivers, and trees, possess spirits and should therefore be revered.
Throughout much of human history, virtually all 
religions were either animistic, polytheistic, or both. Somewhere around 3500 years ago, however, a mono-theistic religion developed in Southwest Asia called Zoroastrianism. (The Parsi we talked about at the begin-ning of Chapter 4 are Zoroastrians who moved to India.) Some believe that the monotheism of late Judaism, Christianity, and Islam can be traced to Zoroastrian inﬂ  u-ences. Others believe that Judaism itself was the ﬁ  rst 
monotheistic religion. Whichever the case, the eventual diffusion of Christianity and Islam spread monotheistic ideas throughout much of the world and marked a major theological shift from the long dominance of polytheis-tic and animist beliefs in most places. The transforma-tion from polytheistic to monotheistic religions happened quite rapidly in Subsaharan Africa. In 1900, neither reli-gion had many followers in Subsaharan Africa, though Islam had many followers in North Africa by 1900. By 2010, the number of Muslims in Subsaharan Africa had grown from 11 million to 234 million, and the number of Christians had grown from 7 million to 470 million.
By 500 bce (Before the Common Era), four major 
hearths of religion and philosophy were developed in the world (Fig. 7.5). The hearth of Greek philosophy is along the northern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. From a hearth in South Asia, along the Indus River Valley, came Hinduism; from a hearth on the eastern Mediterranean came Judaism; and from a hearth on the Huang He River Valley in China came Chinese philosophies. These early-established reli-gions and philosophies profoundly impacted other religions, as the arrows in Figure 7.5 demonstrate. Philosophies and religions diffused from their hearths, affecting one another and inﬂ  uencing the ways founders established newer reli-gions. The two religions with the greatest number of adher-ents in the world today, Christianity and Islam, were both inﬂ uenced by Judaism and Greek philosophy.

 Where Did the Major Religions of the World Originate, and How Do Religions Diffuse?  209
world religions is a generalization, and caution must be 
used when making observations from the map. First, the shadings on the map show the major religion in an area, thereby masking minority religions, many of which have a signiﬁ  cant number of followers. India, for example, is 
depicted as a Hindu region (except in the northwest), but other religions, such as Islam and Sikhism, attract millions of adherents in India. Of the 1.2 billion people in India, 161 million are Muslims, which makes India the third largest Muslim country in the world behind Indonesia and Pakistan.
Second, some of the regions shown as belonging to 
a particular religion are places where faiths have pene-trated relatively recently and where traditional religious ideas inﬂ  uence the practice of the dominant faith. Many Christian and Muslim Africans, for example, continue to believe in traditional powers even as they profess a belief in a universalizing religion. A 2010 Pew Research survey of 25,000 people in 19 African countries found “Large numbers of Africans actively participate in Christianity or Islam yet also believe in witchcraft, evil spirits, sacriﬁ  ces to ancestors, traditional religious heal-ers, reincarnation and other elements of traditional African religions.” The survey found 25 percent of Christian Africans and 30 percent of Muslim Africans they interviewed believed in the protective power of sacriﬁ  ces to spirits or ancestors. The country with the 
highest percentage of respondents who agreed with this statement was T anzania with 60 percent, and the lowest was Rwanda with 5 percent.
In Cameroon, 42 percent of those surveyed believed 
in the protective power of sacriﬁ  ces to spirits or ancestors. For example, the Bamileke tribe in Cameroon lives in an area colonized by the French, who brought Catholicism to the region. The Bamileke are largely Christian today, but they also continue to practice aspects of their tradi-tional, animist religion. Ancestors are still very impor-tant in the lives of the Bamileke. Many believe ancestors decide everything for them. It is common practice to take the skull of a deceased male member of the tribe and place it in the basement of the home of the family’s oldest liv-ing male. Birth practices also reﬂ  ect traditional religious practices. The Bamileke bury the umbilical cord in the ground outside their home so that the baby remembers where he or she came from. Members of the Bamileke tribe also commonly have two weddings today: one in the church and one traditional.
Finally, Figure 7.6 does not reﬂ  ect the rise in sec-
ularism in the world, especially in Europe. In a number of areas many people have moved away from organized religion entirely. Thus, France appears on the map as a Roman Catholic country, yet a large proportion of peo-ple in France profess adherence to no particular faith, and only 13 percent of French people say religion is very important in their lives.Despite the limitations of the map of world reli-
gions, it illustrates how far Christian religions have dif-fused (2.25 billion adherents worldwide), the extent of the diffusion of Islam (1.57 billion), the connection between Hinduism (950 million adherents) and one of the world’s major population concentrations, and the continued importance Buddhism (347 million followers) plays in parts of Asia. Many factors help explain the distributions shown on the map, but each of the widespread religions shares one characteristic in common: they are all uni-versalizing religions. Universalizing religions actively seek converts because they view themselves as offering belief systems of universal appropriateness and appeal. Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism all fall within this cate-gory, and their universalizing character helps explain their widespread distribution.
Universalizing religions are relatively few in num-
ber and of recent origin. Throughout human history, a greater number of religions have not actively sought converts. Rather, a given religion has been practiced by one particular culture or ethnic group. In an ethnic reli-gion, adherents are born into the faith and converts are not actively sought. Ethnic religions tend to be spatially concentrated—as is the case with traditional religions in Africa and South America (250 million followers). The principal exception is Judaism (13 million adherents), an ethnic religion whose adherents are widely scattered as a result of forced and voluntary migrations.
From the Hearth of South Asia
Hinduism
In terms of number of adherents, Hinduism ranks 
third after Christianity and Islam as a world religion. Hinduism is one of the oldest religions in the modern world, dating back over 4000 years, originating in the Indus River Valley of what is today part of Pakistan. Hinduism is unique among world religions in a number of ways. The religion does not have a single founder, a single theology, or agreement on its origins. The com-mon account of the history of Hinduism holds that the religion is based on ancient practices in the Indus River cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. The ancient prac-tices included ritual bathing and belief in reincarnation, or at least a long journey after death. The common his-tory says that Aryans invaded (some say migrated) into the Indus region and gave the name Hinduism to the diverse religious practices of the people who lived along the Indus River.
Despite the ambiguous beginnings of Hinduism, 
one thing is certain: Hinduism is no longer associ-ated with its hearth in Pakistan. The vast majority of Pakistanis are Muslim, and as Figure 7.6 demonstrates, the vast majority of Indians are Hindu. Archaeologists c07Religion.indd Page 209  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 209  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

hypothesize that ﬂ  ooding along the Indus spurred the 
migration of early Hindus eastward to the Ganges River. The Ganges (Ganga, as Indians call it) is Hinduism’s sacred river. Hindus regard its ceaseless ﬂ ow and spiritual healing power as Earthly manifesta-
tions of the Almighty.
Just as there is no consensus on Hinduism’s ori-
gins, there is a lack of agreement on deﬁ  ning Hinduism 
relative to other major world religions. Some deﬁ  ne Hinduism as a polytheistic religion because of the pres-ence of many gods. However, many Hindus deﬁ  ne their 
religion as monotheistic. The one god is Brahman (the universal soul), and the other gods in the religion are various expressions of Brahman. Similarly, Western academics deﬁ  ne Hinduism today as an ethnic religion because Hindus do not actively seek converts. At the same time, historical evidence shows Hindus migrat-ing into Southeast Asia and diffusing their religion, as I

 Where Did the Major Religions of the World Originate, and How Do Religions Diffuse?  211
a universalizing religion would, before the diffusion 
of Buddhism and Islam into Southeast Asia (Fig. 7.7). Although Hinduism is now more of an ethnic religion, the religion has millions of adherents in the popu-lous region of South Asia, extending beyond India to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.
The Hindu religion is not centrally organized. The 
religion does not have an administrative or bureaucratic structure like Christianity and Islam. The Hindu reli-gion does not have a prophet or a single book of scrip-tures, although most Hindus recognize the sacredness of the Vedas, the four texts that make up the sacred books of 
Hinduism. Hinduism is a conglomeration of beliefs char-acterized by a great diversity of institutional forms and practices. The fundamental doctrine is karma, which has to do with the transferability of the soul. According to Hindu doctrine, all beings have souls and are arranged in a hierar-chy. The ideal is to move upward in the hierarchy and then escape from the eternal cycle of reincarnation through union with Brahman (the universal soul). A soul moves upward or downward according to the individual’s behavior in the present life. Good deeds and adherence to the faith lead to a higher level in the next life, whereas bad behavior leads to demotion to a lower level. All souls, those of animals as well as humans, participate in this process. The principle of reincarnation is a cornerstone of Hinduism.
Hinduism’s doctrines are closely bound to Indian 
society’s caste system, for castes themselves are steps on the universal ladder. However, the caste system locks people into particular social classes and imposes many restrictions, I

especially in the lowest of the castes and in those consid-
ered beneath the caste system, Dalits. Until a generation ago, Dalits could not enter temples, were excluded from certain schools, and were restricted to performing the most unpleasant tasks. The coming of other religions to India, the effects of modernization during the colonial period, the work of Mahatma Gandhi, and afﬁ  rmative action policies helped loosen the social barriers of the caste system. The Indian government’s afﬁ  rmative action policies reserve seats in universities and jobs in government for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and Dalits.
Diffusion of Hinduism
As Figure 7.8 shows, Hinduism evolved in what is today Pakistan. From there, Hinduism migrated to the Ganges River and diffused throughout South Asia and into Southeast Asia before the advent of Christianity. It ﬁ rst attached itself to traditional faiths and then slowly 
replaced them. Later, when Islam and Christianity appeared and were actively spread in Hindu areas, Hindu thinkers attempted to integrate certain new teachings into their own religion. For example, elements of the Sermon on the Mount (Jesus’ sermon in which he described God’s love for the poor and the peacemakers) now form part of Hindu preaching, and Christian beliefs contributed to the weakening of caste barriers. In other instances, the con-frontation between Hinduism and other faiths led to the emergence of a compromise religion. Islam stimulated the rise of Sikhism, whose followers disapproved of the wor-ship of idols and disliked the caste system, but retained the concepts of reincarnation and karma.
Given its current character as an ethnic religion, it 
is not surprising that Hinduism’s geographical extent is relatively small. Indeed, throughout most of Southeast Asia, Buddhism and Islam overtook the places where Hinduism had diffused during its universalizing period. In overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia, the island of Bali remains a Hindu outpost. Bali became a refuge for Hindu holy men, nobles, and intellectuals during the sixteenth century, when Islam engulfed neighboring Java, which now retains only architectural remnants of its Hindu age. Since then, the Balinese have developed a unique faith, still based on Hindu principles but mixed with elements of Buddhism, animism, and ancestor worship. Religion plays an extremely important role in Bali. T emples and shrines dominate the cultural landscape, and participation in worship, festivals, and other ceremonies of the island’s unique religion is almost universal. Religion is so much at the heart of Balinese culture that it is sometimes described as a celebration of life.
Outside South Asia and Bali, Hinduism’s presence is 
relatively minor. Over the last two centuries, Hinduism has diffused to small parts of the world through migra-tion. During British colonialism, the British transported hundreds of thousands of Hindu adherents from their colony of India to their other colonies in East and South Africa, the Caribbean, northern South America, and the Paciﬁ  c Islands (see Fig. 7.2). Because Hinduism is not a 
universalizing religion today, the relocation diffusion pro-duced pockets rather than regions of Hinduism.
Buddhism
Buddhism splintered from Hinduism over 2500 years ago. Buddhism and several other religions appeared in India as a reaction to questions about Hinduism’s teach-ings at the time. Reformers questioned Hinduism’s strict social hierarchy that protected the privileged and kept millions in poverty. Prince Siddhartha, who was heir to a wealthy kingdom in what is now Nepal, founded  Figure 7.7
Angkor Wat, Cambodia. The extensive, walled structure at 
the temple complex in Angkor Wat marks the earliest period of Hinduism’s diffusion into Southeast Asia. Eventually, Buddhism supplanted Hinduism in Cambodia, and many Hindu temples such as this now suffer from neglect and destruction.

Buddhism. Siddhartha was profoundly shaken by the mis-
ery he saw around him, which contrasted sharply with the splendor and wealth in which he had been raised. Siddhartha came to be known as Buddha, the enlightened one. He may have been the ﬁ  rst prominent Indian reli-
gious leader to speak out against Hinduism’s caste system. Salvation, he preached, could be attained by anyone, no matter what his or her caste. Enlightenment would come through knowledge, especially self-knowledge; elimina-tion of greed, craving, and desire; complete honesty; and never hurting another person or animal.
After Buddha’s death in 489 bce at the age of 80, 
the faith grew rather slowly until the middle of the third century bce, when the Emperor Asoka became a con-
vert. Asoka was the leader of a large and powerful Indian empire that extended from the Punjab to Bengal and from the Himalayan foothills to Mysore. He not only set out to rule his country in accordance with the teachings of Buddha; he also sent missionaries to carry Buddha’s teachings to distant peoples (Fig. 7.9). Buddhism spread as far south as Sri Lanka and later advanced west toward the Mediterranean, north into Tibet, and east into China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and Indonesia, over a span of about ten centuries (Fig. 7.8). Although Buddhism diffused to distant lands, it began to decline in its region of origin. During Asoka’s rule there may have been more Buddhists than Hindu adherents in India, but after that period Hinduism gained followers in India. T oday Buddhism is practiced by relatively few in India, but thrives in Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, Nepal, Tibet, and Korea. Along with other faiths, Buddhism is part of Japanese culture.
Like Christianity and Islam, Buddhism changed 
as it grew and diffused, and now the religion is strongly regional with different forms in different regions. Buddhism’s various branches have an estimated 347 mil-lion adherents, with Mahayana Buddhism and Theravada 
Buddhism claiming the most adherents. Theravada Buddhism is a monastic faith practiced in Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. It holds that salvation is a personal matter, achieved through good behavior and religious activities, including periods of service as a monk or nun. Mahayana Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in Vietnam, Korea, Japan, and China, holds that salvation can be aided by appeals to super-human, holy sources of merit. The Buddha is regarded as a divine savior. Mahayana Buddhists do not serve as monks, but they spend much time in personal medita-tion and worship. Other branches of Buddhism include the Lamaism of Xizang (Tibet), which combines monas-tic Buddhism with the worship of local demons and dei-ties, and Zen Buddhism, the contemplative form that is prevalent in Japan.
Buddhism has become a global religion over the last 
two centuries, diffusing to many areas of the world, but not without conﬂ  ict in its wake. Militant regimes have 
attacked the religion in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. In Thailand, Buddhism has been under pressure owing to rising political tensions. At the same time, Buddhism has gained adherents in the western world.IBH C60° 60°

Shintoism
Buddhism is mixed with a local religion in Japan, where 
Shintoism is found. This ethnic religion, which is related to Buddhism, focuses particularly on nature and ances-tor worship (Fig. 7.10). The Japanese emperor made Shintoism the state religion of Japan in the nineteenth century, according himself the status of divine-right monarch. At the end of World War II, Japan separated Shintoism from the emperor, taking away the state sanc-tioning of the religion. At the same time, the role of the emperor in Japan was diminished and given a ceremonial status. The number of adherents in Japan is somewhere between 105 and 118 million, depending on the source. The majority of Japanese observe both Buddhism and Shintoism.
From the Hearth of the Huang He River Valley
Taoism
While the Buddha’s teachings were gaining converts in India, a religious revolution of another kind was taking place in China. T wo major schools of Chinese philosophy, T aoism and Confucianism, were forming. The beginnings of Taoism  are unclear, but scholars trace the religion to an 
older contemporary of Confucius, Lao-T su, who published a volume titled T ao-te-ching , or “Book of the Way.” In his 
teachings, Lao-T su focused on the proper form of political rule and on the oneness of humanity and nature: people, he said, should learn to live in harmony with nature. This gave rise to the concept of Feng Shui —the art and sci-
ence of organizing living spaces in order to channel the life forces that exist in nature in favorable ways. According to tradition, nothing should be done to nature without con-sulting the geomancers , people who know the desires of the 
powerful spirits of ancestors, dragons, tigers, and other beings occupying the natural world and can give advice on how to order things according to Feng Shui.
Among the T aoist virtues are simplicity and sponta-
neity, tenderness, and tranquility. Competition, possession, and even the pursuit of knowledge are to be avoided. War, 
punishment, taxation, and ceremonial ostentation are viewed as evils. The best government, according to Lao-T su, is the least government.
Thousands of people began to follow T aoism. 
Followers worshipped Lao-T su as a god, something of

the arrivals of Islam and Christianity and lay overgrown until uncovered and restored under Dutch colonial rule from 1907 to 1911. The monument consists of a set of intricately carved, walled terraces; the upper terraces are open. In the upper terraces  
stand six dozen stupas, each containing a sculpture of the Buddha in meditation, visible when you peer through the openings.”Field Note

which Lao-T su would have disapproved. People, animals, 
even dragons became objects of worship.
Confucianism
Confucius lived from 551 to 479 bce, and his followers 
constructed a blueprint for Chinese civilization in almost every ﬁ  eld, including philosophy, government, and edu-cation. In religion, Confucius addressed the traditional Chinese tenets that included belief in heaven and the existence of the soul, ancestor worship, sacriﬁ  cial rites, 
and shamanism. He held that the real meaning of life lay in the present, not in some future abstract existence, and that service to one’s fellow humans should supersede ser-vice to spirits.
Confucianism is mainly a philosophy of life, and like 
T aoism, Confucianism had great and lasting impacts on Chinese life. Appalled at the suffering of ordinary people at the hands of feudal lords, Confucius urged the poor to assert themselves. He was not a prophet who dealt in prom-ises of heaven and threats of hell. He denied the divine ancestry of China’s aristocratic rulers, educated the landless and the weak, disliked supernatural mysticism, and argued that human virtues and abilities, not heritage, should deter-mine a person’s position and responsibilities in society.
Confucius came to be revered as a spiritual leader 
after his death in 479 bce, and his teachings diffused widely throughout East and Southeast Asia. Followers built temples in his honor all over China. From his writ-ings and sayings emerged the Confucian Classics, a set of 13 texts that became the focus of education in China for 2000 years. Over the centuries, Confucianism (with its T aoist and Buddhist ingredients) became China’s state ethic, although the Chinese emperor modiﬁ  ed Confucian ideals over time. For example, one emperor made worship of and obedience to the emperor part of Confucianism. In government, law, literature, religion, morality, and many other ways, the Confucian Classics were the guide for Chinese civilization.
Diffusion of Chinese Religions
Confucianism diffused early into the Korean Peninsula, Japan, and Southeast Asia, where it has long inﬂ  uenced the 
practice of Buddhism. More recently, Chinese immigrants expanded the inﬂ  uence of the Chinese religions in parts 
of Southeast Asia and helped to introduce their principles into societies ranging from Europe to North America.
The diffusion of Chinese religions even within 
China has been tempered by the Chinese government’s efforts to suppress religion in the country. Like the Soviet government, the communist government that took con-trol of China in 1949 attempted to ban religion, in this case Confucianism, from public practice. But after guid-ing all aspects of Chinese education, culture, and society for 2000 years, Confucianism did not fade easily from the Chinese consciousness. Confucianism and T aoism are so entrenched in Chinese culture that the government’s antireligion initiatives have not had their desired effect. For example, a Chinese government policy in the 1950s that ran counter to the teachings of Feng Shui met much resistance by tradition-bound villagers. Feng Shui geo-mancers in China have the responsibility of identifying suitable gravesites for the deceased so that gravesites leave the dead in perfect harmony with their natural surround-ings. The Chinese created burial mounds for their dead at these chosen gravesites. The pragmatic communist Chinese government saw the burial mounds as a barrier  Figure 7.10

to efﬁ  cient agriculture, so they leveled the burial mounds 
during the communalization program. T radition-bound 
villagers strongly opposed the practice, and they harbored a reserve of deep resentment that exploded much later in the revolutionary changes of the 1970s.
Geomancy is still a powerful force in China today, 
even in urban areas with large populations. Geographer Elizabeth T eather studied the rise of cremation and colum-baria (resting places for ashes) in Hong Kong, investigat-ing the impact Feng Shui has had on the structures and the continued inﬂ  uence of Chinese religious beliefs on burial practices in the extremely densely populated city of Hong Kong. T raditional Chinese beliefs favor a cofﬁ  n and burial 
plot aligned with Feng Shui teachings. However, with the growth of China’s population, the government has highly encouraged cremation over the past few decades. The availability of burial plots in cities like Hong Kong is quite low, and the costs of burial plots have risen in turn.
T eather explains that although cremation is on the 
rise in Hong Kong, traditional Chinese beliefs are dictat-ing the ﬁ  nal resting places of ashes. Most Chinese people, she states, have a “cultural need to keep ancestral remains appropriately stored and in a single place.” In North America and Europe, a family often chooses to scatter the ashes of a cremated loved one, but a Chinese family is more likely to keep the ashes together in a single identiﬁ  -
able space so that they can return to visit the ancestor dur-ing Gravesweeping Festivals—annual commemorations of ancestors during which people visit and tend the graves of their ancestors. T eather describes how Feng Shui mas-ters are consulted in the building of columbaria and how Feng Shui helps dictate the price placed on the niches for sale in the columbaria, with the lowest prices for the niches near the “grime of the ﬂ  oor.”
From the Hearth of the Eastern Mediterranean
Judaism
Judaism grew out of the belief system of the Jews, one of several nomadic Semitic tribes living in Southwest Asia about 4000 years ago. The roots of Jewish religious tra-dition lie in the teachings of Abraham (from Ur), who is credited with uniting his people to worship only one God. According to Jewish teaching, Abraham and God have a covenant in which the Jews agree to worship only one God, and God agrees to protect his chosen people, the Jews.
The history of the Jews is ﬁ  lled with upheaval. Moses 
led them from Egypt, where they had been enslaved, to Canaan, where an internal conﬂ  ict developed and the 
nation split into two branches, Israel and Judah. Israel was subsequently wiped out by enemies, but Judah survived longer, only to be conquered by the Babylonians and the Assyrians. The Jews regrouped to rebuild their headquar-ters, Jerusalem, but then fell victim to a series of foreign powers. The Romans destroyed their holy city in 70 ce (Common Era) and drove the Jews away, scattering the adherents to the faith far and wide. Jews retained only a small presence on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean until the late nineteenth century.
Our map shows that, unlike most other ethnic reli-
gions, Judaism is not limited to contiguous territories. Rather, Judaism is distributed throughout parts of the Middle East and North Africa, Russia, Ukraine, Europe, and parts of North and South America (Fig. 7.6). According to The Atlas of Religion, of all the world’s 18 million Jews, 
40.5 percent live in the United States, 40.2 percent live in Israel, and then in rank order, less than 5 percent live in France, Canada, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Argentina. Judaism is one of the world’s most inﬂ  uential 
religions, although it claims only 18 million adherents.
During the nineteenth century, a Reform movement 
developed with the objective of adjusting Judaism and its practices to current times. However, many feared that this reform would cause a loss of identity and cohesion, and the Orthodox movement sought to retain the old precepts. 
Between those two extremes is a sector that is less strictly orthodox but not as liberal as that of the reformers; it is known as the Conservative movement. Signiﬁ  cant differ-
ences in ideas and practices are associated with these three branches, but Judaism is united by a strong sense of ethnic distinctiveness.
Diffusion of Judaism
The scattering of Jews after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem is known as the diaspora—a term that now signi-ﬁ es the spatial dispersion of members of any ethnic group. 
The Jews who went north into Central Europe came to be known as Ashkenazim, and the Jews who scattered across North Africa and into the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) are called Sephardim. For centuries, both the Ashkenazim and the Sephardim were persecuted, denied citizenship, driven into ghettos, and massacred (Fig. 7.11).
In the face of constant threats to their existence, the 
Jews were sustained by extraordinary efforts to maintain a sense of community and faith. The idea of a homeland for the Jewish people, which became popular during the nineteenth century, developed into the ideology of Zionism. Zionist ideals are rooted in the belief that Jews should not be absorbed into other societies. The horrors of the Nazi campaign against Jews from the 1930s through World War II, when the Nazis established concentration camps and killed some six million Jews, persuaded many Jews to adopt Zionism. Jews from all over the world con-cluded that their only hope of survival was to establish a strongly defended homeland on the shores of the eastern Mediterranean. Aided by sympathetic members of the international community, the Zionist goal of a Jewish state became a reality in 1948, when a United Nations resolution carved two states, Israel and Palestine, out of the territory of the eastern Mediterranean.c07Religion.indd Page 216  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 216  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 Where Did the Major Religions of the World Originate, and How Do Religions Diffuse?  217
While adherents to Judaism live across the world, 
many Jews have moved to Israel since its establishment. The 
Israeli government passed the Law of Return in 1950, which recognizes the rights of every Jew to immigrate to Israel. In 2004, over 10,000 Jews left the former Soviet Union for Israel, along with nearly 4000 Jews from Africa and over 2000 from each of western Europe and North America.
Christianity
Christianity can be traced back to the same hearth in the Mediterranean as Judaism, and like Judaism, Christianity stems from a single founder, in this case, Jesus. Christian teachings hold that Jesus is the son of God, placed on Earth to teach people how to live according to God’s plan. Christianity split from Judaism, and it, too, is a monothe-istic religion. Jesus of Nazareth was born in Bethlehem, and during his lifetime, he traveled through the eastern Mediterranean region preaching, performing miracles, and gaining followers. Christians celebrate Easter as the day Jesus rose from the dead after being cruciﬁ  ed three days prior (Good Friday). According to Christian teaching, the cruci-ﬁ xion of Jesus fulﬁ  lled an ancient prophecy and changed the 
fate of Jesus’ followers by giving them eternal life.
The ﬁ  rst split in Christianity, between Roman 
Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox, developed over a num-ber of centuries. At the end of the third century, the Roman Emperor Diocletian attempted to keep the empire together by dividing it for purposes of government. His divisions left a lasting impression. When the Roman Empire fell and broke apart, the western region, centered on Rome, fell on hard times. The eastern region, with Constantinople (now Istanbul in T urkey) at its heart, became the new focus of the Byzantine Empire (Fig. 7.12). Christianity thrived there and radiated into other areas, including the Balkan Peninsula. This split into west and east at the end of the Roman Empire became a cultural fault line over time. It was formally recog-nized in 1054 ce when the Roman Catholic Church (cen-tered in Rome) and the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church (centered in Constantinople) separated.
The Eastern Orthodox Church suffered blows when 
the Ottoman T urks defeated the Serbs in Kosovo in 1389, when the T urks took Constantinople in 1453, and when the Soviet Union suppressed Eastern Orthodox churches in the twentieth century. T oday, the Eastern Orthodox Church remains one of the three major branches of Christianity and is experiencing a revival in former Soviet areas.
The Roman Catholic Church claims the most 
adherents of all Christian denominations (more than 1 billion). Centered in Rome, Catholic theology teaches the infallibility of the pope in interpreting Jesus’ teachings and in formulating ways to navigate through the modern world. The power of the Roman Catholic Church peaked in the Middle Ages, when the Church controlled sources of knowledge and worked in conjunction with monarchs to rule much of western Europe.
During the Middle Ages, Roman Catholic authorities 
often wielded their power in an autocratic manner and dis-tanced themselves from the masses. The widespread dif-fusion of the Black Death during the 1300s and the deaths Field Note
“Many cities in Europe have distinct Jew-ish neighborhoods with active synagogues 
and communities. Others, such as Prague, have historical Jewish neighborhoods, marked with cemeteries and synagogues that have become historical sites or museums. The Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague was built in the 1400s and the last person was buried there in 1787. The jumbled mass of tombstones in the cemetery is a result of layers of people (up to 12 layers) being buried within the conﬁ  nes of 
the cemetery over the centuries.”

that resulted caused many Europeans to question the role 
of religion in their lives. The Roman Catholic Church itself also experienced divisions within its hierarchy, as evidenced by the Western Schism during the early 1300s, which at one point resulted in three people claiming to be the pope. Reformers to the Church soon followed. During the ﬁ  fteenth and sixteenth centuries, John Huss, Martin 
Luther, John Calvin, and others challenged fundamental teachings of Roman Catholicism, leading to the Protestant Reformation and opposing the practices of the Church’s leaders. The Protestant  sects of Christianity compose the 
third major branch of Christianity. Like Buddhism’s chal-lenge to Hinduism, the Protestant Reformation affected Roman Catholicism, which answered some of the chal-lenges to its theology in the Counter-Reformation. Some countries in Europe, including Switzerland (Fig. 7.13), are still divided into Catholic and Protestant regions.
Christianity is the largest and globally the most widely 
dispersed religion. Christian churches claim more than 1.5 billion adherents, including some 430 million in Europe  Figure 7.12

and the former Soviet Union; approximately 355 million 
in North and Middle America; approximately 310 million in South America; perhaps 240 million in Africa; and an estimated 165 million in Asia. Christians thus account for nearly 40 percent of the members of the world’s major reli-gions. Roman Catholicism, as noted earlier, is the largest segment of Christianity. Figure 7.6 reveals the strength of Roman Catholicism in parts of Europe and North America, and throughout much of Middle and South America. Among religious adherents in signiﬁ  cant parts of 
North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, Protestant churches prevail. Eastern Orthodox churches have as many as 180 million followers in Europe, Russia and its neighboring states, Africa (where a major cluster exists in Ethiopia), and North America.
Diffusion of Christianity
The dissemination of Christianity occurred as a result of expansion combined with relocation diffusion. In western Europe, Christianity declined during the centuries imme-diately after the fall of the Roman Empire. Then a form of contagious diffusion took place as the religious ideas that had been kept alive in remote places such as coastal Ireland and Scotland spread throughout western Europe. In the case of the Eastern Orthodox faith, contagious diffusion took place from the religion’s hearth in Constantinople to the north and northeast. Protestantism began in several parts of western Europe and expanded to some degree through contagious diffusion. Much of its spread in north-ern and central Europe, however, was through hierarchical diffusion, as political leaders would convert—sometimes to escape control from Rome—and then the population would gradually accept the new state religion.
The worldwide diffusion of Christianity occurred 
during the era of European colonialism beginning in the sixteenth century. Spain invaded and colonized Middle and South America, bringing the Catholic faith to those areas. Protestant refugees who were tired of con-ﬂ ict and oppression in Europe came to North America 
in large numbers. Through the efforts of missionar-ies, Catholicism found adherents in Congo, Angola, Mozambique, and the Philippines. The Christian faith today has over 33,000 denominations. Hundreds of these denominations engage in proselytizing (purposeful spreading of religious teachings) around the world, cre-ating an incredibly complex geographical distribution of Christians within the spaces of the world map that are shaded in “Christian” (Fig. 7.6).
The Christian faith has always been characterized by 
aggressive and persistent proselytism, and Christian mis-sionaries created an almost worldwide network of conver-sion during the colonial period that endures and contin-ues to expand today (Fig. 7.14).

T oday, missionaries from North America and Europe work not only in their home countries, but also in developing countries where they work to bring food, shelter, edu-cation and health care around the world. Missionaries from develop-ing countries also travel in North America and Europe to inform church members of needs in their home countries.

220 Chapter 7  Religion
Islam
Like Christianity, Islam, the youngest of the major reli-
gions, can be traced back to a single founder, in this case, Muhammad, who was born in Mecca in 571 ce. According to Muslim belief, Muhammad received the truth directly from Allah in a series of revelations that began when the Prophet was about 42 years old. During these revelations, Muhammad spoke the verses of the Qu’ran (Koran), the Islamic holy book. Muhammad admired the monothe-ism of Judaism and Christianity; he believed Allah had already revealed himself through other prophets includ-ing Judaism’s Abraham and Christianity’s Jesus. However, Muhammad came to be viewed as the one true prophet among Muslims.
After his visions, Muhammad had doubts that he 
could have been chosen to be a prophet but was con-vinced by further revelations. He subsequently devoted his life to the fulﬁ  llment of the divine commands. In 
those days the eastern Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula were in religious and social disarray, with Christianity and Judaism coexisting with polytheistic religions. Muhammad’s opponents began to combat his efforts. The Prophet was forced to ﬂ  ee Mecca, where he 
had been raised, for Medina, and he continued his work from this new base.
In many ways, the precepts of Islam revised Judaic 
and Christian beliefs and traditions. The central precept is that there is but one god, who occasionally reveals him-self through the prophets, such as Abraham, Jesus, and Muhammad. Another key precept is that Earthly matters are profane; only Allah is pure. Allah’s will is absolute; he is omnipotent and omniscient. Muslims believe that all humans live in a world that was created for their use but only until the ﬁ  nal judgment day.
Adherents to Islam are required to observe the “ﬁ  ve 
pillars” of Islam (repeated expressions of the basic creed, frequent prayer, a month of daytime fasting, almsgiving, and, if possible, at least one pilgrimage to Mecca in one’s lifetime). The faith dictates behavior in other spheres of life as well. Islam forbids alcohol, smoking, and gam-bling. In Islamic settlements, the people build mosques to observe the Friday prayer and to serve as social gathering places (Fig. 7.15).
Islam, like all other major religions, is divided—
principally between Sunni Muslims (the great majority) and the Shi’ite or Shiah Muslims (concentrated in Iran). Smaller sects of Islam include Wahhabis, Suﬁ  s, Salaﬁ  sts, 
Alawites, Alevis, and Yazeedis. The religion’s main divi-sion between Sunni and Shi’ite occurred almost imme-diately after Muhammad’s death, and it was caused by a conﬂ ict over his succession. Muhammad died in 632 ce, 
and to some, the rightful heir to the Prophet’s caliph-ate (area of inﬂ  uence) was Muhammad’s son-in-law, Ali. 
Others preferred different candidates who were not nec-essarily related to Muhammad. The ensuing conﬂ  ict was marked by murder, warfare, and lasting doctrinal dis-agreements. The Sunni Muslims eventually prevailed, but the Shi’ite Muslims, the followers of Ali, survived in some areas. Then, early in the sixteenth century, an Iranian (Persian) ruling dynasty made Shi’ite Islam the only legitimate faith of that empire—which extended into what is now southern Azerbaijan, southeastern Iraq, and western Afghanistan and Pakistan. This gave the Shi’ite branch unprecedented strength and created the foundations of its modern-day culture region centered on the state of Iran.
Decendants of Muhammed through his daughter 
Fatimah and his son-in-law Ali are recognized through honoriﬁ  c titles such as sayyids, syeds or sharifs. They gener-
ate respect from both Sunni and Shi’ites, however Shi’ites place much more emphasis on lineage. Shi’ite veneration of the descendants of Muhammad has contributed to a much more centralized and hierarchical clergy than in the Sunni world.

 Where Did the Major Religions of the World Originate, and How Do Religions Diffuse?  221
In the Shi’ite branch, Imams are leaders whose 
appointments they regard as sanctioned by Allah. Shi’ites 
believe that the Imam is the sole source of true knowledge, without sin and infallible, making them a potent social as well as political force. Sunni Islam is much less central-ized. An imam for a Sunni is simply a religious leader at a mosque or recognized religious scholar.
Diffusion of Islam
At the time of Muhammad’s death in 632 ce, Muhammad and his followers had converted kings on the Arabian Peninsula to Islam. The kings then used their armies to spread the faith across the Arabian Peninsula through invasion and conquest. Moving west, in waves of inva-sion and conquest, Islam diffused throughout North Africa. By the early ninth century, the Muslim world included emirates extending from Egypt to Morocco, a caliphate occupying most of Spain and Portugal, and a uniﬁ  ed realm encompassing Arabia, the Middle East, Iran, and most of what is today Pakistan. Ultimately, the Arab empire extended from Morocco to India and from T urkey to Ethiopia. Through trade, Muslims later spread their faith across the Indian Ocean into Southeast Asia (Fig. 7.16). As Muslim traders settled trading ports in Southeast Asia, they established new secondary hearths of Islam and worked to diffuse the religion contagiously from the secondary hearths. Recent diffusion of Islam into Europe (beyond Spain and Portugal), South Africa, and the Americas has largely been a result of migration—of relocation diffusion.
T oday, Islam, with more than 1.57 billion follow-
ers, ranks second to Christianity in global number of adherents. Islam is the fastest growing of the world’s major religions, dominating in Northern Africa and Southwest Asia, extending into Central Asia, the for-mer Soviet Union and China, and including clusters in Indonesia, Bangladesh, and southern Mindanao in the  Figure 7.16

Philippines. Islam is strongly represented in India, with 
over 161 million adherents, and in Subsaharan Africa, with approximately 190 million adherents. Islam has followers in Bosnia and Albania and has substantial numbers of adherents in the United States and west-ern Europe (Fig. 7.17). The largest Muslim country is actually outside of the Middle East, in Southeast Asia. Indonesia has nearly 200 million adherents. In fact, of Islam’s 1.57 billion followers, more than half live out-side Southwest Asia and North Africa. And not every-one in Southwest Asia and North Africa is Muslim. The region is home to millions of Christians, Jews, and other smaller religious sects.
Indigenous and Shamanist
Finally, Figure 7.6 identifies large areas in Africa and several other parts of the world as “Indigenous and Shamanist.” Indigenous religions are local in scope, 
usually have a reverence for nature, and are passed down through family units and groups (tribes) of indigenous peoples. No central tenet or belief can be ascribed to all indigenous religions. We do not group indigenous religions because they share a common theology or belief system. Instead, we group indige-nous religions because they share the same pressures from the diffusion of global religions—and they have survived (Fig. 7.18).
Shamanism is a community faith in which people 
follow their shaman—a religious leader, teacher, healer, and visionary. Shamans have appeared at various times to various peoples in Africa, Native America, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. These appearances had similar effects on the cultures of widely scattered peoples. Perhaps if these shamanist religions had developed elaborate bureaucracies and sent representatives to international congresses, they would have become more similar and might have evolved into another world religion. Unlike Christianity or Islam, the shamanist faiths are small and comparatively isolated.
Shamanism is a traditional religion, an intimate 
part of a local culture and society, but not all traditional religions are shamanist. Many traditional African reli-gions involve beliefs in a god as creator and provider, in divinities both superhuman and human, in spirits, and in a life hereafter. Christianity and Islam have con-verted some followers of traditional religions, but as the map indicates, they have failed to convert most African peoples, except in limited areas. Figure 7.6 shows where the adherents to traditional religions remain in the majority.
The Rise of Secularism
The world map of religion might mislead us into assum-ing that all or even most of the people in areas portrayed as Christian or Buddhist do in fact adhere to these faiths. This is not the case. Even the most careful analysis of worldwide church and religious membership produces a total of about 4 billion adherents—in a population of  Figure 7.17
London, England. This large 
mosque in East London serves the United Kingdom’s largest Muslim community. It attests to the scale of Islamic migration to the United Kingdom over the past several decades. Global religions are not grouped into neat geographical spaces; they are now found side by side all over the world.

over 6 billion. Hundreds of millions of peoples are not 
counted in this ﬁ  gure because they practice traditional religions. But even when they are taken into account, additional hundreds of millions do not practice a reli-gion at all. Moreover, even church membership ﬁ  gures 
do not accurately reﬂ  ect the number of active members  
of a church. When polled about their church-going activities, fewer than 3 percent of the people in Scandinavia reported frequent attendance, and in France and Great Britain, less than 10 percent reported attending church at least once a month. The lack of members active or otherwise underscores the rise of secularism—indifference to or rejection of organized religious affiliations and ideas.
The level of secularism throughout much of the 
Christian and Buddhist worlds varies from country to country and regionally within countries. In North America, for instance, a poll in 2002 asked whether people felt religion was very important to them. Only 30 per-cent of Canadians agreed with this statement, whereas 59 percent of Americans felt religion was very important to them. In France, the government recently banned the wearing of overt religious symbols in public schools. The French government wanted to remove the “disruption” of Muslim girls wearing hijab (head scarves), Jewish boys wearing yarmulke (skullcaps), and Christian students wearing large crosses to school. The French government took the position that banning all religious symbols was the only egalitarian approach.
Looking at polls that ask about the importance of 
religion for people in a country does not give us the com-plete picture, however. Canada’s 30 percent rate would be much, much lower if we removed recent or second-generation immigrants from the tally. Immigrants often hold onto their religion more fervently in part to help them ease into a new place and to link into a community in their new home. Buddhists and Hindus on Canada’s west coast and Muslims in the eastern part of Canada have a higher rate of adherence to their religion than many long-term residents of the country.

“Arriving at the foot of erosion-carved Uluru just before sun-rise it is no surprise that this giant monolith, towering over the Australian desert, is a sacred place to local Aboriginal peoples. Throughout the day, the changing sun angle alters its colors until, toward sunset, it turns a ﬁ  ery red that yields to a bright orange. At night it looms against the moonlit, starry sky, silent sentinel of the gods. Just two years before this, my ﬁ  rst visit in 1987, the Australian government had returned “Ayers Rock” (named by European settlers after a South Australian political leader) to Aboriginal ownership, and reclaimed its original name, Uluru. Visitors continued to be allowed to climb the 1100 feet (335m) to the top, from where the view over the desert is awesome.My day had begun eventfully when a three-foot liz-
ard emerged from under my motel-room bed, but the chain-assisted climb was no minor challenge either. At the base you are warned to be “in good shape” and some would-be climbers don’t make it, but the rewards of per-sisting are dramatic. Uluru’s iron-rich sandstone strata have been sculpted into gullies and caves, the latter containing Aboriginal carvings and paintings, and on the broad summit there are plenty of places where you can sit quietly to con-template the historic, religious, and cultural signiﬁ  cance of 
a place that mattered thousands of years before globaliza-tion reached Australia.”c07Religion.indd Page 223  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 223  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
224 Chapter 7  Religion
In some countries, antireligious ideologies are con-
tributing to the decline of organized religion. Church 
membership in the former Soviet Union, which dropped drastically during the twentieth century under com-munist rule, rebounded after the collapse of the Soviet system but to much lower numbers. Maoist China’s drive against Confucianism was, in part, an antireligious effort, and China continues to suppress some organized religious practices, as reports of religious persecution continue to emanate from China.
In many areas labeled Christian on the world 
map of religions, from Canada to Australia and from the United States to western Europe, the decline of organized religion as a cultural force is evident. In the strongly Catholic regions of southern Europe and Latin America, many people are dissatisﬁ  ed with the papal teachings on birth control, as the desire for larger families wanes in these regions of the world. In Latin America, the Catholic Church is being challenged by rapid social change, the diffusion of other Evangelical Christian denominations into the region, and sexual abuse scandals similar to those that have occurred in the United States and Canada.
Secularism has become more widespread dur-
ing the past century. People have abandoned organized religion in growing numbers. Even if they continue to be members of a church, their participation in church activities has declined. T raditions have also weakened. For example, there was a time when almost all shops and businesses were closed on Sundays, preserving the day for sermons, rest, and introspection. T oday, shop-ping centers are mostly open as usual, and Sunday is increasingly devoted to business and personal affairs, not to church. T o witness the rise of secularism among Christians in America ﬁ  rst-hand, explore your town, city, or suburb on a Sunday morning: how many people are wearing casual clothes and hanging out at the cof-fee shop reading newspapers, and how many people are attending church services?
At the same time that secularism is on the rise in 
the United States, many people who do follow their reli-gion seem to be doing so more fervently. Religious tradi-tions are stronger in some cultural regions of the United States than in others, and Sunday observance continues at a high level, for example, in the Mormon culture area of the United States. Even though Catholic dioceses are closing churches and declaring bankruptcy in some parts of the Northeast, other Catholic dioceses are building new churches and enormous activity halls in other parts of the country. Moreover, Evangelical and other alter-native churches are growing rapidly in some parts of the United States and western Europe. Entire industries, such as Christian music and Christian publications, depend on the growing commitment of many Americans and Europeans to their religion.The division between secularism and fervent adher-
ence is not conﬁ  ned to the Christian world. Secularism is growing in South Korea, where half of the population does not profess adherence to any particular religion. Although major faiths are experiencing an overall decline in adherence, several smaller religions are growing in importance: Baha’i, Cao Dai, Jainism, and the Spiritual Church of Brazil.
Migration plays a large role in the diffusion of religions, both universalizing and ethnic. As Europe becomes more secular, migrants from outside of Europe continue to settle in the region. Imagine Europe 30 years from now. Predict where in Europe secularism will be the most prominent and where religious adherence will strengthen.
HOW IS RELIGION SEEN IN THE 
CULTURAL LANDSCAPE?
Religion marks cultural landscapes with houses of 
worship such as churches, mosques, synagogues, and tem-
ples; with cemeteries dotted with religious symbols and icons; with stores designated to sales of religious goods; and even with services provided to religious adherents who travel to sacred sites. When adherents voluntarily travel to a religious site to pay respects or participate in a ritual at the site, the act of travel is called a pilgrimage. 
Geographers who study religion are interested in the act of pilgrimage and its impacts on place, people, religion, culture, and environment.
Sacred sites are places or spaces people infuse with 
religious meaning. Members of a religious group may deﬁ ne a space or place as sacred out of either reverence or 
fear. If a sacred site is held with reverence, adherents may be encouraged to make a pilgrimage to the sacred site for rejuvenation, reﬂ  ection, healing, or fulﬁ  llment of a reli-
gious commitment.
In ancient human history, sacred spaces were typi-
cally features in the physical geographic landscape, such as buttes, mountain peaks, or rivers. In more recent history, as universalizing religions diffused across the world, sacred sites were abandoned, usurped, or altered. Geographer Mary Lee Nolan studied Irish sacred sites and observed that many of the remote physical geo-graphic features of the Irish landscape were sacred to the Celtic people (Fig. 7.19). When Roman Catholicism c07Religion.indd Page 224  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 224  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
diffused to Ireland, the Catholic Church usurped many 
of these features, infusing them with Christian meaning. Nolan described the marriage of Celtic sacred sites and Christian meaning:
The early Celtic Church was a unique institution, more open to syncretism of old and new religious traditions than was the case in many other parts of Europe. Old holy places, often in remote areas, were “baptized” in the new religion or given new meaning through their historical, or more often legendary, association with Celtic saints. Such places were characterized by sacred site features such as heights, insularity, or the presence of holy water sources, trees, or stones.
Nolan contrasted Irish sacred sites with those in conti-nental Europe, where sacred sites were typically built in urban, accessible areas. In continental Europe, Nolan found that the “sacred” (bones of saints or images) was typically brought to a place in order to infuse the place with meaning.
In many societies, features in the physical geo-
graphic landscape remain sacred to religious groups. Access to and use of physical geographic features are constrained by private ownership, environmental con-cerns, and the act of designating certain sacred spaces as public recreational or tourist areas. Geographer Kari Forbes-Boyte studied Bear Butte, a site sacred to members of the Lakota and Cheyenne people in the northern Great Plains of the United States and a site that became a state park in the 1960s. Bear Butte is used today by both Lakota and Cheyenne people in religious ceremonies and by tourists who seek access to the recreational site. Nearby Devils T ower, which is a National Monument, experiences the same pull between religious use by American Indians and recre-ational use by tourists.
Places such as Bear Butte and Devils T ower experi-
ence contention when one group sees the sites as sacred and another group does not. In many parts of the world, sacred sites are claimed as holy or signiﬁ  cant to adher-ents of more than one religious faith. In India several sites are considered sacred by Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains. Speciﬁ  cally, Volture Peak in Rajgir in northeast-ern India is holy to Buddhists because it is the site where Buddha ﬁ  rst proclaimed the Heart Sutra, a very impor-
tant canon of Buddhism. Hindus and Jains also consider the site holy because they consider Buddha to be a god or prophet. Fortunately, this site has created little discord among religious groups. Pilgrims of all faiths peacefully

Ardmore, Ireland
At St. Declan’s Holy Well in Ireland, I found a 
barbed wire fence substituting for the more traditional thorn tree as a place to hang scraps of clothing as offerings. This tradition, which died out long ago in most parts of Con-tinental Europe, was one of many aspects of Irish pilgrimage that led me to speculate on “Galway-to-the-Ganges” survival of very old religious customs on the extreme margins of an ancient Indo-European culture realm. My subsequent ﬁ  eldwork focused on contem-porary European pilgrimage, but my curios-ity about the geographical extent of certain ancient pilgrimage themes lingered. While traveling in Asia, I found many similarities among sacred sites across religions. Each reli-gion has formation stories, explanations of how particular sites, whether Buddhist monasteries or Irish wells, were recog-nized as sacred. Many of these stories have similar elements. And, in 1998, I traveled across Russia from the remote Kam-chatka Peninsula to St. Petersburg. Imagine my surprise to ﬁ  nd the tradition of hanging rag offerings on trees alive and well all the way across the Russian Far East and Siberia, at least as far as Olkon Island in Lake Baikal.

congregate in the place year after year. Other sacred sites 
are not so fortunate. Some of the most contentious sites are in Jerusalem, a city that three major world religions regard as holy.
Sacred Sites of Jerusalem
The ancient city of Jerusalem is sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Jews saw Jerusalem as sacred before the birth of Jesus, but most Jews ﬂ  ed from the city and surrounding area during the diaspora. For Jews, Jerusalem remained sacred even though they did not control it, and when the Zionist movement gained strength, Jews set their sights on controlling the sacred city once again. The most important sacred site for Jews is the Western Wall (also called the Wailing Wall), at the edge of the T emple Mount in Jerusalem (Fig. 7.20). The T emple Mount was the site of the two great tem-ples of the Jewish people. Occupying the top of a mod-est hill where, according to the T orah (the sacred book of Judaism that is also part of the Old T estament of Christianity’s sacred book, the Bible), Abraham almost sacriﬁ  ced his son Isaac. On this hill, Jews built two 
temples, each of which was destroyed by invaders. The Western Wall is all that remains of the second temple, and Jews gather in the place to remember the story of Abraham and the destruction of the temples and to offer prayers. The name “Wailing Wall” evokes the sounds of mourning over the temple’s demise made by Jewish pil-grims and recognizes the suffering of Jews over time.
For Christians, Jerusalem is sacred both because 
of the sacriﬁ  ce Abraham was willing to make of his son at the T emple Mount and because Jesus’ cruciﬁ  x-
ion took place outside of the city’s walls. Jesus was then buried near the Cross (Jews only allowed kings to be buried inside the city walls) in a tomb Roman Emperor Constantine marked with a basilica that is now the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Fig. 7.21). Christians believe that from that tomb Jesus rose from the dead on Easter. For centuries the Roman, and then the Byzantine, Empire controlled the city and protected their sacred site.
In the seventh century, Muslim armies took control 
over the city from the Byzantine Empire. Muslims con-structed a mosque called the Dome of the Rock adjacent to the Western Wall to mark the site where Muslims believe Muhammad arrived from Mecca and then ascended into heaven (Fig. 7.20). The site Jews call T emple Mount is called al-Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) by Muslims.
Christians and Muslims fought the Crusades of the 
Middle Ages over the question of who should control the sacred land of Jerusalem. Between 1095 and 1199,

 How Is Religion Seen in the Cultural Landscape?  227
European political and religious leaders organized a 
series of Crusades to retake the so-called Holy Land. The ﬁ  rst Christian crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, ruling the city for almost 100 years. As the ﬁ  rst 
crusaders made their way across what is modern-day T urkey on their way to Jerusalem, they also left a series of conquests in their wake—laying claim to the city of Antioch and a number of other strategically important sites. Some of the crusaders returned to western Europe, but many settled, mingled, and intermarried with the local people. Muslims ultimately retook Jerusalem in 1187, 
and later Christian crusaders were unable to conquer it again. The Crusades helped cement a commitment by Christians to protect the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Similarly, the Crusades and then Zionism cemented a commitment by Muslims to protect the Dome of the Rock and by Jews to protect the Western Wall. The commitment by three major religions to protect and control their sacred sites has led to political turmoil that echoes far beyond Jerusalem, as we will see in the next section of this chapter.
Landscapes of Hinduism and Buddhism
T raditional Hinduism is more than a faith; it is a way of life. Pilgrimages follow prescribed routes, and rituals are attended by millions of people. Festivals and feasts are frequent, colorful, and noisy. Hindus believe that the erection of a temple, whether modest or elaborate, bestows merit on the builder and will be rewarded. As a result, the Hindu cultural landscape—urban as well as rural—is dotted with countless shrines, ranging from small village temples to structures so large and elabo-rate that they are virtually holy cities. The location of shrines is important because Hindus prescribe that such holy places should minimally disrupt the natural land-scape. Whenever possible, a Hindu temple is located in a “comfortable” position, for example, under a large, shady tree. Hindus also want their temples to be near water because many gods will not venture far from water and because water has a holy function, ritual bathing, in Hinduism (Fig. 7.22). A village temple should face the village from a prominent position, and followers must make offerings frequently. Small offerings of fruit and ﬂ owers lie before the sanctuary of the deity honored by 
the shrine.
The cultural landscape of Hinduism is the cul-
tural landscape of India, its main culture region. As one travels through India, the Hindu faith is a visual as well as an emotional experience. T emples and shrines, holy animals by the tens of millions, distinctively garbed holy men, and the sights and sounds of long proces-sions and rituals all contribute to a unique atmosphere (Fig. 7.23).
When Buddha received enlightenment, he sat 
under a large tree, the Bodhi (enlightenment) tree at Bodh Gaya in India. The Bodhi tree now growing on the site is believed to be a descendant of the original tree. The Bodhi tree has a thick, banyan-like trunk and a wide canopy of leafy branches. Because of its association with the Buddha, the tree is revered and protected.

Field Note
“In the summer of 2007, the newer, Hi-Tec city area of Hyder-
abad, India was under construction. Migrant workers built new roads, new apartment houses, and new ofﬁ  ce buildings 
throughout the city. Beautiful homes reﬂ  ected the wealth 
accrued among many of the city’s newly wealthy. In front of the new homes, I could see Hinduism in the cultural land-scape, as many owners built temples for their favorite Hindu god. In the oldest parts of the city, I visited Golconda Fort, built more than 1500 years ago. On the day I was there, the Hindu women of the city were participating in the Bonalu Festival as an act of honoring Mother Goddess. The women climbed nearly 400 steps to the top of the fort, carrying with them offerings of food. At the top, I was welcomed into the temple. I took off my shoes and took part in a festival that began in the mid-1800s, when the Hindu women began the festival to ward off the anger of the gods, as the city stood under the siege of the bubonic plague.”

Japan, its purposeful planting marking the cultural land-
scape of numerous villages and towns.
Buddhism’s architecture includes some magniﬁ  -
cent achievements, especially the famed structures at Borobudur in central Java (Indonesia). Buddhist shrines include stupas, bell-shaped structures that protect burial 
mounds. Buddhists also construct temples that enshrine an image of Buddha in his familiar cross-legged pose, as well as large monasteries that tower over the local land-scape. The pagoda is perhaps Buddhism’s most famil-iar structure. Its shape is derived from the relic (often funeral) mounds of old. Every fragment of its construc-tion is a meaningful representation of Buddhist philoso-phy (Fig. 7.24).
Along with the religious structures such as temples, 
we can see evidence of religion in the cultural landscapes of the dead. T raditionally, Hindus, and more recently Buddhists, and Shintoists cremate their dead. Thus, wher-ever a large pocket of Hindus, Buddhists, or Shintoists live, a crematorium will be nearby. The Hindu crema-torium in Kenya stands in stark contrast to much of the rest of the cultural landscape and signals the presence of a large Hindu population (see Fig. 7.2).The cultural landscapes of South Asian religions 
extend into Southeast Asia, where several religions that began in the South Asian hearth (including Hinduism and Buddhism) diffused into Southeast Asia. Later, Islam replaced the South Asian religions in many of these places, and even later Christian missionaries gained adherents in Southeast Asia when Christian gov-ernments encouraged the migration of their people and their religion to their colonies in these areas. T oday, we can stand in Singapore, study the cultural landscape, and see the inﬂ  uences of Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam.
Landscapes of Christianity
The cultural landscapes of Christianity’s branches reﬂ ect the changes the faith has undergone over the 
centuries. In medieval Europe the cathedral, church, or monastery was the focus of life. Other buildings clus-tered around the tower, steeple, and spire of the church that could be seen (and whose bells could be heard) for miles in the surrounding countryside (Fig. 7.25). In the

“To reach the city of Yangon, Myanmar (Burma) we had to transfer to a ferry and sail up the Rangoon River for sev-eral hours. One of Southeast Asia’s most spectacular Bud-dhist shrines is the golden Shwedogon Pagoda in the heart of Yangon. The golden dome (or chedi) is one of the ﬁ  nest 
in Southeast Asia, and its religious importance is striking: eight hairs of the Buddha are preserved here. Vast amounts of gold have gone into the creation and preservation of the Shwedogon Pagoda; local rulers often gave the monks their weight in gold—or more. Today, the pagoda is a cornerstone of Buddhism, drawing millions of faithful to the site. Myan-mar’s ruling generals have ruined the country’s economy and continue to oppress Buddhist leaders who try to convey public grievances to the regime, even blocking international aid following the devastating impact of cyclone Nargis in May 2008. The generals have a powerful ally in the Chinese, who are building bridges and laying pipelines but who exer-cise little inﬂ  uence over the military junta.”c07Religion.indd Page 229  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 229  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

square or plaza in front of the church, crowds gathered 
for ceremonies and festivals, and the church was always present—even if the event was not primarily religious. Good harvests, military victories, public announce-ments, and much else took place in the shadow of the symbol of religious authority. As a result of mercantil-ism and colonialism, Europeans exported the ornate architecture of European Christian churches wherever they settled (Fig. 7.26).
The Reformation, the rise of secularism, and the 
decline of organized religion are reflected in the cul-tural landscape as well. Many of the ornate churches in the town squares of medieval cities now function as museums instead of serving active congregations. Other churches in secular regions are closing their doors or significantly reducing the number of religious services offered. Y et, not all of Europe’s sacred sites have become secularized. Famous cathedrals continue to hold services while tourists peruse the interior of the vast churches. And other sacred sites of Christianity, such as churches for specific saints, places where sig-nificant events occurred, and Vatican City in Rome, are still major pilgrimage sites in Europe. When in Rome, the leader of the Catholic Church, the pope, holds an outdoor service for pilgrims to Vatican City, attracting thousands of followers to St. Peter’s Square each week (Fig. 7.27).
Cities in Europe are also home to centuries-old 
Christian cemeteries. T raditionally, Christians bury,  Figure 7.25

rather than cremate, their dead, and in cities, the cem-
eteries are often crowded with tombstones. Outside of European cities and in North America, Christian cem-eteries can resemble large parks. These cemeteries often reﬂ ect class differences: some graves are marked by sim-
ple tombstones, whereas others are elaborate structures. With rising land-use pressures and the associated costs of burial, however, cremation is becoming increasingly com-mon among Christians—particularly in North America and western Europe.
Religious Landscapes in the United States
The United States, a predominantly Christian country, demonstrates considerable diversity in its religious cul-tural landscapes. In The Cultural Geography of the United States, geographer Wilbur Zelinsky constructed a map identifying religious regions in the country. Figure 7.28 presents a modiﬁ  ed version of Zelinsky’s map. The reli-
gious regions on the map are familiar to anyone who has even the most general impression of cultural differences in the United States.
The New England region is strongly Catholic; 
the South’s leading denomination is Baptist; the Upper Midwest has large numbers of Lutherans; and the Southwest is predominantly Spanish Catholic. The broad midland region extending from the Middle Atlantic to the Mormon region (in the Western United States) has a mixture of denominations in which no sin-gle church dominates; this is also true of the West. As Figure 7.28 shows, some regions represent local cluster-ing, such as the French Catholic area centered in New Orleans and the mixed denominations of Peninsular Florida, where a large Spanish Catholic cluster has emerged in metropolitan Miami.
More interesting than the simple regionalization 
of religions in the United States is the variation in cul-tural landscapes within regions. In a 2008 study, geog-raphers Barney Warf and Mort Winsberg used data on religious adherents by county in the United States to discern what counties and regions of the country have the most and the least religious diversity. Warf and Winsberg deﬁ  ned religious diversity as having a vari-ety of religions within a small spatial unit, in this case a county. One way the authors mapped religious diver-sity is presented in Figure 7.29, a map showing counties with the least religious diversity in the darkest colors. In counties with the darkest shading, one religion accounts for 64 percent or more of all religious adherents in the county. In comparing Figure 7.29 to Figure 7.28, we can see that the Mormon region in Utah and southern Idaho, the Southern Baptist region in the South, and the Catholic region of the Northeast are some of the least diverse regions in the country. In these regions, you can expect to see the imprint of one major religion through-out the cultural landscape. By contrast, religious regions characterized by many lightly colored counties have a rich religious mix.
The plain white churches of the South and 
Lutheran Upper Midwest coincide with the Protestant Church’s pragmatic spending of church money—not on art and architecture as the Catholic Church historically did (Fig. 7.30). Conversely, many Catholic churches in the United States, both in the Northeast and in Chicago, as well as in other immigrant-magnet cities, were built by immigrants who lived in ethnic neighborhoods.

Immigrants spent their own money and used their build-
ing skills to construct more ornate churches and dozens of cathedrals that tied them back to their country of ori-gin and demonstrated their commitment to their faith (Fig. 7.31).
Landscapes of Islam
Elaborate, sometimes magniﬁ  cently designed mosques 
whose balconied minarets rise above the townscape domi-nate Islamic cities, towns, and villages. Often the mosque is the town’s most imposing and most carefully main-tained building. Five times every day, from the towering minarets, the faithful are called to prayer. The sounds emanating from the minarets ﬁ  ll the streets as the faithful converge on the holy place to pray facing Mecca.
At the height of Islam’s expansion into eastern North 
Africa and southern Europe, Muslim architects incor-porated earlier Roman models into their designs. The results included some of the world’s greatest architectural masterpieces, such as the Alhambra Palace in Granada and the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain.

use of geometric designs and calligraphy—the intricacy of 
which is truly astounding (Fig. 7.32). During the eleventh century, Muslim builders began glazing the tiles of domes and roofs. T o the beautiful arcades and arched courtyards, they added the exquisite beauty of glass-like, perfectly symmetrical cupolas. Muslim architecture represents the unifying concept of Islamic monotheism: the perfection and vastness of the spirit of Allah.
Islam achieved its greatest artistic expression, its 
most distinctive visible element, in architecture. Even in the smallest town, the community helps build and main-tain its mosque. The mosque symbolizes the power of the faith and its role in the community. Its primacy in the cul-tural landscape conﬁ  rms the degree to which, in much of 
the Muslim world, religion and culture are one.
One of the most well-known pilgrimages in the 
modern world is the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, the hajj. One of the ﬁ  ve pillars of Islam, the hajj implores all Muslims (if ﬁ  nancially and physically able) to make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once during their lifetime. Each year, over 1.3 million Muslims from outside of Saudia Arabia and over 1 million from inside the country make the hajj (Fig. 7.33). The pilgrimage requires the faithful to follow certain steps of reverence in a certain order and within a certain time frame. As a result, the pil-grims move from Mecca through the steps of the hajj en masse. In 2004, over 250 pilgrims were trampled to death as hordes of people followed the steps of the pilgrimage, and in 1990 over 1400 pilgrims suffered the same fate. The Saudi government now restricts the number of visas granted each year to Muslims from outside of the country. Y et, the number of pilgrims continues to climb, and the services needed for Muslim pilgrims during the hajj and during the rest of the year now employ four times as many people in Saudi Arabia as the oil industry does. The land-scape around Mecca reﬂ  ects the growing number of pil-
grims year round, as towers of apartment buildings and hotels encircle the sacred city.
Geographer Surinder Bhardwaj has studied non-
hajj pilgrimages in Islam, which include “visits to sacred shrines of holy men, the graves of saints and Imams, and the tombs of martyrs of the faith.” Although some sects of Islam see non-hajj pilgrimage as non-Islamic, the ziarats 
(non-hajj pilgrimages) are important to a growing num-ber of Muslims. Bhardwaj points out that the hajj is oblig-atory but the ziarat is voluntary. He explains that study of the ziarat helps geographers understand the many varia-tions and regional forms of Islam in the world today. For example, Bhardwaj describes how the ziarat in Indonesia (the country with the largest number of Muslims) reﬂ  ects 
the continued inﬂ  uence of pre-Islamic ways. Especially in 
the interior of Indonesia, Islam has mixed with Buddhism and Hinduism, both of which stress the importance of pil-grimage. Similar to Ireland, where the Catholic Church usurped Celtic sacred sites, Bhardwaj found that many sites in Indonesia that were sacred under Hinduism and Buddhism were usurped by Islam, which changed the 
object of pilgrimage from non-Muslim to Muslim.

 What Role Does Religion Play in Political Conﬂ  icts?  235
Choose a pilgrimage site, such as Mecca, Vatican City, or the 
Western Wall, and describe how the act of pilgrimage (in some cases by millions) alters this place’s cultural landscape and environment.
WHAT ROLE DOES RELIGION PLAY 
IN POLITICAL CONFLICTS?
Religious beliefs and histories can bitterly divide peo-
ples who speak the same language, have the same ethnic 
background, and make their living in similar ways. Such divisions arise not only between people adhering to differ-ent major religions (as with Muslims and Christians in the former Yugoslavia) but also among adherents of the same religion. Some of the most destructive conﬂ  icts have pitted 
Christian against Christian and Muslim against Muslim.
Religious conﬂ  icts usually involve more than dif-
ferences in spiritual practices and beliefs. Religion often functions as a symbol of a wider set of cultural and politi-cal differences. The “religious” conﬂ  ict in Northern 
Ireland is not just about different views of Christianity, and the conﬂ  ict between Hindus and Muslims in India 
has a strong political as well as religious dimension. Nevertheless, in these and other cases religion serves as the principal symbol around which conﬂ  ict is organized.
Conﬂ  icts along Religious Borders
A comparison between Figure 7.6 and a political map of the world (see Fig. 8.3) reveals that some countries lie entirely within the realms of individual world religions, whereas other countries straddle interfaith boundaries , 
the boundaries between the world’s major faiths. Many countries that lie astride interfaith boundaries are subject to potentially divisive cultural forces—particularly when  Figure 7.33

the people see their religious differences as a source of 
social division within their country. This is the case in sev-eral countries in Africa that straddle the Christian-Muslim interfaith boundary (Fig. 7.34). Other countries with major religious disputes straddle intrafaith boundaries , the 
boundaries within a single major faith. Intrafaith bound-aries include divisions between Christian Protestants and Catholics, divisions between Muslim Sunni and Shi’ite, and the like. This is the case in Northern Ireland, where Protestants and Catholics, who both worship in the Christian tradition, have a long history of conﬂ  ict.
Interfaith and intrafaith boundaries can be peace-
ful, or they can spur enormously violent political con-ﬂ ict. Israel/Palestine, Nigeria, and the former Yugoslavia 
provide examples of interfaith conﬂ  icts, and Northern 
Ireland is an example of an intrafaith conﬂ  ict. In each case, religious difference is not the only factor, but it certainly plays an important symbolic and perceptual role.

 What Role Does Religion Play in Political Conﬂ  icts?  237
Israel and Palestine
Earlier in this chapter, we discussed the history of the con-
ﬂ ict over the sacred space of Jerusalem. The region of 
Israel and Palestine is home to one of the most contentious religious conﬂ  icts in the world today. In the aftermath of World War I, European colonialism came to a region that had previously been controlled and fought over by Jews, Romans, Christians, Muslims, and Ottomans. A newly formed League of Nations (a precursor to the United Nations) recognized British control of the land, calling the territorial mandate Palestine. At that point, the vast major-ity of people living in the land were Muslim Palestinians. The goal of the British government was to meet Zionist goals and to create, in Palestine, a national homeland for the Jewish people (who had already begun to migrate to the area). The British explicitly assured the world that the religious and civil rights of existing non-Jewish peoples in Palestine would be protected. The British policy did not produce a peaceful result, however. Civil disturbances erupted almost immediately, and, by 1947–1948, Jews and Palestinians engaged in open warfare.
In the wake of World War II and the Holocaust, 
many more Jews moved to the region. Shortly after the war, the British mandate ended, and the newly formed United Nations voted to partition Palestine—creating independent Israeli and Palestinian states. From the drawing of the ﬁ  rst map, the partitioning plan was set for failure (see Fig. 3.11). Palestinians and Israelis were to live in noncontiguous states. Surrounding Arab states reacted violently against the new Jewish state. Israel survived through numerous wars in which Palestinians lost their lands, farms, and villages. As a consequence of war and the consolidation of the Israeli state, Palestinians migrated or ﬂ ed to refugee camps in neighboring Arab states.
In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Israel gained con-
trol of the Palestinian lands in Gaza, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights. The international community calls these lands the Occupied T erritories. The Jewish pres-ence in Gaza has always been small. But over the last three decades, the Israelis built Jewish housing settle-ments throughout the West Bank and have expanded the city of Jerusalem eastward into the West Bank (razing Palestinian houses along the way) to gain more control of territory. The Israeli government severely restricts new building by Palestinians, even on lands in the Palestinian zones of the West Bank. Events in the early and mid-1990s began to change this religious-political mosaic as self-government was awarded to Gaza and to small areas inside the West Bank. Palestinian Arabs were empowered to run their own affairs within these zones. Stability and satisfactory coexistence could lead to fur-ther adjustments, some thought—and eventually a full-ﬂ edged Palestinian state, but mistrust on both sides has 
kept that from happening.In September 2005, the Israeli government shifted 
its policy toward the Gaza Strip. Israel evacuated the settlements that had been built there, burned down the buildings that remained (Fig. 7.35), and then granted autonomy to Gaza. The Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip rejoiced—visiting the beaches that were previously open only to Israeli settlers and traveling across the bor-der into Egypt to purchase goods. Although Palestinians now have greater freedom within the Gaza Strip, they are economically isolated and the standard of living has dropped.
The Israeli government tightly controls the ﬂ  ow of 
Palestinians and goods into and out of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Gaza is surrounded by fences, and in some places a wall—with land mines in certain areas and dust road to show footprints. Most controversially, however, the Israelis have set about constructing a security fence in the West Bank, which does not follow the 1947 West Bank border but dips into the West Bank to include some of the larger Israeli settlements on Israel’s side of the fence. This may greatly complicate any future territorial settle-ment, and some Israelis are opposed to it. But many oth-ers argue that Palestinians continue to ﬁ  ght a war against the Israelis—with terrorism. Palestinian attacks against Israelis threaten the everyday lives of the Israeli people; no bus, coffee shop, restaurant, or sidewalk is safe from the threat of terrorist attack. Similarly, in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, the Israeli military hunts the suspects, shedding blood in Palestinian neighborhoods, further exacerbating tensions.
The situation in Israel and Palestine today does not 
reﬂ ect a simple interfaith boundary. The tiny region has a 
multitude of interfaith boundaries, especially in the West Bank (Fig. 7.36). The settlements in the West Bank have produced many miles of interfaith boundaries within a small political territory.
Until 2011 the Palestinians in the West Bank and 
Gaza were represented by separate governments—the lat-ter by Hamas, a group long opposed to Israel’s existence. A 2011 accord between the two governments altered the political landscape, but the prospects for peace between Israelis and Palestinians are greatly complicated by the fact that each side feels it has a historic (in the minds of some, even a divine) right to the land and by the violence inﬂ icted on each side by the other.
Nigeria
As Figure 7.34 makes clear, many of the countries of West Africa are predominantly Muslim in the North, but not in the South. Nigeria is a prime example. With over 155 million people, Nigeria is Africa’s most populous coun-try, and it is fairly evenly divided between Muslims in the North and Christians in the South (see Fig. 8.11). Since c07Religion.indd Page 237  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 237  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

1999, when the country emerged from years of military 
rule, Nigeria has witnessed persistent violence between these communities that has cost tens of thousands of lives.
As with many such conﬂ  icts, the causes of north-
south violence in Nigeria cannot be attributed solely to different religious beliefs. The southern part of Nigeria is characterized by a wet tropical rainforest climate. Moving north, Nigeria’s climate becomes progressively hotter and drier. The climate in the central part of the country is somewhere in between, being both wetter than the arid north and drier than the south. This climatic variation is associated with different modes of livelihood. In northern Nigeria, many people engage in cattle herding, whereas in the south of the country, most rural peoples are farmers.
As land has become scarcer, the fertile grasslands 
of central Nigeria have become coveted by both cattle herders and farmers. It is in these central regions of the country where the worst violence between Muslims and Christians has taken place. One such area is a place called Jos, some 300 miles north of Lagos, the largest city in the country. In the ﬁ  rst six months of 2011 alone, nearly 
1000 people were killed in Jos. The violence may have its roots in the struggle for access to land, political power, and resources, but religion has served as a key marker of  Figure 7.35

difference in the region. Not surprisingly, then, the con-
ﬂ ict escalated into a series of attacks and reprisals in the 
name of the region’s Christian and Muslim populations. Such developments reinforce the perceptual importance of Nigeria’s intrafaith Christian-Muslim boundary, and promote a sense—whether right or wrong—that reli-gious differences represent the most important obstacle to social cohesion in the country.
The Former Yugoslavia
A number of religious and linguistic fault lines run through the Balkan Peninsula. We discussed one of the fault lines earlier in the chapter when we looked at the fall of the Roman Empire and the subsequent divi-sion between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. The dividing line between the two branches of Christianity runs right through the Balkan Peninsula. The Slovenians and Croats in the west of the peninsula are Catholic, and the Serbians and Montenegrans in the east and south of the peninsula are Eastern Orthodox.
The Balkan Peninsula is also a dividing line for lan-
guage in Europe, with people west of the line using the Roman alphabet and people east of the line using the Cyrillic alphabet. The Serbo-Croatian language is now recognized as two languages, Serbian and Croatian. Even when these languages were recognized as a single language, the Croats used the Roman alphabet in the written form of their language and the Serbs used the Cyrillic script.
These divisions in religion and language were com-
plicated by the entry of another universalizing religion during the 1300s. The Ottoman T urks, a Muslim empire, brought soldiers to their northwestern military frontier and converted some Serbian communities to Islam. The Ottomans took control of the region by force, begin-ning with the bloody battle of Kosovo in 1389, which was the Serbian homeland during the European Middle Ages. From that point on, the region has had pockets of Muslims in the middle and south of the peninsula, cre-ating numerous interfaith boundaries. Even by the early 1990s, the clusters of Muslims on the peninsula were quite large, in terms of both territorial extent and population. Muslims had a strong presence in Bosnia and in its capital, Sarajevo, as well as in Kosovo and Macedonia.
Yugoslavia is another example of a country thrown 
together and left wrestling with signiﬁ  cant diver-
sity. The name “Yugoslavia” means land of the South Slavs. The country was formed in the chaotic after-math of World War I before 1920. When World War II began, many Serbs already resented the Muslim pres-ence in the region, harking back to the time when the Ottomans defeated the Serbs. During World War II, the Croats, who supported the German Nazis, fought the anti-Nazi Serbs. Croats, with the might of the Nazis behind them, sought to rid their territories of Serbs, who lived in Croatia and Bosnia during the war. After 1945, Yugoslavia came under the control of a commu-nist dictator, Josip Broz Tito. For decades, Tito ran Yugoslavia as a centralized country with six republics. Tito never healed the ethnic divides in Yugoslavia; he simply suppressed them and pushed them out of view during his control. After his death in 1980, nationalist sentiments began to emerge, and Yugoslavia was sub-sequently swept up in the winds of change produced by the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s. Slovenia was the ﬁ  rst republic to declare its indepen-dence from the rest of the country, followed closely by Croatia and Bosnia.
Serbia, led by an ardent Serb nationalist, Slobodan 
Milosevic, tried to force the republics to stay in a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. The multiethnic republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was caught in the middle when war broke out between the Croats and Serbs (Fig. 7.37). The Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina were soon attacked by both camps. The term ethnic cleansing  
came into use to describe the ouster of Bosnian Muslims and others from their homes and lands—and some-times their slaughter. Serbs and Croats also sought to “cleanse” each other’s territories. In the midst of war, the Croats and Muslims formed a coalition to ﬁ  ght 
against the Serbs. More than 2.5 million Bosnians were driven from their homes, and hundreds of thousands were injured or killed. Atrocities became so rampant that other countries agreed to form a war crimes tribu-nal while the war was ongoing.
The international community belatedly became 
involved, and a partition plan was put in place. New countries joined the United Nations: Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The plan divided Bosnia and Herzegovina into two republics: one for Croats and Muslims and one for Serbs. The future of Bosnia and Herzegovina is uncertain. The central government has little power, and the wounds of war are still raw. The long line divid-ing the two republics was secured by 60,000 NATO peacekeepers from Europe and the United States, but oversight is now in the hands of a European Union force (Fig. 7.38).
In 2003, the name Yugoslavia disappeared from 
the maps and was replaced by the name Serbia and Montenegro for the former Yugoslavia. The splinter-ing of the Balkan Peninsula continued in 2006 when Montenegro voted for independence in a referendum. The United States and the European Union recog-nized Montenegro’s statehood, and in the same year, Montenegro joined the United Nations.
A ﬁ  nal development of signiﬁ  cance began to unfold 
in the second half of the 1990s, when a group of ethnically

Albanian Muslims in Kosovo (an autonomous region in 
southwestern Serbia) demanded autonomy. The Serbian leadership responded with a campaign of ethnic cleans-ing against Kosovo Albanians in 1999. They razed whole villages, drove out people in great numbers, and killed many. The international community was once again slow to intervene. This time the North Atlantic T reaty Organization (NATO), led by the United States, initiated a bombing campaign against Serbia that brought hostili-ties to a halt and paved the way for the introduction of a peacekeeping force. After failed attempts to reach a nego-tiated agreement on independence, in 2008 the Kosovars unilaterally declared the founding of the new independent state of Kosovo. Many countries, including the United States, recognized the new state, but others—notably Russia and, of course, Serbia—did not. Figure 7.37

Northern Ireland
A number of western European countries, as well as 
Canada and the United States, have large Catholic com-munities and large Protestant communities, and often these are reﬂ  ected in the regional distribution of the pop-
ulation. In most places, the split between these two sects of Christianity creates little if any rift today. The most notable exception is Northern Ireland.
T oday Northern Ireland and Great Britain 
(which includes England, Scotland, and Wales) form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the UK). This was not always the case. For centuries, the island of Ireland was its own entity, marked by a mixture of Celtic religious practices and Roman Catholicism. As early as the 1200s, the English began to inﬁ  ltrate the island of Ireland, taking control 
of its agricultural economy. Colonization began in the sixteenth century, and by 1700, Britain controlled the entire island. During the 1800s, the Irish colony pro-duced industrial wealth for Britain in the shipyards of the north. Protestants from the island of Great Britain (primarily Scotland) migrated to Ireland dur-ing the 1700s to Northern Ireland to take advantage of the political and economic power granted to them in the colony. During the 1800s, migrants were drawn to northeastern Ireland where industrial jobs and oppor-tunities were greatest. During the colonial period, the British treated the Irish Catholics harshly, taking away their lands, depriving them of their legal right to own property or participate in government, and regarding them as second-class citizens.
In the late 1800s, the Irish began reinvigorating 
their Celtic and Irish traditions; this strengthening of their identity fortiﬁ  ed their resolve against the British. In the early 1900s, the Irish rebelled against British colo-nialism. The rebellion was successful throughout most of the island, which was Catholic dominated, leading to the creation of the Republic of Ireland. But in the 1922 settle-ment ending the conﬂ  ict, Britain retained control of six counties in the northeast, which had Protestant majori-ties. These counties constituted Northern Ireland, which became part of the United Kingdom. The substantial Catholic minority in Northern Ireland, however, did not want to be part of the United Kingdom (Fig. 7.39)—par-ticularly since the Protestant majority, constituting about two-thirds of the total population (about 1.6 million) of Northern Ireland, possessed most of the economic and political advantages.
As time went on, economic stagnation for both 
populations worsened the situation, and the Catholics in particular felt they were being repressed. T errorist acts by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), an organi-zation dedicated to ending British control over all of Ireland by violent means if necessary, brought British troops into the area in 1968. Although the Republic of

 What Role Does Religion Play in Political Conﬂ  icts?  243
Ireland was sensitive to the plight of Catholics in the 
North, no ofﬁ  cial help was extended to those who were engaging in violence.
In the face of worsening conﬂ  ict, Catholics and 
Protestants in Northern Ireland increasingly distanced their lives and homes from one another. The cultural land-scape marks the religious conﬂ  ict, as each group clusters 
in its own neighborhoods and celebrates either important Catholic or Protestant dates (see Fig. 6.11). Irish geogra-pher Frederick Boal wrote a seminal work in 1969 on the Northern Irish in one area of Belfast. Boal used ﬁ  eldwork 
to mark Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods on a map, and he interviewed over 400 Protestants and Catholics in their homes. Boal used the concept of activity space to demonstrate how Protestants and Catholics had each cho-sen to separate themselves in their rounds of daily activity. Boal found that each group traveled longer distances to shop in grocery stores tagged as their respective religion, walked further to catch a bus in a neighborhood belong-ing to their own religion, gave their neighborhood differ-ent toponyms, read different newspapers, and cheered for different football (soccer) teams.
Although religion is the tag-line by which we refer to 
“the T roubles” in Northern Ireland, the conﬂ  ict is much 
more about nationalism, economics, oppression, access to opportunities, terror, civil rights, and political inﬂ  uence. 
But religion and religious history are the banners beneath which the opposing sides march, and church and cathe-dral have become symbols of strife rather than peace.
In the 1990s, Boal updated his study of Northern 
Ireland and found hope for a resolution. Boal found that religious identities were actually becoming less intense among the younger generation and among the more educated. In Belfast, the major city in Northern Ireland, Catholics and Protestants are now intermixing in spaces such as downtown clubs, shopping centers, and college campuses.
Boal’s observations proved to be right, and a move-
ment toward resolution among the population along with the British government’s support for devolution (see Chapter 8) helped fuel the April 1998 adoption of an Anglo-Irish peace agreement known as the Belfast Agreement & Good Friday Agreement, which raised hopes of a new period of peace in Northern Ireland. Following a decade of one step forward and two steps back toward peace, Northern Ireland ﬁ  nally realized a tenuous peace in 2007 when the Northern Ireland Assembly (Parliament) was reinstated. The two sides have made major strides toward reconciliation in recent years, but the conﬂ  ict has not gone away. While some of the younger generation may be mix-ing socially, more “peace walls” (giant barriers between Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods) have been con-structed since the signing of the Belfast agreement—raising concerns that segregation may be increasing.

244 Chapter 7  Religion
Religious Fundamentalism and Extremism
T oday, throughout the world, religious leaders and mil-
lions of their followers are seeking to return to the basics of their faith. The drive toward religious fundamental-
ism is often born out of frustration over the perceived breakdown of society’s mores and values, lack of religious authority, failure to achieve economic goals, loss of a sense of local control, or a sense of violation of a religion’s core territory. Regardless of the religion, a fundamental-ist group holds its religious beliefs as nonnegotiable and uncompromising.
People in one society often fear fundamentalism 
in other societies without recognizing it in their own. In fact, what many call fundamentalism is sometimes bet-ter deﬁ  ned as extremism. Religious extremism is fun-damentalism carried to the point of violence. The attacks on the United States in September 2001 reinforced the tendency of many Americans to equate extremism with Islam. Y et Christian extremism is also a potent force, as witnessed in the United States when religious zealots kill physicians who perform legal abortions. Fundamentalists can be extremists, but by no means are all fundamental-ists, whether Christian, Muslim, Jewish, or any other religion, extremists.
T oday the forces of globalization affect religions. 
Education, radio, television, and travel have diffused notions of individual liberties, sexual equality, and free-dom of choice—but also consumerism and secularism. In the process, the extent of cultural diffusion and inno-vation has accelerated. Some churches have managed to change with the times, allowing women to serve as priests and homosexuals to marry, and generally liberalizing their doctrines. Others have gone in the opposite direction, reafﬁ rming fundamental or literalist interpretations of 
religious texts and trying to block modern inﬂ  uences and 
external cultural interference.
Christianity
The Roman Catholic Church has long resisted innova-tions deemed incompatible with the fundamentals of the faith. Among the issues giving rise to disputes are birth control, family planning, and the role of women in the religious bureaucracy. The major religions tend to be male-dominated, and few women have managed to enter the hierarchy. This is true in the Roman Catholic Church, where women are not allowed to serve as priests. The Roman Catholic Church has over 1 billion adher-ents and has a global diplomatic and political presence, affecting policies in numerous places and on many top-ics. For example, the Roman Catholic Church preaches against the use of artiﬁ  cial means of birth control as well as abortion. During the September 1994 United Nations Conference on Population and Development, the Roman Catholic Church sought to ally itself with Islamic coun-tries against advocates of population control.
In the United States, certain sects of the Catholic 
Church continue to hold Mass in Latin and are much more fundamentalist than the rest of the Church. Some of these sects are part of the Catholic Church and continue to oper-ate within the purview of the Church. Others stand apart from the Catholic Church and do not recognize the pope, nor does the Vatican sanction them. For example, actor/director Mel Gibson belongs to the Holy Family Church, which does not recognize the pope, and the Vatican does not recognize that church as part of the Catholic Church. Gibson’s church is most associated with the Traditionalist 
Catholic Movement, a fundamentalist movement that believes the Mass should still be conducted in Latin and that modern popes and clergy are not following the tradi-tional theology and practices of the Church.
In the United States, Christian fundamental-
ism is also associated with Protestant faiths. Preaching a doctrine of strict adherence to the literal precepts of the Bible, many Protestant Christian fundamentalists believe that the entire character of contemporary society needs to be brought into alignment with biblical prin-ciples. Fundamentalist Protestant churches range from tiny churches to enormous warehouse-style churches with thousands of members. Regardless of the size of the congregation, fundamentalist Protestant churches have become increasingly active in political and social arenas—arguing for prayer in public schools, the teaching of cre-ationism in science courses, a strict ban on abortion, and the adoption of laws outlawing gay marriage (Fig. 7.40). In the process, they have gained considerable inﬂ  uence, 
especially in local politics (school boards and city councils).
Judaism
Like all other major religions, Judaism has fundamental-ist sects. The most conservative of the three major sects of Judaism is Orthodox. Y et, the Orthodox sect is divided into several different schools of thought, teachings, and synagogues. Much diversity exists among Orthodox Jews, with varying views on Israel, education, and interaction with non-Orthodox Jews. Fundamentalist Jews who have migrated to Israel tend to vote for more conserva-tive candidates in Israeli elections, affecting election out-comes. Similarly, some fundamentalist Jews who remain in Europe or North America send money to certain politi-cians in Israel in support of policies such as Israeli settle-ments on the West Bank.
Judaism also has its extremist element—people 
whom the majority of Jews denounce and whom the government of Israel has even banned from the coun-try. Among the Jewish extremist groups is the Kach and Kahane Chai—followers of the late American-born, Israeli Rabbi Meir Kahane. Rabbi Kahane espoused anti-c07Religion.indd Page 244  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 244  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 What Role Does Religion Play in Political Conﬂ  icts?  245
Arabism in his teachings, and his followers (Kahane Chai) 
continue to do so. Members of Kach or Kahane Chai are suspected in several terrorist acts in Isreal.
Islam
Other major faiths must also confront the pressures of change. Not all Muslim communities, for example, adhere precisely to the rules of the Qu’ran prohibiting the use of alcohol. The laws of Islam, which (like some other religions) are very strict when interpreted literally, are not applied with equal force throughout the Muslim world.
Prior to September 11, the growth of a fundamen-
talist movement, the T aliban in Afghanistan, provided a particularly striking example of how quickly a fundamen-talist government can use extremism to change a place. The T aliban regime seized control of much of the coun-try during the 1990s and asserted the strictest fundamen-talist regime in the contemporary world. The leadership imposed a wide range of religious restrictions, sought to destroy all statues depicting human forms, required fol-lowers of Hinduism to wear identifying markers, and for-bade women to appear in public with their head exposed.The T aliban in Afghanistan also provided a haven for 
the activities of Islamic extremists who sought to promote an Islamic holy war, or jihad, against the West in general and the United States in particular. One of the key ﬁ  gures 
in the Islamic extremist movement of the past decade, Osama bin Laden, helped ﬁ  nance and mastermind a variety 
of terrorist activities conducted against the United States, including the destruction of the World T rade T owers, the attack on the Pentagon, and the downing of Flight 93 on September 11, 2001 (Fig. 7.41). Bin Laden is now dead, but those following in his footsteps are a product of a revo-lutionary Islamic movement that views the West as a great enemy and that opposes both the westernization and liber-alization of the traditionally Islamic realms. These beliefs are certainly not representative of Islam as a whole, but they are religious beliefs. Indeed, they can be traced to a form of Islam, known as Wahhabi Islam , which developed 
in the eighteenth century in opposition to what was seen as sacrilegious practices on the part of Ottoman rulers. The champions of the opposition movement called for a return to a purportedly pure variant of Islam from centuries ear-lier. The Saudi Arabian state is the hearth of Wahhabi Islam today, as the Saudi Royal family has championed

Wahhabi Islam since the 1800s. Saudis fund Wahhabi 
Islamic schools, called madrasses, around the world.
A variety of forces have fueled the violent path on 
which the Wahhabi extremist movement has embarked, but some of these forces are unambiguously geographic. Perhaps the most important is the widely held view among movement followers that “inﬁ  dels” have invaded the 
Islamic holy land over the past 80 years. Of particular con-cern to Islamic extremists are the presence of American military and business interests in the Arabian Peninsula, the establishment of the state of Israel, and the support European and American governments have given Israel. A principal goal of the movement is to bring an end to what are seen as improper territorial incursions. A second geo-graphically related concern of Wahhabi extremists is the diffusion of modern culture and technology and its impact on traditional lifestyles and spiritual practices. Ridding the Islamic world of such inﬂ  uences is also a major goal.
Islamic fundamentalists who have resorted to vio-
lence in pursuit of their cause (thereby becoming extrem-ists) are relatively small in number. Y et one of the critical contemporary issues is the extent to which they can attract widespread support throughout the Islamic world. The potential for such support is greatest among those who feel that they are the losers in the contemporary global eco-nomic order and who feel their cultures are fundamentally threatened. By extension, a key to avoiding the division of the world into mutually antagonistic religious realms is to promote an atmosphere in which such feelings do not become widespread. This, in turn, suggests the impor-tance of non-Islamic cultures conveying an understanding of the gap between mainstream and fundamentalist Islam, and supporting the economic and political efforts of genu-inely democratic forces in Islamic countries.
Boal’s studies in Northern Ireland demonstrate that solving a religious conﬂ  ict is typically not about theology; it is about identity. You are assigned the potentially Nobel Prize–win-ning task of “solving” the conﬂ  ict either in Northern Ireland or in Israel and Palestine. Using Boal’s example, determine how you can alter activity spaces and change identities to create the conditions for long-lasting peace in this conﬂ  ict zone. Figure 7.41

Religion is a major force in shaping and changing culture. The major world religions today all stem from an area of Eurasia stretching from the eastern Mediterranean to China. Major world religions are distributed regionally, with Hinduism in India; Buddhism, T aoism, Shintoism, and Chinese philosophies in East and Southeast Asia; Islam reaching across North Africa, through the Middle East and into Southeast Asia; Shamanist religions mainly in Subsaharan Africa; and Christianity in Europe, Western Asia, the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Judaism, another major world religion, is not as concentrated. T oday, Judaism has a base in Israel and has adherents scattered throughout Europe and the Americas.
As the September 11, 2001, attacks on New Y ork City and Washington, D.C. made 
clear, religious beliefs can drive people to extremist behaviors. On a day-to-day basis, however, religion more typically drives cultures—shaping how people behave, how people perceive the behaviors of others, and how people across place, scale, and time interact with each other.c07Religion.indd Page 247  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 247  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

249  Political Geography   8     CHAPTER
  Field Note    Independence Is Better Than Servitude  
  I arrived in Ghana just after an assas-
sination attempt on the coun-try’s ﬁ  rst president,   Kwame   
Nkrumah. As I drove through the capital city of Accra in 1962, I stopped short when I saw a statue of President Nkrumah in the middle of the street. I have seen plenty of statues of leaders in my travels, but this one was unique.   Ghanians   had dressed their hospital-ridden president in a hospital gown and bandaged his head!  
  I stopped the car to take a picture (Fig. 8.1), and I 
read the proclamations on Nkrumah’s statue. Written in English, they said, “To me the liberation of Ghana will be meaningless unless it is linked up with the lib-eration of Africa” and “We prefer self-government with danger to servitude in tranquility.”  
  Ghana, the ﬁ  rst   Subsaharan   African colony 
to become independent, gained its independence in 1960. A wave of decolonization swept through Africa in the 1960s (Fig. 8.2)—fueled by the hope that decolonization would bring political and economic independence. But decolonization did not eliminate political and economic problems for Africa. Former colonies became states, reaching political indepen-dence under international law; each new country was now sovereign, legally ha  v  ing the ultimate say over what happened within the borders. New politi-cal problems arose within the formally independent countries. Each had to deal with a mixture of peoples, cultures, languages, and religions that were grouped within single poli  t  ical units during the colonial period.

They had to try to adapt colonial social and political structures to the needs of 
the newly independent states. Economically, the new countries found themselves fully intertwined in the world economy, unable to control fundamental elements of their own eco  n  omies.  
  For many of the new African states, Nkrumah’s words rang true—independence 
was better than servitude, even if it meant danger instead of tranquility. Nkrumah, elected in 1960, was overthrown by the mil  i  tary in 1966 and died in exile in 1972.  
  The story of Ghana and President Nkrumah is a familiar one. After decades 
of European colonial rule,   peoples   around the world sought indepen  d  ence; they  Figure 8.2

pendence movements between 1750 and 1939 occurred mainly in the Americas. The second 
major wave of independence movements after 1940 occurred mainly in Africa and Asia. South Sudan became the most recently recognized independent state in July 2011, bringing the total number of member states in the United Nations to 193.

wanted to have their own country, and they wanted to have a voice in what hap-
pened in their country. Nkrumah knew the risk was great—danger came with the quick transition and from the inheritance of a political organization that made lit-tle sense for Ghana or the people who lived there. European colonialism  organized the world as a huge functional region controlled from Europe and d  e  signed to serve Europe’s economic and political interests. Colonialism also brought the European way of polit  i  cally o  r  ganizing space into states to the rest of the world. This system and its lack of ﬁ  t for most of the world   has   caused political strife, and yet, peoples still seek to become independent countries.  Tropic of CancerArctic Circle

252 Chapter 8   Political Geography 
organizing space (into states) that is less than 400 years 
old. Just as people create places, imparting ch  a  racter to 
space and shaping culture, people make states. States and state boundaries are made, shaped, and r  e  ﬁ ned by people, 
their actions and their history. Even the idea of dividing the world into territorially deﬁ  ned states is one created 
and e  x  ported by people.  
  Central to the  state are the concepts of   territory   and 
territoriality. As geographer Stuart   Elden   has pointed out, 
the modern concept of territory arose in early modern 
Europe as a system of political units came into being with ﬁ xed, distinct boundaries and at least a quasi-independent 
government.   Territoriality   is the process by which such 
units come into being. T erritoriality, however, can take 
place at different scales. In a book published in 1986, geographer Robert Sack deﬁ  ned   territoriality   as “the 
attempt by an individual or group to affect, inﬂ  uence, or 
control people, phenomena, and relationships, by delim-
iting and asserting control over a geographic area.” Sack sees human territoriality as a key ingredient in the con-struction of social and p  o  litical spaces. He calls for a bet-
ter understanding of the human organization of the planet through a consideration of how and why certain territorial strategies are pursued at different times and across pla  c  es.  
  T oday, territoriality is tied to the concept of sover-
eignty. As Sack explained, territorial behavior implies an 
expression of control over a territory. In international law, the concept of sovereignty is territorially d  e  ﬁ ned.   HOW   IS SPACE   POLITICALLY ORGANIZED 
INTO STATES AND NATIONS?  
  Political geography is the study of the political 
organization of the world. Political geographers study 
the spatial manifestations of political processes at various scales: how politically meaningful spaces came into b  e  ing 
and how these spaces inﬂ  uence outcomes. At the global 
scale, we have a world divided into individual cou  n  tries, 
which are commonly called states. A state is a politi-cally organized territory with a permanent popul  a  tion, 
a deﬁ  ned territory, and a government. T o be a state, an entity must be recognized as such by other states.  
  The present-day division of the world political map 
into states is a product of endless accommodations and 
adjustments within and between human societies. On the conventional political map, a mosaic of colors is used to represent more than 200 countries and territories, a visu-alization that accentuates the sep  a  ration of these countries 
by boundaries (Fig. 8.3). The political map of the world is the world map most of us learn ﬁ  rst. We look at it, memo-
rize it, and name the countries and perhaps each country’s capital. It hangs in the front of our classrooms, is used to organize maps in our textbooks, and becomes so natural looking to us that we begin to think it is natural.  
  The world map of states is anything but natural. The 
mosaic of states on the map represents a way of politically   Political activity is as basic to human culture as language or religion. All indi-
viduals, groups, communities, nations, governments, and supranational organizations 
engage in poli  t  ical activity. Each desires power and inﬂ  uence to achieve personal and public goals. Whether or not we like po  l  itics, each of us is caught up in these processes, with effects ranging from the composition of school boards to the conduct of war.  
  In this chapter, we examine how geographers study politics, the domain of polit-
ical geography. Like all ﬁ  elds of g  e  ography (and the social sciences, more generally), political geographers used to spend a lot of time explaining why the world is the way it is and trying to predict or prescribe the future. Today, political geographers spend much more time trying to understand the spatial a  s  sumptions and structures under-lying politics, the ways people organize space, the role territory plays in politics, and the problems that result from changing political and territorial circum  s  tances.  
  Key Questions     For   Chapter 8  
   1.   How is space politically   organized into states and nations?  
   2 .    How do states spatially organize their governments?  
   3.   How are boundaries established, and why do boundary disputes occur?  
   4.   How does the study of geopolitics help us understand the world?  
   5.   What are supranational organizations, and what is the future of the state?  c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 252  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 252  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Is Space Politically Organized Into States and Nations? 253
minor German states created a complicated patchwork of 
political entities, many with poorly deﬁ  ned borders. The 
emerging political state was accompanied by mercantilism, which led to the accumulation of wealth through plun-der, colonization, and the protection of home industries and foreign markets. Rivalry and competition intensi-ﬁ ed in Europe as well as abroad. Powerful royal families 
struggled for dominance in eastern and southern Europe. Instability was the rule, strife occurred fr  e  quently, and 
repressive governments prevailed.  
  The event in European history that marks the 
beginning of the modern state system is the Peace of 
Westphalia, negotiated in 1648 among the princes of 
the states making up the Holy Roman Empire, as well as a few neighboring states. The treaties that constituted this peace concluded Europe’s most destructive internal struggle over religion during the Thirty Y ears’ War. They contained new language recognizing the rights of ru  l  ers 
within deﬁ  ned, demarcated territories. The language of 
the treaties laid the foundations for a Europe made up of mutually recognized territorial states.  
  The rise of the   Westphalian   state system marked a 
fundamental change in the relationship between people 
and territory. In previous eras,   where   a society lived con-
stituted its territory; in the   Westphalian   system it became 
the   territory   that deﬁ  ned the   society  . T erritory is treated as 
a ﬁ  xed element of political ident  i  ﬁ cation, and states deﬁ  ne 
exclusive,   nonoverlapping   territories.  
  Even well after the Peace of Westphalia, absolutist 
rulers controlled most European states. During the later 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, however, the devel-opment of an increasingly wealthy middle class proved to be the undoing of absolutism in parts of   western   Europe. 
City-based merchants gained money, inﬂ  uence, and pres-
tige, while the power of the nobility declined. The tra-ditional measure of afﬂ  uence—land—became less impor-
tant. The merchants and bus  i  nessmen demanded political 
recognition. In the 1780s, a series of upheavals began that changed the sociopolitical face of the continent, most notably the French Rev  o  lution of 1789. The revolution, 
conducted in the name of the French people, ushered in an era in which the foundations for political authority came to be seen as resting with a state’s citizenry, not with a hereditary m  o  narch.  
  Nations  
  The popular media and press often use the words nation, 
state, and country interchangeably. Political geographers use state and country interchangeably (often preferring 
state), but the word nation is distinct. State is a l  e  gal term 
in international law, and the international political com-munity has some agreement about what this term means. Nation, on the other hand, is a culturally deﬁ  ned term, and Sovereignty means having a recognized right to control a territory both politically and militarily. The states of the world have the last say, legally, at least, over their respective territories. When the intern  a  tional community recognizes 
an entity as a state, it also recognizes the entity as being sov-
ereign within its borders. Under international law, states are sovereign, and they have the right to defend their territorial integrity against incu  r  sion from other states.  
  The Modern State Idea  
  In the 1600s, Europeans were not the only ones who 
behaved territorially, organized themselves into di  s  tinct 
political units, or claimed sovereignty. Because territorial-ity manifests itself in different ways, the idea of the state appeared in a variety of forms across world regions 400 or 500 years ago. The role territory played in d  e  ﬁ ning the 
state and the sovereign varied by region.  
  In North America, American Indian tribes behaved 
territorially but not necessarily exclusively. Plains tribes 
shared hunting grounds with neighboring tribes who were friendly, and they fought over hunting grounds with neighboring tribes who were unfriendly. T erri-torial boundaries were usually not delineated on the ground. Plains tribes also held territory communally so that individual tribal members did not “own” land. In a political sense, terr  i  toriality was most expressed by 
tribes within the Plains. Similarly, in Southeast Asia and 
in Africa, state-like political entities also existed. In all of these places, and in Europe before the mid-1600s, rulers held sway over a people, but there was no collec-tive agreement among rulers about how territory would be organized or what r  u  lers could do within their respec-
tive domains.  
  The European state idea deserves particular atten-
tion because it most inﬂ  uenced the development of 
the modern state system. We can see traces of   this   state 
idea more than two millennia ago near the southeastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea, where distinct kingdoms emerged within discrete territ  o  ries.   Greek philosophy on 
governance and aspects of Ancient Greece and Rome play 
parts in the modern state idea.   Political geogr  a  pher Rhys 
Jones studied state formation in the United Kingdom 
during the European Middle Ages. He found the ﬁ  rst 
states in Wales were small in size but had the attributes of the modern state. In the late   Middle   Ages, powerful rul-
ers constructed more sizable states in what are now the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. We cannot trace a clear evolution in the Eur  o  pean state idea, but we can see 
aspects of the modern state in many places and at many points in European history.  
  By the early seventeenth century, states including 
the Republic of Venice, Brandenburg, the Papal States 
of central Italy, the Kingdom of Hungary, and several c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 253  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 253  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

of the most widely read sch  o  lars on nationalism today, 
Benedict Anderson, deﬁ  nes the nation as an “imagined 
community”— it is ima  g  ined because one will never 
meet all of the people in the nation, and it is a com-
munity because one noneth  e  less sees oneself as part of 
that nation.  
  All nations are ultimately mixtures of different peo-
ples. The French are often considered to be the cla  s  sic 
example of a nation, but the most French-feeling person 
in France today is the product of a melding together of a wide variety of cultural groups over time, including Celts, Ancient Romans, Franks, Goths, and many more. If the majority of inhabitants of modern France belong to the French nation, it is because, during the formation few people agree on exactly what it means. Some argue that a nation is simply the people within a state’s bor-ders; in this case, all people who live in Ge  r  many. Y et this 
approach gives little sense of how politically charged the concept of nation really is.  
  In keeping with the way the term was originally 
used, we deﬁ  ne nation as a group of people who think 
of themselves as one based on a sense of shared culture 
and history, and who seek some degree of political-territorial autonomy. This idea encompasses different kinds of culturally deﬁ  ned nations. Nations variously see the  m  selves as sharing a religion, a language, an eth-
nicity, or a history. How a nation is deﬁ  ned depends on 
the people who see themselves as part of the nation. One Tropic of Cancer

 How Is Space Politically Organized Into States and Nations? 255
  Nation-State  
  The European idea that the map of   states   should look 
like the map of   nations   became the aspiration of govern-
ing elites around the world. A nation-state is a politi-
cally organized area in which nation and state o  c  cupy the 
same space. Since few (if any) states are nation-states, the importance of the concept of the nation-state lies primar-ily in the idea behind it. In the effort to form nation-states, some states have chosen to privilege one et  h  nic group at 
the expense of others, and other states have outlined a common history and culture. Either way, the state works to temper identities that might challenge the state’s territorial i  n  tegrity.  of the French territorial state, the people came to think of themselves as French—not b  e  cause the French nation 
existed as a primordial group that has always been di  s  tinct.  
  People in a nation tend to look to their past and 
think, “we have been through much together,” and when 
they look to their future they often think, “whatever hap-pens we will go through it together.” A nation is identi-ﬁ ed by its own membership; therefore, we cannot simply 
deﬁ ne a nation as the people within a territory. I  n  deed, 
rarely does a nation’s extent correspond precisely with a state’s borders. Many countries have mu  l  t  i  ple nations 
within their borders. For example, in the country of Bel-gium, two nations, the Flemish and the Wa  l  loons, exist 
within the state borders.  Tropic of CancerArctic Circle

256 Chapter 8   Political Geography 
This loyalty does not necessarily coincide with the borders 
of the state. A state, in contrast, seeks to promote a sense of nationhood that coincides with its own borders. In the name of nationalism, a state with more than one nation within its borders may attempt to build a single national identity out of the divergent people within its bo  r  ders. In the name of 
nationalism, a state may also promote co  n  ﬂ ict with another 
state that it sees as threatening to its territorial inte  g  rity.  
  Even though the roots of nationalism lie in ear-
lier centuries, the nineteenth century was the true age 
of nationalism in Europe. In some cases the pursuit of nationalist ambitions produced greater cohesion within long-established states, such as in France or Spain; in other cases nationalism became a rallying cry for bring-ing together people with some shared historical or cul-tural el  e  ments into a single state, such as in the cases of 
Italy or Germany. Similarly, people who saw themselves as separate nations within other states or empires launched successful separatist mov  e  ments. Ireland, Norway, and 
Poland all serve as examples of this phenomenon.  
  European state leaders used the tool of nationalism 
to strengthen the state. The modern map of Europe is still 
fragmented, but much less so than in the 1600s (Fig. 8.4). In the process of creating nation-states in Europe, states absorbed smaller entities into their borders, resolved   The goal of creating nation-states dates to the 
French Revolution, which sought to replace control by a 
monarchy or colonizer with an imagined cultural-historical community of French people. The Revolution initially promoted democracy, the idea that the people are the 
ultimate sovereign—that is, the people, the   n  a  tion  , have 
the ultimate say over what happens within the state. Each 
nation, it was argued, should have its own sove  r  eign terr  i-
  tory, and only when that was achieved would true democ-
racy and stability exist.  
  People began to see the idea of the nation-state as 
the ultimate form of political-territorial organization, 
the right expression of sovereignty, and the best route to stability. The key problem associated with the idea of the nation-state is that it assumes the presence of reasonably well-deﬁ  ned, stable nations living co  n  tiguously within 
discrete territories. Very few places in the world come close to satisfying this requirement. Nonetheless, in the Europe of the eigh  t  eenth and nineteenth centuries, many 
believed the assumption could be met.  
  The quest to form nation-states in the Europe of the 
1800s was associated with a rise in nationalism. We can view 
nationalism from two vantage points: that of the people and that of the state. When people have a strong sense of nation-alism, they have a loyalty to and a belief in the nation itself.

tions. Such complications might include states contai  n  ing 
more than one nation, nations residing in more than one 
state, and even n  a  tions without a state at all.  
  Nearly every state in the world is a multinational 
state, a state with more than one nation inside its borders. 
The people living in the former state of Yugoslavia never achieved a strong sense of Yugoslav nationhood. Mil-lions of people who were citizens of Yugoslavia never had a Yugoslav nationality. They long identiﬁ  ed themselves as  Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, or members of other nations or 
ethnic groups. Yugoslavia was a state that was always com-prised of more than one nation, and it eventually co  l  lapsed.  
  When a nation stretches across borders and across 
states, the nation is called a   multistate   nation. Polit  i  cal 
geographer George White studied the states of Roma-
nia and Hungary and their overlapping nations (Fig. 8.5). As he has noted, the territory of T ransylv  a  nia is cur-
rently in the middle of the state of Romania, but it has not always been that way. For two centuries, Hungary’s borders stretched far enough   east   to encompass T ra  n  syl-
vania. The T ransylvanian region today is populated by 
Romanians and by Hungarians, and places within T ran-sylvania are seen as pivotal to the histories of both Hun-gary and R  o  mania. In keeping with the nation-state ideal, 
it is not surprising that both Romania and Hungary have conﬂ icts by force as well as by negotiation, and d  e  ﬁ ned 
their borders more precisely.  
  T o help people within the borders relate to the domi-
nant national ideal, states provide security, infrastructure, 
and goods and services for their citizens. States support education, health care, and a mil  i  tary to preserve the state 
and to create a connection between the people and the 
state—to build a nation-state. Eur  o  pean states even used 
the colonization of Africa and Asia in the late 1800s and 
early 1900s as a way to pr  o  mote nationalism. People could 
take pride in their nation’s vast colonial empire. People 
could identify the  m  selves with their nation, be it French, 
Dutch, or British, by contrasting themselves with the peo-
ple in the colonies whom they deﬁ  ned as mystical or savage. By deﬁ  ning themselves in relation to an “Other,” the state and the people helped identify the supposed “traits” of their nation; in so doing, they began to build a n  a  tion-state.  
  Multistate   Nations, Multinational States, 
and Stateless Nations  
  People with a sense of belonging to a particular nation 
rarely all reside within a si  n  gle state’s borders. The lack of 
ﬁ t between nation and state therefore creates complica-  Guest Field Note  
  Cluj-Napoca  , Romania  
  To Hungarians, Transylvania is sig-niﬁ cant because it was an impor-
tant part of the Hungarian Kingdom for a thousand years. Many of their great leaders were born and bur-ied there, and many of their great churches, colleges, and architec-tural achievements are located there too. For example, in the city of   Cluj-Napoca   (  Kolozsvár   in Hun-garian) is St. Michael’s Cathedral, and next to it is the statue of King Matthias, one of Hu  n  gary’s greatest kings. Romanians have long lived in the territory too, tracing their roots back to the Roman Empire. To Romanian nationa  l  ists, the existence of Roman ruins in Tran-sylvania is proof of their Roman ancestry and their right to govern Transylvania because their ancestors lived in Transylvania before those of the Hungarians. When a  r  chaeologists found Roman ruins around St. Michael’s Cathedral and King Matthias’s statue, they i  m  mediately began excavating them, which in turn aggravated the ethnic Hungarians. Traveling in Tra  n  sylvania made me very aware of how important places are to peoples and how contested they can be.

established a Kurdish Security Zone north of the 36th 
parallel in Iraq, and that area continues to have signiﬁ  -
cant autonomy in present-day Iraq. The no-ﬂ  y zone in the 
Kurdish region of northern Iraq has created a relatively peaceful place compared to continued violence in south-ern Iraq. Violent acts still mar the Kurdish north, but prosperity has also come to the region through petrodol-lars. An October 2008 travel article in the   New York Times   
described new theme parks and gated communities that 
reﬂ ect the afﬂ  uence in the city of   Erbil  , which is the Kurd-
ish capital city in Iraq. The article also described   Erbil’s   
6000-year-old citadel as a reminder that the city is “one of the oldest continuously inh  a  bited cities in the world.”  
  An independent Kurdish state seems unlikely, at 
least in the near future. In addition to northern Iraq, the 
Kurds form the largest minority in T urkey where the city of   Diyarbakir   is the unofﬁ  cial Kurdish capital of T u  r  key. 
Relations between the 10 million Kurds in T urkey and the T urkish government in Ankara have been vol  a  tile, and 
T urkey regards the Kurdish region as part of the state’s core territory.  Without the consent of T urkey, establish-ing a truly independent Kurdish state will be di  f  ﬁ cult.  
  European Colonialism and the Diffusion 
of the Nation-State Model  
  Europe exported its concepts of state, sovereignty, and 
the desire for nation-states to much of the rest of the world through two waves of colonialism (Fig. 8.7). In the interests in T ransylv  a  nia, and some Hu  n  garians continue 
to look upon the region as territory that has been illegiti-mately lost. White explains how i  m  portant territory is 
to a nation: “The control and maintenance of territory is as crucial as the control and maint  e  nance of a national 
language, religion, or a particular way of life. Indeed, a la  n  guage, religion or way of life is difﬁ  cult to maintain 
without control over territory.” In the case of Romania and Hungary, as in other similar situations, te  r  ritory is as 
important as  “language, religion, or way of life.” When 
multiple nations or states claim a  t  tachments to the same 
piece of territory, the potential for conﬂ  ict is signiﬁ  cant.  
  Another complication that arises from the lack of ﬁ  t 
between nations and states is that some nations do not have 
a state; they are stateless nations. The Palestinians are an example of a stateless nation. The Palestinian Arabs have gained control over the Gaza Strip and fragments of the Occupied T erritories of the West Bank and Golan Heights. These territories may form the foundations of a future state. The United Nations Agency for Palestinian Refugees records 4.9 million registered  Palestinian refugees. Well over half of the registered  Palestinian refugees conti  n  ue 
to live in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and other Arab states. 
Nearly 2 million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip and West Bank; however, the international community does not universally recognize the Pale  s  tinian lands as a state.  
  A much larger stateless nation is the Kurds whose 
population of between 25 and 30 million live in an area 
called Kurdistan that covers parts of six states (Fig. 8.6). In the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, the United Nations

the ﬂ  ows of raw materials for their own beneﬁ  t, and we 
can still see the tangible evidence of that organization (plantations, ports, mines, and railroads) on the cultural landscape.  
  Despite the end of colonialism, the political organi-
zation of space and the global world economy persist. And 
while the former colonies are now independent states, their economies are anything but indepen  d  ent. In many 
cases raw material ﬂ  ows are as great as they were before 
the colonial era came to an end. For example, today in Gabon, Africa, the railroad goes from the interior forest, which is logged for plywood, to the major port and capi-tal city, Libreville. The second largest city, Port   Gentil  , 
is located to the south of Libreville, but the two cities are not connected directly by road or railroad. As the crow ﬂ ies, the cities are 90 miles apart, but if you drive from one 
to the other, the circuitous route will take you 435 miles. Both cities are export focused. Port   Gentil   is tied to the 
global oil economy, with global oil corporations respon-sible for building much of the city and its housing, and employing many of its people.  
  Construction of the Capitalist World Economy  
  The long-term impacts of colonialism are many and var-
ied. One of the most powerful impacts of colonialism was the construction of a global order characterized by great differences in economic and political power. The European colonial enterprise gave birth to a   globalized   
economic order in which the European states and areas dominated by European migrants emerged as the major centers of economic and political activity. Through sixteenth century, Spain and Portugal took advantage of an increasingly well-consolidated internal political order and newfound wealth to expand their inﬂ    u  ence to increas-
ingly far-ﬂ  ung realms during the ﬁ  rst wave of colonial-ism. Later joined by Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, the ﬁ  rst wave of colonialism established a far-
reaching political and economic system. A  f  ter indepen-
dence movements in the Americas during the late 1700s and 1800s, a second wave of c  o  lonialism began in the late 
1800s. The major colonizers were Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Italy. The coloniz-ing parties met for the Berlin Conference in 1884–1885 and arb  i  trarily laid out the colonial map of Africa with-
out reference to indigenous cultural or political arrange-ments. Driven by motives ranging from economic proﬁ  t 
to the desire to bring Christianity to the rest of the world, colonialism projected European power and a European approach to organizing poli  t  ical space into the non-Euro-
pean world (Fig. 8.8).  
  With Europe in control of so much of the world, 
Europeans laid the ground rules for the emerging inter-
national state system, and the modern European concept of the nation-state became the model adopted around the world. Europe also established and deﬁ  ned the ground 
rules of the capitalist world economy, creating a sy  s  tem of 
economic interdependence that persists today.  
  During the heyday of colonialism, the imperial pow-
ers exercised ruthless control over their domains and 
organized them for maximum economic exploitation. The capacity to install the infrastructure necessary for such efﬁ cient proﬁ  teering is itself evidence of the power rela-
tionships involved: entire populations were regimented in the service of the colonial ruler. Colonizers organized    Figure 8.7

other parts of East and Southeast Asia as well as Paciﬁ  c 
Islands by colonial means. But the concentr  a  tion of 
wealth that colonia  l  ism brought to Europe, and to parts 
of the world dominated by European settlers, i  n  cluding 
the United States, Canada, and Australia, is at the heart 
of the highly uneven global distribution of power that continues even t  o  day.  
  The forces of colonialism played a key role in knit-
ting together the economies of widely separated a  r  eas, 
which gave birth to a global economic order called the 
world economy. Wealth is unevenly distributed in the world economy, as can be seen in statistics on per cap-ita gross national income (GNI): Bangladesh’s GNI is only $1,340, whereas Norway’s is $53,690. But to truly colonialism, Europeans extracted wealth from colonies and put colonized peoples in a p  o  sition of subservience.  
  Of course, not all Europeans proﬁ  ted equally from 
colonialism. Enormous poverty persisted within the most 
powerful European states, and sustaining control over colonies could be costly. In the late seventeenth century, Spain had a large colonial empire, but the empire was economically draining Spain by then. Moreover, west-ern Europeans were not the only people to proﬁ  t from 
colonialism. During the period of European colonia  l  ism 
(1500–1950), Russia and the United States expanded over 
land instead of over seas, proﬁ  ting from the taking of ter-r  i  tory and the subjugation of indigenous peoples. Japan 
was a regional colonial power, controlling Korea and    Figure 8.8

how each dot ﬁ  ts into the pi  c  ture as a whole.1   In   the last 
few decades, social scientists have sought to understand 
how each dot, how each country and each locality, ﬁ  t into 
the picture of the world as a whole. T o study a single dot or even each dot one at a time, we miss the whole. Even if we study every single dot and add them together, we still miss the whole. We need to step back and see the whole, as well as the individual dots, studying how one affects the other. By now, this should sound familiar: it is one of the ways geographers think about scale.  understand why wealth is distributed unevenly, we can-not simply study each country, its resources, and its pro-duction of goods. Rather, we need to understand where countries ﬁ  t in the world economy. That is, we need to see the big picture.  
  Think of a pointillist painting. Speciﬁ  cally, envi-
sion the magniﬁ  cent work of nineteenth-century French 
painter Georges Pierre   Seurat  , Sunday Afternoon on the 
Island of La Grande   Jatte   (Fig. 8.9). The painting hangs in 
the Art Institute of Chicago. If you have the opportunity to 
see the painting and if you stand close enough, you will see   Seurat’s   post-Impressionist method of painting millions 
of points or dots—single, tiny brush strokes, each a single color. When you step back again, you can gain a sense of ATLANTIC

producers gain proﬁ  t by   commodifying   whatever they 
can.   Commodiﬁ  cation   is the process of pla  c  ing a price 
on a good, ser  v  ice, or idea and then buying, selling, and 
trading that item. Companies create new products, gen-
erate new twists on old products, and create demand for the products through marketing. As chil  d  ren, none of the 
authors of this book could have imagined buying a bottle of water. Now, the sale of water in bottles is commo  n  place.  
  Second, despite the existence of approximately 200 
states, everything takes place within the context of the 
world economy (and has since 1900). Colonialism played a major role in establishing this system by exporting the European state idea and facilita  t  ing the construction of an 
interdependent global economy. When col  o  nies became 
independent, gaining the legal status of sovereign states was relatively easy for most colonies. The United Nations Charter even set up a committee to help colonies do so after World War II. But gaining true econo  m  ic indepen-
dence is all but impossible. The economies of the world are tied together, generating intended and unintended consequences that fundame  n  tally change places.  
  Lastly, world-systems theorists see the world econ-
omy as a three-tiered structure: the core, periphery, and 
  semiperiphery  . The core and the periphery are not just 
places but the sites where particular pro  c  esses take place. 
The core is where one is most likely to ﬁ  nd higher levels 
of education, higher salaries, and more techno  l  ogy—core 
processes that generate more wealth in the world econ-omy. The periphery more commonly has lower levels of education, lower salaries, and less technology—peripheral processes associated with a more marginal position in the world eco  n  omy.    Political geographers took note of one sociologist’s 
theory of the world economy and added much to it. Build-
ing on the work of Immanuel   Wallerstein  , proponents of 
  world-systems theory   view the world as much more than 
the sum total of the world’s states. Much like a pointillist 
painting, world-systems theorists hold that to understand any state, we must also understand its spatial and func-tional relationships within the world eco  n  omy.  
  Wallerstein’s   publications number in the hundreds, 
and the political and economic geography publications tied to world-systems theory number in the thousands. T o simplify the research, we can study the three basic tenets of world-systems theory, as   Wallerstein   deﬁ nes them:  
  1.   The world economy has one market and a global 
division of labor.  
  2.   Although the world has multiple states, almost every-
thing takes place within the context of the world economy.  
  3.   The world economy has a three-tier structure.  
  According to   Wallerstein  , the development of a 
world economy began with capitalist exchange around 
1450 and encompassed the globe by 1900. Capitalism 
means that in the world economy, individuals, corpora-tions, and states produce goods and services that are exchanged for proﬁ  t. T o generate a proﬁ  t, produ  c  ers seek 
the cheapest production and costs. Since labor (including salaries and beneﬁ  ts) is now often the most e  x  pensive of 
these production costs, corporations often seek to move production of a good from, for example, North Carolina to Mexico and then to China, simply to take advantage of cheaper labor. In addition to the world labor supply,    Figure 8.9

fee, fruit, and cotton production. During the second wave 
of colonialism, which happened after the Indu  s  trial Revo-
lution, colonizers set their sights on cheap industrial labor, 
cheap raw materials, and large-scale agricu  l  tural plantations.  
  Not all core countries in the world today were colo-
nial powers, however. Countries including Switzerland, 
Singapore, and Australia have signiﬁ  cant global clout 
even though they were never classic colonial po  w  ers, and 
that clout is tied in signiﬁ  cant part to their positions in the global economy. The countries gained positions through access to the networks of production, consumption, and exchange in the wea  l  thiest parts of the world and through 
their ability to take advantage of that access.  
  World-Systems and Political Power  
  Are economic power and political power one and the 
same? No, but certainly economic power can bring polit  i-
  cal power. In the current system, economic power means 
wealth, and political power means the ability to inﬂ    u  ence 
others to achieve your goals. Political power is not simply a function of sovereignty. Each state is theoret  i  cally sover-
eign, but not all states have the same ability to inﬂ  uence 
others or achieve their political goals. Ha  v  ing wealth helps 
leaders amass political power. For instance, a wealthy   Figure 8.10 presents one way of dividing up the 
world in world-systems terms. The map desi  g  nates some 
states as part of the   semiperiphery  —places where core 
and periphery processes are both occu  r  ring—places that 
are exploited by the core but in turn exploit the periphery. 
The   semiperiphery   acts as a buffer between the core and 
periphery, preventing the polarization of the world into two e  x  tremes.  
  Political geographers, economic geographers, and 
other academics continue to debate world-systems theory. 
The major concerns are that it overemphasizes economic factors in political development, that it is very state-centric, and that it does not fully account for how places move from one category to another. Nonetheless,   Wallerstein’s   
work has encouraged many to see the world political map as a system of interlinking parts that need to be under-stood in relation to one another and as a whole. As such, the impact of world-systems theory has been considerable in political geography, and it is increasingly commonplace for geographers to refer to the kinds of core–periphery distin  c  tions suggested by world-systems theory.  
  World-systems theory helps explain how colonial 
powers were able to amass great concentrations of wealth. 
During the ﬁ  rst wave of colonialism, colonizers extracted goods from the Americas and the Caribbean and exploited Africa for slave labor, amassing wealth through sugar, cof-PACIFIC

264 Chapter 8   Political Geography 
  HOW DO STATES SPATIALLY ORGANIZE 
THEIR GOVERNMENTS?  
  In the  1950s, a famous political geographer, R  i  chard 
Hartshorne, described the forces within the state that 
unify the people as centripetal and the forces that divide them as centrifugal. Whether a state continues to exist, according to Hartshorne, depends on the balance between centripetal and centrifugal forces. Many political geo  g  ra-
phers have debated Hartshorne’s theory, and most have concluded that we cannot select a given event or  process 
and simply deﬁ  ne it as centrifugal or centripetal. An event 
such as a war can pull the state together for a short time and then divide the state over the long term. Timing, scale, interaction, and pe  r  spe  c  tive factor into uniﬁ  cation 
and division in a state at any given point. Instead of creat-ing a balance sheet of centripetal and ce  n  trifugal forces, 
governments attempt to unify states through nation-building, through structuring the go  v  ernment in a way 
that melds the nations within, by deﬁ  ning and defending 
boundaries, and through expres  s  ing control over all of the 
territory within those boundaries.  
  By looking at how different governments have 
attempted to unify the peoples and territories within their 
domains, we are reminded how important geography is. Governance does not take place in a vacuum. The unique characteristics of places shapes whether any possible gov-ernmental “solution” solves or exacerbates ma  t  ters.  
  Form of Government  
  The internal political geographic organization of states 
can have an impact on state unity. Most states in the world are either unit  a  ry or federal states.  
  Until the end of World War II, many European 
states, including multinational states, were highly central-
ized, with the capital city serving as the focus of power. States made no clear e  f  forts to accommodate minor  i  ties 
(such as Bretons in France or Basques in Spain) or outly-ing regions where identiﬁ  cation with the state was weaker. 
Political geographers call these highly centralized states   unitary   governments. The administrative framework of 
a unitary government is designed to ensure the central 
government’s authority over all parts of the state. The French government divided the state into more than 90   départements  , whose representatives came to Paris not just 
to express regional concerns but to implement central-
government decisions back home.  
  One way of governing a   multinational   state is to 
construct a federal system, organizing state territory into 
regions,   substates   (which we refer to as States), provinces, 
or cantons. In a strong federal system, the regions have 
much control over government policies and funds, and country can establish a mighty military. But political inﬂ  u-
ence is not simply a function of hard power; it is also dip-lomatic. Switzerland’s declared neutral  i  ty, combined with 
its economic might, aids the country’s diplomatic efforts.  
  World-systems theory helps us understand how 
Europe politically reorganized the world during colon  i  al-
ism. When colonialism ended in Africa and Asia, the newly 
independent people continued to follow the European model of political organization. The arbitrarily drawn colonial borders of Africa, dating from the Berlin Con-ference, b  e  came the boundaries of the newly independent 
states. On the map, former colonies became new states; administrative borders transformed into international boundaries; and, in most cases, colonial administrative towns b  e  came capitals. The greatest political challenge 
fa  c  ing the states of Africa since independence has been 
building nation-states out of incredibly divergent (some-times antagonistic) peoples. The leaders of the newly indepen  d  ent states continually work to build nation-states 
in the hope of quelling division among the people, secur-ing their territory, and developing their economic (as well as other) sy  s  tems of organization.  
  The Enduring Impact of the Nation-State Idea  
  The idea of meshing the nation and state into a n  a  tion-
state was not conﬁ  ned to nineteenth-century Europe or 
twentieth-century Africa. Major players in international relations still seek solutions to complex political co  n-
  ﬂ icts by trying to redraw the political map in an effort 
to bring political and national borders into closer corre-
spondence. Faced with the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia or the complex problems of Israel/Palestine, for example, the tendency is often to propose new state boundaries around nations, with the goal of making the nation and state ﬁ  t. Drawing neat boundaries of this sort is usually impossible and the creation of new territories can create different ethno-national problems. Regard-less of the multitude of problems and lack of simple  sol  u  tions to nation and state conﬂ  icts, the European 
 territorial state idea became the world model, and that 
idea is still shaping the political organiz  a  tion of space 
around the world.  
  Imagine you are the leader of a newly independent state 
in Africa or Asia. Determine what your government can do to build a nation that corresponds with the borders of your state. Consider the roles of education, government, military, and culture in your exercise in n  a  tion-building.  c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 264  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 264  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Do States Spatially Organize Their Governments? 265
of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia fell 
apart, despite their federalist systems, and the future of Belgium as a single state is uncertain.  
  Devolution  
  Devolution is the movement of power from the central 
government to regional governments within the state. Sometimes devolution is achieved by reworking a con-stitution to establish a federal system that recogni  z  es the 
permanency of the regional governments, as Spain has 
done. In other places, governments devolve power wit  h-
  out altering constitutions, almost as an experiment. In the 
United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Assembly, a par-liamentary body, resulted from devolution, but the Brit-ish government suspended its activities in 2002 and then reinstated the assembly in 2007. Devolutionary forces can emerge in all kinds of states, old and young, large and small. These forces arise from several sources of internal division:   ethnocultural  , ec  o  nomic, and territorial.  
  Ethnocultural   Devolutionary Movements  
  Many of Europe’s devolutionary movements came from 
nations within a state that deﬁ  ne themselves as being eth-nically, linguist  i  cally, or religiously distinct.  
  The capacity of   ethnocultural   forces to stimulate 
devolutionary processes has been evident, for example, in 
eastern Europe. Parts of the eastern European map have changed quite drastically over the past two de  c  ades, and 
two countries, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, succumbed to devolutionary pressures. In the case of Cz  e  choslovakia, 
the process was peaceful: Czechs and Slovaks divided 
their country, creating a new international border. As Figure 8.13 shows, however, one of the two new states, in a weak federal system, the central government retains a signiﬁ  cant measure of power. Most federal systems are somewhere in between, with gover  n  ments at the state 
scale and at the   substate   scale each having control over 
certain revenues and ce  r  tain policy areas. Gi  v  ing control 
over certain policies (e  s  pecially culturally relative policies) 
to smaller-scale governments is one strategy for keeping the state as a whole together.  
  Federalism functions differently depending on the 
context. In Nigeria, the 36 constituent States choose their 
own judicial system. In the Muslim north, twelve States have   Shari’a   laws (legal systems based on traditional Islamic 
laws), and in the Christian and animist south, the States do 
not (Fig. 8.11).   Shari’a   law in the northern states of Nigeria 
is only applied to Muslims, not to Christians and Animists. 
The move to   Shari’a   law in the north came at the same time 
as democracy swept Nigeria in 2000. Nigerians in the north 
hoped stri  c  ter laws would help root out corruption among 
politicians, although it has failed to do so.  
  In the United States, States take different approaches 
to matters such as the death penalty, access to alcohol 
(Fig. 8.12), and the right to carry concealed weapons but many of the fundamentals of the legal system do not differ among States.  
  Federalism accommodates regional interests by vest-
ing primary power in provinces, States, or other regional 
units over all matters except those explicitly given to the central government. The Australian geographer K. W. Robinson described a federation as “the most geographi-cally expressive of all political systems, based as it is on the existence and accommodation of regional differences . . . federation does not create unity out of d  i  versity; rather, it 
enables the two to coexist.”  
  Choosing a federal system does not always quell 
nationalist sentiment. After all, the multinational states 5° 10° 15°

succes  s  fully, integrated 56 ethnic nations into the state 
of China. China has acknowledged the precarious place 
of the minor  i  ty nations within the larger Han-domi-
nated state by extending rights to minorities, including 
the right to have two children under the government’s One Child Policy. Whether the nations within China will cha  l  lenge the state remains to be seen. In China’s 
far west, Tibetan and   U  y  ghur   separ  a  tist movements 
have become more visible, but the Chinese government’s 
ﬁ rm hold and control of the media and Internet makes it 
difﬁ cult, if not i  m  possible, for separatist groups to hold 
Egyptian-style protests in China.  
  Devolution, however, does not   necessarily   fuel greater 
calls for independence. Nations within states can, instead, 
call for autonomy within the borders of the state. In the United Kingdom, Scotland voted in 1997 to establish its own parliament, which had last met in 1707. The 129 members of the Scottish Parliament swear all  e  giance to 
the Queen of England. The Scottish Parliament has the right to introduce primary legislation over several issues, including education, health, housing, and police. Unlike the parliament in Wales that was esta  b  lished in 1997 and Slovakia, is not homogeneous. About 11 percent of Slovakians are Hungarian, and that minority is concen-trated along the border between Slovakia and Hungary. The Hungarian minority, concerned about linguistic and cultural discrimination, has at times demanded greater autonomy or self-governance to protect its heri  t  age in the 
new state of Slovakia.  
  Compared to the constituent units of the former 
Yugoslavia (discussed in detail in Chapter 7), other coun-
tries shown in Figure 8.14 have dealt with devolutionary pressures more peacefully. Among these are Lithuania and Ukraine. Elsewhere in the world, ho  w  ever, ethno-
cultural fragmentation has produced costly wars. For example, ethno-cultural differences were at the heart of the civil war that wracked Sri Lanka (South Asia) between the 1980s and 2009, with the Sinhalese (Buddhist) major-ity ultimately suppressing the drive by the T amil (Hindu) minority for an independent state.  
  Devolutionary forces based on ethno-cultural 
claims are gaining momentum in places that have long 
looked stable from the outside. The communist govern-ment of China has pragmatically, and arguably relatively   Guest Field Note

  In most states in the U.S., a “dry county” might cause one to think of a place where there is very li  t  tle rain. But in the southern part of the U.S., there are many dry counties—that is, counties with laws forbidding the sale of packaged alcohol. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, keep-ing counties dry was much easier than it is t  o  day. A hundred years ago, it took up to a day to travel to the next town or city on very poor roads. Today, with cars traveling 70 MPH on an interstate, the same trip takes a matter of minutes. Why would counties continue to ban a  l  cohol sales today? Many of the rea-sons are cultural. Of the Arkansas resi-dents who attend church, most are Bap-tists (see Figure 7.28) or other Protestant denominations. Many of these churches prohibit consumption of alcoholic beverages. The Arkansas legislature supports dry counties by requiring counties that want to sell packaged li  q  uor to get 38 percent of the voters in the last election t o 
sign a petition. It only takes 10 percent of that voter pool to get any other issue on the ballot. Today, however, many dry counties in A  r  kansas are known as “damp.” Damp counties are those where restaurants, country clubs and social organiza-tions can apply and receive a l  i  cense to serve alcohol by the drink. This arrangement seems counterintuitive to the idea of a dry county. But business and economic development authorities want damp counties to e  n  courage investment and growth in the local economy.

by the government in Rome high on the list of griev-
ances. Italy also faces serious devolutionary forces on its mainland peninsula. One is rooted in regional dis-parities between north and south. The   Mezzogiorno   
region lies to the south, below the   Ancona   Line (an 
imaginary border extending from Rome to the Adriatic 
coast at   Ancona  ). The wealthier north stands in sharp 
contrast to the poorer south. Despite the large subsi-
dies granted to the   Me  z  zo  g  iorno  , the development gap 
between the north, very much a part of the European 
core, and the south, part of the European periphery, has been widening. Some Italian politicians have exploited widespread impatience with the situation by forming organizations to promote northern interests, including devolution. One of these organiz  a  tions, the Northern 
League, has raised the prospect of an independent state 
called   Padania   in the northern part of Italy centered on 
the Po River. After a surge of enthusiasm, the   Padania   
campaign faltered, but it pushed the Italian government 
to focus more attention on regional inequalities within the country.  
  Brazil provides another example of the interconnec-
tions between devolutionary movements and economics. 
As in northern Italy, a separatist movement emerged in the 1990s in a better-off region in the south that includes the three southernmost States of Rio Grande do   Sul  , the assembly in Northern Ireland that was established in 1998, the parliament of Scotland has the right to levy a tax of up to 3 pence per British pound.  
  Devolutionary pressures can create demands for 
new states, such as the Czech Republic and Slovakia, or 
for greater autonomy within a state, like Scotland in the United Kingdom.  
  Economic Devolutionary Forces  
  Devolutionary pressures often arise from a combination 
of sources. In Catalonia,   ethnocultural   differences play a 
signiﬁ  cant role, but Catalonians also cite economics; with 
about 6 percent of Spain’s territory and just 15 percent of its population, Catalonia produces some 25 percent of all Spanish exports by value and 40 percent of its industrial exports (Fig. 8.15). Pro-independence groups in Cata-lonia held a referendum in April 2011 seeking a vote for independence. The vote failed, but devolutionary forces continue to argue that Cat  a  lonia’s economy pays more 
into the Spanish government than it receives from the state of Spain.  
  Economic forces play an even more prominent 
role in Italy and France. In Italy, demands for auton-
omy for Sardinia are deeply rooted in the island’s eco-nomic circumstances, with accusations of neglect Black Sea Sea of

  Territorial Inﬂ  uences on Devolution  
  We have seen how political decisions and cultural and 
economic forces can generate devolutionary processes in states. Devolutionary events have at least one fea-ture in common: they most often occur on the ma  r  gins 
of states. Note that every one of the devolution-affected areas shown in Figure 8.14 lies on a coast or on a border. Distance, remoteness, and marginal location frequently Santa   Catarina  , and   Parana  . Southerners complained 
that the government was misspending their tax money on assistance to   Amazonia   in northern Br  a  zil. The southern-
ers found a leader, manufactured a ﬂ  ag, and demanded 
independence for their Republic of the Pampas. The Bra-zilian government responded by outlawing the separat-ists’ political party, but the economic differences b  e  tween 
north and south continue, and devolution pressures will certainly arise again.  BASQUE

 How Do States Spatially Organize Their Governments? 269
In that year, a vocal minority of native   Hawai’ians   and 
their sympathizers demanded the return of rights lost 
during the “occupation.” These demands included the right to reestablish an independent state called   H  a  wai’i   
(before its annexation   Hawai’i   was a Polynesian king-
dom) on several of the smaller islands. Their hope is 
that ultimately the island of Kauai, or at least a signiﬁ  cant 
part of that island, which is considered ancestral land, will become a component of the independent   Hawai’ian   state.  
  At present, the native   Hawai’ian   separatists do not 
have the numbers, resources, or inﬂ  uence to achieve their 
aims. The potential for some form of separation between   Hawai’i   and the mainland United States does exist, how-
ever. The political geographer Saul Cohen theorized in 1991 that political entities situated in border zones between geopolitical powers may become gateway states, a  b  sorbing and assimilating diverse cultures and traditions 
and emerging as new entities, no longer dominated by one or the other.   H  a  wai’i  , he suggests, is a candidate for 
this status.  
  T erritorial characteristics can play a signiﬁ  cant role 
in starting and sustaining devolutionary processes. Dis-
tance can be compounded by differences in physical geog-raphy—a feeling of remoteness can be fueled by being iso-lated in a valley or separated by mountains or a river. Basic physical-geographic and   locational   fa  c  tors can thus be key 
ingredients in the devolutionary process.  
  Electoral Geography  
  The partitioning of state territory into electoral districts 
represents another key component of a state’s internal political geography. Ele  c  toral geographers examine how 
the spatial conﬁ  guration of electoral districts and the vot-ing patterns that emerge in particular elections reﬂ  ect and 
inﬂ uence social and political affairs. Various countries use 
different voting systems to elect their governments. For example, in the 1994 South African ele  c  tion, government 
leaders introduced a system of majority rule while award-ing some power to each of nine newly formed regions. The overall effect was to protect, to an extent, the rights of minor  i  ties in those regions.  
  In the 1994 election in South Africa, the leading 
political party, the African National Congress, designated 
at least 35 percent of its slate of candidates to women, helping South Africa become one of the world leaders in the percent of women who hold seats in parliament or legisl  a  ture (see Fig. 5.17).  
  The geographic study of voting behavior is espe-
cially interesting because it helps us assess whether peo-
ple’s voting tendencies are inﬂ  uenced by their geographic situation. Maps of voting patterns often produce surprises that can be explained by other maps, and Geographic Information Systems have raised this kind of analysis to strengthen devolutionary tendencies. The regions most likely to seek dev  o  lution are those far from the national 
capital. Many are separated by water, desert, or mountains from the ce  n  ter of power and adjoin neighbors that may 
support separatist objectives.  
  Note also that many islands are subject to devolutionary 
processes: Corsica (France), Sardinia (Italy), T aiwan (China), 
Singapore (Malaysia), Zanzibar (T anzania),   Jolo   (Philip-
pines), Puerto Rico (United States),   Mayotte   (Comoros), and 
East Timor (Indonesia) are notable examples. As this list indi-
cates, some of these islands became independent states, while others were divided during devolution. Insularity clearly has advantages for separatist movements.  
  Not surprisingly, the United States faces its most 
serious devolutionary pressures on the islands of   Hawai’i   
(Fig. 8.16). The year 1993 marked the hundred-year 
anniversary of the United States’ annexation of   Hawai’i  , 
   Figure 8.15  
  Barcelona, Spain.     Barcelona’s long-standing economic and 
political signiﬁ  cance is indelibly imprinted in the urban land-
scape. Once the heart of a far-ﬂ  ung Mediterranean empire, Barcelona went on to become a center of commerce and banking as the Iberian Peninsula industrialized. In the process, the city became a center of architectural innovation that is not just evi-dent in the major public buil  d  ings. The major streets are lined 
with impressive buildings—many with intricate stone façades.

270 Chapter 8   Political Geography 
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan lost representatives 
and the Sun Belt States of Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida along with the southwestern States of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah gained re  p  resentatives.  
  In the United States, once reapportionment is 
complete, individual States go through the process of 
redistricting, each following its own system. The crite-ria involved in redistricting are numerous, but the most important is equal representation, achieved by ensuring that districts have approximately the same populations. In addition, the Supreme Court prefers compact and con-tiguous districts that keep political units (such as counties) intact. F  i  nally, the courts have repeatedly called for repre-
sentational equality of racial and linguistic mino  r  ities.  
  Even after the civil rights movement of the 1950s 
and 1960s in the United States, minorities were refused 
voting rights in a mu  l  titude of districts and States around 
the country. County registrars would close their doors when African Americans came to register to vote, and intimidation kept many away from voting at the polls. Even in places where minorities were allowed to register and vote, the parties drawing the voting districts or choos-ing the electoral system would make it nearly impossible new levels. Political geographers study church afﬁ  liation, 
income level, ethnic background, educ  a  tion attainment, 
and numerous other social and economic factors to gain an understanding of why voters in a ce  r  tain region might have voted the way they did.  
  The domain in which electoral geographers can have 
the most concrete inﬂ  uence is in the drawing of electoral 
districts. In a d  e  mocracy with representatives elected by dis-
trict, spatial organization of the districts determines whose 
voice is heard in a given place—with impacts on who is elected. A voter’s most direct contact with government is at the local level. The United States Constitution establishes a system of territorial representation  . In the   Senate, each 
major territorial unit (State) gets two representatives, and 
in the House of Representatives, members are elected from territorially deﬁ  ned districts based on population.  
  The Co  n  stitution requires a census every ten years 
in order to enumerate the population and reapportion 
the representatives accordingly. Reapportionment is the process by which districts are moved accor  d  ing to popu-
lation shifts, so that each district encompasses approxi-mately the same number of people. For example, after the 2010 census, several States in the Rust Belt, including   Field Note  
  “As I drove along a main road through 
a Honolulu suburb I noticed that 
numerous houses had the   Hawai’i   State ﬂ  ag ﬂ  ying upside down. I 
knocked on the door of this house and asked the homeowner why he was trea  t  ing the State ﬂ  ag this way. 
He invited me in and we talked for more than an hour. ‘This is 1993,’ he said, ‘and we native   Hawai’ians   are letting the State government and the country know that we haven’t for-gotten the a  n  nexation by the United States of our kingdom. I don’t accept it, and we want our territory to plant our ﬂ  ag and keep the traditions alive. Why don’t you drive past the royal palace, and you’ll see that we mean it.’ He was right. The   Iolani   Palace, where the   Hawai’ians  ’ last monarch, Queen   Liliuokalani  , reigned until she was d  e  posed by a group of American busi-nessmen in 1893, was draped in black for all of Honolulu to see. Here was devoluti  o  n  ary stress on American soil.”

minority populations with meandering co  r  ridors and fol-
lowing Interstates to connect urban areas that have large 
minority populations (Fig. 8.18).  
  Strange-looking districts constructed to attain cer-
tain political ends are nothing new in American politics. 
In 1812, Governor Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts signed into law a district designed to give an adva  n  tage 
to his party—a district that looked so odd to artist Gilbert Stuart that he drew it with a head, wings, and claws. Stuart called it the “salamander district,” but a colleague immor-talized it by naming it a gerrymander (after the governor). Ever since, the term gerrymandering has been used to describe “redistricting for adva  n  tage.” Certainly, many of 
the districts now on the United States electoral map may be seen as gerr  y  manders, but for an important purpose: 
to provide representation to minorities who, without it, would not be represented as effe  c  tively in the House of 
Representatives. Despite this well-intended goal, others argue that the packing of minor  i  ties into majority-minority 
districts simply concentrates minority votes, creating a 
countrywide government that is less responsive to m  i  nor-
ity concerns.  
  The larger point is that the spatial organization of 
voting districts is a fundamentally geographical phenom-
enon, and it can have profound impacts on who is rep-resented and who is not—as well as peoples’ notions of fairness. And that is only the beginning. The voting pat-terns that emerge from particular elections can help rein-force a sense of regionalism and can shape a government’s for the election of a minority to occur. For example, if a government has to draw ten districts in a State that is 60 percent white, 30 percent African Amer  i  can, and 10 per-
cent Hispanic, it can easily dilute the minority voters by splitting them among multiple di  s  tricts, ensuring that the 
white population holds the majority in each district.  
  In 1982, the United States Congress amended the 
1965 Voting Rights Act by outlawing districts that have 
the effect of weakening minority voting power. In a series of decisions, the courts interpreted this amendment to mean States needed to redistrict in a way that would ensure minority representation. Using this criterion in the redis-tricting that followed the 1990 census, States increased the number of majority-minority districts in the House of Representatives from 27 to 52. Majority-minority dis-tricts are packed districts in which a majo  r  ity of the pop-
ulation is from the minority. In the hypothetical State 
described above, a redistricting follo  w  ing this criterion 
could have the goal of creating at least three majority-
minority districts and a fourth where minorities had a siz-able enough population to inﬂ  uence the outcome of the election.  
  Ideally, majority-minority districts would be com-
pact and contiguous and follow existing political units. 
Political geographers Jonathan   Leib   and Gerald Webster 
have researched the court cases that have resulted from trying to balance these often-conﬂ  icting criteria. T o pack minorities who do not live compactly and contiguously, States have drawn bizarrely shaped districts, connecting 6

272 Chapter 8   Political Geography 
  Many borders were established on the world map 
before the extent or signiﬁ  cance of subsoil resources was 
known. As a result, coal seams and aquifers cross boundar-ies, and oil and gas r  e  serves are split b  e  tween states. Europe’s 
coal reserves, for example, extend from Belgium underneath 
the Net  h  erlands and on into the Ruhr area of Germany. 
Soon after mining began in the mid-nineteenth century, 
these three neighbors began to accuse each other of mining coal that did not lie directly below their own national ter-ritories. The underground surveys available at the time were too inaccurate to pinpoint the ownership of each coal seam.  
  During the 1950s–1960s, Germany and the Neth-
erlands argued over a gas reserve that lies in the subsoil 
across their boundary. The Germans claimed that the Dutch were withdrawing so much natural gas that the gas was ﬂ  owing from beneath German land to the Dutch side of the boundary. The Germans wanted compensation for the gas they felt they lost. A major issue between Iraq and Kuwait, which in part led to Iraq’s i  n  vasion of Kuwait in 
1990, was the oil in the   Rumaylah   reserve that lies under-
neath the desert and crosses the border b  e  tween the two 
states. The Iraqis asserted that the Kuwaitis were drilling 
too many wells and draining the r  e  serve too quickly; they 
also alleged that the Kuwaitis were drilling oblique bore-
holes to penetrate the vertical plane extending downward along the boundary. At the time the Iraq-Kuwait bound-ary was established, however, no one knew that this giant oil reserve lay in the subsoil or that it would contribute to an international crisis (Fig. 8.19).  
  Above the ground, too, the interpretation of bound-
aries as vertical planes has serious implications. A state’s 
“airspace” is deﬁ  ned by the atmosphere above its land 
area as marked by its boundaries, as well as by what lies beyond, at higher altitudes. But how high does the airspace response to issues in the future. Small wonder, then, that many individuals who have little general understanding of geography at least appreciate the impo  r  tance of its elec-
toral geography component.  
  Choose an example of a devolutionary movement and 
consider which geographic factors favor, or work against, greater autonomy (self-governance) for the region. Would granting the region autonomy stren  g  then or weaken the state in which the region is currently situated?  
  HOW ARE BOUNDARIES ESTABLISHED, AND 
WHY DO BOUNDARY DISPUTES OCCUR?  
  The territories of individual states are separated by 
international boundaries, often referred to as borders. 
Bou  n  daries may appear on maps as straight lines or may 
twist and turn to conform to the bends of rivers and the curves of hills and va  l  leys. But a boundary is more than 
a line, far more than a fence or wall on the ground. A boundary between states is actually a vertical plane that cuts through the rocks below (called the subsoil) and the airspace above, dividing one state from another (Fig. 8.18). Only where the vertical plane inte  r  sects the Earth’s 
surface (on land or at sea) does it form the line we see on the ground.

extend? Most states insist on controlling the airline traf-
ﬁ c over their territories, but states do not yet control the 
paths of satellite orbits.  
  Establishing Boundaries  
  States typically deﬁ  ne the boundary in a treaty-like legal 
document in which actual points in the landscape or 
points of latitude and longitude are described. Cartog-raphers delimit the boundary by drawing on a map. If 
either or both of the states so desire, they can demar-cate the boundary by using steel posts, concrete pillars, fences, walls, or some other visible means to mark the boundary on the ground. By no means are all boundaries on the world map demarcated. Demarcating a lengthy boundary is expensive, and it is hardly worth the effort in high mountains, vast deserts, frigid polar lands, or other places with few permanent settlements. Demar-cating boundaries is part of state efforts to administrate  
borders—to determine how the boundaries will be mai  n  tained and to determine which goods and people 
may cross them. How a boundary is administered can 
change dr  a  matically over time, however (Fig. 8.20).    Types of Boundaries  
  When boundaries are drawn using grid systems such as lat-
itude and longitude or township and range, political geog-raphers refer to these boundaries as geometric boundar-ies. In North America, the United States and Ca  n  ada used 
a single line of latitude west of the Great Lakes to deﬁ  ne 
their boundary. During the Berlin Conference, colonial 
powers used arbitrary reference points and drew straight lines to establish the boundaries in much of Africa.  
  At different times, political geographers and other 
academics have advocated “natural” boundaries over geo-
metric boundaries because they are visible on the landscape as physical geographic features. Physical-political (also called natural-political) boundaries are boundaries that follow an agreed-upon feature in the na  t  ural landscape, 
such as the center point of a river or the crest of a mountain 
range. The Rio Grande is an i  m  po  r  tant physical-political 
boundary between the United States and Mexico. Another 
physical-political boundary follows the crest lines of the Pyr-enees separating Spain and France. Lakes sometimes serve as boundaries as well; for example, four of the ﬁ  ve Great Lakes of North America are borders between the United States c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 273  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 273  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  graphical circu  m  stances than with the character of the 
boundary itself.  
  Boundary Disputes  
  The boundary we see as a line on a map is the product 
of a complex series of legal steps that begins with a wri  t-
  ten description of the boundary. Sometimes that legal 
description is old and imprecise. Sometimes it was dic-tated by a stronger power that is now less dominant, giving the weaker neighbor a reason to a  r  gue for change. 
At other times the geography of the borderland has actu-ally changed; the river that marked the boundary may have changed course, or a portion of it has been cut off. and Canada, and several of the Great Lakes of East Africa are borders between Congo and its eastern neighbors.  
  Physical features sometimes make convenient 
political boundaries, but topographic features are not 
sta  t  ic. Rivers change course, volcanoes erupt, and slowly, 
mountains erode. People perceive physical-political 
boundaries as stable, but many states have entered ter-ritorial conﬂ  icts over borders based on physical fea-tures (not  a  bly Chile and Argentina). Similarly, physical 
boundaries do not necessarily stop the ﬂ  ow of people or 
goods across boundaries, leading some states to rein-force physical boundaries with human-built o  b  stacles 
(the United States on the Rio Grande). The stability of 
boundaries has more to do with local historical and ge  o-  Field Note  
  “Seeing the border between Italy and Slovenia marked 
by a plaque on the ground reminded me of crossing this border with my family as a teenager. The year was 
1973, and after waiting in a long line we ﬁ  nally reached 
the place where we showed our passports to the authorities. They asked us many questions and they looked through the luggage in our trunk. Now that Slovenia is part of the European Union and has signed the   Schengen   Agre  e  ment eliminating border controls between countries, crossing that same border today is literally like a walk in the park.”

 How  Does   the Study of   Geopolitics  Help Us Understand the World? 275
    People used to think physical-political boundaries were 
always more stable than geometric boundaries. Through studies of many places, political geographers have con-ﬁ rmed that this idea is false. Construct your own argument 
explaining why physical-political boundaries can create just as much instability as geometric bound  a  ries.  
  HOW   DOES   THE STUDY OF   GEOPOLITICS   
HELP US UNDERSTAND THE WORLD?  
  Geopolitics is the interplay among geography, power, 
politics, and international relations on Earth’s surface. 
Political science and international relations tend to focus on governmental institutions, systems, and interactions. Geo-politics brings   locational   considerations, environmental con-
texts, territorial ideas and arrang  e  ments, and spatial assump-
tions to the fore. Geopolitics helps us understand the spatial 
power arrangements that shape international relations.  
  Classical Geopolitics  
  Classical   geopoliticians   of the late nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries generally ﬁ  t into one of two camps: the 
German school, which sought to explain why certain states 
are powerful and how to become powe  r  ful, and the British/
American school, which sought to offer strategic advice by 
identifying parts of Earth’s surface that were particularly important for the maintenance and projection of power. A few   geopoliticians   tried to bridge the gap, blending the two 
schools, but for the most part classical   geopoliticians   who 
are still writing today are in the British/American school, 
offering   geostrategic   perspe  c  tives on the world.  
  The German School  
  Why are certain states powerful, and how do states become 
powerful? The ﬁ  rst political geographer who stu  d  ied these 
issues was the German professor Friedrich   Ratzel   (1844–
1904). Inﬂ  uenced by the writings of Charles Darwin,   Rat-
zel   postulated that the state rese  m  bles a biological organ-
ism whose life cycle extends from birth through maturity 
and, ultimately, decline and death. T o prolong its existence, the state requires nouris  h  ment, just as an organism needs 
food. Such nourishment is provided by the acquisition of 
territories that provide ad  e  quate space for the members of 
the state’s dominant nation to thrive, which is what   Ratzel   
called lebensraum. If a state is conﬁ  ned within permanent Resources lying across a boundary can lead to conﬂ  ict. In 
short, states often argue about their boundaries. Bound-
ary disputes take four principal forms: deﬁ  n  i  tional,   loca-
tional  , operational, and   allocational  .  
  Deﬁ nitional boundary disputes focus on the legal lan-
guage of the boundary agreement. For example, a bound-
ary deﬁ  nition may stipulate that the median line of a river will mark the boundary. That would seem clear enough, but the water levels of rivers vary. If the valley is asymmet-rical, the median line will move back and forth between low-water and high-water stages of the stream. This may involve hundreds of meters of mov  e  ment—not very 
much, it would seem, but enough to cause serious argu-ment, especially if there are resources in the river. The solution is to reﬁ  ne the deﬁ  nition to suit both parties.  
  Locational   boundary disputes center on the delimita-
tion and possibly the demarcation of the boundary. The deﬁ nition is not in dispute, but its interpretation is. Some-
times the language of boundary treaties is vague enough to allow mapmakers to delimit the line in various ways. For example, when the colonial po  w  ers deﬁ  ned their 
empires in Africa and Asia, they speciﬁ  ed their interna-
tional boundaries rather carefully. But internal adminis-trative boundaries often were not strictly deﬁ  ned. When 
those internal boundaries b  e  came the boundaries between 
independent states, there was plenty of room for argu-ment. In a few instances,   locational   disputes arise b  e  cause 
no deﬁ  nition of the boundary exists at all. An important case involves Saudi Arabia and Y emen, whose potentially oil-rich boundary area is not covered by a treaty.  
  Operational boundary disputes involve neighbors who 
differ over the way their border should function. When 
two adjoining countries agree on how cross-border migration should be controlled, the border functions sat-isfactorily. However, if one state wants to limit migration while the other does not, a dispute may arise. Sim  i  larly, 
efforts to prevent smuggling across borders sometimes lead to operational disputes when one state’s e  f  forts are 
not matched (or are possibly even sabotaged) by its neigh-bor. And in areas where nomadic ways of life still prevail, the movement of people and their livestock across inter-national borders can lead to conﬂ  ict.  
  Allocational   boundary disputes of the kind described 
earlier, involving the Netherlands and Germany over nat-
ural gas and Iraq and Kuwait over oil, are becoming more common as the search for resources intensiﬁ  es. T oday 
many such disputes involve international boundaries at sea. Oil reserves under the seaﬂ  oor below coastal waters 
sometimes lie in areas where exact boundary delimit  a  tion 
may be difﬁ  cult or subject to debate. Another growing area of   allocational   dispute has to do with water supplies: 
the Tigris, Nile, Colorado, and other rivers are subject to such disputes. When a river crosses an international boundary, the rights of the upstream and downstream users of the river often come into conﬂ  ict.  c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 275  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 275  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
276 Chapter 8   Political Geography 
  In 1943,   Mackinder   wrote a ﬁ  nal paper expressing 
concern that the Soviet Union, under Stalin, would seek to 
exert control over the states of Eastern Europe. He offered strategies for keeping the Soviets in check, including avoid-ing the expansion of the Heartland into the Inner Cres-cent (Fig. 8.21) and creating an alliance around the North A  t  lantic to join the forces of land and sea powers against 
the Heartland. His ideas were not embraced by many at the 
time, but within ten years of publication, the United States began its containment po  l  icy to stop the expansion of the 
Soviet Union, and the United States, Canada, and Western 
Europe formed an alliance called the North Atlantic T reaty Organization (NATO). Further proof of the importance of   Mackinder’s   legacy can be seen in the fact that, even after 
the collapse of the Soviet Union, his theories enjoy wide-
spread currency in Ru  s  sian foreign po  l  icy circles.  
  Inﬂ  uence of   Geopoliticians   on Politics  
  Ratzel   and   Mackinder   are only two of many   geopoliti-
cians   who inﬂ  uenced international relations. Their writ-
ings, grounded in history, current events, and physical 
geography, sounded logical and inﬂ  uenced many politi-cians, and in some ways still do. NATO still exists and has not invited Russia to join the military alliance, but it has extended membership to 28 states since the end of the Cold War, including eastern European states. NATO has a working partnership with former republics of the Soviet Union, though the war between Russia and Georgia in 2008 produced a chilling effect on NATO’s eas  t  ward 
expansion.  
  Despite the staying power of geopolitical theories, 
geopolitics declined as a formal area of study after World 
War II. Because of the inﬂ  uence   Ratzel’s   theory had on 
Hitler and because anot  h  er   geopolitician  , Karl   Haush-
ofer  , also inﬂ  uenced Hitler, the term geopolitics acquired a and static boundaries and deprived of overseas domains,   Ratzel   argued, it can a  t  rophy. T erritory is thus seen as the 
state’s essential, life-giving force.  
  Ratzel’s   theory was based on his observations of 
states in the nineteenth century, including the United 
States. It was so speculative that it might have been for-gotten if some of   Ratzel’s   German followers in the 1930s 
had not translated his abstract writings into policy rec-
ommendations that ult  i  mately led to Nazi expansionism.  
  The British/ American School  
  Not long after the publication of   Ratzel’s   initial ideas, other 
geographers began looking at the overall organiz  a  tion of 
power in the world, studying the physical geographic map 
with a view toward determining the locations of most stra-tegic places on Earth. Prominent among them was the Oxford University geo  g  rapher Sir   Halford   J.   Mackinder   
(1861–1947). In 1904, he published an article titled “The 
Geographical Pivot of History” in the Royal Geographical Society’s Geographical Journal. That article became one of the 
most i  n  tensely debated geographic publications of all time.  
  Mackinder   was concerned with power relation-
ships at a time when Britain had acquired a global empire 
through its strong navy. T o many of his contemporaries, the oceans—the paths to colonies and trade—were the key to world domination, but   Mackinder   disagreed. He concluded 
that a land-based power, not a sea power, would ultimately 
rule the world. His famous article contained a lengthy appraisal of the largest and most populous landmass on Earth—Eurasia (Europe and Asia together). At the heart of Eurasia, he argued, lay an impre  g  nable, resource-rich “pivot 
area” extending from eastern Europe to eastern Siberia (Fig. 
8.21).   Mackinder   i  s  sued a warning: if this pivot area became 
inﬂ uential in Europe, a great empire could be formed.  
  Mackinder   later renamed his pivot area the heart-
land, and his warning became known as the heart-
land theory. In his book Democratic Ideals and Reality  
(1919),   Mackinder   (calling Eurasia “the World Island”) 
i  s  sued a stronger warning to the winners of World 
War I, stating:  
  Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland   
  Who rules the Heartland commands the World Island   
  Who rules the World Island commands the World  
  When   Mackinder   proposed his heartland theory, 
there was little to foretell the rise of a superpower in the 
heartland. Russia was in disarray, having recently lost a war against Japan (1905), and was facing revolution. Eastern Europe was fractured. Germany, not Russia, was gaining power. But when the Soviet Union emerged and Moscow controlled over much of Eastern Europe at the end of World War II, the heartland theory a  t  tracted renewed attention.   Figure 8.21

 How Does the Study of Geopolitics Help Us Understand the World? 277
  Statements such as these are rooted in a particular 
geopolitical perspective on the world—one that divides 
the globe into opposing camps. That much may seem obvious, as there are clear ideological fault lines between an organization such as al-Qaeda and a state such as the United States. But critical geopolitics seeks to move beyond such differences to explore the spatial ideas and understandings that   undergird   particular political per-
spectives and that shape policy approaches.  
  One of the most powerful geopolitical ideas since 
Samuel Huntington published   The Clash of Civilizations 
and the Remaking of World Order   in 1996 posits an “Islamic 
World.” September 11, 2001 ampliﬁ  ed the idea of a threat-
ening Islamic realm. The U.S. government, concerned about al-Qaeda’s inﬂ  uence in the Islamic World, justiﬁ  ed 
military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. The idea of a uniﬁ  ed “Islamic World” appears in the words of com-mentators on 24-hour news channels. The problem with such conceptions is that the “Islamic World” is tremen-dously diverse, cult  u  rally, and reli  g  iously, and some of 
the most intractable conﬂ  icts of recent times have been 
fought within the I  s  lamic World. Belief in or fear of a uni-
ﬁ ed “Islamic World” is not any more rational than belief 
in or fear of a uniﬁ  ed “Christian World.” Regardless, if geopolitical ideas are believed, they shape the policies that are pursued and how we perceive what happens on the ground. An important task for geographers, then, is to understand the ideological roots and implications of geo-political reasoning by intelle  c  tuals of statecraft.  
  Geopolitical World Order  
  Political geographers study geopolitical world orders, 
which are the temporary periods of stability in the way international politics is conducted. For example, during the Cold War, the geopolitical world order was bipolar—the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellites versus the United States and its close allies in Western E  u  rope. 
In the past, after a stable geopolitical world order broke 
down, the world went through a transition, eventually se  t-
  tling into a new geopolitical world order. Noted political 
geographers Peter J. T aylor and Colin Flint argue that at the end of World War II, ﬁ  ve possible orders could have emerged among the three major powers, the United King-dom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Each could have created its own bloc with its own allies; the three could have come together under the United Nations; or three possible alliances could have occurred—the United States and USSR against the UK, the United States and the UK against the USSR, or the UK and USSR against the United States. What emerged was the bipolar world order of the Cold War: the Uni  t  ed States and the UK against the USSR.  
  After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the world 
entered a transition period, again opening up a var  i  ety of 
different geopolitical possibilities. Some politicians spoke negative connotation. For some decades after World War 
II, the term was in such disrepute that few political geog-raphers, even those studying power rel  a  tionships, would 
identify themselves as students of geopolitics. Time, along with more balanced perspectives, has reinstated geopoli-tics as a signiﬁ  cant ﬁ  eld of study, encompassing efforts to 
understand the spatial and territorial dimensions of power relationships past, present, and f  u  ture.  
  Critical Geopolitics  
  Rather than focusing their attention on predicting and 
prescribing, many current students of geopolitics focus on revealing and explaining the underlying spatial assumptions and territorial perspectives of international actors. Political geographers   Gearoid     O’T uathail   and John Agnew refer to 
those actors in the most powerful states, the core states, as 
“intellectuals of statecraft.” The basic concept behind criti-
cal geopolitics is that intellectuals of statecraft construct ideas about geographical circumstances and places, these ideas i  n  ﬂ uence and reinforce their political behaviors and 
policy choices, and then affect what happens and how most 
people interpret what ha  p  pens.  
  O’T uathail   has focused particular attention on Ameri-
can geopolitical reasoning—examining speeches and state-
ments by U.S. intellectuals of statecraft. He has drawn atten-tion to how several American leaders often   spatialize   politics 
into a world of “us” and “them.” Political leaders can shape 
how their constituents see places and organize international space in their minds. By drawing on American cultural logic and certain represent  a  tions of America,   O’T uathail   
argues that presidents have repeatedly deﬁ  ned an “us” that 
is pro-democracy, indepe  n  d  ent, self-sufﬁ  cient, and free and a 
“them” that is in some way against all of these things.  
  During the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan 
coined the term Evil Empire for the Soviet Union and 
represented the United States as “the shining city on a hill.” During ensuing presidencies, terrorism replaced the Soviet Union as the “they.” Sounding remarkably similar, Democratic President William J. Clinton and Repu  b  li-
can President George W. Bush justiﬁ  ed military actions 
against terrorists. In 1998, President Clinton justiﬁ  ed 
American military action in Sudan and Afghanistan as a response to terrorist plans by Osama bin Laden by no  t  ing 
that the terrorists “come from diverse places but share a hatred for democracy, a fanatical gloriﬁ  cation of violence, and a horrible distortion of their religion, to justify the murder of innocents. They have made the Uni  t  ed States 
their adversary precisely because of what we stand for and what we stand against.” Immediately after September 11, President George W. Bush made a similar claim, argu-ing that “They [the terrorists] stand against us because we stand in their way.” In 2002, President Bush again explained, “I’ve said in the past that nations are either with us or against us in the war on te  r  ror.”  c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 277  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 277  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

we will discuss in Chapter 9, global cities may gain increas-
ing power over issues typ  i  cally addressed by states.  
  Read a major newspaper (in print or online) and look for a 
recent statement by a world political leader regarding interna-tional politics. Using the concept of critical geopolitics, deter-mine what geopolitical view of the world the leader has—how does he or she view and divide up the world spatially?  
  WHAT ARE SUPRANATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS, AND WHAT ARE THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE?  
  Ours is a world of contradictions. Over the past 
couple of decades some French Canadians,   Quebeçois  , 
have demanded indepen  d  ence from Canada even as 
Canada joined the United States and Mexico in NAFTA 
(the North American Free T rade Agreement). Flemings in northern Belgium called for autonomy or even inde-pen  d  ence despite the fact that Brussels, the capital of Bel-
gium (and Flanders), serves as the de facto capital of the European Union. At every turn we are reminded of the interconnectedness of nations, states, and regions; yet, separatism and calls for a  u  tonomy are rampant. In the 
early decades of the twenty-ﬁ  rst century, we appear to be caught between the forces of division and uniﬁ      cation.  
  Despite conﬂ  icts arising from these contradictory 
forces, today hardly a country exists that is not involved 
in some supran  a  tional organization. A supranational 
organization is an entity composed of three or more states that forge an association and form an administra-tive structure for mutual beneﬁ  t and in pursuit of shared 
goals. The twentieth century witnessed the establishment of numerous supranational associations in p  o  litical, eco-
nomic, cultural, and military spheres.  
  T oday, states have formed over 60 major suprana-
tional organizations (such as NATO and NAFTA), many 
of which have subsidiaries that bring the total to more than 100 (Figure 8.22). The more states participate in such mu  l  tilateral associations, the less likely they are to 
act alone in pursuit of a self-interest that might put them at odds with neighbors. And in most cases participation in a supranational entity is advantageous to the partners, and being left out can have serious negative implic  a  tions.  
  From League of Nations to United Nations  
  The modern beginnings of the supranational move-
ment can be traced to conferences following World optimistically about a new geopolitical world order where a standoff of nuclear terror between two superpowers would no longer determine the destinies of states. Sup-posedly, this new geopolitical order would be shaped by the forces that connect nations and states; by s  u  pranational 
entities like the European Union (discussed in the next 
section of this cha  p  ter); and, should any state violate inter-
national rules of conduct, by multilateral military action. 
The risks of nuclear war would r  e  cede, and negoti  a  tion 
would replace confrontation. When a United Nations 
coalition of states led by the United States in 1991 drove Iraq out of Kuwait, the framework of a New World Order seemed to be taking shape. The Soviet Union, which a few years before was the United States’ principal geopolitical antagonist, endorsed the operation. Arab as well as non-Arab forces helped repel the i  n  vaders.  
  Soon, however, doubts and uncertainties began 
to cloud hopes for a mutually cooperative geopolitical 
world order. Although states were more closely linked to each other than ever before, national self-interest still acted as a powerful force. Nations wanted to become states, and many did, as the number of United Nations members increased from 159 in 1990 to 184 by 1993 and 192 as of 2006. At the same time, a variety of organ  i  za-
tions not tied to speciﬁ  c territories posed a new challenge 
to the territorially deﬁ  ned state. The number and power 
of economic and social networks that extend across state 
borders increased. The new world order i  n  cludes   non-
state   organizations with political agendas that are not 
channeled through states and are often spatially diffuse.  
  Some hoped to see a geopolitical world order based 
on unilateralism, with the United States in a position 
of hard-power dominance and with allies of the United 
States following rather than joining the political decision-making process. The U.S. military budget is as large as all the military budgets of all other states in the world com-bined. The United States’ controversial invasion of Iraq signiﬁ  cantly undermined its inﬂ  uence in many parts of the 
globe. Southeast Asian states that had long been oriented toward the United States began to turn away. A signiﬁ  -
cant rift developed across the Atlantic between the United States and some European cou  n  tries, and anti-American-
ism surged around the world. The processes of globaliza-tion, the diffusion of nu  c  lear weapons, the emergence of 
China and India as increasingly signiﬁ  cant powers, and the 
growth of networked groups and organizations, including terrorist groups, also challenged American unilateralism.  
  When geopolitical strategists and intellectuals of 
statecraft predict future geopolitical orders, they often 
assume that individual states will continue to be the domi-nant actors in the international arena. Y et as we discuss later in this chapter, many of the same forces that worked against American unilateralism have undermined some of the tra-ditional powers of the state. The rise of regional blocs could lead to a new   multip  o  lar   order, with key clusters of states 
functioning as major geopolitical nodes. Alternatively, as c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 278  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 278  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 What Are Supranational Organizations, and What Are Their Implications for the State? 279
Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the C  o  venant 
on Civil and Political Rights, and the Covenant on Eco-
nomic and Social Rights, set a precedent and laid the groundwork for countless human rights groups working in the world today.  
  By participating in the United Nations, states commit 
to internationally approved standards of behavior. Many 
states still violate the standards embodied in the United Nations Charter, but such violations can lead to collective action, such as economic sanctions or Security Council-supported military action. The United N  a  tions’ actions 
in South Africa (Apartheid) and Iraq (the Gulf War) are 
examples of UN success, but the organ  i  zation has its crit-
ics as well. Some argue that the composition of its Security 
Council reﬂ  ects the world of 1950 more than the world of today. Others express concern about power being vested in an organization that is not directly respo  n  sible to voters and 
that provides little room for non-state interests. Still oth-
ers criticize the fact that states like Iran, Cuba, and North Korea sit on the organization’s Human Rights Council. For all its wea  k  nesses, however, the United Nations represents 
the only truly international forum for addressing many sig-
niﬁ cant pro  b  lems co  n  fronting the globe.  
  Regional Supranational Organizations  
  The League of Nations and the United Nations are global 
manifestations of a phenomenon that is expressed even more strongly at the regional level. States organize supra-national organizations at the regional scale to p  o  sition 
themselves more strongly economically, politically, and even militarily.  
  Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg under-
took the ﬁ  rst major modern experiment in regional eco-
nomic cooperation. The three countries have much in common culturally and economically. Dutch farm prod-ucts are sold on Belgian markets, and Belgian industrial goods go to the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Dur-ing World War II, representatives of the three countries decided to create common tariffs and eliminate i  m  port 
licenses and quotas. In 1944, even before the end of the war, the governments of the three states met in London to sign an agreement of cooperation, creating the Benelux 
(Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) region.  
  Following World War II, U.S. Secretary of State 
George Marshall proposed that the United States ﬁ  nance 
a European recovery program. A committee representing 
16 Western European states plus (then) West Germany presented the United States Congress with a joint pro-gram for economic rehabilitation, and Congress approved it. From 1948 to 1952, the United States gave Europe about $12 billion under the Marshall Plan, the largest foreign aid program in history. This investment revived European national economies and spurred a movement toward cooperation among E  u  ropean states.  War I. Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States,  proposed an international organization that would include all the states of the world (fewer than 75 states existed at that point), leading to the creation of the League of N  a  tions in 1919. Even though it was the 
idea of an American president, the United States was 
among the countries that did not join this organiza-tion because isolationists in the U.S. Senate opposed joining. In all, 63 states participated in the League, although the total membership at any single time never reached that number. Costa Rica and Brazil left the League even before 1930; Germany departed in 1933, shortly before the S  o  viet Union joined in 1934. The 
League later expelled the Soviet Union in 1939 for 
invading Finland. The League was born of a world-wide desire to prevent future aggression, but the fail-ure of the United States to join dealt the organization a severe blow. In the mid-1930s, the League had a major opportunity when Ethiopia’s   Haile     Selassie   made a dra-
matic appeal for help in the face of an invasion by Italy, 
a member state until 1937. The League failed to take action, and in the chaos of the beginning of World War II the organization collapsed.  
  Even though the League of Nations ceased func-
tioning, it spawned other supranational organizations. 
Between World War I and World War II, states cre-ated the Permanent Court of International Justice to adjudicate legal issues between states, such as bound-ary disputes and ﬁ  shing rights. The League of Nations also init  i  ated international negotiations on maritime 
boundaries and related aspects of the law of the sea. The 
confe  r  ences organized by the League laid the ground-
work for the ﬁ  nal resolution of the size of territorial seas 
de  c  ades later.  
  After World War II, states formed a new organi-
zation to foster international security and cooperation: 
the United Nations (UN). Membership in the UN has grown signiﬁ  cantly since its inception in 1947 (Fig. 8.23). A handful of states still do not belong to the United Nations, but with the most recent additions in 2006, it now has 192 member states. The United Nations orga-nization includes numerous less visible but nonetheless signiﬁ      cant subsidiaries, including the FAO (Food and 
Agriculture Organization), UNESCO (United Nations 
Educ  a  tional, Scientiﬁ  c and Cultural Organization), and 
WHO (World Health Organization). Not all United 
N  a  tions members participate in every United Nations 
subsidiary, but many people around the world have ben-
eﬁ ted from their work.  
  We can ﬁ  nd evidence of the United Nations’ work 
in the “world” section of any major newspaper. UN 
peacekeeping troops have helped maintain stability in some of the most contentious regions of the world. The United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees is called upon to aid refugees in crises in far-ﬂ  ung places.

eliminations of certain tariffs and a freer ﬂ  ow of labor, capi-
tal, and commodities beyond steel. This led, in 1958, to the cre  a  tion of the European Economic Community (EEC).  
  The success of the EEC induced other countries 
to apply for membership. Denmark, Ireland, and the 
United Kingdom joined in 1973, Greece in 1981, and Spain and Portugal in 1986. The organization became known as the European Community (EC) because it began to address issues beyond economics. By the late 1980s, the EC had 12 members: the three giants (Germany, France, and the United Kingdom); the four southern countries (Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece); and ﬁ  ve smaller states (the Netherlands, Belgium, Lux-embourg, Denmark, and Ireland). These 12 members   The European Union  
  From the European states’ involvement in the Marshall 
Plan came the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), and this body in turn gave rise to other cooperative organizations. Soon after Europe e  s  tab-
lished the OEEC, France proposed the creation of a Euro-
pean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) with the goal of lifting the restrictions and obstacles that impeded the ﬂ  ow 
of coal, iron ore, and steel among the mai  n  land’s six primary 
producers: France, West Germany, Italy, and the three 
Benelux countries. The six states entered the ECSC, and gradually, through negotiations and agreement, enlarged their sphere of cooperation to i  n  clude reductions and even

 What Are Supranational Organizations, and What Are Their Implications for the State? 281
because of the diversity of the states involved. For example, 
agricultural practices and pol  i  cies have always varied widely. 
Y et some general policy must govern agriculture through-
out the European U  n  ion. Individual states have found these 
adjustments difﬁ  cult at times, and the EU has had to devise 
policies to accommodate regional contrasts and delays in implementation. In addition, integration requires signiﬁ  cant 
expenditures. Under the rules of the EU, the richer coun-tries must subsidize (provide ﬁ  nancial support to) the poorer ones; therefore, the entry of eastern European states adds to the ﬁ  nancial burden on the wealthier western and northern European members. Recent ﬁ  nancial crises in Greece and Ireland have put the union under u  n  precedented pressure, 
as wealthier countries such as Germany question why they 
should foot the bill for cou  n  tries that have not (at least in 
German eyes) managed their ﬁ  nances responsibly.  initiated a program of cooperation and uniﬁ  cation that 
led to the formal establishment of a European Union 
(EU) in 1992. In the mid-1990s, Austria, Sweden, and Finland joined the EU, bringing the total number of members to 15 (Fig. 8.24).  
  In the late 1990s, the EU began preparing for the 
establishment of a single currency—the euro (Fig. 8.25). 
First, all electronic ﬁ  nancial transactions were denomi-
nated in euros, and on January 1, 2002, the EU introduced euro coins and notes. Not all EU me  m  ber states are cur-
rently a part of the euro-zone, but the euro has emerged as a signiﬁ  cant global currency.  
  The integration of ten eastern European and Mediter-
ranean island states into the European Union in 2004, and 
two more in 2007, is a signiﬁ  cant development. Integration is a difﬁ  cult process and often requires painful adjustments

thereby widening the organization’s reach. The govern-
ment of T urkey has long sought to join, but many Greeks are hesitant to support T urkish membership because of the long-standing dispute between Greece and T urkey over Cyprus and a number of islands off the T urkish coast. Other EU me  m  bers have expressed concern over T urkey’s 
human rights record, speciﬁ  cally its treatment of Kurds 
and its reluctance to recognize the extent of the mass kill-
ing of Armenians in World War I. Behind these claims lies an often-unspoken sense among many Europeans that T urkey is not “European” enough to warrant membership, perhaps rooted in a historical and cultural tendency to d  e  ﬁ ne Muslims as the “Ot  h  er.” The d  e  bate within the EU   The Union is a patchwork of states with many different 
ethnic traditions and histories of conﬂ  ict and competition, 
and some in Europe express concern over losing traditional state powers. Ec  o  nomic success and growing well-being 
tend to submerge hesitancy and differences, but in the face 
of difﬁ  cult economic or social times, divisive forces can, and have, reasserted themselves. Moreover, as the EU gets big-ger, it becomes increasingly difﬁ  cult for individual states (even powerful ones) to shape the dire  c  tion of the union. 
And some citizens in smaller states such as Denmark and 
Sweden worry about getting lost in the mix.  
  Another difﬁ  cult problem involves T urkey. Some 
western Europeans would like to see T urkey join the EU,

 What Are Supranational Organizations, and What Are Their Implications for the State? 283
Asia-Paciﬁ  c Economic Council (APEC), and the Com-
monwealth of Ind  e  pendent States (CIS), have drawn up 
treaties to reduce tariffs and import restrictions in order 
to ease the ﬂ  ow of commerce in their regions. Not all of these alliances are successful, but economic   suprana-
tionalism   is a sign of the times, a grand experiment still 
in progress.  
  Y et, when we turn back to the European Union, we 
see a supranational organization that is unlike any other. It 
is not a state, nor is it simply an o  r  ganization of states. The 
European Union is remarkable in that it has taken on a life of its own—with a multifaceted government structure, three capital cities, and billions of euros ﬂ  owing through about T urkey has alienated many T urkish people, causing them to que  s  tion their support for EU membership.  
  How Does   Supranationalism   Affect the State?  
  Supranationalism   is a worldwide phenomenon. Other 
economic associations, such as the North American 
Free T rade Agreement (NAFTA), the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), the Central American Com-mon Ma  r  ket, the Andean Group, the Southern Cone 
Community Market (MERCOSUR), the Economic

state governments. With the European Union, we may be 
witnessing a transformation to a new political geographic construct that signiﬁ  es a change in the political organiza-tion of space similar to the transformation to the modern state system that occurred in Europe in the seventeenth ce  n  tury.  
  Other movements in addition to the European 
Union are posing major challenges to the state as we 
know it and raising questions as to whether the division of the world into territorial states is logical, effective, or its coffers. The European Union is extending into foreign relations, domestic policies, and mil  i  tary policies, with 
sovereignty over certain issues moving from the states to the European Union. One of the authors of this book has studied the degree to which Europeans in some regions are fee  l  ing a greater a  t  tachment to their region and to 
the European Union than to their own state (Fig. 8.26). Identifying with the European U  n  ion (over the state) is 
strong in the Benelux countries (the ﬁ  rst members) and in regions where people have been disempowered by their    Mediterranean  Sea    North

or group to pu  r  chase the power with which to threaten 
the world.  
  Although states provide the territorial foundation 
from which producers and consumers still operate and 
they continue to exert considerable regulatory powers, economic globalization makes it ever more difﬁ  cult for 
states to control economic relations, which is an example of   deterritorialization  . States are respon  d  ing to this situation 
in a variety of ways, with some giving up traditional regula-
tory powers and others seeking to insulate themselves from the intern  a  tional economy. Still others are working to build 
supranational economic blocs that they hope will help them 
cope with an increasingly   globalized   world. The impacts of 
many of these develo  p  ments are as yet uncertain, but it is 
increasingly clear that states now compete with a variety of 
other forces in the intern  a  tional arena.  
  The state’s traditional position is being further eroded 
by the globalization of social and cultural relations. Net-
works of interaction are being constructed in ways that do not correspond to the map of states. In 2011, when unrest broke out in Egypt, for example, activists used   Facebook   
to garner support. Scholars and researchers in different 
countries work together in teams. Increased mobility has brought individuals from far-ﬂ  ung places into much closer 
contact than before. Paralleling all this change is the spread of popular culture in ways that make national borders vir-tually meaningless. Katy Perry is listened to from Iceland to Australia; fas  h  ions developed in northern Italy are hot 
items among Japanese tourists visiting South Korea; Thai 
restaurants are found in towns and cities across the United States; Russians hurry home to watch the next episode of soap o  p  eras made in Mexico; and movies produced in Hol-
lywood are seen on screens from Mumbai to Santiago.  
  The rise of fundamentalist religious movements 
with geopolitical goals represents another global phe-
nomenon with potentially signiﬁ  cant implications for a future world order. In Chapter 6, we noted that fund  a-
  mental religious movements sometimes become extrem-
ist by inciting violent acts in the name of their faith. V  i  olence by extremists challenges the state—whether 
undertaken by individuals at the local scale or by widely 
diffused groups spread across major world realms. The state’s mission to combat religious violence can produce support for the state government in the short term, but the state’s inability to defeat extremist attacks may we  a  ken the state in the long term. T errorist attacks have 
been threatened or carried out by religious extremists 
from a v  a  riety of different faiths, but the wave of inter-
national terrorism that began in the 1980s in the name 
of Islam has dominated the international scene over the past two decades. The attacks on the World T rade Cen-ter and the Pentagon and the downing of Flight 93 in Pennsylvania, and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan that followed, moved terrorism to the ge  o  political cen-
ter stage. More recent terrorist attacks in Madrid, Mos-
cow, and Mumbai have helped to keep it there.  even necessary. Among these challenges are the demand of nations within states for independence, economic glo-balization, increasing connectedness among people and cultures, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  
  Nuclear weapons give even small states the ability 
to inﬂ  ict massive damage on larger and distant adversar-
ies. Combined with missile technology, this may be the most serious danger the world faces, which is why the United Nations insisted on dismantling Iraq’s nuclear capacity after the 1991 Gulf War and why concerns over Iran’s nuclear program are so great. Some states pub-licize their nuclear weapons programs, whereas other nuclear states have never formally acknowledged that they possess nuclear weapons. Reports of nuclear pro-liferation have led to military actions in the last 30 years. In 1981, when reports of Iraq’s nuclear program reached Israel, the Israelis attacked Iraq. As nuclear weapons have become smaller and “tact  i  cal” nuclear arms have 
been d  e  veloped, the threat of nuclear weapons sales is 
of growing concern. It is now possible for a hostile state

the spatial di  s  tribution of power is more complex than the 
traditional map of states would suggest. Describing that 
spatial distribution will be a challenge for geographers for gener  a  tions to come.  
  In 2004, the European Union welcomed ten additional states, and in 2007, it welcomed two more. Examine the European Union website (listed below in the Learn More Online section). Read about the European Union’s expansion and what is going on in the European Union right now. Assess how complicated it is for the European Union to bring together these many divergent members into one supranational organization.    All of the foregoing processes are creating eco-
nomic, social, and cultural geographies that look less and 
less like the map of states (Fig. 8.3). The term   deterrito-
rialization   is sometimes used to describe these processes 
because globalization, networked communities, and the 
like undermine the state’s traditional territor  i  al author-
ity. But the state is far from disappearing, and national-ism continues to be a fundamental social force in the world today. Indeed, in many instances. the state is mov-ing to solidify control over its territory through a process known as   reterritorialization  . For example, in response 
to concerns over illegal immigration, some state borders 
are becoming more heavily fortiﬁ  ed, and moving across 
those borders is becoming more di  f  ﬁ cult. However one 
views the balance between   deterrit  o  rialization   and   reter-
ritorialization  , the state of the geopolitical order is clearly 
in ﬂ ux. We appear to be headed toward a world in which    Figure 8.26

  Summary  
  We tend to take the state for granted, but the modern state idea is less than 400 years 
old. The idea and ideal of the nation-state have diffused around the globe in the wake of colonialism and the emergence of the modern i  n  ternational legal order.  
  The state may seem natural and permanent, but it is not. New states are being rec-
ognized, and existing states are vulnerable to destructive forces. How long can this way 
of politically organizing space last?  c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 286  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 286  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  The semicircular shaped Grand Circus Park in Detroit, Michigan is divided by 
several streets, making it look like the hub and spokes of a bicycle wheel from above. The grouping of buildings along Grand Circus Park (Fig 9.1) reﬂ  ects the 
rise, fall, and revitalization of the   central business district (CBD)    in Detroit. 
  The ce  n  tral business di  s  trict is a concentration of business and commerce in the city’s downtown.  
  The Kales building is the tall building on the far left of the photograph. It 
was once the headquarters of the Kresge Corporation, which became K-Mart.

 Ghosts of Detroit? 289
Aba  n  doned in 1986 and left to a state of disrepair, the Kales building was renovated 
at a cost of $15 million in 2005. The Kales building now houses over 100 lu  x  ury apar  t  ments. In 2011, the Kales Building stood at 100 percent occupied.  
  The short building to the right of the Kales building, tucked behind the trees, 
was the Adams Theater. Closed in 1988, the Adams Theater fell into a state of dis-repair to the point that building could no longer be saved. The Downtown Detroit Development Authority required i  n  vestors to save the façade of the building and allowed them to demolish the rest of it. A new building is slated to go up behind the façade.  
  To the right of that building is the Grand Park Centre, which underwent a $7 
million renovation in 2000. Grand Park Centre is an ofﬁ  ce building, but downtown Detroit has an abundance of o  f  ﬁ  ce space. As a result, in 2011, the building was only 
26.1 percent leased, and 73.9 percent stood vacant.  
  The building on the far right houses the Fyfe Apartments, named for Richard 
H. Fyfe who built a fo  r  tune in the shoe trade in Detroit. The building was con-verted to apartments in 1960 and has functioned as apartments since that time. In 2011, the Fyfe Apar  t  ments were 97 percent occupied.  
  Buildings in the Grand Circus Park neighborhood have garnered millions 
in ren  o  vation because of the neighborhood’s close proximity to the revital-ized entertainment district in dow  n  town Detroit. Right around the corner from Grand Circus Park are C  o  merica Park, Fox Theater, and Ford Field. The property manager of the Kales Building said the central business district of Detroit is bouncing back because of the entertainment di  s  trict. He said it’s now tough to ﬁ nd an apartment in the central business district of Detroit, speculating that 
pe  o  ple are drawn to living downtown because of high gas prices and low crime rates in the central business district. Another real estate developer contended the main reason rental units are full in D  e  troit is because so many pe  o  ple have lost their houses in the mortgage crisis that they are renting now. Across Grand Circus Park, the Bro  d  erick Towers are slated to open after a massive renovation, which will bring a new shopping complex and more apartments to this revital-ized neighbo  r  hood.  
  Other neighborhoods of the city are not bouncing back as well as apartment 
units in Grand Circus Park have. Abandoned high-rise buildings called the ghosts of Detroit (Fig. 9.2) are joined by empty single-family homes to account for 10,000 abandoned buildings in the city. The population of Detroit rose and fell with the automobile industry. The population peaked at 1.8 million in 1950, but the 2010 census shows the city’s popul  a  tion falling to 713,777.  
  Empty high-rise ofﬁ  ce buildings, apartments, government buildings, hotels, 
and train depots stand throughout the city like dead trees in a forest. The Lafayette Building (Fig. 9.2) stood across the street from the Book Cadillac Hotel for nearly a century. Once home to the ofﬁ  ces of the Michigan Supreme Court, the Lafa  y  ette closed due to ﬁ  nancial woes and lack of tenants in 1997. In the ﬁ  rst decade of the 2000s, the Book C  a  dillac Hotel received a $200 million renovation, but the Lafayette fell into a greater state of disrepair. I took this photograph in October 2008, the same month that a po  r  tion of the Lafayette fell off the building to the street below. In 2009, the Detroit City Council voted to demolish the Lafayette, and in 2010, the city tore down the building.  
  The Lafayette is not the only building on the chopping block in Detroit. The 
mayor of Detroit a  n  nounced a plan in 2010 to demolish 10,000 abandoned build-ings and houses in D  e  troit by 2014.  c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 289  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 289  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  Geographers are leading the study of cities today through the application 
of scale, globalization, and p  o  litical economy to the city and urbanized spaces. 
Urban geographer Edward Soja urges scholars to think of ci  t  ies, including Detroit, as integral to the development of societies and to change, not as stages upon which humans act. Soja deﬁ  nes   synekism   as the “conditions that derive from 
dwelling together in a partic  u  lar home place or space” (2003, 273). As a result of people dwelling together in cities, a set of conditions occur that make change possible. To Soja, cities do not simply reﬂ  ect changing economies and politics. Rather, cities create the conditions necessary for economies and politics to change.  
   Using the concept of synekism, Grand Circus Park and the Lafayette 
Building in Detroit are not merely reﬂ  ections of the changing political economy 
of Detroit. This block of buildings and the larger city of Detroit created the con-ditions necessary for industrial production to expand to the global scale and are creating the conditions necessary for portions of Detroit to r  e  bound.  
   In our study of urban geography in this chapter, we study the city spatially, 
looking at the forms of cities around the world, the role of people in building and shaping c  i  ties, and changes in cities over space and time.  c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 290  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 290  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 When and Why Did People Start Living in Cities? 291
  Key Questions For Chapter 9  
   1.   When and why did people start living in cities?  
   2.   Where are cities located and why?  
   3.   How are cities organized, and how do they function?  
   4.   How do people shape cities?  
   5.   What role do cities play in globalization?  
  WHEN AND WHY DID PEOPLE START 
LIVING IN CITIES?  
  Worldwide, more people live in urban areas than 
in rural areas today. China, a traditionally rural coun-
try, reached the point where more than 50 percent of its population lived in urban areas in 2010. According to Ch  i  na’s census, the country was 36.1 percent urban 
in 2000. The rapid urbanization of China is due to the migration of millions of people from rural to urban areas since ec  o  nomic liberalization began in 1979.  
  Urban   refers to the built up space of the cen-
tral city and suburbs. Urban areas include   the city and 
 surrounding environs connected to the city. An urban 
place is distinctively nonrural and nona  g  ricultural.  
  For the vast majority of human history, the world 
was largely rural. From the beginnings of human society 
to about 3000 BC, less than 1 percent of people lived in urban areas. With cities established in Mesopot  a  mia, the 
Nile River, Mesoamerica, and Asia, the proportion of the world’s population living in cities rose “only slightly.”  
  After the start of the Industrial Revolution in the 
mid-1700s in Great Britain, urbanization exploded “when 
some states such as Great Britain and the Netherlands became predominantly urban for the ﬁ  rst time” (Soja 
2010, 376).   In western Europe, the United States, Canada, 
and Japan, four out of ﬁ  ve people live in ci  t  ies or towns 
(Fig. 9.3). In China, the ﬁ  gure is ﬁ  ve out of ten, and in 
India, the country’s 2011 census reported nearly 7 out of ten living in rural areas.  
  The agglomeration of people, services, and goods 
in cities affords people the luxury of time to innovate. 
Ci  t  ies are centers of political power and industrial 
might, higher education and technological innovation, 
artistic achievement, and medical advances. They are the great markets, centers of specialization and interac-tion, sources of news and information, suppliers of ser-vices, and providers of sports and entertainment. Ci  t  ies 
are the anchors and instigators of modern culture; urban 
systems and their spokes form the structural skeleton of soc  i  ety. A city is an agglomeration of people and build-
ings clustered together to serve as a center of politics, 
culture, and ec  o  nomics.    In the modern world, urbanization can happen quite 
quickly. A rural area or a small town can be transformed 
into a major metropolitian area. During the latter part of the twentieth century, the Chinese government a  n  nounced 
a major economic development project in Guangdong, a province in southern China. The Chinese government established a special economic zone (SEZ) in Guangdong Province, and business and industry mushroomed. The small ﬁ  shing vi  l  lage of Shenzhen in Guangdong Province 
is adjacent to Hong Kong. Hundreds of industries moved from Hong Kong to Shenzhen to take advantage of lower labor costs. The small ﬁ  shing village of Shenzhen experi-enced extraordinary growth as its population, rus  h  ing to 
the area to ﬁ  nd work, swelled from 20,000 to 8 million 
in just three decades. Shenzhen was quickly transformed: sk  y  scrapers now tower where thatch houses, rice paddies, 
and duck ponds once stood (Fig. 9.4).  
  The urbanization that can happen so quickly today 
took thousands of years to develop originally; indeed, the 
rise of the city is a very recent phenomenon in human his-tory. Human communities have existed for over 100,000 years, but more than 90,000 years passed before people began to cluster in towns. Archae  o  logical evidence indi-
cates that people established the ﬁ  rst cities about 8000 
years ago. However, only in the last 200 years did cities begin to r  e  semble their modern size and structure.  
  The Hearths of Urbanization  
  The switch from hunting and gathering to agriculture 
occurred prior to urbanization. Archaeologists ﬁ  nd evi-
dence of early agriculture between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago. Archaeologists agree that the ﬁ  rst cities came 
“several millennia” after the origins of agriculture (Smith 2009). Geographers Edward Soja and Peter T aylor argue that the ﬁ  rst cities came before agriculture, and they cite the 12,000-year-old settlement of Catal Huyuk as evi-dence (Fig. 9.5). Archaeologists see Catal Huyuk as an agricultural village, not a city.  
  Agricultural villages were relatively small in size 
and in population. Everyone living in an agricultural 
 vi  l  lage was involved in agriculture, and the people lived 
at near-subsistence levels, producing just enough to get by. c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 291  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 291  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
292 Chapter 9  Urban Geography
The dwellings in ancient agricultural villages were about 
the same size and contained about the same nu  m  ber of 
possessions, reﬂ  ecting the egalitarian nature (sharing of 
goods in common among the people) of the s  o  cieties liv-
ing in these early villages. The populations were perma-nent, reﬂ  ected in the dwelling units where people moved 
rocks in, built permanent structures, and laid out ﬂ  oors 
made of plaster. Egalitarian s  o  cieties pe  r  sisted long after 
agriculture began.  
  Scholars are fairly certain that these descriptors accu-
rately depict the agricultural villages in the ﬁ  rst agr  i  cul-
tural hearth, the area of Southwest Asia called the Fertile 
Crescent. Additional archaeological evidence portrays agricultural villages in the later hearths of agricultural 60°

also ﬁ  tting these descriptors. When people establish cit-ies, however, these descri  p  tors become inaccurate. In cit-
ies, people generate personal material wealth, trade over long distances, live in stratiﬁ  ed classes that are usually 
reﬂ ected in the housing, and engage in a diversity of eco-
nomic activ  i  ties—not just agricu  l  ture.  
  T wo components enabled cities to stabilize and 
grow: agricultural surplus and social stratiﬁ  cation.  
A  r  chaeologists, anthropologists, and geographers have 
studied the remains and records of the ﬁ  rst cities, creating 
numerous theories as to how cities came about. Most agree that some series of events led to the formation of an agricul-tural surplus and a leadership class; which came ﬁ  rst varies by c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 292  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 292  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

theory. The series of events spurring these two components 
also varies by theory. One theory maintains that advances in tec  h  nology such as irrigation generated an agricultural sur-
plus, and a leadership class formed to control the surplus and 
the technology that produced it. Another theory holds that a king or priest-king centra  l  ized polit  i  cal power and then 
demanded more labor to generate an agricultural surplus, 
which would help the r  u  ler retain political power.  
  Regardless of how the leadership class was established, 
we do know that once established, it helped generate the sur-
plus and facilitated that control of its distribution. The link between the surplus and the le  a  dership class is clear in early 
cities, where the home of the leaders was often positioned 
close to the grain storage. The leadership class, or urban elite, consisted of a group of decision makers and organi  z-
  ers who controlled the resources, and often the lives, of oth-
ers. The urban elite controlled the food su  p  ply, i  n  cluding 
its production, storage, and distribution. Generating an 
agricultural surplus enabled some people to devote their efforts to pursuits besides agriculture. The urban elite, for instance, did not work the ﬁ  elds. Rather, they devoted time to other pursuits such as religion and philosophy. Out of such pu  r  suits came the concepts of writing and recordkeep-
ing. Writing made possible the codiﬁ  cation of laws and the 
preservation of traditions. Urban elites defended themselves by constructing walls on the ou  t  skirts of the city. However, 
the leadership class collected taxes and tribute from people 
within their co  n  trol beyond the city walls.  20° 20°

1Some scholars argue that there are fewer than ﬁ  ve hearths and attribute 
more urbanization to diffusion.  Some cities grew out of agricultural villages, and 
others grew in places previously unoccupied by sed-
entary people. The innovation of the city is called the ﬁ rst urban revolution, and it occurred independently 
in six separate hearths, a case of independent inven-tion  
1   (Fig. 9.6). In each of the urban hearths, people 
b  e  came engaged in economic activities beyond agricul-
ture, including specialty crafts, the military, trade, and 
 go  v  ernment.  
  The six urban hearths are tied closely to the hearths 
of agriculture. The ﬁ  rst hearth of agriculture, the Fertile 
Crescent, is the ﬁ  rst place archaeologists ﬁ  nd evidence 
of cities, dating to about 3500 bce. This urban hearth is called Mesopotamia, referring to the region of great cit-
ies (such as Ur and Babylon) located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Studies of the cultural landscape and urban morphology of Mesopotamian cities have found signs of social inequality in the varying sizes and ornamentation of houses. Urban elite erected p  a  laces, 
protected themselves with walls, and employed countless 
artisans to beautify their spaces. They also e  s  tablished a 
priest-king class and developed a religious-political ide-
ology to support the priest-kings. Rulers in the cities were both priests and kings, and they levied taxes and demanded tribute from the harvest brought by the agr  i-
  cultural laborers.    Archaeologists, often teaming up with anthro-
pologists and geographers, have learned much about the 
ways ancient Mesopotamian cities functioned by study-ing the urban morphology of the cities. The ancient Mes  o  potamian city was usually protected by a mud wall 
surrounding the entire community, or sometimes a clu  s  ter 
of temples and shrines at its center. T emples dominated the urban landscape, not only because they were the larg-est structures in town but also b  e  cause they were built on 
artiﬁ cial mounds often over 100 feet (30 meters) high.  
  In Mesopotamia, priests and other authorities 
resided in substantial buildings, many of which might c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 294  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 294  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

be called palaces. Ordinary citizens lived in mud-walled 
houses packed closely together and separated only by na  r  row lanes. Lining the narrow lanes, craftspeople 
set up their workshops. The informal urban housing of Mes  o  potamia surrounded well-planned central cities.  
  The second hearth of urbanization is the Nile River 
Valley, dating back to 3200 bce. The interrelatio  n  ship 
between urbanization and irrigation in this region dis-
tinguishes it from other urban hearths. The might of the rulers of the Nile River Valley is reﬂ  ected in the feats of architecture such as the great pyramids, tombs, and sphinx. T raditional theories hold that slaves built these feats of engineering, but more recent theories in archaeol-ogy claim that ordinary citizens built ancient monuments as part of their tax pa  y  ment.  
  The third urban hearth, dating to 2200 bce, is the 
Indus River Valley, another place where agriculture likely 
diffused from the Fertile Crescent. Unable to decipher ancient Indus writing, scholars are puzzled by H  a  rappa and 
Mohenjo-Daro, the ﬁ  rst cities of the Indus River Valley 
(Fig. 9.7). The intricate planning of the cities points to the 
existence of a leadership class, but the houses continued to be equal in size, with no palaces or monuments appear-ing in the cities. In addition, all the dwellings in the cities had access to the same infr  a  structure, including wastewa-
ter drains and carefully maintained stone-lined wells. The 
cities had thick walls, and the di  s  covery of coins from as far 
away as the Mediterranean found at the gateways to these 
walls points to si  g  niﬁ cant trade over long distances.    The fourth urban hearth arose around the conﬂ  u-
ence of the Huang He (Y ellow) and Wei  (Yangtzi) Valleys 
of present-day China, dating to 1500 bce. The Chinese 
purposefully planned their ancient cities to ce  n  ter on a 
vertical structure in the middle of the city and then built 
an inner wall around it. Within the inner wall, the pe  o  ple 
of this hearth typically placed temples and palaces for the 
leadership class. The urban elite of the Huang He and Wei region demonstrated their power by building enormous, elaborate structures. Around 200 bce, the E  m  peror Qin Xi 
Huang directed the building of the Great Wall of China. 
Like the Egyptians, he also had an elab  o  rate mausoleum 
built for himself. An estimated 700,000 laborers worked 
for over 40 years to craft the intricate faces and weapons, horses, and chariots of an army of over 7000 terracotta warriors who stand guard over his burial place (Fig. 9.8).  
  Chronologically, the ﬁ  fth urban hearth is 
Mesoamerica, dating to 1100 bce. The ancient cities of 
Mes  o  america were religious centers. The Olmec built cit-
ies, including San Lorenzo, on the Gulf Coast of Me  x  ico. 
The Olmec carved stone monuments, and archeaologists believe they moved the volcanic stones 50 miles from the interior of Mexico to the coast. The Olmec civilization died out, but based on cultural teachings of the Olmec, the Maya built cities in the same region also centered on religious temples (including Tikal, Chichén-Itzá, U  x  mal, 
and Copán in Fig. 9.9).

Chavín built cities in Peru dating to 900 bce. The larg-
est settlement, Chavín, was sited at an elevation of 10,530 
feet in the Andean highlands.  
  The Role of the Ancient City in Society  
  Ancient cities not only were centers of religion and 
power, but also served as economic nodes. Cities were the chief marketplaces and bases from which wealthy merchants, land and livestock owners, and traders o  p  er-
ated. As educational centers, residents of cities included 
teachers and philosophers. They also had hand  i  craft 
industries that attracted the best craftspeople and inve  n-
  tors. In all of these roles, ancient cities were the anchors 
of culture and society, the focal points of power, author-ity, and change.  
  How large were the ancient cities? We have only 
estimates because it is impossible to judge from excavated 
ruins the dimensions of a city at its height or the number of people who might have occupied each reside  n  tial unit. 
By modern standards, the ancient cities were not large. The cities of Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley may have had between 10,000 and 15,000 inhabitants after nearly 2000 years of growth and deve  l  opment. That, scholars 
conclude, is about the maximum sustainable size based on existing systems of food production, gathering, dis-tribution, and social organization, These urban places were geographical exce  p  tions in an overwhelmingly rural 
world. The modern city we know today did not emerge until several tho  u  sand years la  t  er.  
  Diffusion of Urbanization  
  Urbanization diffused from Mesopotamia in several direc-
tions. Populations in Mesopotamia grew with the steady food supply and a sedentary lifestyle. People migrated out from the hearth, diffusing their knowledge of agriculture and urbanization. Diffusion from Mesopotamia happened early, even before agriculture deve  l  oped independently in 
some other hearths. In fact, urbanization diffused to the Mediterranean from Mesop  o  tamia (and perhaps the Nile 
River Valley) more than 3500 years ago, at about the same time cities were d  e  veloping in the hearth of the Huang 
He and long before cities originated in Mesoamerica.  H

  Greek Cities  
  Greece is not an urban hearth because agriculture and 
urbanization diffused to Greece from Mesopotamia, r  a  ther 
than being independently innovated in Greece. Greece 
is more accurately described as a   secondary hearth   of 
urbanization because the Greek city form and function dif-
fused around the world centuries later through European colonialism. Greek cities began more than 3500 years ago, when the city of Knossos on the island of Crete became the cornerstone of a system of towns in the Minoan civiliz  a  tion.  
  By 500 bce, Greece had become one of the most 
highly urbanized areas on Earth. The urban  i  zation of 
Ancient Greece ushered in a new stage in the evolution of 
cities. At its height, Ancient Greece enco  m  passed a net-
work of more than 500 cities and towns, not only on the mainland but also on the many Greek islands. Se  a  farers 
connected these urban places with trade routes and carried the notion of urban life throughout the Mediterranean region. Athens and Sparta, often vying with each other for power, soon b  e  came Greece’s leading cities. Athens may 
have been the largest city in the world at the time, with an est  i  mated 250,000 i  n  habitants.  
  With the hilly topography of Greece, the people 
had no need to build earthen mounds on which to perch 
temples; these were provided by nature. Every city had its acropolis (acro   /H11005   high point, polis   /H11005   city), on which 
the people built the most impressive structures—usually 
religious buildings. The Parthenon of At  h  ens remains the 
most famous of all, surviving to this day despite nearly 2500 
years of war, earth tremors, vanda  l  ism, and environmental 
impact (Fig. 9.10). Building this magniﬁ  cent columned 
structure, designed by the Athenian architect-engineer 
Phidias, began in 447 bce, and its rows of tapering columns 
have i  n  spired arch  i  tects ever since.  
  Like the older Southwest Asian cities, Greece’s cities 
also had public places. In the Southwest Asian towns these 
seem to have been rather cramped, crowded, and bustling with activity, but in Ancient Greece they were open, spa-cious squares, often in a low part of town with steps lead-ing down to them (Fig. 9.11). On these steps the Greeks debated, lectured, judged each ot  h  er, planned military 
campaigns, and socialized. As time went on, this public space called the agora (meaning market) also became the 
focus of commercial a  c  tivity.  
  Greece’s cities also had excellent theaters. The 
aristocracy attended plays and listened to philosophical 
di  s  courses, but for many people life in a Greek city was 
miserable. Housing was no better than it had been in the Mesopotamian cities thousands of years earlier. Sanitation and health conditions were poor. And much of the gran-deur designed by Greece’s urban planners was the work of hundreds of thousands of slaves.  
  As a secondary urban hearth, the Greek city had 
global impact. Urbanization diffused from Greece to the 
Roman Empire. Roman urbanization and urban culture diffused through western Europe. The city declined in Europe for a time after the fall of the Roman Empire, but Eur  o  peans eventually carried Western concepts of city 
life (drawn from Greece and Rome) around the world through colonialism and capitalism. From Washington, D.C., to Canberra, Australia, the urban landscape shows the imprints of Greco-Roman urban culture.  
  Roman Cities  
  The great majority of Greece’s cities and towns were 
located near the Mediterranean Sea on peninsulas and islands and linked by sea routes. When the Romans suc-ceeded the Greeks (and Etruscans) as rulers of the r  e  gion, 
their empire incorporated not only the Mediterranean 
shores but also a large part of interior Europe and North Africa (Fig. 9.12). The Roman urban system was the largest yet—much larger than Greece’s domain. The capital, Rome, served as the apex of a hierarchy of settle-ments ranging from small villages to large cities. The Romans linked these places with an extensive transpor-tation network that included hu  n  dreds of miles of roads, 
well-established sea routes, and trading ports along the 
roads, sea, and rivers. R  o  man regional planners dis-
played a remarkable capacity for choosing the site of cit-
ies, for identifying sui  t  able locales for settlements. The 
site of a city is its absolute location, often chosen for its 
advanta  g  es in trade or defense, or as a center for reli-
gious practice.  c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 298  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 298  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 When and Why Did People Start Living in Cities? 299
  The   situation   of a city is based on its role in the 
larger, surrounding context. The site of a city is based on 
an absolute location, such as at the head of navigation of a river or where two rivers converge.   The   situation   of 
a city is its relative location, its place in the region and 
world around it.   The situation of a city changes with the 
times. For example, Rome was the center of the Roman 
Empire, but when the Roman Empire dissolved, the sit-uation of Rome changed, as well. It developed into the center of the Roman Cath  o  lic Church, a role it still plays 
today. But during the Renaissance when Florence ﬂ  our-
ished and during the Industrial Rev  o  lution when Naples 
and points north of Rome grew economically, the situa-
tion of Rome within Italy as a whole shifted. It no longer was the scientiﬁ  c, political and economic focal point of 
the country.  
  Romans were greatly inﬂ  uenced by the Greeks, as 
is evident in Roman mythology and visible in the cul-
tural landscape and   urban morphology   of Roman cities. 
The urban morphology of a city is the layout of the city,

Field Note
“There can be few spaces of greater signiﬁ  cance 
to the development of Western civilization than 
the Roman Forum. This was the nerve center of a vast empire that transformed the face of western Europe, Southwest Asia, and North Africa. It was also the place where the decisions were made that carried forward Greek ideas about gover-nance, art, urban design, and technology. The very organization of space found in the Roman Forum is still with us: rectilinear street patterns; distinct buildings for legislative, executive, and judicial functions; and public spaces adorned with statues and fountains.”

colonial cities in a rectangular grid pattern, and R  o  mans 
adopted this plan wherever surface conditions made it 
possible.  
  When we add the purpose or use of buildings to the 
map of the morphology of a city, we reveal the   fun  c  tional 
zonation   of the city. The functional zonation reveals 
how different areas or segments of a city serve di  f  ferent 
purposes or functions within the city. For example, the 
Romans took the Greek acropolis (zone of reli  g  ion and 
center of power) and agora (zone of public space and the marketplace) and combined them into one zone: the Forum, which served as the focal point of Roman public life (Fig. 9.13).  
  In Rome, the Forum includes the world’s ﬁ  rst great 
stadium, the Colosseum, which was a much grander ve  r-
  sion of the Greek theater. Before crowds of thousands of 
onlookers, Roman gladiators fought each other or killed wild animals imported from Africa in the Colosseum. After Christianity diffused to Rome, but before the Roman E  m  pire adopted Christianity, Romans even 
forced Christians into the Colosseum where hungry 
lions attacked and ate them. All Roman cities of any size had an arena like the Colosseum where compet  i  tions, 
war games, cer  e  monies, and other public events took 
place.  
  Throughout the Roman Empire, cities were places 
of cultural contrasts. What still stands in ruins in many 
places around the Mediterranean are monumental build-ings, impressive villas, spacious avenues, ingenious aqu  e  ducts and baths, and sewage systems built of stone 
and pipe (Fig. 9.14). What we can no longer see in the ruins of the empire are the thousands of slaves who built these structures (estimates are between one-third and two-thirds of the population of the empire was enslaved) and the wretchedly poor who were crammed into over-crowded tenements and lived in ﬁ  lth. The city of the 
Roman Empire, like the city of today, was home to both c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 300  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 300  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

rich and poor and reﬂ  ected both the greatest achieve-
ments and the worst failings of civilization.  
  Urban Growth after Greece and Rome  
  After the Roman Empire fell in 495 ce, Europe entered an 
era historians called the Middle Ages, which spanned from about 500 to 1300 (or later in parts of Europe). During the ﬁ  rst two-thirds of this period in Europe, little urban 
growth occurred, and in some parts of the continent, urbanism went into sharp decline. The urban growth that did take place during this time o  c  curred on sites of oases 
and resting places along the Silk Route between Europe and Asia. Many of these places grew into towns, and some, such as Bukhara and Samarqand, became major cities. In Asia, Chinese styles of city-building diffused into Korea and Japan, with Seoul beco  m  ing a full-ﬂ  edged city by 
1200 and Kyoto, Japan’s historic capital, growing rapidly after the turn of the ninth century.  
  During Europe’s Middle Ages, urbanization contin-
ued vigorously outside of Europe. In West Africa, trading 
cities developed along the southern margin of the Sahara. By 1350, Timbuktu (part of Mali today) was a m  a  jor 
city—a seat of government, a university town, a market, and a religious center. The Americas also e  x  perienced sig-
niﬁ cant urban growth during Europe’s Middle Ages, espe-
cially within the Mayan and Aztec empires (Fig. 9.15). The largest pre-Columbian city in the Americas was in the Aztec Empire on the Mex  i  can Plateau. The Aztec cap-
ital of T enochtitlán had nearly 100,000 inhabitants when many European cities lay in ruins.    Site and Situation during European Exploration  
  Early Eurasian urban areas extended in a crescent-
shaped zone across Eurasia from England in the west to J  a  pan in the east, including the cities of London, Paris, 
Venice, Constantinople (Istanbul today), and T abriz, 
S  a  marqand, Kabul, Lahore, Amra, Jaunpur, Xian, 
Anyang, Kyoto and Osaka. Before European explora-
tion, most cities in the world were sited on trade routes in the interiors of continents, not just in Eurasia, but also in West Africa and indigenous America. Interior trade routes such as the Silk Route and the caravan routes of West A  f  rica sustained these inland cities and, in many 
cases, helped them prosper.  
  The relative importance of the interior trade routes 
changed, however, when European maritime exploration 
and overseas colonization ushered in an era of oceanic, worldwide trade. With this shift, the situation of ci  t  ies like 
Paris and Xian changed from being crucial in an interior trading route to being left out of an oceanic trade.  
  After European exploration took off during the 
1400s, the dominance of interior cities declined. Other 
ci  t  ies, sited on coasts, gained prominence as their situ-
ations changed. In Asia, coastal cities such as Bombay 
(now Mumbai, India), Madras (Chennai, India), Malacca (Malaysia), Batavia (Jakarta, Indonesia), and T okyo ( J  a  pan) came to the fore. Exploration and oceanic 
trade refocused the situations of cities in West Africa 
as well. Before 1500, urbanization in West Africa was concentrated in a belt extending along the southern margin of the Sahara, including such cities as Timbuktu (Mali), Niani (Guinea), Gao (Mali), Zaria (Nigeria), Kano (Nigeria), and Maiduguri (Nigeria). Here, cross-desert caravan trafﬁ  c met boat trafﬁ  c on the River Niger (where “camel met canoe”), and people exchanged goods from northern deserts for goods from coastal fo  r  ests. Maritime trade di  s  rupted this pattern of trade: 
coastal ports became the leading markets and centers of 
power, and the African ci  t  ies of the interior began a long 
decline.  
  Coastal cities remained crucial after exploration led 
to colonialism. During the colonial p  e  riod key cities in 
international trade networks included the coastal cities of 
Cape T own (South Africa), Lima-Callao (Peru), and New Y ork City.  
  The trade networks European powers commanded 
(including the slave trade) brought u  n  precedented 
riches to Europe’s burgeoning medieval cities, such 
as Amsterdam (the Netherlands), London (England), Lisbon (Portugal), Liverpool (England), and Seville (Spain). Successful merchants built ornate mansions, patro  n  ized the arts, participated in city governance, 
and supported the reconstruction of city centers. As a 
result, cities that thrived during mercantilism took on similar properties whether it was Antwerp (Belgium), c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 301  10/3/11  9:12 PM user f-400c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 301  10/3/11  9:12 PM user f-400 F-400F-400

C  o  penhagen (De  n  mark), Lisbon (Portugal), or Genoa 
(Italy). A central square became the focus of the city, 
fronted by royal, religious, public, and private buildings evincing wealth and prosperity, power and inﬂ    u  ence (Fig. 
9.16). Streets leading to these central squares formed 
arteries of commerce, and the beginnings of “down-towns” emerged.  
  During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, 
European mercantile cities became the nodes of a widen-
ing network of national, regional, and global commerce. So wealthy and powerful were the merchants that, su  p-
  ported by their rulers, they were able to found and expand 
settlements in distant lands. Cities such as Dakar (Senegal), Lourenco Marques (now Maputo, Moçambique), and Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam) were endowed with the ornate trappings of the mercantile cities of Europe, including elaborately inlaid sidewalks, tree-lined avenues, and neo-Gothic architecture.  
  The Second Urban Revolution  
  During the last decades of the eighteenth century, the 
Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain. None of E  u  rope’s cities was prepared for what lay ahead: an ava-
lanche of changes that ripped the fabric of urban life. Around 1800, western Europe was still overwhelmingly rural. As thousands migrated to the cities with i  n  dustr  i-
  alization, cities had to adapt to the mushrooming popu-
lation, the proliferation of factories and supply facilities, the expansion of transport sy  s  tems, and the construction 
of tenements for the growing labor force.  
  A Second Agricultural Revolution  
  Before the second urban revolution could take place, a 
second revolution in agriculture was necessary. Du  r  ing 
the late seventeenth century and into the eighteenth cen-tury, Europeans invented a series of important improv  e-
  ments in agriculture, including the seed drill, hybrid 
seeds, and improved breeding practices for livestock. The second agricultural revolution also improved orga-nization of production, market collabor  a  tion, and stor-
age c  a  pacities. Agricultural laborers migrated to cities in 
hopes of obtaining jobs in the formal economy, which i  n  cluded wages usable in the growing cash-based econo-
mies of Europe. Manufacturers tapped into the new labor force and expanded industrial production (for a further discussion of industrializ  a  tion, see Chapter 12).  
  Not all mercantile cities turned into industrial cities. 
Many industrial cities grew from small villages or along 
canal and river routes. The primary determinant in the location of early industrial cities was proximity to a power source. For textile manufacturing, industrial cities had to be sited near fresh water sources to power the w  a  ter 
loom. In Great Britain, industrial cities involved in textile manufacturing were located in the Pennines, where fresh water ﬂ  owed down the hillsides. Industrial cities involved in iron manufacturing were located around Birmingham Field Note
“The contemporary landscape of Genoa stands as a reminder of the city’s historic importance. Long before Europe became divided up into states, a number of cities in northern Italy freed themselves from the strictures of feudalism and began to function autonomously. Genoa and Venice were two of these, and they became the foci of signiﬁ  cant Mediterranean maritime trad-ing empires. In the process, they also became magniﬁ  cent, wealthy cities. Although most build-
ings in Genoa’s urban core date from a more recent era, the layout of streets and public squares harkens back to the city’s imperial days. Is it a surprise that the city gave birth to one of the most famous explorers of all time: Christo-pher Columbus?”

and Coalbroo  k  dale, easily accessible to Britain’s coal and 
iron ore ﬁ  elds.  
  When industrialization diffused from Great Britain 
to the European mainland, the places most ready for 
i  n  dustrialization had undergone their own second agricul-
tural revolution, had surplus capital from mercantilism and 
colonialism, and were located near coal ﬁ  elds (Fig. 9.17).  
  The Chaotic Industrial City  
  With industrialization, cities became unregulated jum-
bles of activity. Factories engulfed private homes. Open spaces became garbage dumps. Urban dwellers converted elegant housing into overcrowded slums. Sanit  a  tion sys-
tems failed, and water supplies were inadequate and often 
polluted. By the late 1800s, the Industrial Rev  o  lution had 
changed transportation signiﬁ  cantly. The steam engine, powered by coal, not only pumped water from mines for 
coal mining but also p  o  wered the railroad and steamship. 
The diffusion of the railroad gave cities that were not near 
coal ﬁ  elds the chance to industrialize. The central parts of cities like London, Paris, and Amste  r  dam retained their 
preindustrial shape. But with the diffusion of the railroad, 
railroad tracks knifed through long-stable neighborhoods.  
  Living conditions were dreadful for workers in cit-
ies, and working conditions were shocking. Children 
worked 12-hour shifts in textile mills, typically six days a week. In industrial cities, health conditions were worse than they had been in medieval times; the air was polluted and the water contaminated. The grimy, soot-covered cit-ies of the British Midlands were appropriately deemed the “black towns.” Few if any safety mech  a  nisms protected 
the laborers, and injuries were common.  
  In the mid-1800s, as Karl Marx and Frederick Engels

“workers of the world” to unite, conditions in European 
manufacturing cities gradually improved. I  n  dustrialists 
were forced to recognize workers’ rights, and gover  n-
  ments intervened by legislating workers’ rights and intro-
ducing city planning and zo  n  ing. Many manufacturing 
cities in North America never suffered as much as their European predecessors, although living and working conditions for factory workers (and “blue-collar” work-ers generally) were far from satisfactory. American manu-facturing cities did not alt  o  gether escape the problems of 
the European industrial cities. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the American manufactur-ing city grew rapidly, often with inadequate planning and rapid immigr  a  tion leading to the d  e  velopment of slums 
and ghettoes.  
  During the second half of the twentieth century, the 
nature of manufacturing changed, as did its location: cities 
repositioned many factories away from congested, over-crowded, expensive urban areas. Comp  a  nies simply aban-
doned large manufacturing plants, making “rust belts” out of once-thriving industrial di  s  tricts. Many of these plants 
still stand today, overgrown by weeds, with broken win-dows and cracking walls (Fig. 9.18).  
  Although factories and factory jobs are not perma-
nent, the urbanization that went along with indu  s  trializa-
tion is still apparent. Depending on the sometimes vari-
able deﬁ  nition of “urban,” western Europe t  o  day is more 
than 80 percent urb  a  nized, and urbanization has become a 
global phenomenon. Worldwide, more people now live in cities than in rural areas.  
  Archaeologists have found that the houses in Indus River cit-ies, such as Mohenjo-Daro and H  a  rappa, were a uniform size: each house had access to a sewer system, and p  a  laces were absent from the cultural landscape. Derive a theory as to why these conditions were present in these cities that had both a leadership class and a surplus of agricultural goods.  
  WHERE ARE CITIES LOCATED AND WHY?  
  When you look at a map in an atlas of the United 
States or Canada, or at a road map of a State or pro  v  ince, 
you see an array of places of different sizes, with varying 
distances between them. The map looks like a ju  m  ble, yet 
each place is where it is because of some decision, some perception of the site or its situation. Site and situation help explain why certain cities were planned and why cit-ies thrive or fail. T o understand why a conglomeration of Field Note
“The Ruhr Valley long functioned as the incubator of Germany’s industrial economy. Largely destroyed during World War II, the Ruhr rose again to help Germany back to recovery. But as declining transportation costs and ris-ing labor costs prompted heavy industries to move their operations to other parts of the world, factories such as this iron and steel mill on the edge of Duisburg fell silent. Unemployment soared, and the area became depressed. In an effort to rebound, local authorities are now trying to turn a few of these relics into tourist destinations. They are unlikely to compete with the great churches or medieval palaces found elsewhere in Germany, but for the geogra-pher they provide fascinating insights into the urban and economic arrangements that made modern Europe what it is today.”

cities is distributed across space the way it is and why cities 
are different sizes, it is nece  s  sary to examine more than 
one city at a time and see how those cities ﬁ  t together, into the region, into the state, and into the globe as a whole.  
  Urban geographers studied the distribution of cities 
in Europe and the Americas during the 1900s, using quan-
titative techniques to determine how many cities and what size cities are needed within a certain space. In studying the size of cities and distances between them, urban geog-raphers explored the trade areas of di  f  ferent size cities. 
Every city and town has a trade area, an adjacent region within which its inﬂ  uence is dominant. Customers from smaller towns and villages come to the city to shop and to conduct other bus  i  ness. An o  n  line survey of approxi-
mately 50,000 people helped one armchair geographer create a map of trade areas for the co  n  tiguous United 
States (Fig. 9.19). The city’s newspapers are read, and its television stations are watched in the surrounding region (Fig. 9.20).  
  Across the multitude of quantitative studies in urban 
geography, three key components arose frequently: popu-
lation, trade area, and distance. The simplest way to think through the relationship among these three var  i  ables is 
to consider your State or province map. On the map, you will see many villages with unfamiliar names, a number of small towns sited on highways, several medium-sized cities where transportation routes converge, and likely one familiar, d  o  minant city. The largest city has the larg-
est trade area, and as a result fewer places rival it as the major trade area: the several medium-sized cities trade in smaller areas of co  m  merce and are scattered apart from 
the major city, small towns house the grocery stores and other necess  i  ties, and ﬁ  nally villages may still have a café 
or a gas station. The trade areas and population combine to give us a hierarchy of urban places, following a pattern commonly called the rank-size rule.  
  Rank and Size in the Urban Matrix  
  The rank-size rule holds that in a model urban hierar-
chy, the population of a city or town will be inversely pro-portional to its rank in the hierarchy. Thus, if the largest city has 12 mi  l  lion people, the second largest will have St. GeorgeSeattle

Broken Arrow, Oklahoma
Many trade areas in the United States are named, and their names typically 
coincide with the vernacular region, the region people perceive themselves as living in. In promoting a trade area, companies often adopt, name, or shape the name of the vernacular region. In Oklahoma, the label Green Country refers to the northeastern quarter of the state, the trade area served by Tulsa. Tourism promoters derived the label in the 1970s, and the Tulsa media have used the name since. Promoters see the label as positive, implying Green Country is a landscape of forests, lakes, rivers, hills, and wealth—a perception that chal-lenges popular notions of Dust Bowl Oklahoma as a treeless, dry, ﬂ  at, windy, 
and impoverished region of the 1930s. Green Country’s popularity is conﬁ  rmed 
by the hundreds of businesses, organizations, and agencies that have adopted the name. In turn, the presence of the trade area name throughout the cultural landscape reinforces the vernacular region, strengthening the importance of the region in the minds of the people.

about 6 million (that is, half the population of the lar  g-
  est city); the third city will have 4 million (one-third); the 
fourth city 3 mi  l  lion; and so on. Note that the size differ-
ences between city levels become smaller at lower levels of the hierarchy, so that the tenth-largest city would have 1.2 million i  n  habitants.  
  Although German Felix Auerbach suggested the 
rank-size rule in 1913, linguist George Zipf is credited 
with establishing the mathematical equation for the rank-size rule in 1941. Since then, scholars across disciplines have tested the rule and questioned when the rule applies and when it does not. Studies in 1966, 1980, and again in 2002 found that the majority of countries they tested had populations with more even distrib  u  tions than the rank-
size rule would predict. Other recent studies have ques-tioned why the rank-size rule ﬁ  ts the cou  n  tries where it 
does ﬁ  t, and these studies have offered answers including 
a combination of random growth (chance) and economies of scale (e  f  ﬁ ciency).  
  The rank-size rule does not apply in all countries, 
especially countries with one dominant city. States often 
focus development in one particular city, such as the capi-tal city, thereby bolstering that city and its popul  a  tion 
above the rest of the cities in the state. In 1939, geogra-pher Mark Jefferson deﬁ  ned a primate city as “a cou  n  try’s 
leading city, always disproportionately large and excep-tionally expressive of national capacity and fee  l  ing.” He 
saw the primate city as the largest and most economically inﬂ uential within the state, with the next largest city in the 
state b  e  ing much smaller and much less inﬂ  uential.  
  Many former colonies have primate cities, as the 
colonial powers often ruled from a single dominant city, 
where economic and political activities were concen-trated. Examples of primate cities in former colonies include Me  x  ico City, Mexico and Manila, the Philippines. 
In the noncolonial context, London and Paris each serve as exa  m  ples of primate cities in the United Kingdom and 
France, respe  c  tively  .  
  Central Place Theory  
  Walter Christaller wrote the classic urban geography 
study to explain where cities, towns, and villages are likely 
to be located. In his book, The Central Places in Southern 
Germany (1933), Christaller laid the groundwork for cen-
tral place theory. He attempted to develop a model to pre-dict how and where central places in the urban hierarchy (hamlets, villages, towns, and cities) would be functionally and spatially di  s  tributed. Christaller began his theory of 
development with a set of assumptions: ﬁ  rst, the surface of 
the ideal region would be ﬂ  at and have no physical barriers; 
second, soil fertility would be the same everywhere; third, 
population and purchasing po  w  er would be evenly distrib-
uted; next, the region would have a uniform transportation 
network to permit direct tr  a  vel from each settlement to the 
other; and, ﬁ  nally, from any given place, a good or service 
could be sold in all directions out to a certain distance.  
  Through his studies, Christaller calculated the ideal 
central place system and then compared his model to 
real-world situations and tried to explain the variations and exceptions. In the u  r  ban hierarchy, the central places 
would be nested, so the largest central place provides the greatest number of functions to most of the region. Within the trade area of the largest central place, a series of larger towns would provide functions to several smaller 
306c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 306  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 306  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 Where Are Cities Located and Why? 307
places. The smaller places would then provide fewer cen-
tral functions to a smaller-yet se  r  vice area.  
  T o determine the locations of each central place, 
Christaller needed to deﬁ  ne the goods and services pr  o-
  vided. He studied the sale of goods and services and calcu-
lated the distance people would willingly travel to acquire them. Cities, he postulated, would be regularly spaced, with central places where the same product was sold at the same price located a standard distance apart. He reasoned that a person would not be e  x  pected to tr  a  vel 11 miles 
to one place to buy an item if it were possible to go only 9 miles to purchase it at another place. Central place theory maintains that each central place has a surround-ing complementary r  e  gion, an exclusive trade area within 
which the town has a monopoly on the sale of certain goods, because it alone can provide such goods at a given price and within a certain range of travel.  
  Hexagonal Hinterlands  
  Based on this description of Christaller’s theory, you may 
expect the shape of each central place’s trade area to be circular (bullseye shapes surrounding each place). But cir-cles either have to overlap or leave certain a  r  eas u  n  served. 
Hence, Christaller chose perfectly ﬁ  tted hexagonal 
regions as the shape of each trade area (Fig. 9.21).  
  Urban geographers were divided on the relevance 
of his model. Some saw hexagonal systems everywhere; 
others saw none at all. Christaller received support from geographers, who applied his ideas to regions in E  u  rope, 
North America, and elsewhere. In China, both the North China Plain and the Sichuan Basin display the seemingly uninterrupted ﬂ  atness assumed by Christaller’s model. 
When G. William Skinner e  x  amined the distribution 
of villages, towns, and cities there in 1964, he found a spatial pattern closely resembling the one pr  e  dicted by 
Christaller’s model. Studies in the U.S. Midwest sug-gested that while the square layout of the township-and-range system imposed a different kind of regularity on the landscape, the ec  o  nomic forces at work there tended to 
conﬁ rm Christaller’s theory.  
  Christaller recognized that not all his assumptions 
would be met in reality; physical barriers, uneven r  e  source 
distributions, and other factors all modify Christaller’s 
hexagons. Nonetheless, his model yielded a nu  m  ber of 
practical insights. His studies pointed to a hierarchy of urban places that are spatially balanced and also estab-lished that larger cities would be spaced farther from each other than smaller towns or villages. Although Christaller’s model of perfectly ﬁ  t hexagons is not often realized, his studies conﬁ  rm that the di  s  tribution of cities, 
towns, and vi  l  lages in a region is not an accident but is tied 
to trade areas, population size, and distance.  
  Central Places Today  
  When Christaller worked on his spatial model and pro-
jected central place theory to help explain the distrib  u-
  tion of urban areas, the world was a simpler and much less 
populated place than it is today. As many urban geogr  a-
  phers have pointed out during the debate that followed 
Christaller’s publications, new factors, forces, and cond  i  tions  Figure 9.21

not anticipated by his models and theories (including the 
Internet and the interstate system) make them less rel-evant today.  
  Geographer Larry Ford stresses that central place 
notions still have a role in explaining current develop-
ments. T ake, for example, the Sun Belt phenomenon of the past four decades—the movement of millions of Amer  i  cans from northern and northeastern States to the 
South and Southwest. This is not just an internal, volun-tary migration made possible by social security funds and retirement plans; it also results from deliberate gover  n-
  mental economic and social polices that favor “Sun Belt” 
cities through federal spending on military, space, and r  e  search facilities. And even as Northerners moved south-
ward, millions of Middle and South American migrants moved nort  h  ward—into the same urban centers already 
growing for domestic reasons.  
  The overall effect of all this movement was to create 
a changed urban hierarchy in the Sun Belt region. Central 
place theory would predict that some existing cities would respond by increasing their production of hig  h  er-order 
(technological) goods and services, increasing their eco-nomic reach and bypassing others. And this is what hap-pened: Atlanta, Dallas, and Phoenix became headquarters cities for large regions, mo  v  ing up in the urban hierarchy. 
Charlotte, T ampa, San Antonio, and T ucson also rose, but took secondary status. Other centers participated less in the new spatial economy and remained where they were in the u  r  ban hierarchy.  
  As Ford emphasized, central place theory can still 
add “analytical power to the understan  d  ing of patterns 
of urban growth, even in this era of fast and long-distance 
transportation, suburbanization, and multiple urban fun  c  tions.”  
  Sketch a map of your city or town and the cities or towns 
nearby. Make a list of the kinds of goods and se  r  vices avail-able in each of these towns. Do the ideas about central places presented in this section of the cha  p  ter apply to your region?  
  HOW ARE CITIES ORGANIZED, 
AND HOW DO THEY FUNCTION?  
  We all know that cities have certain features in 
common, and we use geographic terms to identify these 
fe  a  tures i  n  cluding downtowns, suburbs, industrial dis-
tricts, and shopping malls. Cities in various geographic regions of the world also have their own, distinct char-
acteristics. Mumbai, India, looks vastly different from Chicago, Ill  i  nois. T okyo, Japan, is distinct from Lagos, 
Nigeria. Cities in South America tend to be graced by 
often magniﬁ      cent plazas not common in Australia or 
Russia.  
  One way to conceptualize the layout of cities is 
through models that illustrate the structures of cities. 
Since the 1920s, urban geographers have studied, charted, and mapped cities to create models that describe the u  r  ban morphology, functional zonation, and overall lay-
out of cities in world regions.  
  City models reveal how cities are purposefully struc-
tured to perform the roles they have as centers of co  m-
  merce, education, transportation, industry, and gover-
nance. The form of cities also reﬂ  ects the historic, sp  a  tial, 
economic, cultural, and political processes that shaped cities in each world region.  
  In this section of the chapter, we discuss a number 
of models that urban geographers have drawn for cities. 
In the next section, we discuss the people and institutions that organize and shape c  i  ties.  
  Models of the City  
  Each model of the city, regardless of the region, is a study 
in   fun  c  tional zonation  —the division of the city into 
 certain regions (zones) for certain purposes (functions). 
Every city in the world is an assemblage of functional zones, orderly designed in some places and jumbled chaos in others. Zones of the city exist and play certain roles in the city’s life, whether to house residents, produce goods, educate students, or acco  m  modate gover  n  ment. Each 
zone or region is part of the larger city.  
  Globalization has created common cultural land-
scapes in the ﬁ  nancial districts of many world cities. 
Until little more than 30 years ago, Shanghai, China, was a vast, low-rise Chinese city centered on a col  o  nial-era 
riverfront with British and French architectural imprints 
that had e  n  dured for more than a century. T oday, you 
might mistake the ﬁ  nancial districts in downtown 
Shanghai for New Y ork City with its forest of skyscra  p-
  ers housing international corporations, banks, hotels, 
and hundreds of thousands of apartment dwellers. Y ou will also see the names of the same corporations and hotels on high-rise buildings in central Mumbai (India), Ban  g  kok (Thailand), Dubai (United Arab Emirates) and 
Singapore.  
  With globalization reﬂ  ected in cultural landscapes 
around the world, are regional models of cities no lon-
ger useful? Quite the opposite: they help us understand the processes that forged cities in the ﬁ  rst place and 
understand the impact of modern linkages and inﬂ  uences 
now chan  g  ing cities. In Shanghai, China, for example, c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 308  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 308  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Are Cities Organized, and How Do They Function?  309
the government chose to preserve the unique c  o  lonial 
riverfront architecture and develop around the colonial 
neighborhood and across the   Huangpu River  . In South 
America, cities are protecting historic plazas against mod-
ernization through regulations that limit high-rise devel-opment to areas outside of the plazas. The city of Paris protects the old city from development of high rises. Instead, Paris concentrates skyscraper development in the technology corridor called La Defense, which is located along the axis of the Avenue Charles de Gaulle a little over 3 miles from the Arc de T riomphe.  
  Models of cities give us context for understanding the 
history and geography of regions and major cities within 
them. Studying the location and interplay of zones within cities and the changing cultural lan  d  scape of cities helps us 
grasp the interplay between cities and globaliz  a  tion.  
  Functional Zones  
  Before examining the models of urban spaces, we must 
deﬁ ne some terms commonly used in referring to parts of 
the city. The term zone is typically pr  e  ceded by a descrip-
tor that conveys the purpose of that area of the city. The models describe zones as areas with a relatively uniform land use, for example, an industrial zone or a res  i  dential 
zone. Most models deﬁ  ne the key economic zone of the 
city (if there is such) as the   central business district   (CBD). 
The American CBD typically has high land values, tall 
buildings, busy trafﬁ  c, converging highways, and mass 
transit sy  s  tems.  
  The term central city describes the urban area that 
is not suburban. In effect, central city refers to the older 
city as opposed to the newer suburbs. A suburb is an out-
lying, functionally uniform part of an u  r  ban area, and is 
often (but not always) adjacent to the central city. Most suburbs are residential, but some have other land uses, including schools, shopping malls, and ofﬁ  ce parks.  
  Suburbanization is the process by which lands that 
were previously outside of the urban environment b  e  come 
urbanized, as people and businesses from the city move to 
these spaces. The process of suburbaniz  a  tion holds special 
interest for human geographers because it involves the transformation of large areas of land from rural to urban uses and affects large numbers of people who can afford to move to larger and more expensive suburban homes. The aesthetic of the suburb reveals the occupants’ ideal-ized living patterns b  e  cause their la  y  out can be planned in 
response to choice and demand.  
  In Contemporary Suburban America (1981), urban 
geographer P . O. Muller offered a thorough analysis of suburbanization, describing how suburbia “evolved into a self-sufﬁ  cient urban entity, containing its own m  a  jor 
economic and cultural activities, that is no longer an appendage to the central city.” Muller found subu  r  ban cities ready to compete with the central city for leading urban economic activities such as telecommun  i  cations, 
high-technology industries, and corporate headquarters. In addition to expanding residential zones, the process of su  b  urbanization rapidly creates distinct urban regions 
complete with industrial, commercial, and educational co  m  ponents.  
  The overall importance of suburban life in the 
United States is underscored by the results of the 2000 
census, which indicated that no less than 50 percent of the entire American population resided in the suburbs (up from 37 percent in 1970); the remaining 50 percent were divided b  e  tween the central cities (30.3 percent) and non-
metropolitan or rural areas (19.7 percent). Of the popu-lation living in metropolitan areas, 62.2 percent r  e  sided 
in the suburbs, which in 2000 had 141 million residents. Thus, the suburbs have become the essence of the mo  d  ern 
American city.  
  Just by using such terms as residential area and cen-
tral business district, people acknowledge the existence 
of a regional structure within cities. When you refer to downtown, or to the airport, or to the city zoo, you are in fact referring to urban regions where certain functions pr  e  vail (business activity, transportation, and recreation, 
in the three just mentioned). All of these urban regions or zones lie near or adjacent to each other and together make up the city. But how are they arranged?  
  Modeling the North American City  
  Urban geographers have constructed a succession of 
models that reﬂ  ect change and growth in the geographic layout of North American cities. The ﬁ  rst model, the concentric zone model (Fig. 9.22A), resulted from soc  i-
  ologist Ernest Burgess’s study of Chicago in the 1920s. 
Burgess’s model divides the city into ﬁ  ve concentric 
zones, d  e  ﬁ ned by their function. As the city grew, land 
was converted in zones around the outside of the city, 
and the co  n  centric zone model emerged. At the center 
is the CBD (1), itself subdivided into several subdistricts 
(ﬁ na  n  cial, retail, theater).  
  The zone of transition (2) is characterized by resi-
dential deterioration and encroachment by business and 
light manufacturing. Zone 3 is a ring of closely spaced but adequate homes occ  u  pied by the blue-collar labor 
force. Zone 4 consists of middle-class residences, and 
Zone 5 is the suburban ring. Burgess described his model as dynamic: as the city grew, inner zones encroached on outer ones, so that CBD functions invaded Zone 2 and the problems of Zone 2 a  f  fected the inner margins of 
Zone 3.  
  In the late 1930s, Homer Hoyt published his sector 
model (Fig. 9.22B), partly as an answer to the limitations 
of the Burgess model. Hoyt focused on residential patterns, c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 309  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 309  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
310 Chapter 9  Urban Geography
explaining where the wealthy in a city chose to live. Hoyt 
argued that the city grows outward from the center, so a low-rent area could extend all the way from the CBD to the city’s outer edge, creating zones that are shaped like a piece of pie. Hoyt found that the pie-shaped pieces describe the high-rent residential, intermediate rent resi-dential, low-rent residential, ed  u  cation and recreation, 
tran  s  portation, and industrial sectors.  
  Researchers studied both theories, and Chauncy 
Harris and Edward Ullman argued that neither the con-
ce  n  tric rings nor the sector model adequately reﬂ  ected 
city structure by the mid-twentieth century. In the 1940s, Harris and Ullman proposed the multiple nuclei model (Fig. 9.22 C). Their model recognizes that the CBD was losing its dominant position as the single nu  c  leus of the 
urban area. Several of the urban regions shown in the ﬁ  g-
ure have their own nuclei.  
  Most urban geographers think these models are 
too simplistic to describe the modern city. With the 
avai  l  ability of personal automobiles and the construc-
tion of ring roads and other art  e  ries around cities in the 1970s and 1980s, suburbanization exploded around new 
transport  a  tion corridors. The outer city grew rapidly and 
became more functionally independent of the central 
city, and suburban downtowns emerged to serve their new local economies. Often located near key freeway intersections, these suburban downtowns developed mainly around big regional shopping centers and attracted industrial parks, ofﬁ  ce complexes, hotels, res-ta  u  rants, entertainment facilities, and even sports stadi-
ums. They became edge cities. Edge cities such as 
T  y  sons Corner, Virginia (outside Washington, D.C.) and 
Irvine, California (outside Los Angeles) ﬂ  ourished. They 
attracted tens of thousands of nearby suburbanites—
offering workplaces, sho  p  ping, leisure activities, and all 
the other elements of a complete urban environment—
thereby loosening r  e  maining ties not only to the central 
city but to other suburban areas as well (Fig. 9.23). As 
early as 1973, American suburbs surpassed the central cities in total employment. By the mid-1980s, in some metropolises in the Sun Belt, the majority of jobs in the m  e  tropolis were in the suburbs.   Figure 9.22

 How Are Cities Organized, and How Do They Function?  311
  Modeling the Cities of the Global Periphery 
and Semiperiphery  
  Cities in the world with millions of inhabitants can now 
be counted in the hundreds; it therefore becomes increas-ingly difﬁ  cult to model, classify, or typify urban centers. In the 1960s, researchers classiﬁ  ed “col  o  nial” cities as urban 
areas where European transplants dominated the form of the city, laying it out with Western styles. Researchers also drew models of “indige  n  ous” cities that remained 
remote from globalizing inﬂ  uences and various forms of 
the Western city.  
  The rapid growth in population and territorial foot-
print of megacities in the developing world has made it 
difﬁ cult to apply city models. Primate cities in developing 
countries are called   m  e  gacities   when the city has a large 
population, a vast territorial extent, rapid in-migration, 
and a strained, inadequate infrastru  c  ture. For e  x  ample, 
Mumbai, India, has more people than the country of Australia. São Paulo, Brazil, covers more land than the country of Belgium. Kinshasa, The Congo, is the fastest growing city in Africa. Jakarta, Indonesia, is the largest city in the world without a su  b  way or metro system.  
  In Middle and South America, Mexico City (Mexico) 
and São Paulo (Brazil) are now the kinds of megac  i  ties that 
make analysis difﬁ  cult. Nonetheless, some cities located in 
South American countries once colonized by Spain have retained a common social-spatial geography. Also, some 
former colonial cities in Subsaharan Africa have mai  n-
  tained the spatial components lost in megacities like 
Lagos (Nigeria) and Kinshasa (The Congo).  
  The South American City  
  In 1980, geographers Ernst Grifﬁ  n and Larry Ford studied 
South American cities and derived a model of the South American city referred to as the Grifﬁ  n-Ford model. 
Grifﬁ  n and Ford found that South American ci  t  ies blend 
traditional elements of South American culture with the forces of globalization that are reshaping the urban scene, combining radial sectors and conce  n  tric zones.  
  Anchoring the model is the thriving CBD, which 
remains the city’s primary business, employment, and 
e  n  tertainment focus. The CBD is divided into a tradi-
tional market sector and a more modern high-rise sec-
tor. Adequate public transit systems and nearby afﬂ  u-
ent residential areas assure the dominance of the CBD. Emanating outward from the urban core along the city’s most prestigious axis is the commercial spine, which is su  r  rounded by the elite residential sector. This widening 
corridor is essentially an extension of the CBD. It features 
ofﬁ ces, sho  p  ping, high-quality housing for the upper and 
upper-middle classes, restaurants, theaters, and such ame-
nities as parks, zoos, and golf courses. At the end of the

elite spine sector lies an i  n  cipient edge city shown as “mall” 
on the model and ﬂ  anked by high-priced residences. This 
reﬂ ects the emergence of suburban nodes from the North 
American model in South America’s c  i  ties.  
  In the Grifﬁ  n-Ford model, the remaining concentric 
zones are home to less well-off residents, who co  m  pose the 
great majority of the urban population. Socioeconomic 
levels and housing quality decrease mar  k  edly with greater 
distance from the city center (Fig. 9.24). The zone of matu-
rity in the inner city contains the best housing outside the spine sector, attracting the middle classes, who invest sufﬁ  -
ciently to keep their solidly built but aging dwellings from deteriorating. The adjacent zone is one of much more modest hou  s  ing. Interspersed with the more modest areas 
are densely populated unkempt areas, which represent a 
tra  n  sition from inner-ring afﬂ  uence to outer-ring poverty. 
The outermost zone of peripheral squatter settl  e  ments is 
home to the impoverished and recent migrants who live in 
shantytowns.   Shantytowns are u  n  planned developments 
of crude dwellings and shelters made mostly of scrap 
wood, iron, and pieces of car  d  board that develop around 
ci  t  ies  . Although the ring of peripheral squatter settlements 
consists mainly of teeming, high-density shantytowns, many residents here are surprisingly optimistic about ﬁ  nd-
ing work and i  m  proving their living conditions.  
  A structural element common among many South 
American cities is the disamenity sector, the very poor-
est parts of ci  t  ies that in extreme cases are not connected 
to regular city services and are controlled by gangs and drug lords. The disamenity sectors in South American cit-ies contain relatively unchanging slums known as barrios 
or fav  e  las. The worst of these poverty-stricken areas often 
include large numbers of people who are so poor that they are forced to live in the streets (Fig. 9.25). There is little in the way of regular law enforcement within such commu-nities, and drug lords often run the show—or battle with other drug lords for dominance. Such cond  i  tions also pre-
vail in places beyond the ring highway or periférico, which is now a feature of most South Amer  i  can cities.  
  Finally, the Grifﬁ  n-Ford model displays two smaller 
sectors: an industrial park, reﬂ  ecting the ongoing co  n  cen-
tration of industrial activity in the city, and a gentriﬁ  cation 
zone, where historic buildings are preserved. Ge  n  triﬁ cation 
remains much less common in South American cities than 
in North America, but it is an emerging phenomenon.  
  T o what extent is the Grifﬁ  n-Ford model a realistic 
portrayal of the South American city? The model r  e  ﬂ ects 
the enormous differences between the spaces of privilege 
and the spaces of abject poverty within the South American city. The model also describes elements of sector d  e  velop-
ment evident in many large South American cities, but the 
concentricity suggested by the model seems to be breaking down. Figure 9.24 i  n  corporates both the original zones of 
the Grifﬁ  n-Ford model and the updates Larry Ford added 
in a 1996 a  r  ticle. Larry Ford’s updated Grifﬁ  n-Ford model 
adds a ring highway (periférico) around the outskirts of the 
city, d  i  vides the downtown business district into a CBD 
and a market, adds a mall near the elite space, and leaves 
space for su  b  urban industrial parks.  
  The African City  
  At the beginning of this century, Subsaharan Africa 
included countries with some of the world’s lowest lev-els of urbanization. In the tropical region of Africa, the majority of the people are fa  r  mers, and most countries in 
the tropics remain under 40 percent urbanized. Outside the tropics, the region is about 57 percent urban. D  e  spite the 
region’s lower levels of overall urbanization than much of the rest of the world, Africa now has the world’s fas  t  est 
growing cities, followed by those in South Asia and main-land East Asia and South and Middle America. In contrast, the cities of North America, southern South America, and Australia are growing more slowly, and those of western Europe are barely growing at all.  
  The imprint of European colonialism can still be seen 
in many African cities. During colonialism, Europeans  Figure 9.24

 How Are Cities Organized, and How Do They Function?  313
Field Note
“February 1, 2003. A long-held hope came true today: 
thanks to a Brazilian intermediary I was allowed to enter and spend a day in two of Rio de Janeiro’s hillslope fave-
las, an eight-hour walk through one into the other. Here live millions of the city’s poor, in areas often ruled by drug lords and their gangs, with minimal or no public services, amid squalor and stench, in discomfort and danger. And yet life in the older favelas has become more comfort-able as shacks are replaced by more permanent structures, electricity is sometimes available, water supply, however haphazard, is improved, and an informal economy brings goods and services to the residents. I stood in the doorway of a resident’s single-room dwelling for this overview of an urban landscape in transition: satellite-television disks symbolize the change going on here. The often blue cis-terns catch rainwater; walls are made of rough brick and roofs of corrugated iron or asbestos sheeting. No roads or automobile access, so people walk to the nearest road at the bottom of the hill. Locals told me of their hope that they will some day have legal rights to the space they occupy. During his campaign for president of Brazil, former president Lula de Silva suggested that long-term inhabitants should be awarded title, and in 2003 his government approved the notion. It will be complicated: as the photo shows, people live quite literally on top of one another, and mapping the chaos will not be simple (but will be made possible with geographic information systems). This would allow the government to tax residents, but it would also allow residents to obtain loans based on the value of their favela properties, and bring millions of Brazil-ians into the formal economy. The hardships I saw on this excursion were often dreadful, but you could sense the hope for and anticipation of a better future. In 2007, Lula da Silva’s government pledged $3.6 billion to bring water, sewage, roads, an d 
improved housing to the 20 percent of the city of Rio de Janeiro who live in the favelas.”

Sons, Inc.laid out prominent urban centers such as Kinshasa (The 
Congo), Nairobi (Kenya), and Harare (Zimbabwe) in the interior, and Dakar (Senegal), Abidjan (Ivory Coast), Luanda (Angola), Maputo (Mozambique), and other ports   along the coast. Africa even has cities that are neither tra-
ditional nor colonial. The centers of South Africa’s major cities ( Johannesburg, Cape T own, and Durban) remain essentially Western, with el  e  ments of European as well as 
American models and a veneer of globalization including 
high-rise CBDs and sprawling upper-income suburbs.  
  As a result of this diversity, it is difﬁ  cult to formulate a 
model African city. Studies of African cities indicate that the 
central city often consists of not one but three CBDs (Fig. 9.26): a remnant of the colonial CBD, an informal and some-times periodic market zone, and a transitional business cen-ter where commerce is co  n  ducted from curbside, stalls, or 
storefronts. Vertical development occurs mainly in the for-
mer colonial CBD; the traditional business center is usually c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 313  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 313  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

Model of the Large Southeast Asian City. A model of land

McGee, The Southeast Asian City, London: Bell, 1967, p. 128.a zone of single-story buildings with some traditional archi-
tecture; and the market zone tends to be open-air, informal, yet still important. Sector development marks the enci  r  cl-
ing zone of ethnic and mixed neighborhoods (often char-
acterized by strong ethnic identities as people of ethnic kin tend to cluster together). Since many African cities began as mining towns, such oper  a  tions still occur in conjunction 
with this zone in some instances. Manufacturing companies, 
originally founded near the labor force concentrated in this zone still function here. Invariably, fast-growing African cit-ies   are enci  r  cled by vast shantytowns rapidly growing as a 
result of vi  r  tually unchecked in-migration.  
  The Southeast Asian City  
  Some of the most populated cities in the world are in 
Southeast Asia. The city of Kuala Lu  m  pur, Malaysia, 
is a complex of high-rise development, including the 1483-foot-tall Petronas T owers, which until recently was the world’s tallest building. The city of Jakarta, Indonesia, called Jabotabek by the locals, is an eno  r  mous conurb  a-
  tion of Bogor, T angerang, and Bekasi.  
  In 1967, urban geographer T . G. McGee studied the 
medium-sized cities of Southeast Asia and found that they 
exhibit similar land-use patterns, creating a model referred to as the McGee model (Fig. 9.27). The f  o  cal point of the 
city is the old colonial port zone combined with the largely 
commercial district that su  r  rounds it. McGee found no 
formal central business district; rather, he found the ele-
ments of the CBD present as sep  a  rate clusters surround-
ing the old colonial port zone: the government zone; the 
Western commercial zone (practically a CBD by itself); the alien commercial zone, dominated by Chinese merchants whose res  i  dences are attached to their places of business; 
and the mixed land-use zone that contains miscellaneous 
ec  o  nomic activities, including light industry. The other 
nonresidential areas are the market-gardening zone at the 
outskirts of the u  r  ban area and, still farther from the city, a 
recently built industrial park or “estate.”  
  The residential zones in McGee’s model are similar 
to those in the Grifﬁ  n-Ford model of the   South   American 
city. Other similarities between the McGee and Grifﬁ  n-
Ford model are the hybrid structure of sectors and zones, 
an elite residential sector that includes new suburbs, an inner-city zone of middle-income hou  s  ing, and peripheral 
low-income squatter settlements. One main difference is that the McGee model includes middle-income hous-ing in a suburban zone, reﬂ  ecting the larger middle class in these cities of the global semiperip  h  ery and the small 
middle class in   South   American cities.  
  Regardless of the region or city, we recognize that 
models do not explain how or why cities are organized the 
way they are. A model of a city shows us an end product, whether planned or not and suggests the forces that cre-ated that end product.  
  Employing the concepts deﬁ  ned in this section of the chap-
ter, draw a model of the city with which you are most famil-iar. Label each section of the city accordingly. After read-ing through the models described in this section, determine which model best corresponds to the model you drew and hypothesize as to why it is so.  
  HOW DO PEOPLE SHAPE CITIES?  
  People and institutions make places, and the city 
is no exception to this rule. The roles individual people, 
go  v  ernments, corporations, developers, ﬁ  nancial lend-
ers, and realtors play in shaping cities varies across the world. Government planning agencies can directly affect the layout of cities by restricting the kinds of d  e  velopment 
allowed in certain regions or zones of cities.  
  Through   zoning     laws  , cities deﬁ  ne areas of the city 
and designate the kinds of development allowed in each c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 314  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 314  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

zone. For example, Portland, Oregon, is often described 
as the best planned city in North America because it is built around free transportation in the central city to dis-courage the use of cars. Portland is a co  m  pact city with 
ofﬁ ce buildings and residential zones in close proximity 
to encourage walking, biking, and public transpo  r  tation. 
On the other hand, Houston, T exas, is the only large city that does not have zoning laws on the books. Houstonites voted against the creation of zoning laws three different times (most recently in 1993).  
  In addition to government planning and zoning 
laws, people shape cities by choosing to live in certain 
neighborhoods and by opening stores, houses of worship, and even sporting ﬁ  elds that reﬂ  ect the values of their cul-ture. If you wander through neighborhoods of any city and pay close attention, you can see diffe  r  ences in   the 
existence of single-family or multifamily homes, in par-ticular styles of construction and buil  d  ing materials, in the 
distance between houses, in the nature and style of vegeta-tion around houses, in the di  s  tance between the houses 
and the streets, and even in the amount of space devoted to autom  o  bile movement and storage.

Manila, the Philippines
I passed through cargo shipping piers in Manila, 
the Philippines, and encountered row after row of hand-built squatter houses. I was struck by the scale of the settlements and the sheer number of people who inhabit them. I was shocked at the level of squalor in people’s living conditions. The garbage scavengers in this picture wore cotton gloves and held prods to dig through the trash for items they can use, trade, or sell. The poor and destitute live throughout the city because housing stocks are inadequate, underlying pov-erty persists, and thousands ﬂ  ock to Manila daily recognizing that petty services and even trash picking often offer more opportunity than life in the rural provinces.

city is located in a wealthy country in the world and which is l  o  cated in a poor country. What factors can 
you consider? Y ou may look at the presence or absence 
of high-rise buildings, the aesthetics of the buildings, the transportation, and the distance between houses, and after doing so, you may guess that Fi  g  ure 9.28 is 
in the wealthy country. Look again. This time, look 
for whether there are     telephone and electrical wires, 
and at the building materials used. Figure 9.28 is actu-
ally in a poorer cou  n  try; it is the city of Lomé, T ogo 
in Subsaharan Africa. Figure 9.29 is part of a suburb 
of T okyo, Japan. Jap  a  nese houses in this middle-class 
neighborhood are on top of each other because the city is 
so densely populated that land is at a premium. In Lomé, the high rises are part of the central business district, and they and the houses immediately surrounding them are where the wealthy live. The houses in the for  e  ground are 
where the poor live. Here the roofs are tin or cardboard, 
the houses are makeshift, and utility lines are lacking. Notice that in this picture of Lomé, we see no evidence of a middle class; this is common in cities of the per  i  ph-
ery where there are the “haves” and the “have-nots” and 
little in between.    Shaping Cities in the Global Periphery 
and Semiperiphery  
  Many of the world’s most populous cities are located in 
the less prosperous parts of the world, including São Paulo (Brazil), Mexico City (Mexico), Mumbai (India), Dhaka (Bangladesh), and Delhi (India). Across the world, people continue to migrate to cities in response to “pull” fa  c  tors 
that are often more imaginary than real; their expecta-tions of a better life mostly fail to m  a  terialize.  
  Particularly in the economic periphery, new arrivals 
(and many long-term residents, too) are crowded t  o  gether 
in overpopulated apartment buildings, dismal tenements, 
and teeming slums (Fig. 9.30). New arrivals come from other cities and towns and from the rural countryside, often as large families; they add to the ci  t  ies’ rate of nat-
ural growth. Housing cannot keep up with this massive inﬂ ow. Almost overnight huge   sha  n  tytowns   developed 
around these cities. The overcrowding and dismal con-ditions do not deter additional u  r  ban migration, and as a 
result millions of people spend their entire lives in urban housing of wretched qua  l  ity.

© Erin H. Fouberg.  Cities in poorer parts of the world generally lack 
enforceable   zoning laws.   Without zoning laws, cities in 
the periphery have mixed land use throughout the city. For 
example, in cities such as Madras, India (and in other cities in India), open space between high-rise buildings is often occupied by squatter settlements (Fig. 9.31). In Bangkok, Thailand, elementary schools and noisy, polluting facto-ries stand side by side. In Na  i  robi, Kenya, hillside villas 
overlook some of Africa’s worst slums. Over time, such 
incongruities may disa  p  pear, as is ha  p  pening in many cit-
ies in East Asia. Rising land values and greater demand for 
enforced zoning regulations are transforming the central cities of East Asia. But in South Asia, Subsaharan Africa, Southwest Asia, North A  f  rica, and Middle and South 
America, unregulated, helter-skelter growth continues.  
  Across the global periphery, the one trait all major 
cities display is the stark contrast between the wealthy and 
poor. Sharp contrasts between wealthy and poor areas can be found in major cities all over the world—for example, homeless people sleeping on heating grates half a block from the White House in Washington, D.C. Y et the inten-sity and scale of the contrast are greater in cities of the periphery. If you stand in the ce  n  tral area of Cairo, Egypt, 
you see what appears to be a modern, Mediterranean 
metropolis (Fig. 9.32). But if you get on a bus and ride it toward the city’s outskirts, that impression fades almost immediately as paved streets give way to dusty alleys, apartment buildings to harsh tenements, and sidewalk cof-fee shops to br  o  ken doors and windows (Fig. 9.33). T rafﬁ  c-
choked, garbage-strewn, polluted Cairo is home to an esti-
mated 12.5 million people, more than one-ﬁ  fth of Egypt’s 
population; the city is bursting at the seams. And still people continue to arrive, seeking the better life that pulls countless m  i  grants from the countryside year after year.  
  Shaping Cities in the Global Core  
  The goals people have in making cities have changed 
over time. One way people make cities is by remaking them, reinventing neighborhoods, or changing layouts to reﬂ ect current goals and aesthetics. During the se  g  rega-
tion era in the United States, realtors, ﬁ  nancial lenders, 
and city governments deﬁ  ned and segregated spaces in 
urban environments. For example, before the civil rights movement of the 1960s, ﬁ  nancial instit  u  tions in the busi-
ness of lending money could engage in a practice known as redlining. They would identify what they co  n  sidered 
to be risky neighborhoods in cities—often predominately black neighborhoods—and refuse to offer loans to anyone purchasing a house in the neighborhood encircled by red lines on their maps. This practice, which is now illegal, worked against those living in poorer neighborhoods and helped to pr  e  cipitate a downward spiral in which poor neighborhoods became increasingly rundown because funds were not available for upkeep or to purchase homes for sale.  
  Before the civil rights movement, realtors could pur-
posefully sell a house in a white neig  h  borhood at a very low 
price to a black buyer. In a practice called blockbusting,  
realtors would solicit white residents of the neig  h  borhood 
to sell their homes under the guise that the neighborhood 
was going downhill because a black person or family had moved in. This produced what urban geographers 
and sociologists call white ﬂ  ight—movement of whites 
from the city and adjacent neighborhoods to the outly-ing suburbs. Blockbusting led to signiﬁ  cant tur  n  over 
in housing, which of course beneﬁ  ted real estate agents 
through the commissions they earned as representatives 
of buyers and sellers. Blockbusting also prompted land-owners to sell their prope  r  ties at low prices to get out of 
the neighborhood quickly, which in turn allowed devel-opers to subdivide lots and build tenements. T yp  i  cally, 
developers did not maintain tenements well, dropping the property values even further.  
  Developers and governments are also important 
actors in shaping cities. In cities of the global core that 
have experienced high levels of suburbanization, people have left the central business district for the suburbs for a number of reasons, among them single-family homes, yards, better schools, and safety. With suburbaniz  a  tion, 
city governments lose tax revenue, as middle- and upper-class taxpayers leave the city and pay taxes in the suburbs instead. In order to counter the suburbanization trend, c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 317  10/17/11  6:55 AM user f-400c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 317  10/17/11  6:55 AM user f-400 F-400F-400

“Moving out from central Cairo, evidence of the 
city’s rapid growth is all around you. These hast-ily built housing units are part of the (often los-ing) effort to keep up with the city’s exploding growth. From a city of just one million people in 1930, Cairo’s population expanded to six mil-lion by 1986. And then high growth rates really kicked in. Although no one knows the exact size of the contemporary city, most estimates sug-gest that Cairo’s population has doubled in the last 20 years. This growth has placed a tremen-dous strain on city services. Housing has been a particularly critical problem—leading to a land-scape outside the urban core dominated by hast-ily built, minimally functional, and aesthetically non-descript housing projects.”

“Central Cairo is full of the multistory buildings, transportation arteries, and commercial signs that characterize most contemporary big cities. Outside of a number of mosques, few remnants of the old medieval city remain. The ﬁ  rst blow 
came in the nineteenth century, when a French-educated ruler was determined to recast Cairo as a world-class city. Inspired by the planning ideas of Paris’s Baron von Hausman, he transformed the urban core into a zone of broad, straight streets. In more recent years the forces of modern inter-national capitalism have had the upper hand. There is little sense of an overall vision for cen-tral Cairo. Instead, it seems to be a hodge-podge of buildings and streets devoted to commerce, administration, and a variety of producer and consumer services.”
city governments are encouraging co  m  mercialization of 
the central business district and gentriﬁ  cation of neigh-
borhoods in and around the central bus  i  ness district.  
  The plans that city governments draft to revive cen-
tral cities usually involve cleaning streets, sidewalks, and 
buildings; tearing down old, abandoned buildings; and building up commercial offerings and residences. City 
governments have often created programs to encourage commercialization   of central business di  s  tricts  , which 
entails transforming the central business district into an 
area attractive to residents and tourists alike.

“In 2008, downtown Fort Worth, Texas looked quite different than 
it did when I ﬁ  rst visited in 1997. In that eleven year period, business leaders in the City of Fort Worth gentriﬁ  ed the downtown. The Bass family, who has a great deal of wealth from oil holdings and who now owns about 40 blocks of downtown Fort Worth, was instrumental in the city’s gentriﬁ  cation. In the 1970s and 1980s, members of the Bass family looked at the empty, stark, downtown Fort Worth, and sought a way to revitalize the downtown. They worked with the Tandy fam-ily to build and revitalize the spaces of the city, which took off in the late 1990s and into the present century. The crown jewel in 
the gentriﬁ  ed Fort Worth is the beautiful cultural center called the 
Bass Performance Hall, named for Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass, which opened in 1998.”

waterfront “theme” areas to attract vi  s  itors. These areas 
include festival marketplaces, parks with exotic sculptures 
and play areas, and amusement zones occupying former industrial sites. Cities including Detroit and Minneapolis commercialize their central business districts by building or using tax incentives to attract professional sports stadiums to the central bus  i  ness district. Ventures have been success-
ful in attracting tourists and in generating business, but they 
alone ca  n  not revive downtowns because they cannot attract 
what the core of the city needs most: permanent residents 
with a stake in its future. The newly commercialized down-towns often stand apart from the rest of the ce  n  tral city.  
  Beginning in the 1960s, central-city neighborhoods 
located conveniently close to central business districts, but 
run down as a result of out-migration of residents, began to attract buyers who were willing to move back into the city to rehabilitate run-down houses and live in central-city neighborhoods. A process called   gentriﬁ  c  a  tion—  the 
rehabilitation of houses in older neighborhoods—took 
hold in the central-city neighborhoods of many cities.  
  In the United States, g  entriﬁ  cation began in cit-
ies with a tight housing market and deﬁ  ned central-city neighborhoods, including San Francisco, Portland, and 
Chicago. Gentriﬁ  cation slowed in the 1990s but is grow-
ing again, as city governments are encouraging gentriﬁ  ca-
tion through beautiﬁ  cation programs and si  g  niﬁ cant tax 
breaks to people who buy up abandoned or dilapidated 
housing. The growing interest in central-city housing has resulted in part from the changing character of American society: the proportion of childless couples (heterosexual and homosexual) is growing, as is the number of single people in the population. Chil  d  less couples and singles 
often choose to live in cities because the suburbs do not 
look as attractive as they typ  i  cally do to families with young 
children. Gentriﬁ  ed central-city neighborhoods attract 
residents who want to live within walking distance of their workplace and close to cultural, entertainment, and r  e  c-
reational amenities, nightlife, and restaurants (Fig. 9.34).  
  One consequence of gentriﬁ  cation is increased hous-
ing prices in central-city neighborhoods. In many cities, 
gentriﬁ  cation has displaced lower income residents because 
property taxes rise as land values rise and the costs of goods and services in the neighborhood, from parking to restau-rants, rises as well. For urbanites di  s  placed by gentriﬁ  ca-c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 319  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 319  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
320 Chapter 9  Urban Geography
tion, the consequences can be s  e  rious. Rising housing costs 
associated with gentriﬁ  cation have played a key role in the 
growing problem of homeles  s  ness in American cities.  
  The suburb is not immune to gentriﬁ  cation. In sub-
urbs that are close to the city or directly connected by 
commuter rail, people purchase smaller or older homes with the intention of tearing the house down and buil  d-
  ing a much larger home. The homes intended for sub-
urban demolition are called teardowns. In their place, suburbanites build newer homes that often are super-sized and stretch to the outer limits of the lot. New man-sions that are supersize and have a sim  i  lar look are called 
  McMansions   (Fig. 9.35).  
  Like gentriﬁ  cation in the city, the teardown phe-
nomenon changes the landscape and increases average 
hou  s  ing values, tax revenue for the city, and the average 
household income of the neighborhood. Unlike gentriﬁ    -
  cation, with teardowns, the original houses are destroyed 
instead of preserved. Also unlike gentriﬁ  cation, teardowns 
often occur in middle-class and wealthy suburbs, includ-ing Greenwich, Connecticut, and Hin  s  dale, Ill  i  nois.  
  Greenwich, a high-end neighborhood in Fairﬁ  eld 
County, Connecticut, just outside of New Y ork City. 
i  s  sued 138 permits for teardowns in 2004 (56 more than it 
did the year before). The collapse of the housing ma  r  ket 
brought a decline in the number of teardowns in Fairﬁ  eld 
County starting in 2007, but in May 2010 the   Wall Street 
Journal   reported that teardown permits had begun ris-
ing again in Fai  r  ﬁ eld County. The rise in permits was 
not in Greenwich, however. According to the   Wall Street 
Journal  , “  The most expensive corners of Fairﬁ  eld County, including Greenwich, haven’t seen much of a pickup in 
teardowns, local brokers say. A surplus of homes priced at more than $2 million, and difﬁ  culties in getting ﬁ  nancing 
for these purchases, has kept that activity to a minimum.”  
  In Hinsdale ( just outside Chicago), one-third of the 
suburb’s houses have been torn down since 1986. Those in 
favor of teardowns argue that the phenomenon slows urban sprawl by r  e  placing existing homes with new homes, rather 
than converting farmland to residential lots. Those opposed 
to teardowns see the houses as too large for their lots, dwarf-ing the neighboring houses, and destroying the character of the street by demolis  h  ing the older homes on it.  
  Urban Sprawl and New Urbanism  
  As populations have grown in certain areas of the United 
States, such as the Sun Belt and the West, urban a  r  eas 
have experienced urban sprawl—unrestricted growth of 
housing, commercial developments, and roads over large expanses of land, with little concern for urban planning. Urban sprawl is easy to spot as you drive down major road-ways in any urbanized part of the country. Y ou will see strip malls, big box stores, chain re  s  ta  u  rants, huge intersections, 
and numerous housing developments, all spread out over 
many acres (Fig. 9.36). Sprawl is a phenomenon of the automobile era. Cities that grew before the automobile typically grew “up” instead of “out.” For instance, Boston grew around the marketplace and port, but it grew before the autom  o  bile, resulting in development over smaller 
areas. If you walk through the central city of Boston t  o  day,

Chicago, a new McMansion stands in the place where a smaller house (similar in size to the one still stand-ing in the right of the photo) used to stand. In the last 20 years, about 25 percent of Hinsdale’s houses have been torn down to make room for much larger houses.

you can walk where you need to go or take the T (metro). 
Places are built up vertically, and curving, narrow streets and commercial developments with a ﬂ  avor of the old city 
(Quincy Market) give the city a cozy, int  i  mate feel.  
  Does population growth explain which cities expe-
rience the most urban sprawl? In a study of sprawl from 
1960 through the 1990s, Leon Kolankiewicz and Roy Beck (two antisprawl writers) used United States Ce  n  sus data on 
urbanized areas and found that urban sprawl happened even 
in urban areas without signiﬁ  cant population growth. In the United States, urban sprawl is more rampant in the Sun Belt of the South (A  t  lanta) and in the West (Houston) in 
urban areas whose population is rapidly growing (T able 9.1). 
Y et, even in ci  t  ies such as D  e  troit and Pittsburgh, where 
urban populations fell during the study period—by 7 per-
cent in Detroit and 9 percent in Pittsburgh—urban sprawl increased the urbanized areas of the cities by 28 percent and 30 percent, respe  c  tively. For urban sprawl to happen, farm-
lands and old industrial sites are razed, and roads are built or 
w  i  dened, strip malls are erected, and housing developments 
monopolize the horizon.  
  T o counter urban sprawl, a group of architects, urban 
planners, and developers (now numbering over 2000 in 
more than 20 countries) outlined an urban design vision they call new urbanism. Forming the Congress for the New Urbanism in 1993, the group deﬁ  nes new urban-
ism as development, urban revitalization, and subu  r  ban 
reforms that create walkable neighborhoods with a diver-
sity of housing and jobs. On their website, the Congress for the New Urbanism explains that “New Urbanists support regional planning for open space, appr  o  priate architecture 
and planning, and the balanced development of jobs and 
housing. They believe these strategies are the best way to reduce how long people spend in trafﬁ  c, to increase the 
supply of affor  d  able housing, and to rein in urban sprawl.” New urbanists want to create neighborhoods that promote 
a sense of community and a sense of place.  
  The most famous new urbanist projects are cit-
ies that new urbanists designed from the ground up, 
including Seaside, Florida (featured in the movie The 
Truman Show), West Laguna, California, and Kentlands, Mar  y  land. When new urbanists build a town, the design 
is remini  s  cent of Christaller over a much smaller area. 
The planners choose the central shopping areas and open spaces and develop the neighborhoods around them, with housing clustered around the central space, so that people can walk to the shopping area within ﬁ  ve minutes. One 
goal of new urbanist designs is to build housing more densely, to take up less space. Along with that, ma  k  ing 
shopping and other amenities walkable decreases depen-dency on the automobile, in the process helping the envi-ronment.  
  Although some see new urbanist designs as manu-
factured communities and feel disconnected in a new 
urba  n  ist space, others see these designs as superior to 
sprawl. Celebration, Florida, is a remarkable new urban-ist space: it is adjacent to Walt Disney’s theme parks, was envisioned by Walt Disney himself, and is owned by the Disney Company (Fig. 9.37). Built in 1994, Celebration is centered on Market Street, a shopping district with res-taurants (including a 1950s-style diner and a pizza place), a town hall, banks, a post ofﬁ  ce, and a movie theater with a nostalgic marquee (Fig. 9.38). The town includes schools, a health center, a ﬁ  tness ce  n  ter, and churches. The Disney 
Company chose certain architectural styles for the houses in Celebration, and builders offer homes and townhouses in a price range from $300,000 to over $1 million. T o meet the new u  r  banist goal of incorpora  t  ing diverse people in a 
community, Celebration includes apartments for rent and condominiums for sale.

322 Chapter 9  Urban Geography
  For geographers, new urbanism is seen as a redeﬁ  ni-
tion of space in the city. Public spaces become privatized 
for the enjoyment of the few (the residents of the neigh-borhood). Geograp  h  ers Stuart Aitken, Don Mitchell, and 
Lynn Staeheli note that as new urbanism strives to turn 
neighborhoods back in time, “spaces and social fun  c  tions 
historically deemed public (such as parks, neighborhood 
centers, shopping districts)” are privatized. The houses with porches that encourage neighbors to talk and the parks that are within walking distance for the res  i  dents cre-
ate “mythic landscapes that are ingratiating for those who 
can afford them and exclusionary for those who cannot.”  
  Noted geographer David Harvey offers one of the 
strongest critiques of new urbanism, explaining ﬁ  rst 
that most new urbanist designs are “greenﬁ  eld” projects 
designed for the afﬂ  uent to make the suburbs more liv-
able. This fact is evidence, Harvey argues, that the new 
urbanism movement is a kind of “spatial determinism” that does not recognize that “the fundamental difﬁ  culty 
with modernism was its persistent habit of privileging spatial forms over social processes.” Harvey, and others who critique new urbanism, claim that new urbanism does nothing to break down the social conditions that privilege some while disadvantaging others; that new urbanist proj-ects take away much of the grittiness and character of the city; and that the “communities” that new urba  n  ists form 
through their projects are exclusionary communities that deepen the racial s  e  gregation of cities.  
  Despite the critiques against new urbanism, devel-
opments in the new urbanist tradition are attracting a 
gro  w  ing number of people, and when they are situated 
within cities, they can work against urban sprawl.  
  Gated Communities  
  As you drive through urban spaces, suburban and central 
city alike, you will note more and more neighbo  r  hoods 
being developed or redesigned to align with new urban-ist principles. In your inventory of landscapes, even more overwhelming will be the proliferation of gated commu-nities. Gated communities are fenced-in neighborhoods TABLE 9.1

“When I visited Celebration, Florida in 1997, I 
felt like I was walking onto a movie or televi-sion set. The architecture in the Walt Disney-designed new urbanist development looked like the quintessential New England town. Each house has a porch, but on the day I was there, the porches sat empty—waiting to wel-come the arrival of their owners at the end of the work day. We walked through town, past the 50s-style movie marquee, and ate lunch at a 50s-style diner. At that point, Celebration was still growing. Across the street from the ‘Bank of Celebration’ stood a sign marking the future home of the ‘Church in Celebration.’”

with controlled access gates for people and automobiles. 
Often, gated communities have s  e  curity cameras and 
security forces (privatized police) keeping watch over the community, as the main obje  c  tive of a gated community 
is to create a space of safety within the uncertain urban world. A secondary obje  c  tive is to maintain or i  n  crease 
housing values in the neighborhood through enforcement of the neighborhood associ  a  tion’s bylaws that control 
everything from the color of a house to the character and size of additions.  
  During the late 1980s and early 1990s, developers in 
the United States began building gated communities in 
urban areas around the country. In a 2001 census of hous-ing, the United States government reported that 16 mil-lion people, or about 6 percent of Americans, live in gated communities. The urban design of gating communities has diffused around the globe at record speed, with gated communities in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  
  In poorer countries, where cities are divided 
between wealthy and poor, gated communities provide 
another layer of comfort for the city’s wealthy. In the large cities of Latin America and Africa, you commonly see walls around individual houses, walling in yards and pools and kee  p  ing out crime. During the last ten years, many 
neighborhoods in these cities have added gates around the neighborhoods in addition to the walls. Walled houses and gated communities in the wealthy northern suburbs of Johannesburg, South A  f  rica, are threatening the deseg-
regation of the post-Apartheid city. White, wealthy resi-dents fear crime in the city with a murder rate, along with neighboring Pretoria, of 5000 per year (in an area with about 5 million people). In response to their fear of crime, people in the suburbs of Johannesburg blocked off over 2500 streets and posted guards to control access to these streets by 2004. Many fear that the gated communities are a new form of segregation. Since the vast majority of the crimes in the city occur in poor black tow  n  ships or 
in the central city, the concern is that these developments only worsen the plight of less well-off segments of soc  i  ety.  
  In China, gated communities have taken off, now 
crossing socioeconomic classes and creating a ubiquitous 
fe  a  ture on the urban landscape (Fig. 9.39). Like the gated 
communities in Europe and North America, the gated communities of China privatize spaces and exclude out-siders with gates, security cameras, and restricted access. Ho  w  ever, the gated communities in China are ﬁ  ve to ten 
times more densely populated than gated communities in Europe and North America. Geographer Y ouqin Huang has found other differences between gated commun  i  ties 
in China and those in North America and Europe. China has a long history of gated communities, dating back to the ﬁ rst Ch  i  nese cities and persisting since. Huang argues 
that the “collectivism-oriented culture and tight political control” in China explain why the Chinese government built gated communities during the socialist p  e  riod and 
why a proliferation of gated communities has occurred by private developers since China’s housing r  e  form in 1998 
promoted ind  i  vidual home ownership.

 How Do People Shape Cities? 325
  In Europe and North America, gated communities 
are not only for the wealthy and privileged. Especially since 
September 11, people have a growing desire to feel safe at home, and this is just as true of middle and lower classes as it is of the rich. Some urban planners have encouraged govern-ments to recast low-income housing as small communities, gated from each other, in order to reduce the ﬂ  owthrough 
trafﬁ c and crime associated with it. Cities have torn down 
the enormous high rises, typically ridden with crime and referred to as “the projects” such as C  a  brini Green in 
Chicago and Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis, in an effort to remake 
the spaces of the poor into “defensible” spaces (Fig. 9.40).  
  Urban planners want to gate middle-income and 
low-income neighborhoods in order to create a sense of 
community and to make the spaces “defensible” from undesired activities such as drug dealing and prostit  u  tion. 
One of the best-documented cases of gating a middle-
income community is the Five Oaks district of Dayton, Ohio, a neighborhood that is about 50 percent African American and 50 percent white and has a high rate of rent-als. Urban planner Oscar Newman encouraged planners in Dayton to divide the 2000 hous  e  holds in the Five Oaks 
district into ten smaller, gated communities with restricted 
access. The city turned most of the reside  n  tial streets in 
each of these mini-neighborhoods into cul-de-sacs. They 
have experienced a serious reduction in crime, along with an increase in housing sales and housing values.  
  Ethnic Neighborhoods in the European City  
  Ethnic neighborhoods in European cities are typi-
cally afﬁ  liated with migrants from former colonies. For e  x  ample, Algeria was a colony of France, and now Paris 
and other French cities have distinct Algerian neighbo  r-
  hoods. Similarly, London (the United Kingdom) has a 
Jamaican neighborhood, and Madrid (Spain) has a dis-tinct Moroccan neighborhood, reﬂ  ecting their c  o  lonial 
ties with these now sovereign countries. Other European countries cultivated relationships with countries outside of Europe after the colonial era. For example, after World War II, Germany invited young men from T urkey to migrate to Germany as guest workers (see Chapter 3). Cities in Germany, such as Frankfurt, have distinct T urkish neighborhoods. Current imm  i  gration to countries in 
Europe typically focuses on the cities. And most of the migrants to European cities come from the global p  e  riph-
ery or from eastern Europe, not from other countries in western Europe.  
  Migration to Europe is constrained by government 
policies and laws. Many western European cities have 
pu  b  lic housing zones that were built after World War II 
following the devastation of the war years. Governments in Europe are typically much more involved in the social rights of people, such as health care and hou  s  ing than the 
United States government. European cities are also much older than American cities, and when the cities were laid out they were designed for foot and horse trafﬁ  c, not auto-mobiles. Thus, European cities are typ  i  cally more com-
pact, densely populated, and walkable than American cit-ies. European cities also have hi  s  toric city centers where 
much of the city’s history took place and is preserved and to which tourists are attracted t  o  day. Rather than the sky-
scrapers that are typically the focal point of downtown in American cities, a historic city center is the focal point of downtown in European cities and skyscrapers are reserved

the image of this public housing project as a failure.

for developments on the outskirts of town. Housing in the 
European city is often co  m  bined with places of work, with 
work spaces on the bottom ﬂ  oors of buildings and hous-
ing above. Large zones of housing in Europe typically begin in a ring around the outside of the city center, in what Ernest Burgess called the zone of transition. After the war, many European go  v  ernments built public hous-
ing structures in the spaces leveled by bombing around the 
city center.  
  Government Policy and Immigrant 
Accommodation  
  Immigration is changing the spatial-cultural geography 
of European cities. As immigrants have settled in large numbers in the zone of transition, locals have moved out. Walking from the city center of Paris out through immi-grant neighborhoods, one can see the cultural landscape change to reﬂ  ect the signiﬁ  cant number of i  m  migrants 
from the “Maghreb” of Africa, the region of North Africa 
around Algeria and Morocco. Maghrebis are by far the most numerous inhabitants in the tough, hardscrabble immigrant neighborhoods around Paris, where unemplo  y-
  ment is high, crime is widespread, and resentment festers.  
  Whether a public housing zone is divided into eth-
nic neighborhoods in a European city d  e  pends in large 
part on government policy. Urban geographers Christian 
Kesteloot and Cees Cortie studied housing policies and zones in Brussels, Belgium, and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. They found that Brussels has very little pub-lic housing and that immigrants live in privately owned rentals throughout the city. Kesteloot and Cortie also found that immigrant groups in Brussels who came from a distinct region of their home country (especially rural regions), such as the T urks in Brussels, tend to cluster in ethnic neighborhoods. In contrast, the r  e  searchers 
r  e  ported that immigrant groups who came from cities, 
such as the Moroccans in Brussels, chose rental units sca  t-
  tered throughout the city and therefore did not establish 
ethnic neighborhoods in Brussels.  
  Amsterdam is quite different from Brussels: 
Amsterdam has a great deal of public housing and few 
ethnic neighborhoods within the public housing units. When immigration to Amsterdam from former colonies (Indon  e  sia, Surinam) and noncolonies (Morocco and 
T urkey) increased in the 1960s, Amsterdammers moved from the transition zone of public housing to neighbor-ing towns such as Almere. The Dutch government then impl  e  mented a policy in the public housing zone that 
slowed the creation of ethnic neighborhoods. The Dutch go  v  ernment allots public hou  s  ing to legal immigrants by 
assigning homes on a sequential basis in the city’s zone of transition, where some 80 pe  r  cent of the housing stock 
is public housing. As a result of government assignment of housing, if you walk through the public housing zone of Amsterdam, you will ﬁ  nd a family from Suriname liv-
ing next to an Indonesian family and a Moroccan family, not just other Surinamese. The housing and neighbor-hoods are multicultural. The ethnic groups maintain their local cultures through religious and cultural orga-nizations rather than through residential se  g  regation. In 
Amsterdam, the call to Friday prayer for Muslims rings out all over the immigrant areas, as Muslims from various countries are spread throughout the city.  
  Ethnic Neighborhoods in the Global Periphery 
and Semiperiphery City  
  In cities of the periphery and semiperiphery, a sea of 
slum development typically begins where the perm  a-
  nent buildings end, in some cases engulﬁ  ng and dwarﬁ  ng 
the central city. If you stand on a hill outside Lima (Peru) 
or overlooking the Cape Flats near Cape T own (South Africa), you see an unchanging panorama of makeshift shacks built of every conceivable material, vying for every foot of space, extending to the hor  i  zon. Y ou will 
n  o  tice few, if any, trees, and you will see narrow foot-
paths leading to a few unpaved streets that go into the 
central city.  
  Millions of migrants travel to such ominous envi-
ronments every year. The total number of people living 
in these types of slum developments is uncertain because government control is impossible and enumeration i  m  practical. In Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), the migrants build 
their dwellings on dangerous, landslide-prone slopes; in Port Moresby (Papua New Guinea), the migrants sink stilts in the mud and build out over the w  a  ter, risking wind 
and waves. In Calcutta (India), thousands of migrants do not even try to erect shelters: there and in many other cit-ies they live in the streets, under bridges, even in storm drains. City governments do not have the r  e  sources to 
adequately educate, medicate, or police the burgeoning populations, let alone to provide even min  i  mal housing 
for most.  
  Even the people living in the squalid conditions of 
shanty settlements are not really squatters—they pay rent. 
When the settlements expand outward from the central city, they occupy land owned by previous residents, fami-lies who farmed what were once the rural areas beyond the city’s edge. Some of the farming fam  i  lies were favored 
by the former colonial administration; they moved into the cities but continued to own the lands their farms were on. As shanty deve  l  opments encroached on their lands, 
the landowners began to charge people rent for living on the dilapidated housing the new residents built on the land. 
After establishing an owner-tenant relationship, the land-owners steadily raise rents, threatening to destroy the ﬂ imsy shacks if residents fail to pay. In this way, powerful c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 326  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 326  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Do People Shape Cities? 327
long-term inhabitants of the city exploit the weaker, more 
recent arr  i  vals.  
  The vast slums of cities in poorer parts of the world 
are typically ethnically delineated, with new arrivals pre-
car  i  ously accommodated. For example, Nairobi, Kenya, 
has a large slum area, one of the worst in Subsaharan Africa in terms of amenities, called Kibera. Much of the land where Kibera is located is owned by Nubians, who are of Sudanese descent. The Sudanese Nubians settled in the area of Kibera during the colonial era. Many of the Nub  i  ans have become businesspeople in the city of 
Nairobi. The modern tenants of the shanty settlements 
in Kibera are largely Luo from western Kenya and Luhya from northwestern Kenya. During the fall of 2001, some of the Kiberian tenants were unable to pay the latest increase in rents. The Nubian landowners came to evict them, and in the ﬁ  gh  t  ing that followed, a number of 
people were killed. Groups of Luo, Luhya, and others 
even took to ﬁ  ghting among themselves. The government 
intervened to stabilize the situation. The latest rent increases   were withdrawn, but the fu  n  damental problems—
crowding, unemployment, unsanitary conditions, hunger, 
and lack of education—remain, and the ethnic groups 
living in the neighborhoods of Kibera will likely experi-ence ﬁ  ghting again.  
  Power and Ethnicity  
  Geography plays a major role in the relationships among 
ethnic components of a former colonial city. The se  t  tle-
ment patterns of cities developed during the colonial period often persist long after. In a study of the city of Mombasa, Kenya, during the 1960s, H. J. de Blij found that the central city, in effect the island on which Mo  m  basa 
was built, was informally partitioned among m  a  jor ethnic 
groups. Apart from the Swahili who occupied the Old T own and adjacent historic po  r  tions of the built-up area, 
the spatial pattern of occupance by ethnic groups in the city of Mombasa mirrored the status of the ethnic groups in the country of Kenya as a whole. The port of Mombasa, the country’s largest, was the city’s major employer. The Kikuyu, whose historic homeland lies far away from Mombasa to the north of Nairobi, were privileged by the British during colonial times. B  e  cause of their important 
position during colonialism, Kikuyu workers and their families living in Mombasa r  e  sided closest to the port and 
to the center of economic power. Although the most pow-erful workers lived closest to the central commercial dis-trict, the Asians (often from India and thus referred to as Indians in Mombasa) who controlled the city’s commerce were concentrated on the opposite side of the island, away from the port. A  n  other powerful ethnic group, the 
Kamba, occupied a zone farther outward from the port. The Mijikenda, a less powerful African ethnic group, migrated from off-island villages to work in Mombasa and lived farther from the comme  r  cial center.  
  In recent times, as the city’s population has grown 
seven times larger than it was in the 1960s, the spatial pat-
tern of Mombasa still reﬂ  ects the power of ethnic groups. The most recent imm  i  grants, desperate for jobs, crowd 
the outer zone of the city, off of the island, and in the shanty se  t  tlements.  
  How do the many millions of urban immigrants 
living in the slum-ridden rings and pockets of the cit-
ies of the global periphery and semiperiphery survive? Extended families share and stretch every dollar they manage to earn; when one member of the family has a salaried job, his or her income saves the day for a dozen or more rel  a  tives. When a member of the family (or several 
members of a larger community) manages to emigrate to a core country or an island of development and makes good money there, part of that income is sent back home and b  e  comes the mainstay for those left behind. Hundreds 
of millions of dollars are transferred this way every year; r  e  mittances make a critical difference in the poorer coun-
tries of the world (see Chapter 3).  
  The Informal Economy  
  In the vast slums, barrios, and favelas, those who are job-
less or unsalaried are not idle. Everywhere you look peo-ple are at work, inside or in front of their modest habi-tats, ﬁ  xing things, repairing broken items for sale, sor  t  ing 
through small piles of waste for salvageable items, trading and selling goods from makeshift stands. What prevails here is referred to as the informal economy—the econ-omy that is not taxed and is not counted toward a country’s gross national income. What is generated in the informal economy can add up to a huge total in unr  e  corded mon-
etary value. The informal economy worries governments because it is essentially a recordless eco  n  omy and no taxes 
are paid. Remittances are usually delivered in cash, not via Western Union or a bank. T yp  i  cally, a trusted community 
member (who might pay a comparatively small bribe at the airport when passing through immigration) carries remi  t  tances to family members.  
  From Colonial to Global CBD  
  Even as the informal economy thrives among the millions 
in the shantytowns, the new era of globalization is making a major impact in the major cities founded or fostered by the colonial powers. In 2002, geographers Richard Grant and Jan Nijman documented this transformation in for-mer colonial port cities, including Mu  m  bai, India. In this 
city, formerly called Bombay, colonial rule produced an 
urban landscape marked by strong segregation of for-eign and local activities, commercial as well as  residential c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 327  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 327  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

(Fig. 9.41), and high levels of fun  c  tional specialization 
and concentration. Adjacent to the port area was a well-
demarcated European business di  s  trict containing for-
eign (mostly British) companies. Most economic activities 
in this European commercial area involved trade, trans-port, banking, distribution, and insurance. Zoning and building codes were strictly e  n  forced. Physically sepa-
rated from this European district were the traditional 
markets and bazaars of the so-called Native T own, a densely pop  u  lated mix of commercial and residential 
land uses.  
  In this era of globalization, a new spatially demar-
cated foreign presence has arisen. The city now has 
a global CBD at the heart of the original colonial city, housing mostly foreign corporations and multinational comp  a  nies and linked mainly to the global economy. 
The former European T own has a large presence of big dome  s  tic companies and a pronounced orientation to 
the national (Indian) economy. And the Native T own 
now has a high concentration of small domestic company headquarters and the strongest orientation to the imme-diate u  r  ban area.

 What Role Do Cities Play in Globalization? 329
  WHAT ROLE DO CITIES PLAY 
IN GLOBALIZATION?  
  Globalization, as we deﬁ  ned the term in the ﬁ  rst 
chapter, is a set of processes and outcomes that occur 
on the global scale, circumventing and leaping over state boundaries to affect the world. In the processes of globa  l  ization, cities are taking over in ways we barely 
understand. Most statistics about economic activity at the global scale are gathered and disseminated by states. Nonetheless, many of the most important processes o  c  cur 
among and between cities, not states as a whole, masking the integral role world cities play in globaliz  a  tion. World 
cities function at the global scale, beyond the reach of 
the state borders, functioning as the se  r  vice centers of the 
world economy.  
  Contending that models of cities and hierarchies 
of cities within states (such as Christaller) no longer rep-
resent what is happening with the city, T aylor and Lang maintain that the city has become “something else” than a si  m  ple CBD tied into a hierarchy of other cities within the 
state. The world city is a node in globalization, reﬂ  ecting 
pro  c  esses that have “redrawn the limits on spatial inter-
action,” according to Felsenstein, Schamp, and Shachar. A node is a place through which a  c  tion and interaction 
occur. As a node, a world city is connected to other cit-ies, and the forces sha  p  ing globalization pulse across these 
connections and through the cities.  
  Most lists of world cities provide a hierarchy of the 
most important nodes, the most important world cities, 
then the next most important, and so forth. Virtually all agree that New Y ork, London, and T okyo are the most impo  r  tant world cities, but beyond that point, the deﬁ  -
nition of what makes a world city and the list of world 
cities changes d  e  pending on the perspective of the 
researcher. Geographers Jon Beaverstock and Peter J. 
T aylor and their Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network have produced nearly 200 research papers, cha  p  ters, and books on the geography of world 
cities over the past few years. By studying which cities 
provide pr  o  ducer services (integral to the processes of 
globalization) in the areas of banking, law, advertising, 
and accoun  t  ing, these geographers have produced an 
inventory of world cities mapped in Figure 9.42. They 
delineate 10 A  l  pha, 10 Beta, and 35 Gamma world cit-
ies. The Alpha cities (London, Paris, New Y ork, T okyo, 
Chicago, Fran  k  furt, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Milan, 
and Singapore) have a global capac  i  ty to provide services 
in the world-economy.  
  World cities do not exist merely to service players in 
the global economy. Major world cities such as Lo  n  don 
and Paris are also capital cities. States concentrate devel-
opment and encourage interconnectedness b  e  tween cer-tain cities and the rest of the world. Even though Lo  n  don 
and Paris are a short distance apart, both function as world cities in part because of the role they play within their respective states: each became a magnet for economic and political activ  i  ty within its state, and then the globe.  
  Some countries such as the United States and 
Germany have two or more world cities within their state 
borders. They thus do not have a single, distinct pri-mate city. T o understand the role of cities in glob  a  lization, 
the services cities provide to places and peoples around the 
world and the interconnectedness among cities must also be co  n  sidered. Geographers are now working to uncover 
the globalized ﬂ  ows and processes occurring across world 
 ci  t  ies, bringing them closer together.  
  Cities as Spaces of Consumption  
  In addition to being nodes in globalization, cities are 
also products of globalization. Major changes in cities, such as the redevelopment of New Y ork’s Times Square and the remaking of Berlin’s Potsdamer Platz, are the result of global processes. Frank Roost has found that “the global media industry is becoming the driving force in the reshaping of cities” such as New Y ork and Berlin, turning city centers into spaces of consum  p  tion. Global 
media giants such as Time Warner, Viacom, and Walt 
Disney use cross promotion to encourage the co  n  sump-
tion of their products. It is no accident that characters 
on television sit-coms produced and aired on ABC (a television channel owned by Walt Disney) visit Disney theme parks or host Disney Princess-themed birthday parties on a given episode. These same media companies are investing heavily in urban centers in order to create entertainment spaces, places where tourists can go to consume their products. M  e  dia corporations are hel  p-
  ing transform urban centers into major entertainment 
districts (“variations on a theme park”) where items are consumed.  
  For example, in New Y ork City, government entities 
began to try to redevelop Times Square in the early 1980s. 
At that time, this area of the city was known for its neon lights, pornography movie houses, prostit  u  tion, and other 
illicit economic activities. The city sought to push these 
businesses out of Times Square and return the business district to a conglomeration of restaurants, hotels, bars, and entertainment spaces (as it had been before World War II). Over the decade of the 1980s, the city closed hundreds of small businesses in Times Square. In 1995, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani reached a deal with Michael Eisner, CEO of Walt Di  s  ney. The mayor promised to 
remove the remaining sex shops, and Eisner committed to 
renovating the New Amsterdam Theater, a focal point in Times Square (Fig. 9.43, left and right).

Disney set the new course for a  family-friendly entertain-
ment district in New Y ork. The restored New Amsterdam Theater hosts Di  s  ney musicals such as The Lion King and 
Beauty and the Beast (both based on Disney movies). The 
Times Square area is assuredly a space of consumption and a variation on a theme park: themed restaurants (Hard Rock Café, ESPN Zone), cross-promoting themed stores (Warner Brothers Store, Disney Store), and retail stores that cater to families (an enormous T oys R Us with a ferris wheel inside).  
  In 2009, New Y ork Mayor Michael Bloomberg 
closed portions of Broadway in Times Square to traf-
ﬁ c and created an urban esplanade with lawn chairs and seating to advance his goal of making the city more liv-able. New Y orkers and tourists took to the new seating and moved in with laptops in hand. Times Square and the Hi-Line Walkway in New Y ork now have bleacher-style seating as well as chairs to encourage New Y orkers to sit a spell and enjoy the city.  
  Potsdamer Platz in Berlin is also becoming a new 
space of consumption in the city center. Prior to the 
bom  b  ing of Berlin during World War II, Potsdamer 
Platz was a center of entertainment for Berlin’s middle 
class. After the war, little was left of the area.

the city divided Potsdamer Platz and sold the land. The 
two largest owners are the German comp  a  ny Daimler-
Benz and the Japanese company Sony. Sony built a 
huge entertainment structure called the Sony Center for cross promotion. According to Roost, much of the Daimler-Benz structure, Daimler City, is a space of consumption, with entertainment venues, restaurants, bars, and h  o  tels.  
  Although the tourist will be focused on the theme park 
atmosphere of these spaces of consumption, the renov  a-
  tions of the districts in both of these cities have also brought 
spaces of media production to the cities. Sony has placed its European headquarters in Berlin, Warner Brothers moved its ofﬁ  ces to Times Square, and new o  f  ﬁ ce towers around 
Times Square house many other media companies.  
  Thinking through the challenges to the state presented in 
Chapter 8, predict whether and under what circu  m  stances world cities could replace states as the basic and most pow-erful form of political organization in the world.  c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 331  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 331  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  The city is an ever changing cultural landscape, its layers reﬂ  ecting grand plans by gov-
ernments, impassioned pursuits by individuals, economic decisions by corporations, and 
processes of globalization. Geographers who study cities have a multitude of topics to examine. From gentriﬁ  cation to teardowns, from favelas to McMa  n  sions, from spaces of 
production to spaces of consumption, from ancient walls to gated communities, c  i  ties have 
so much in common, and yet each has its own pulse, its own feel, its own spatial structure, 
its own set of realities. The pulse of the city is undoubtedly created by the peoples and cultures who live there. For it is the people, whether working independently or as part of global institutions, who continuously create and re-create the city and its geography.  c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 333  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 333  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  Field Note    Geography, Trade, and Development  
  Walking down one of the major streets of Timbuktu, Mali (Fig. 10.1), I could hardly 
believe I was in the r  e  nowned intellectual, spiritual, and economic center of the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries. At that time, the place had a great reputation for wealth, which spurred the ﬁ  rst European explorations along the African coast. What survives is a relatively impoverished town of some 35,000 people providing central place fun  c  tions for the surrounding area and seeking to attract some tour-ist business based on its legendary name.  
  What happened to Timbuktu? The city’s wealth many centuries ago derived 
from its ability to control the trans-Sahara trade in gold, salt, ivory, kola nuts, and slaves. But when trade patterns shifted with the deve  l  opment of sea trade routes    Figure 10.1  
  Central Square, Timbuktu, Mali.     Sited along the Niger River on the edge of the Sahara 
Desert, Timbuktu was once a major trade center. Goods from the north carried on camels were 
traded with goods from the south brought in on boats. The development of sea trade routes in the sixteenth century allowed traders to circumvent Timbuktu. In turn, the city’s central trade role declined.

336 Chapter 10   Development
along the west coast of Africa, Timbuktu lost its strategic position and a long 
p  e  riod of decline set in.  
  Timbuktu’s story serves as a reminder that where a place is located in rela-
tion to patterns of economic d  e  velopment and exchange can be as important as, or even more important than, the commodities found in that place. Indeed, there are many examples of places where the presence of a valuable commod-ity does not translate into improved economic lives for those living nearby. The people working on the oil booms in G  a  bon or Nigeria or workers chopping down rare hardwood trees in Thailand or Malaysia, for example, are not the ones who beneﬁ  t from most of the wealth associated with demand for the goods they help 
produce. I  n  stead, international corporations or the wealthiest families in a place, those who own the industry, are the principal beneﬁ  c  i  aries.  
  To understand how the production of a good creates wealth for some and 
not for others, we must understand the concept of a commodity chain and the role of places in the chain of production. A   commodity chain   is a series of 
links connecting the many places of production and distribution and result-ing in a commodity that is then e  x  changed on the market. The generation of wealth differs along the commodity chain. Each link along the chain adds a certain value to the commodity, producing differing levels of wealth for the place and the pe  o  ple where production o  c  curs.  
  What Timbuktu had to offer was the ability to coordinate and facilitate trade 
based on its ge  o  graphic site where the Niger River turned north at the edge of the Sahara Desert. The river was the last major water source for those crossing the S  a  hara from south to north across what is now Mali and Algeria. Timbuktu was a break-of-bulk location, where goods traded on one mode of transport, camel, were transported to another mode of transport, boat. The commodity chain the production of a good follows and the points along the chain where materials and goods are traded changes over time, directly impacting the economic situation of places.    
  Places along a commodity chain do not all beneﬁ  t equally from the production 
of a good. The generation of wealth depends on how production occurs at each step. In Chapter 8 we introduced the concepts of core and periphery. Sophist  i  cated 
technology, high skill lev els, extensive research and development, and high sala-
ries tend to be assoc  i  ated with the segment of global commodity chains located in the core. The segments located in the perip  h  ery, by contrast, tend to be associ-ated with low technology, less education, little research and development, and lower wages.     
  The concept of development is both about being nodes along commod-
ity chains and also about transforming peripheral processes into core ones, or red  i  recting the proﬁ  t generated through core processes to improve the periph-
ery. As the twenty-ﬁ  rst century unfolds, coun  t  less governments, academics, nongovernmental organizations, and international ﬁ  nancial institutions offer ideas about how to lift up the poorer parts of the world. The theories, meth-ods, and recommendations vary, but they all focus on the illusive concept of develo  p  ment.  
  In this chapter, we review how development is deﬁ  ned and measured and 
some of the theories of develo  p  ment. We also examine how geography affects development, considering the structures of the world eco  n  omy. We look at the geographical barriers to and costs of development within countries, and we ask why uneven deve  l  opment occurs not just across the globe, but within states.  c10Development.indd Page 336  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 336  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Is Development Deﬁ  ned and Measured? 337
  HOW IS DEVELOPMENT DEFINED 
AND MEASURED?  
  The economic and social geography of the con-
temporary world is a patchwork of almost inconceivable 
co  n  trasts. On the simple ﬁ  elds of shifting cultivators in 
equatorial American and African forests, farmers grow 
root crops using ancient methods and rudimentary tools. On the Great Plains of North America, in Ukraine, and in eastern Australia, farmers use expensive, mod-ern machines to plow the land, plant seeds, and harvest grains. T oolmakers in the villages of Papua New Guinea still fashion their implements by hand, as they did many centuries ago; whereas, factory workers in Japan or South Korea produce automobiles by the shi  p  load for distr  i  bu-
tion to markets thousands of miles away. Between these extremes, the range and variety of productive activities are virtually en  d  less.  
  These contrasts point to a major issue in understand-
ing development: wealth does not depend solely on   what 
is produced  ; it depends in large part on   how and where it is 
produced  . People can grow agricultural co  m  modities with 
rudimentary tools or with expensive combines. Is one or 
the other necessary for development to occur? The idea of development is everywhere, but rarely do we pause to ask exactly what deve  l  opment means or how we can measure 
it (Fig. 10.2).  
  Development implies progress, and in the modern 
world progress usually means improvements in techno  l-
  ogy and production, as well as improvements in the social 
and economic welfare of people. T o say a country is   devel-
oping  , then, is to say progress is being made in technol-
ogy, production, and socioeconomic well- being. Our 
modern notion of development is related to the Industrial Revolution and the idea that technology can i  m  prove the 
lot of humans. Through advances in technology, people 
can produce more food, create new pro  d  ucts, and accrue 
material wealth. But these things do not necessarily bring 
happiness (see chapter 14), social stability, or enviro  n  men-
tal sustainability, which makes development a narrow, and 
sometimes controversial, indicator of the human condition.    Gross National Income  
  Ways of measuring development ﬁ  t into three major 
areas of concern: development in economic welfare, d  e  velopment in technology and production, and devel-
opment in social welfare. Beginning with the 1960s, the 
most common way of comparing development in eco-nomic welfare was to use the index economists cr  e  ated 
to compare countries, the gross national product.   Gross 
national product (GNP)   is a measure of the total value 
of the ofﬁ  cially recorded goods and services produced 
by the citizens and corporations of a cou  n  try in a given 
year. It includes things produced both inside and out-
side the country’s territory, and it is ther  e  fore broader 
than   gross domestic product (GDP)  , which encom-
passes only goods and services produced within a coun-
try during a gi  v  en year.  
  In recent years, economists have increasingly turned 
to   gross national income (GNI)  , which calculates the 
monetary worth of what is produced within a country plus 
income received from investments ou  t  side the country 
minus income payments to other countries around the world. GNI is seen as a more accurate way of measuring a country’s wealth in the context of a global economy. In order to compare GNI across countries, economists must standardize the data. The most common way to standard-ize GNI data is to d  i  vide it by the population of the coun-
try, yielding the   per capita GNI  . In Japan the per capita 
gross n  a  tional income in U.S. dollars in 2008 was $34,600. 
In the United States it was $45,850. In Lu  x  embourg it 
was $64,400. But in India it was $2740, in Nigeria it was 
$1770, and in Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, it was $3580. This enormous range across the globe in per capita GNI reﬂ  ects the o  f  ten-searing con-
trasts b  e  tween rich and poor.  
  Although the map of per capita GNI clearly shows 
the startling contrasts between rich and poor in the world, 
the statistic has several shortcomings. GNI is a limited measure because it only includes transactions in the   formal 
economy  , the legal economy that governments tax and 
monitor. Quite a few countries have per ca  p  ita GNI of less 
than $1000 per year—a ﬁ  gure so low it seems impossible   Key Questions   For Chapter 10  
   1.   How is development deﬁ  ned and measured?  
   2 .    How does geographical situation affect development?  
   3.   What are the barriers to and the costs of development?  
   4.   How do political and economic institutions inﬂ  uence uneven development 
within states?  c10Development.indd Page 337  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 337  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
that people could survive. A key co  m  ponent of survival in 
these countries is the   informal economy  , the uncounted 
or illegal economy that gover  n  ments do not tax and keep 
track of, including everything from a garden plot in a yard 
to the black market to the illegal drug trade. The infor-mal economy is a signiﬁ  cant element in the economies 
of many countries, but GNI stati  s  tics omit the informal 
economy entirely.  
  GNI per capita also masks extremes in the distribu-
tion of wealth within a country. The Middle Eastern oil 
countries of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have per capita GNIs over $24,000, a le  v  el higher than 
that of several European countries. These ﬁ  gures give us 
no hint of the degree of overall partic  i  pation in the coun-
try’s economy, the average citizen’s material standard of living, or gaps between genders or among regions. Eco-nomic production and the wealth it generates are not dis-tr  i  buted evenly across the seven emirates that make up the 
United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi, the emirate that domi-nates the petroleum industry, generated over half of the country’s GDP in 2010. Dubai, the next largest emirate, ge  n  erated about a quarter of the GDP , and the Qaywayn 
emirate generated less than 1 percent of the country’s gross GDP .    Another limitation of GNI per capita is that it mea-
sures only outputs (i.e., production). It does not take into 
account the nonmonetary costs of production, which take a toll on the environment through resource depl  e  tion and 
po  l  lution of air and water. Per capita GNI may even treat 
such externalities as a plus. For example, the sale of ciga-rettes augments GNI. If cigarette use causes sickness and hospitalization is required, the GNI ﬁ  gure is boosted fur-ther. Conversely, the use of energy-efﬁ  cient devices can 
actually lower GNI.  
  The limitations of GNI have prompted some 
analysts to look for alternative measures of economic 
develo  p  ment, ways of measuring the roles technology, 
production, transportation, and communications play 
in an eco  n  omy.  
  T o gain a sense of the role of technology in the 
economy, the   occupational structure of the labor force   
can be measured using the percentage of workers 
employed in various sectors of the economy. A high per-centage of laborers engaged in the production of food staples signals a low overall level of development, as conve  n  tionally deﬁ  ned, and a high percentage of work-
ers involved in high-tech industries and services signals 
a high level of development.   Productivity per worker     is

students in the United States. The women pictured here collaborated with me on a research/activism project for migrant women wor  k  ers in Indonesia. The woman on the left (“Rina”) had returned from working in Saudi Arabia as a domestic worker for two years. She wanted to return to Saudi Arabia for another contract to earn more money for herself and her family, but she was concerned about her rights and her safety. She had been e  m  ployed by a person she considered fair and reasonable, but she had heard from friends and neighbors that many migrants had exper  i  enced serious abuses while abroad. The woman pictured on the right (“Sorani”) is an Indonesian activist who works in support of migrant rights. She discussed with Rina and me her strategies for mobilizing political change, and she helped us to see possibilities for building transnational alliances among American and Indon  e  sian workers, students, and activists. Based on these interviews, as well as many years of working with migrant women working in factories in Indonesia, my own research has i  n  creasingly sought to understand the ways in which we in the United States, as scholars, students, workers, and consumers, can better serve global justice.

 How Is Development Deﬁ  ned and Measured? 339
examined by summing production over the course of a 
year and dividing it by the total number of persons in the labor force. A more productive workforce points to a higher level of mechanization in production. T o mea-sure access to technology, some analysts use   transpo  r-
  tation and communications facilities per person  , which 
reduces railway, road, airline co  n  nections, telephone, 
radio, television, and so forth to a per capita index and 
reﬂ ects the amount of infrastructure that exists to f  a  cili-
tate economic activity. Figure 10.3 highlights some of 
the extraordinary disparities in communications access around the world.  
  Other analysts focus on social welfare to measure 
development. One way to measure social welfare is the 
  dependency ratio  , a measure of the number of depen-
dents, young and old, that each 100 employed people 
must support (Fig. 10.4). A high dependency ratio can result in signiﬁ  cant economic and social strain. Y et, as we saw in Chapter 2, the aging countries of Europe have high dependency ratios and also very high per cap-ita GNIs. We can employ countless other statistics to measure social welfare, including literacy rates, infant mo  r  tality, life expectancy, caloric intake per person, 
percentage of family income spent on food, and amount 
of sa  v  ings per capita.  
  Looking through all of the maps that measure devel-
opment, we gain a sense that many countries come out in 
approximately the same position no matter which of these measures is used. Each map and each statistic shares one limit with per capita GNI: they do not capture differences in development   within   countries, a question we consider 
at the end of this chapter.  
  Development Models  
  This discussion of ways of measuring development takes 
us back to another problem with terminology. The word   developing   suggests that all countries are improving their 
place in each of these indicators, increasing literacy, 
improving communications, or increasing productiv-ity per worker. Beyond the problem of term  i  nology, the 
very effort to classify countries in terms of levels of devel-
opment has come under increasing a  t  tack. The central 
concern is that development suggests a single trajectory 
through which all countries move. The development model, then, does not take geographical differences very seriously. Just because Japan moved from a rural, agrarian state to an urbanized, industrial one does not mean that Mali will, or that it will do so in the same way. Another criticism of the development model is that the conceptu-alization of deve  l  opment has a Western bias. Critics argue 
that some of the measures taken in poorer countries that 
the West views as progress, such as attracting industry and mechanizing agriculture, can lead to worsened social and environmental cond  i  tions for many people in the 
poorer countries. Still others criticize the development 
model because it does not consider the ability of some countries to inﬂ  uence what happens in other cou  n  tries, 
or the different positions countries occupy in the world 
economy. Instead, the development model treats coun-tries as autonomous units moving through a process of development at di  f  ferent speeds.  
  The classic development model, one that is subject 
to each of these criticisms, is economist Walt Rostow’s 
  modernization model  . Many theories of development 
grew out of the major decolonization movements of the 
1960s. Concerned with how the dozens of newly indepen-dent countries in Africa and Asia would survive ec  o  nomi-
cally, Rostow looked to how the economically powerful countries had gotten where they were.  
  Rostow’s model assumes that all countries fol-
low a similar path to development or modernization, 
advancing through ﬁ  ve stages of development. In the CountryInternet Users

  Dependency Ratio.     The dependency ratio is a measure of the number of people under the age 
of 15 and over the age of 65 that depends on each working-age adult. The working-age adults in 
the formal economy contribute to a country’s tax base, thereby supporting the young and old in the country. The higher the number, the more “dependents” (under 15 or over 65) each working age adult supports through taxes.

ﬁ rst stage, the society is   traditional  , and the dominant 
activity is su  b  sistence   farming. The social structure 
is rigid, and technology is slow to change. The second 
stage brings the   preconditions of takeoff  . New leadership 
moves the country toward greater ﬂ  exibility, openness, 
and divers  i  ﬁ cation. These changes, in turn, will lead to 
the third stage,   takeoff  . Now the country experiences 
something akin to an industrial revolution, and sustained 
growth takes hold. Urbanization increases, industrializa-tion proceeds, and technological and mass-production breakthroughs occur. Next, the economy enters the fourth stage, the   drive to maturity  . T echnologies dif-
fuse, industrial specialization occurs, and international 
trade expands. Mo  d  ernization is evident in key areas of 
the country, and population growth slows. In Rostow’s 
model, some countries reach the ﬁ  nal stage,   high     mass 
consumption  , which is marked by high i  n  comes and wide-
spread production of many goods and services. During 
this stage, a majority of workers enter the se  r  vice sector 
of the economy.  c10Development.indd Page 340  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 340  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  Another name for Rostow’s model (and other models 
derived from it) is the   ladder of development  . Vis  u  ally, we 
can see his ﬁ  ve stages of development as rungs on a lad-
der (Fig. 10.5), with each country climbing the ladder 
one rung at a time. In addition to the general criticisms of development models, the major pro  b  lem with Rostow’s 
model is that it provides no larger context to development. 
Is a climb up the ladder truly dependent on what happens within one country? Or do we need to take into account all of the other cou  n  tries, their places on the ladder, and how 
their actions as well as global forces affect an individual 
cou  n  try’s movement on the ladder? The theory also misses 
the forces that can inﬂ  uence development decisions within an individual country, leaving us to wonder where cultural 
and political differences ﬁ  t into the pi  c  ture.  
  Because it is descriptive of the experiences of some 
countries, Rostow’s model is still inﬂ  uential, despite all of 
these criticisms. Even the notion of calling wealthy coun-
tries “industrialized” and saying poor countries need to “industrialize” implies that economic development can be achieved only by climbing the same la  d  der of develop-
ment wealthier countries have already climbed. Y et if a 
poor country quickly industrialized today through foreign investment, it might not reap much economic beneﬁ  t, but 
it could experience severe enviro  n  mental consequences. 
It is also interesting to note that the “industrial” countries c10Development.indd Page 341  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 341  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

of today are really “postindu  s  trial,” in that industrial pro-
duction has now shifted away from some of the wealthiest 
parts of the planet (Cha  p  ter 12).  
  
  
  Is the idea of economic development inherently Western? If 
the West (North America and Europe) were not encouraging the “developing world” to “develop,” how would people in the regions of the “developing world” think about their own economies?  
  HOW DOES GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION 
AFFECT DEVELOPMENT?  
  Development happens in   context  : it reﬂ  ects what is 
happening in a place as a result of forces operating co  n-
  cu  r  rently at multiple scales. T o understand why some 
countries are poor and others are wealthy, we need to co  n-
  sider the context not only at the state scale, but also at the 
local, regional, and global scales.    At the global scale, European ideas of the state and 
economic exchange diffused throughout the world via 
colonialism, bringing much of the world into the capi-talist world-economy. The Industrial Revolution and colonia  l  ism made colonies dependent on the colonizers 
and brought wealth to the colonizers. Even after the 
end of c  o  lonization, the economic, political, and social 
interlinkages of the world economy persist. In the 
capitalist world economy, the ﬂ  ow of capital changed little after decolonization. Many development schol-ars argue that today the poor are experiencing   neo-
colonialism  , whereby the major world powers continue 
to control the economies of the poorer countries, even 
though the poorer countries are now politically ind  e-
  pendent states.  
  Development scholars have produced a number of the-
ories that take into account the context of neo-colonialism; 
  these theories are called structuralist theories. A   struc-
turalist theory   holds that difﬁ  cult-to-change, large-scale 
economic arrangements shape what can happen in fun-
damental ways. The development of the global economy brought into being a set of structural circumstances, such as the concentration of wealth in certain areas and u  n  equal relations among places, that make it very difﬁ  cult 
for poorer regions to improve their economic situation. Structuralists argue that these countries face a very differ-ent set of development circumstances than those faced by the countries of western Europe that Rostow looked at in constructing his modern  i  zation model.  
  Dependency Theory  
  Structuralists have developed a major body of develop-
ment theory called   dependency theory  , which holds 
that the political and economic relationships between 
countries and regions of the world control and limit the economic development possibilities of poorer areas. Dependency theorists note, for example, that colo-nia  l  ism cr  e  ated political and economic structures that 
caused the colonies to become dependent on the colo-
nial powers. They further argue that such dependency helps sustain the prosperity of dominant regions and the p  o  verty of other regions, even after decolonization 
occurs.  
  Many poorer countries tie their currency to a 
wealthy country’s currency, either by tying the value of 
their currency to the wealthy country’s currency or by completely adopting the wealthy country’s currency as their own, creating a signiﬁ  cant link between the poor and wealthy countries’ economies. For example, El Sa  l  vador went through a process of   dollarization  , 
whereby the country’s currency, the colon, was aba  n-
  doned in favor of the dollar (Fig. 10.6). For the peo-
ple of El Salvador, dollarization made sense because the    Figure 10.5  
  Rostow’s Ladder of Development.     This ladder assumes that 
all countries can reach the same level of development and that 
all will follow a similar path.   Adapted with permission from:    P . J.

 How Does Geographical Situation Affect Development? 343
economies of the two countries were tied long before 
dollarization occurred. Over 2 million Salvadorians live in the United States, and in 2010, they sent $3.5 billion in remittances to El Salvador. With this ﬂ  ow of American dollars to El Salvador, many transactions occurred in dollars long before the ofﬁ  cial switch. The United Nations Development Program estimates that 22.3 per-cent of families in El Salvador receive remi  t  tances. In 
addition, over two-thirds of El Salvador’s exports go to 
the United States. When the Federal R  e  serve Board in 
the United States controls the supply of dollars by alter-
ing the interest rates, the ramiﬁ  cations are felt directly in El Salv  a  dor.  
  Dependency theory contends that economic pros-
perity is extremely difﬁ  cult to achieve in regions and cou  n-
  tries that have traditionally been dominated by external 
powers. Y et some traditionally “dependent” regions have made economic gains. Like modernization theory, depen-dency theory is based on generalizations about economic change that pay relatively little attention to geographi-cal differences in culture, politics, and soc  i  ety. Although 
both models provide some i  n  sights into the development 
process, neither is greatly concerned with the spatial and cultural situation of particular places—central elements of geograph  i  cal analysis.  
  Geography and Context  
  As geographers, economists, and other social scientists 
came to realize that studying economic development divorced from political and social context did not reﬂ  ect 
reality, geographers began to search for a develo  p  ment the-
ory that encompassed geography, scale, place, and culture. 
Immanuel Wallerstein’s   world-systems theory   provided 
a useful framework for many. We discussed world-systems 
theory in Chapter 8, focusing on how the theory provides insights into the political organization of space. In this chap-ter, we focus on how world-systems theory helps us under-stand the geography of development.  
  Many geographers are drawn to world-systems 
theory because it is sensitive to the relationships among 
d  e  velopment processes that occur in different places. 
Speciﬁ  cally, W allerstein’s division of the world into a   three-
tier structure  —the core, periphery, and semiperiphery—
helps explain the interconnections between places in the 
global economy. As discussed in more detail in Chapter 8, core processes gene  r  ate wealth in a place because they 
require higher levels of education, more sophisticated 
technologies, and higher wages and beneﬁ  ts. When core 
processes are embedded in a place (such as the T elecom corridor in Richardson-Plano, T exas), wealth is gener-ated for the people in that place. Peripheral processes, on the other hand, r  e  quire little education, lower tech-
nologies, and lower wages and beneﬁ  ts. Core regions are 
those that have achieved high levels of socioeconomic 
prosperity and are dominant players in the global eco-nomic game. When peripheral processes are embed-ded in a place (such as banana growers in Ecuador), the processes o  f  ten generate little wealth for the people in 
that place. Periphery regions are poor regions that are 
d  e  pendent in signiﬁ  cant ways on the core and do not 
have as much control over their own affairs, economi-
cally or p  o  litically. The semiper  i  phery exhibits both 
core and peripheral processes, and semiperipheral places 
serve as a buffer between the core and periphery in the world-economy. Countries of the semiperiphery exert more power than peripheral regions but remain heavily inﬂ uenced by core regions.  
  Dividing the world into cores, semiperipheries, and 
peripheries might seem to do little more than replace 
developed, developing, and underdeveloped with a new    Figure 10.6

set of terms. But the core–periphery model is fu  n  damentally 
different from the modernization model because it holds 
that not all places can be equally wea  l  thy in the capital-
ist world-economy. World-systems theory also makes the power relations among places expl  i  cit and does not 
assume that socioeconomic change will occur in the same way in all places. It is thus sensitive to geograph  i  cal con-
text, at least in economic terms.  
  Geographer Peter J. T aylor uses the analogy of a 
school of tadpoles to demonstrate these ideas. He env  i-
  sions different places in the world as tadpoles and explains 
that not all tadpoles can survive to develop into toads. Rather, those who dominate survive, and the others per-ish. World-systems theorists see domination (explo  i  ta-
tion) as a function of the capitalist drive for proﬁ  t in the 
global economy. Thus, capitalists can move pr  o  duction 
quickly from one place to another around the globe to enhance proﬁ  ts, but places that lose a produ  c  tion facility 
can suffer. Moreover, their coping capacity can be small if, as is often the case, they earlier abandoned trad  i  tional 
ways and shifted to an export economy when external investment ﬁ  rst arrived.  
  World-systems theory is applicable at scales beyond 
the state. A core–periphery relationship can exist within 
a region, a state (country), or a local area. For example, Los Angeles can be described as the core of the Sout  h  ern 
California region; the Johannesburg area can be described as the core of the South African state; or the Central Business District can be described as the core of São Paulo, Brazil.  
  
  
  Compare and contrast Rostow’s ladder of development with Wallerstein’s three-tier structure of the world economy as models for understanding a significant eco-nomic shift that has occurred in a place with which you are familiar.   
  WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS TO AND THE 
COSTS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT?  
  International organizations and governments 
measure development and then create programs to 
help i  m  prove the condition of humans around the 
world, especially in the poorest countries of the world. 
By mea  s  uring h  u  man development, organizations and governments hope to discern how to break down barri-
ers to development and improve the human condition globally.  
  One of the most widely referenced measurements 
of development today is the United Nations Human 
D  e  velopment Index (Fig. 10.7). According to the 
United   Nations, the Human Development Index goes 
b  e  yond ec  o  nomics and incorporates the “three basic 
dimensions of human development: a long and healthy 
life, kno  w  ledge and a decent standard of living.” Several 
statistics, including per capita GDP , literacy rates, 
school enrollment rates, and life expectancy at birth, factor into the calculation of the Human Development Index.  
  In 2000, the United Nations held a high-proﬁ  le 
summit, during which 189 world leaders adopted the 
United Nations Millennium Declaration, with the goal of improving the condition of the people in the coun-tries with the lowest standards of human development. At the summit, world leaders recognized the principal ba  r  riers to economic development and identiﬁ  ed eight 
key development goals to be achieved by the year 2015. 
They were:  
   1.     Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.  
   2.     Achieve universal primary education.  
   3.     Promote gender equality and empower women.  
   4.     Reduce child mortality.  
   5.     Improve maternal health.  
   6.     Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.  
   7.     Ensure environmental sustainability.  
   8.     Develop a global partnership for development.  
  These   Millennium Development Goals   rep-
resent a fairly high degree of consensus about the key 
conditions that need to be changed if economic devel-opment is to be achieved. As 2015 approaches, however, it is b  e  coming increasingly clear that many of the goals 
will not be met. For example, HIV infection rates remain 
high, and extreme poverty is still the plight of countless millions.  
  Barriers to Economic Development  
  As described in the last section of this chapter, the struc-
tures and geography of the world-economy i  n  hibit eco-
nomic development in the periphery. Numerous factors serve as barriers to the economic deve  l  opment of the 
periphery. In Chapter 1, we discussed the causes of mal-nutrition, and in Chapter 2, we examined how AIDS has ravaged Subsaharan Africa. In Chapter 13, we discuss the vulnerability to natural hazards that exist in many periph eral c10Development.indd Page 344  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 344  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 What Are the Barriers to and the Costs of Economic Development? 345
countries, including the lack of infrastructure to cope with 
those hazards. It is clear that the world economic system often works to the disadvantage of the perip  h  ery but that 
the system is not the only obstacle that p  e  ripheral coun-
tries face.  
  Conditions within the periphery, such as high 
population growth rates, lack of education, foreign debt, 
aut  o  cra  t  ic (and often corrupt) leadership, political insta-
bility, and widespread disease hamper development. It is 
possible to get into the chicken-or-the-egg debate here: did the structures of the world-economy create these conditions, or do these conditions help to create the structures of the world-economy? Many think that nei-ther a  r  gument can stand alone, but understanding both 
structures and conditions is important if you are to form 
your own opi  n  ion.  
  Regardless of which came ﬁ  rst, numerous people 
throughout the periphery are burdened with familial, 
ec  o  nomic, cultural, and political hardships. In this sec-
tion of the chapter, we discuss several of the conditions 
that affect the economic development prospects of peo-ple in the poorest countries of the world, including many fa  c  tors outlined in the United Nations Millennium 
Development Goals.  
  Social Conditions  
  Countries in the periphery face numerous demographic, 
economic, and social problems. Most of the less well-off countries have relatively high birth rates and low life expectancies at birth (see Chapter 2). Across the global periphery, as much as half the population is 15 years old or younger, making the supply of adult, taxpaying l  a  borers 
low relative to the number of dependents. Low life expec-tancies and high infant and child mortality rates stem from inadequate nutrition (protein deﬁ  ciency is a com-
mon problem). Many in the global economic periphery also lack public sewage systems, clean drinking water, and access to health care, ma  k  ing economic deve  l  opment all 
the more difﬁ  cult.  
  Lack of access to education is also a major problem 
in the periphery. In some places, even the poorest fam  i  lies 
pay for their children to attend school. As a result, large 
numbers of school-age children do not go to school, and illiteracy rates are high. Moreover, access to education in the periphery is often gendered, with boys attending school longer than girls. Girls often stop attending school and instead work in the city to pay for their brothers’ school fees.  
  Lack of education for girls is founded on and com-
pounded by the widespread assumption (not just in the 
p  e  riphery but in most of the world) that girls will leave 
their homes (and communities) when they marry, no 
longer bringing income to the family. In parts of the periphery, trafﬁ  cking in children, especially girls, is co  m  mon. Mike Dottridge, a modern antislavery activ-
ist, explains that   trafﬁ cking   happens when “adults and 
chi  l  dren ﬂ  eeing poverty or seeking better prospects are 
manipulated, deceived, and bullied into working in con-
d  i  tions that they would not choose.” This phenomenon 
is not considered slavery because the family does not sell 
a child; instead the child is sent away with a recruiter in the hopes that the recruiter will send money and the child will earn money to send home. The trafﬁ  cked chil-
dren are often taken to neighboring or nearby countries that are wealthier and in demand of domestic servants. Others are trafﬁ  cked across the world, again typically to work as domestic servants. Dottridge explains that the majority of trafﬁ  cked children are girls and that the m  a  jority of girls are “employed as domestic servants or 
street vendors,” although some girls are “trafﬁ  cked into 
prostitution.”  
  Some countries are working to change access to 
primary education in order to make education unive  r-
  sally available. In 2000, the Millennium Development 
Report prompted the government of Rwanda to improve access to education. In 2003, fees for primary educa-tion were eliminated, and two years later schools started receiving revenues based on the number of students they were educating. Rwanda’s goal was to make pri-mary education available to all by 2010. Progress has been made, but it is difﬁ  cult to assess whether the goal 
was achieved. Moreover, access and completion are two different things; of the almost two million children cur-rently in primary schools, only half reach the sixth year of school. Moreover, without adequate funding to sup-port the growing student population, some of Rwanda’s st  u  dents meet under trees and many convene in swelling 
classrooms. Aid is ﬂ  owing in from outside, but sustaining 
support for the country’s educational sector remains an 
ong  o  ing challenge.  
  Foreign Debt  
  Complicating the picture further is the foreign debt 
crisis that many periphery and semiperiphery coun-tries face. Shortly after the decolonization wave of the 1960s, banks and other international ﬁ  nancial institu-
tions began lending large sums of money to the newly independent states, money earmarked for development projects. By the 1980s and 1990s, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were len  d  ing 
si  g  niﬁ cant amounts of money to peripheral and semi-
peripheral countries, but with strings attached. T o 
secure the loans, countries had to agree to implement economic or governmental reforms, such as privati  z-
  ing government entities, opening the country to for-
eign trade, reducing tariffs, and encouraging foreign d  i  rect inves  t  ment. These loans are known as   structural 
adjustment loans  .  c10Development.indd Page 345  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 345  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  Once peripheral countries owe money to the IMF ,

  Structural adjustment loans were part of a larger 
trend toward   neoliberalism   in the late twentieth ce  n  tury. 
Neoliberalism derives from the neo-classical economic i  dea that government intervention into markets is i  n  ef-

possible. These ideas were at the heart of the conditions 
that were attached to loans and reﬁ  nancing programs, but

of economic control from states to the private sector. This 
development, in turn, fostered economic globalization while shrinking the size of the public sector in a number of cou  n  tries. The trade-off, however, was the expansion of 
corporate control and the erosion of the ability of regional and state governments to control their economic destinies. 
Hence, the neoliberal turn has been highly conte  n  tious.

spending also was also unsustainably high, and corruption was rampant (Fig. 10.9).    By 2005, internal economic growth and aid from 
Venezuela put Argentina in a position to work out a co  m-

back from the brink. Argentina’s agricultural economy bounced back in 2010 with the rise of corn and soy  prices. SLOVENIA

350 Chapter 10   Development
Argentina’s economy is stabilizing, but in cases where 
countries are facing imminent econo  m  ic, political, and 
social meltdown, the only alternative may be to default on loans. Defaulting countries then ﬁ  nd themselves in a 
severely disadvantaged position when it comes to attract-ing f  u  ture external investment. And if a substantial num-
ber of countries were to default at the same time, a global economic crisis could ensue that would work to the disad-vantage of almost everyone.  
  Disease  
  Those living in the global economic periphery experience 
comparatively high rates of disease and a corr  e  spon  d  ing lack 
of adequate health care. These circumstances directly affect 
economic development, making survival difﬁ  cult for many 
people, orphaning children, and weakening the labor force.  
  As highlighted in Chapters 1 and 2, the high concen-
tration of HIV/AIDS cases in parts of the periphery pr  e  s-
ents a signiﬁ  cant obstacle to development—particularly in 
parts of Subsaharan Africa. Moreover,   vectored diseases   —
those spread by one host (person) to another by an interme-
diate host or vector—are a scourge in warm, humid parts of the periphery and semiperiphery. The warm, moist cli-mates of tropical environments e  n  hance biological activity. 
Vectors abound in such environments, and infectious dis-
eases spread rapidly through host populations.  
  Development experts look at malaria as a “silent tsu-
nami” in the periphery, comparing its death toll to the tsu-
nami that ravaged South and Southeast Asia in late 2004. That tsunami killed some 300,000 people (i  n  cluding 
children)   at once  . Malaria kills about   150,000 children   in the global periphery   each month  .   Malaria   is an infectious 
disease spread by mosquitoes that carry the parasite in 
their saliva. Scientists did not dete  r  mine the role of mos-
quitoes in the diffusion of the disease until the late eigh-teenth century. T oday, the s  e  quence of the disease is well 
known. The mosquito stings an infected host and sucks up some of the di  s  ease agents. In the mosquito’s stomach, the 
parasites reproduce and multiply, eventually reaching its saliva. When the mosqu  i  to stings the next person, some of 
the parasites are injected into that person’s bloodstream. The person who has been stung deve  l  ops malaria and 
becomes a host.  
  The disease manifests itself through recurrent fever 
and chills, with associated symptoms such as anemia and 
an enlarged spleen. Nearly one million people in the world die of the disease each year. Malaria is a m  a  jor fac-
tor in infant and child mortality, as most of the victims are children age 5 or younger. If a person su  r  vives the dis-
ease, he or she will develop a certain degree of immunity. However, many infected by malaria are weak, lack energy, and face an increased risk of other diseases taking hold in their weakened body.  
  Malaria occurs throughout the world, except in 
higher latitudes and altitudes, and drier environments. 
A  l  though people in the tropical portions of Africa suffer 
most from this disease, malaria is also prevalent in India, Sout  h  east Asia, parts of southern China, and the tropical 
Americas.  
  Several types of malaria spread throughout these 
regions, with some being more severe than others. In 
add  i  tion to humans, various species of monkeys, rats, 
birds, and even snakes can be affected by the disease. In   Field Note  
  “Arriving in Argentina during the political and economic upheavals that had begun in 2001, I saw signs of dislocation and trouble everywhere. Beggars pursued pedestrians on the once-fashionable Avenida Florida. Banks had installed protec-tive shutters against angry crowds demanding return of their frozen and devalued d  e  posits. A bus trip on the Patagonian Highway turned into an adventure when masked protesters carrying rocks and burning rags stopped vehicles and threat-ened their occupants. Newspapers carried reports of sta  r  va-tion in T  u  cumán Province—in a country capable of producing seven times the food its population needs.”

 What Are the Barriers to and the Costs of Economic Development? 351
Subsaharan Africa, malaria’s virulence results from the 
effectiveness of its vectors—three African mosqu  i  toes 
(  An  o  pheles gambiae, A. arabiensis  , and   A. funestus  ). Whole 
populations are afﬂ  icted, and entire regions have been 
abandoned because of the prevalence of the disease.  
  Antimalarial drugs exist, but to defeat malaria, 
afﬂ icted regions must eliminate the vector: the mosquito. 
During the 1940s, the government of Sri Lanka (then 
Ceylon) launched a massive attack on the mo  s  quito with 
the aid of a pesticide called   dichloro diphenyl trichloroeth-
ane   (DDT). The results were dramatic. The mosquito was 
practically wiped out, and the rate of deaths attributable 
to malaria fell markedly. In 1945, Sri Lanka’s death rate overall had been 22 per 1000; in 1972, it reported a death rate of only 8 per 1000. The ﬁ  gure was fu  r  ther reduced 
to 5 per 1000 by 2004 and then rose again to 7 in 2009, as reﬂ ected in Figure 10.10.  
  The conquest of malaria produced a new set of 
problems, however. DDT proved to be highly carcino-
genic and to have negative health and environmental consequences of its own. Also, the lowered death rate through malaria eradication led to a substantial rise in the population growth rate, creating new pro  b  lems for 
Sri Lanka. By the time the birth rate dropped (it is 19 
per 1000 today), the island had experienced a popul  a-
  tion e  x  plosion.  
  Success in combating major vectored diseases often 
is only temporary. Following the Sri Lankan exper  i  ment, 
India initiated a massive assault against the malaria mos-
quito, and the number of new cases of m  a  laria declined 
dramatically. But ten years after the program was intro-
duced, India reported that 60 million people were infected with malaria, more than half the number who had the disease before the antimalaria campaign began. This example proved the mosquito population’s ability to rebound quickly after even the most inte  n  sive applic  a-
  tion of pesticides.  
  T oday the war against malaria is taking a new tack: 
genetic interference with the mosquito so that its capa  c  ity 
to transmit the malaria parasite,   Plasmodium  , is destroyed. 
By introducing “engineered” mosquitoes into the gen-
eral population, health experts hope that the number of nonvirulent mosquitoes will rise si  g  niﬁ cantly. A number 
of programs also focus on distributed insecticide-laden mosquito nets to surround sleeping qua  r  ters and protect 
people from the mosquitoes that are most active at night (Fig. 10.11).  
  Political Corruption and Instability  
  Although not addressed in the Millennium Development 
goals, political corruption and instability can greatly impede economic development as well. Establishing a sta-ble, legitimate government that can mai  n  tain control over and lead a low-income country can be a daunting task. In peripheral countries, a wide d  i  vide often exists b  e  tween 
the very wealthy and the poorest of the poor. In Kenya, for example, the wealthiest 10 percent of the population controls nearly 50 percent of the country’s wealth, and the poorest 10 percent control less than 1 percent of Kenya’s wealth. The disenfranchisement of the poor and the com-petition among the rich for control of the government (and the potential spoils that go along with that) can lead to extreme political instability within a state—as Kenya experienced in 2007–2008. Add to these factors i  n  volve-
ment from outside the country, especially by powerful countries, and the political instability can ea  s  ily escalate, 
yielding horrid conditions in which military dictators, selﬁ sh megalomaniacs, and corrupt go  v  ernments can 
come to power.  
  Countries of the core have established democracies 
for themselves; since World War II, they have held reg-
ularly scheduled democratic elections. But countries in the periphery and semiperiphery have had a much harder time establishing and maintaining democracies. In the process of decolonization, the colonizing countries typi-cally left governments that reﬂ  ected political and social 
hierarchies during the c  o  lonial period. Some failed, some 
were overthrown by military coups, and some saw the 
consolidation of power around a di  c  tatorial strongman. 
Many countries in the periphery and semiperiphery have 
alternated repeatedly between qu  a  si-democratic and 
military governments. Some argue that without consid-
erable wealth, maintaining a liberal democracy is all but impossible.  
  Opening the homepage of any major newspaper on 
any given day will reveal a story somewhere in the world 
that demonstrates the link between economic stability and political stability. In post-T aliban Afghanistan, eco-nomic woes represent one of the greatest threats to the stability of the United States-supported gover  n  ment 
in Kabul. More than half of the population is impover-
ished, and the government lacks the funds to i  n  vest in 
deve  l  opment. Foreign aid—much of it from the United 
States—has provided some help, but the ﬂ  ow of aid has 
been variable and its amount insufﬁ  cient to address the country’s searing economic problems. Many an  a  lysts 
see this as a key impediment to achieving stability in 
Afghanistan. As the   Economist   put it in 2006, “p  o  verty 
helps the T aliban.”  
  In places where poverty is rampant, politicians often 
become corrupt, misusing aid and exacerbating the plight 
of the poor. In Zimbabwe, the year 2002 left many people starving, as poor weather cond  i  tions created a meager 
harvest. The country’s ruling party, ZANU-PF , headed 
by Robert Mugabe, d  e  manded cards from Zimbabweans 
who registered for the “food for work” program—cards 
demonstrating me  m  bership in the ZANU-PF politi-
cal party. As conditions worsened in subsequent years, c10Development.indd Page 351  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 351  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

the Mugabe go  v  ernment faced increasing resistance. 
A potential challenger, Morgan T svangirai, emerged in 
2008. Me  m  bers of his opposition party were killed and 
the challenger was harassed, but after a contested elec-
tion that many believe T svangirai won, a power-sharing agreement came into effect that kept Mugabe as presi-dent and made T svangirai the prime minister. Some sta-bility returned to the country, but continuing tensions make it difﬁ  cult to address Zimbabwe’s enormous ec  o-
  nomic problems.  
  The Zimbabwe case shows that in low-income 
countries, corrupt leaders can stay in power for decades    Figure 10.10

b  e  cause the people are afraid to rise up against the lead-
er’s extreme power or because those who have risen up 
have been killed or harmed by the leader’s followers. Circumstances and timing need to work t  o  gether to allow 
a new government to come to power. When governments become excessively corrupt, other countries and non-governmental organizations sometimes cut off develop-ment aid to the country. Y et when this ha  p  pens, everyday 
people often bear the brunt of hardship. Even when the global community cuts off the co  r  rupt gover  n  ment’s aid, 
core countries and nongovernmental organizations often try to provide food aid to the people. All too frequently, Tropic of CancerArctic Circle

when this type of aid reaches its intended beneﬁ  ciaries, it 
is rarely sufﬁ  cient to meet basic needs or reverse the tra-
je  c  tory of hardship in the country.  
  Costs of Economic Development  
  Economic development changes a place. T o increase 
productivity, whether industrial or agricultural, pe  o-
  ple transform the environment. When a country goes 
through intensiﬁ  cation of   industrial production,   air 
and surface water are often polluted. Pollution is not 
conﬁ ned to industry. With intensiﬁ  cation of   agricul-
tural produ  c  tion  , the introduction of pesticides and 
herbicides can have deleterious impacts on the soil and 
groundw  a  ter.   T ourism   can be just as difﬁ  cult on the 
environment—taxing the existing infrastructure beyond 
its c  a  pacities. The costs of tourism often stretch far 
beyond the environment, affecting ways of life and fun-
d  a  mentally altering the cultural lan  d  scape.  
  Industrialization  
  In their efforts to attract new industries, the governments 
of many countries in the global periphery and semip  e-
  riphery have set up special manufacturing export zones 
called   export processing zones (EPZs),   which offer 
f  a  vorable tax, regulatory, and trade arrangements to for-
eign ﬁ  rms. By the early 2000s, more than 60 cou  n  tries had 
established such zones, and many of these had become 
major manufacturing centers (Fig. 10.12). T wo of the best known of these zones are the Mexican   maquilado-
ras   and the   special ec  o  nomic zones   of China (di  s  cussed in Chapter 9). Governments locate such zones in places 
with easy access to export markets. Thus, the maqu  i  la-
dora zone in Mexico is situated directly across the border 
from the United States, and the special economic zones of China are located near major ports. These zones typi-cally attract a mix of manufacturing operations, depend-ing on the skill levels of the labor force and the available infrastructure.  
  The maquiladora program started in 1965 when the 
Mexican government designated the region of nort  h  ern 
Mexico as a maquiladora district, making it a place where 
raw materials could be shipped into Mexico, manufactured into goods, and then sent back to the United States free of import tariffs. U.S. corporations rel  o  cated manufacturing 
plants to Mexico to take advantage of the program.  
  Although the maquiladora phenomenon started in 
1965, it did not really take off until the 1980s. During the 
1980s, American companies recognized the expanding wage and beneﬁ  t differences between the Uni  t  ed States 
and Mexican worker and began relocating to the maqui-ladora district in northern Mexico. Although competition from other parts of the world has led to the closing of some plants, today some 3000 maqu  i  ladoras continue to func-
tion, employing 1 million workers and accounting for 50 percent of Mexico’s e  x  ports. The maquiladora plants pro-
duce goods such as electronic equipment, electrical appli-ances, autom  o  biles, textiles, plastics, and furniture. The 
plants are controversial both in Mexico and the United States, as corporations that have r  e  located there avoid the 
employment and environmental regulations that are in force just a few miles to the north. Many m  a  quiladora fac-
tories hire young women and men for low pay and few if    Figure 10.11

peoples living in low latitudes, which is an impediment to economic develo  p  ment.

any beneﬁ  ts, putting them to work in repetitive jobs, often 
in environmentally questionable co  n  ditions.  
  In 1992, the United States, Mexico, and Canada 
established the   North American Free Trade 
Agre  e  ment (NAFTA)  , which prompted further indus-
trialization of the border region. NAFTA took effect 
January 1, 1994. In addition to manufacturing plants, NAFTA has facilitated the movement of service indus-tries from the United States to Mexico, including data processing operations. Most of the new plants are located in two di  s  tricts: Tijuana on the Paciﬁ  c Coast—linked to 
San Diego across the border—and Ciudad Juarez on the 
Rio Grande across from El Paso, T exas. In recent years the socioeconomic and environmental contrasts b  e  tween 
cities on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border have 
become increasingly stark. Violent crime has b  e  come a 
particularly serious problem in Juarez, even as El Paso 
remains comparatively safe, and the slums of Tijuana are a world apart from much of San Diego. Although NAFTA was designed to foster increased int  e  raction in 
North America, cross-border disparities have worked 
together with growing U.S. concerns over illegal imm  i-
  gration and the inﬁ  ltration of foreign terrorists to make 
the U.S.-Mexico border more tightly co  n  trolled and 
more difﬁ  cult to cross than in prior decades.  
  Agriculture  
  In peripheral countries, agriculture typically focuses 
on personal consumption or on production for a large agricultural conglomerate. Where zones of larger-scale, modernized agriculture have developed in the p  e  riph-
ery, foodstuffs are produced for the foreign market and 
often have minimal impact on the impoverished condi-tions of the surrounding lands. Little is produced for the local marketplace because distribution sy  s  tems are poorly 
organized and because the local population is typically 
unable to pay for foodstuffs. If the local population owns land, their landholdings are usually fragmented, creating small plots of land that are difﬁ  cult to farm in a ma  n  ner 
that produces much income. Even on larger plots of land, 
most farmers are equipped with outdated, inefﬁ      cient 
tools and equipment. The main crops tend to be grains 
and roots; farmers produce little protein because high-protein crops typically have lower yields than grain crops. On the farms in the periphery, yields per unit area are low, subsistence modes of life prevail, and many families are co  n  stantly in debt.  
  Impoverished farmers can ill afford such luxuries 
as fertilizers, and educational levels are typically too low 
to achieve widespread soil conservation. As a result, soil erosion is commonplace in most peripheral areas. S  e  vere 
soil erosion in areas with dry or semiarid climates around deserts results in extreme degradation of the land and the spread of the desert into these lands. Although the expan-sion and contraction of deserts can occur naturally and cyclically, the process of   desertiﬁ  cation   is more often 
exacerbated by humans destroying veg  e  tation and ero  d-
  ing soils through the overuse of lands for livestock grazing 
or crop production.     Figure 10.12

  Desertiﬁ  cation has hit Africa harder than any of the 
other continents (Fig. 10.13). More than half of Africa is 
arid or semiarid, and many people farm the marginal, dry lands of the continent. Land ownership pa  t  terns, the need 
for crops and protein sources (both for local consumption and for export), and power di  f  ferences among groups of 
people lead some farmers and ranchers to turn marginal, semiarid lands into farm and ranch lands. Lands that are available for farming or ranching may be used more inten-sively in order to increase agricultu  r  al production (see 
Chapter 13). In semiarid regions, the decision to farm more intensively and increase agricultural production has the unintended consequence of eroding the land, e  n  cour-
aging out-migration, and creating conﬂ  ict.  
  In Subsaharan Africa over the last 50 years, more 
than 270,000 square miles (700,000 square kilometers) 
of farming and grazing land have become desert, extend-ing the Sahara Desert to the south. Some of the African c10Development.indd Page 356  10/21/11  12:18 PM user f-400c10Development.indd Page 356  10/21/11  12:18 PM user f-400 F-400F-400

desertiﬁ  cation may be caused by climatic ﬂ  uctuations, but 
overgrazing, woodcutting, soil exhaustion, and misuse 
have u  n  doubtedly accelerated the process.  
  Tourism  
  All development strategies have pros and cons, as is well 
illustrated by the case of tourism. Peripheral island coun-tries in the Caribbean region of Middle America and in other parts of the world have become leading dest  i  na-
tions for millions of tourists from richer states. T ourism is now one of the major industries in the world and has sur-passed oil in its overall economic value, and it sometimes brings some wealth and e  m  ployment to these countries 
(see Chapter 12). T ourism may also have serious negative effects on cultures and environments.  
  In economic terms, to develop tourism the “host” 
country must make a substantial investment. Sometimes c10Development.indd Page 357  10/21/11  12:18 PM user f-400c10Development.indd Page 357  10/21/11  12:18 PM user f-400 F-400F-400
358 Chapter 10   Development
imports of building materials and equipment strain the 
country’s supply system, and funds are diverted to hotel construction that could have been spent on other needs such as housing for citizens. Moreover, many hotels and other tourist facilities are owned not by the host country but by large multinational corporations. These corpora-tions earn enormous proﬁ  ts, most of which are sent back 
to owners, shareholders, and exec  u  tives.  
  Countries that do earn substantial income from tour-
ism include Thailand, Kenya, Barbados, and Fiji.   Much of 
the income a country receives from tourism revenues are 
reinvested in the construction of ai  r  ports, cruise-ports, and 
other infrastructure that supports more tourism. T ourism 
can create local jobs, but they are often low-paying and have little job security. In tourist zones, many employees work two or three jobs in o  r  der to break even. T ourism can 
bring wealth to owners, shareholders, and executives out-
side of tourist destinations.  
  T ourism frequently strains the fabric of local com-
munities as well. The invasion of poor communities by 
wea  l  thier visitors can foster antipathy and resentment. 
T ourism can also have the effect of altering, and even debasing, local culture, which is adapted to suit the visi-tors’ taste. In many instances tourism fosters a “de  m  on-
stration effect” among locals that encourages them to behave in ways that may please or interest the vis  i  tors but 
that is disdained by the larger local community. Some tourism workers consider emplo  y  ment in the tourist 
industry dehumanizing because it demands displays of friendliness and servitude that locals ﬁ  nd i  n  sulting.  
  A ﬂ  ood of afﬂ  uent tourists may be appealing to 
the government of a poor country whose elite may have 
a ﬁ     nancial stake in the hotels where they can share the 
pleasures of the wealthy, but local entrepreneurs often 
take a different view. Indeed, powerful multinational cor-porations and national governments may intervene to limit the opportunities of local, small-scale operators in favor of mass, prearranged tourist destinations (“excl  u-
  sive” resorts) that isolate the tourist from local society. 
Overreliance on tourism can also leave an economy vul-ner  a  ble if shifting economic circumstances cause a sharp 
decline in the number of tourists or if natural disasters hit. Because many tourist destinations in poorer countries are beach attractions, natural ha  z  ards such as the 2004 tsu-
nami in Southeast Asia can destroy the lynchpin of a coun-try’s economy (we di  s  cuss the tsunami and other na  t  ural 
hazards in greater detail in Chapter 13). Suffering the loss of thousands of people; dealing with the after-effects of sewage, homelessness, orphans, and the destitute; and coping with rebuilding the tourist destinations must occur while the ﬂ  ow of tourist-related income has stopped.  
  The cultural landscape of tourism is frequently a 
study in harsh contrasts: gleaming hotels tower over mo  d-
  est, often poor housing; luxury liners glide past poverty-
stricken villages; opulent meals are served in hotels while, down the street, children suffer from malnutrition. If the tourist industry offered real prospects for economic prog-ress in low-income countries, such circumstances might be viewed as temporary, unfortunate by-products. However, the evidence too often points in the other direction.  
  
  
  Think of a trip you have made to a poorer area of the coun-try or a poorer region of the world. Describe how your expe-rience in the place as a tourist was fundamentally different from the everyday lives of the people who live in the place.  
  HOW DO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
INSTITUTIONS INFLUENCE UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT WITHIN STATES?  
  In our globalized world, poverty is not conﬁ  ned to 
the periphery. Core countries have regions and peoples 
that are markedly poorer than others. On the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the northern Great Plains of the United States, unemployment hovers at 80 percent, and more than 60 percent of the people live in poverty with a per capita income of just over $6000. Other countries of the core have similar regions where peoples’ ec  o  nomic 
lives do not improve when the country’s economy grows. In Europe, areas of isolation and stagnation persist—particularly in the east. At the same time, some places in peripheral countries are experiencing rapid economic growth. The local conditions in these places differ sharply from those prevailing in surrounding a  r  eas. Recent eco-
nomic growth on the Paciﬁ  c Rim of East Asia has created huge regional disparities in ec  o  nomic conditions between 
some coastal provinces of China and distant interior prov-inces. Such regional ec  o  nomic contrasts have signiﬁ  cant 
polit  i  cal as well as social consequences.  
  As noted at the beginning of this chapter, regional 
contrasts in wealth are a reminder that per capita GNI 
does not accurately represent the economic development of individual places. Any statistic that is derived for an entire country or State hides the variety of economic situ-ations within. Peripheral countries are not  o  riously marked 
by severe regional disparities. In Chapter 9 we discussed 
the stark contrasts between wealthy and poor within Latin American and African cities. When viewed at the scale of the State, major cities (particularly capitals) and their surroundings often look like islands of prosperity, with c10Development.indd Page 358  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 358  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Do Political and Economic Institutions Inﬂ  uence Uneven Development Within States?  359
modern buil  d  ings, factories on the outskirts, and modern 
farms nearby. In some cases roads and rails lead to a bustling 
port, where luxury automobiles are unloaded for use by the privileged elite and raw materials or agricultural products from the cou  n  try are exported to points around the world. 
In these core areas of countries, the rush of “progress” may 
be ev  i  dent. If you travel a few miles into the countryside or 
into a different neighborhood in the city, however, you will 
likely see a very different picture. The contrasts between rich and poor areas are not simply the result of differences in the economic endowments of places. Government policy fr  e  quently affects development patterns as well. Hence, 
in this section of the chapter we turn to how gover  n  ments 
collaborate with corporations to create islands of develop-
ment, and consider how people try to gene  r  ate growth in 
the periphery of the per  i  phery.  
  The Role of Governments  
  The actions of governments inﬂ  uence whether, how, and 
where wealth is produced. This is because the di  s  tribution 
of wealth is affected by tariffs, trade agreements, taxation structures, land ownership rules, env  i  ronmental regula-
tions, and many other manifestations of governmental authority. Government policies play an important role at the interstate level, but they also shape patterns of devel-opment within States—not just between u  r  ban and rural 
areas, but within each of these sectors.  
  Of course, governments alone do not determine pat-
terns of wealth and poverty, but they are almost always 
part of the picture. Consider the case of the Ninth Ward in New Orleans, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. On its surface, what happened to the Ninth Ward was the result of a natural disaster. But the ﬂ  ooding of that part of New Orleans was also the result of government decisions decades ago to build levies and settle ﬂ  ood-prone 
areas. The concentration of people living there was also the product of inn  u  merable pol  i  cies affecting housing, the 
construction of businesses, and the like. Once the hurricane 
hit, many looked to government to rebuild the devastated section of the city. The limited nature of the governmental response is evident in the landscape today (Fig. 10.14).  
  At a somewhat larger scale, consider the contrasts 
between parts of rural Wisconsin and rural Appalachia in 
the United States. In rural Wisconsin, many of the sur-viving family farmers are educated at land-grant un  i  versi-
ties in plant and animal sciences and in agribusiness. They may well be running a highly mechanized dairy farm. On such farms, the farmer equips each cow with a barcode 
  Field Note  
  “Walking through New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward more than two years after Hurricane Katrina, it seemed as if the natural disaster had just happened. Street after street of devastated, vacant buildings was all the eye could behold—many still bearing the mark-ings of the emergency crews that had moved through the neighborhood in the wake of the hurricane, showing whether anyone had died inside. It struck me that r  e  construction would r  e  quire a public commitment on the order of what occurred in Europe after World War II, when cities reduced to rubble by bombing were rebuilt almost from scratch. No such commitment ever materialized, but some prog-ress has been made in recent years. Recent census data shows a city that is slightly smaller and slightly richer than the pre-Katrina city, with a somewhat reduced black population, and a mod-estly expanding number of Hispa  n  ics.”

and keeps a range of data about that particular cow. The 
data include any medical attention the cow has needed, how much milk the cow is pr  o  ducing, and when the cow 
last calved. The farmer then feeds the cow a diet geared toward improving or maintaining milk production. When the cow ambles over to the trough to feed, a sensor reads the cow’s ba  r  code and automatically mixes the correct bal-
ance of proteins, carbohydrates, and nutrients for the cow, di  s  pensing them into the trough for the cow to eat. If the 
cow has already eaten that day, the computer di  s  penses 
nothing into the trough, and the cow is left to a  m  ble away.  
  In parts of rural Appalachia, by contrast, hardscrab-
ble farming is the norm. Farmers have limited educ  a  tion, 
and there is little mechanization. In short, life in some of 
the poorest parts of rural Appalachia is a world apart from life on a modern Wisconsin dairy farm. Some of those dif-ferences can be attributed to geographic situation and eco-nomic swings. But others are the product of government policies that inﬂ  uence educational opportunities, provide subsidies for particular agricultural pursuits, and promote the development of partic  u  lar technologies. Every policy 
has a geographical expression, meaning that some regions are favored whereas others are disadvantaged as a result of the implementation of that policy. When policies come t  o  gether to favor some regions over others, uneven devel-
opment is the result. And uneven develo  p  ment can easily 
be exacerbated over time as the wealthy grow wealthier.  
  Government policy can also help alleviate uneven 
development. In the case of Appalachia, the U.S. Co  n  gress 
created an Appalachian Regional Commission in 1965 
to address poverty in the region. The Commi  s  sion has 
orchestrated a program of government investment in 
roads, schools, health-care facilities, and water and sewer systems that has fostered development in parts of the region. Signiﬁ  cant parts of App  a  lachia have b  e  neﬁ ted from 
these policies, although pockets of deep poverty remain.  
  Looking at commodity chains can also help us 
understand the role of governments in uneven develop-
ment both within and between states. In her 2005 book   The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy   , econ  o  mist 
Pietra Rivoli described the signiﬁ  cant inﬂ  uences gov-
ernments have on the distribution of wealth b  e  tween 
and within states. Rivoli grabs a T-shirt out of a bin at a 
Walgreens in Florida, buys it, and then traces its pr  o  duc-
tion back through the commodity chain to see how it ends up in her hands. The cotton for her T-shirt was grown in West T exas, where the cotton lobby (the political arm of America’s cotton producers) has effectively politicked for governmental labor programs and price supports that help the lobby grow cotton and sell it at pr  e  dictable prices.  
  From West T exas, the cotton bale reaches China by 
ship. There it is spun into thread and woven into fabric. 
Women from rural China work in state-owned factories set up in regions that are slated for economic develo  p-
  ment—  cutting and sewing T-shirts and keeping the tex-
tile machines in good repair. The women are considered cheap labor at the global scale, earning about $100 per month. Rivoli reports that over 40,000 garment fact  o  ries 
operate in China alone.  
  The T-shirts are then shipped to the United States 
for sale. In an attempt to protect T-shirts produced in 
America with higher labor costs from those produced in China, the U.S. government has established quotas on how many items from various clothing categories can be imported into the United States from China and other countries. An unintended consequence of the quota system has been a “quota ma  r  ket” that allows 
countries to buy and sell their U.S. quota numbers to 
producers in other countries (an illegal but rampant pra  c  tice). Instead of trading in quotas, some production 
facilities have moved to places where quotas and cheap 
labor are available—places such as Sri Lanka, Poland, and Lesotho. Rivoli describes how one pr  o  ducer of cot-
ton shirts has moved around the world:  
  The Esquel Corporation, today the world’s largest pro-
ducer of cotton shirts, started in Hong Kong in the late 1970s, but, unable to obtain quota to sell to the United States, shifted production to mainland China. When the United States tightened Chinese shirt quotas in the early 1980s, Esquel moved production to M  a  laysia. When 
Malaysian quota also became difﬁ  cult to obtain, Esquel 
moved yet again, this time to Sri Lanka. The globe hop-ping continued, with the Chinese shirt producer setting up operations in Mauritius and Maldives.  
  The point is that quota laws, like other policies 
made by governments, regional trade organizations, and 
i  n  ternational political regimes (such as the World T rade 
Organization and the International Labor Organiz  a  tion), 
affect whether and how regions can produce and exchange goods on the world market.  
  Islands of Development  
  In both periphery and core, governments often priori-
tize the creation of wealth in the seat of governmental authority: the capital city. In most states, the capital city is the political nerve center of the country, its n  a  tional 
headquarters and seat of government. Capital cities 
are home to government buildings and jobs; they often house universities, museums, heritage centers, conven-tion centers, and the headquarters of large corp  o  ra-
tions. After gaining independence, many former colonial 
states spent lavishly on their capitals, not because such spending was essential to political or economic success but because the states wanted to showcase their ind  e-
  pendence, their futures, and create a national treasure. 
The European colonizers who focused their wealth and treasures on their capital cities, such as Great Britain’s London, France’s Paris, and the Nethe  r  lands’ c10Development.indd Page 360  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 360  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

Amsterdam, served as mo  d  els for the newly independent 
states (just as the state system itself did).  
  In many countries of the global economic periphery 
and semiperiphery, the capital cities are by far the lar  g  est 
and most economically inﬂ  uential cities in the state (i.e., 
primate cities, discussed in Chapter 9). Some newly inde-pendent states have built new capital cities, away from the colonial headquarters. Their goals in doing so are to sepa-rate the  m  selves from their colonizers, to bring together 
diverse groups into one state with a city built to reﬂ  ect 
their common culture, to extend economic development into the interior of the state, or to help esta  b  lish control 
over a region with a population whose loyalties might not be to the state.  
  Nigeria, for example, moved its capital from Y oruba-
dominated Lagos along the coast to an ethnically ne  u  tral 
territory in the center of the state: Abuja. Malawi moved 
its capital from Zomba, deep in the south, to more ce  n  tral 
Lilongwe. Pakistan moved the capital from the colonial headquarters of Karachi to Islamabad in the far north to symbolize the country’s reorientation toward its his-torically important interior and north. Brazil moved its capital from coastal Rio de Janeiro to centrally located Brasilia in order to direct attention to the huge, sparsely populated, yet poorly integrated interior. More recently, Kazakhstan moved its capital from Alm  a  ty in the south 
to Astana in the north, partly to be closer to Russia and the center of the possibly restless Russian population. Malaysia has also recently moved its capital from the colo-nial capital of Kuala Lumpur to a completely new center called Putrajaya, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) to the south. The M  a  laysian government decided to build a new, ultramodern seat of government to symbolize the coun-try’s rapid economic growth (Fig. 10.15).  
  Corporations can also make cities focal points of 
development by concentrating corporate activities in a 
pa  r  ticular place. Often, corporations build up the cities 
near the resources they are extracting or near manufa  c  tur-
ing centers they have built. Multinational oil companies create subsidiaries in countries of the periphery and semi-periphery, creating or expanding cities near oil reserves. For example in Gabon, Elf and Shell, two oil companies based in Europe, run ElfGabon and ShellGabon in the Central African country. The oil co  m  panies took the 
small colonial town of Port Gentile in Gabon and turned it into a city that the locals call “oil city.” The oil co  m  pa-
nies built housing, roads, and stores, and provide much of the employment in the town (Fig. 10.16).  
  When a government or corporation builds up and 
concentrates economic development in a certain city or 
small region, geographers call that place an   island of devel-
opment  . In Chapter 3, we identiﬁ  ed islands of develo  p  ment 
in the periphery and semiperiphery and discussed why peo-
ple migrate to these cities from rural areas and other poorer cities. The hope for a job drives many migrants to move to these islands of comparative prospe  r  ity.  
  Creating Growth in the Periphery of the Periphery  
  One of the greatest challenges to development is creating 
  development opportunities outside of islands of deve  l  op-
ment.     In the most rural, impoverished regions of less pros-
perous countries, some nongovernmental organiz  a  tions    Figure 10.15

try to improve the plight of people.   Nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs)   are not run by state or local gov-
ernments. Rather, NGOs operate independently, and the 
term is usually reserved for e  n  tities that operate as non-
proﬁ ts. Thousands of NGOs operate in the world today, 
from churches to charities such as Heifer International. 
Each NGO has its own set of goals, depending on the pri-mary concerns ou  t  lined by its founders and ﬁ  nanciers.  
  Some countries have so many NGOs operating 
within them that they serve as what the   Economist   calls “a 
parallel state, ﬁ  nanced by foreigners and accountable to 
nobody.” For example, more than 20,000 NGOs o  p  erate 
within the country of Bangladesh at any time, focusing 
mainly on the rural areas and villages of the state. But the NGO phenomenon can be a bit of a mirage, masking the depth of problems some places face. In the wake of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, one respected British newspaper, the   Guardian  , reported that there was approximately 1 NGO 
per 1000 people in Haiti, but that much of the money fun-
neled through these NGOs was misappropriated.  
  One particular kind of program by NGOs that has 
found success in South Asia and South America is the 
m  i  crocredit program. The idea behind a   microcredit 
program   is simple: give loans to poor people, partic  u  larly 
women, to encourage development of small businesses. 
Programs either have women in the village guarantee each other’s credit, or they make future lending to oth-ers contingent on repayment by the ﬁ  rst bo  r  rowers. With 
repayment rates hovering at 98 percent, microcredit pro-grams can ﬁ  nance themselves, and many NGOs offer the pr  o  grams (Fig. 10.17).    By providing microcredit to women, NGOs can alter 
the gender balance in a region, giving more ﬁ  scal power 
to women. Some microcredit programs are credited with 
lowering birth rates in parts of developing countries and altering the social fabric of cultures by diminishing men’s positions of power. Successful m  i  crocredit programs also 
help alleviate malnourishment, as women with incomes can feed themselves and their children.  
  Microcredit programs have been less successful in 
places with high mortality rates from diseases such as AIDS. 
If the borrower is unable to work or if the family has medical and funeral bills, the borrower is much more lik  e  ly to default 
on the microcredit loan. When people in the periphery of 
the periphery (the poorest regions of p  e  ripheral countries) 
experience a multitude of challenges, such as disease, cor-
rupt governments, high mortality rates, high fertility rates, and disruptions from natural hazards, the goal of economic deve  l  opment takes a bac  k  seat to daily survival.  
  Find something in your house (an item of clothing, an elec-
tronic device, etc.) and, using the Internet, try to trace the commodity chain of production. What steps did the item and its components go through before reac  h  ing you? Consider the types of economic processes that were oper-ating at each step and consider the roles go  v  ernments and international political regimes played along the way.    Field Note  
  “Before the 1970s, Gabon’s principal exports were manganese, hardwoods, and uranium ores. The discovery of oil off the Gabonese coast changed all that. This oil storage tank at the edge of Port Gentil is but one r  e  minder of a development that has transformed Gabon’s major port city—and the economy of the cou  n  try as a whole. Oil now accounts for 80 percent of Gabon’s export earnings, and that ﬁ  gure is climbing as oil prices rise and new discoveries are made. But how much the average citizen of Gabon is beneﬁ  ting from 
the oil eco  n  omy remains an open question. Even as health care and infrastructure needs remain unmet, the French public  a  tion   L’Autre Afrique   listed Gabon’s recently deceased ruler as the African leader with the largest real estate hold-ings in Pa  r  is.”

  Summary  
  The idea of economic development is relatively new; it implies a sense of progres-
sively improving a cou  n  try’s economic situation. The idea took hold in the wake of 
the Industrial Revolution. Geographers focus on the spatial structure of the economy, assessing how that structure inﬂ  uences the ability of states and regions to reach greater levels of economic development. Geographers also recognize that economic develop-ment in a single place is based on a multitude of factors, including the situation within the global eco  n  omy, the link the place plays in commodity chains, the efﬁ  cacy of gov-
ernment, the presence of disease, the health and well-being of the population, the pres-ence and amount of foreign debt, the success or failure of government policies, and the inﬂ  uence of nongovernmental programs. Geographers also realize that all of these pro  c  esses are operating concurrently across scales, making a country’s journey toward 
economic development much more complicated than climbing a la  d  der.

Agriculture 11CHAPTER
Field Notes Changing Greens
Driving across the semiarid ranchlands of western South Dakota, I noticed the 
presence of a crop in the landscape that was recently found only in the eastern, moister region of the state: soybeans (Fig. 11.1).
I called a colleague who works in agriculture at South Dakota State University 
to ask, “When did the cattle ranchers of western South Dakota start growing soy-beans?” He replied, “When the soy biodiesel plants started popping up in Nebraska and Kansas and when genetically modiﬁ  ed soybeans made it possible to grow the crop here.” He explained the development of Roundup Ready soybeans, a particu-lar genetically modiﬁ  ed soybean that can grow in more arid regions of the country.

366 Chapter 11   Agriculture
First, you plant the soybean; then you use an airplane to spray Roundup, a com-
mon weed killer that is manufactured by the company that produces the Roundup Ready soybeans, over the ﬁ  eld. The application of Roundup over the entire ﬁ  eld 
saves a lot of time and energy for the farmers because the genetically modiﬁ  ed 
soybeans are resistant to the Roundup, but the weeds are killed. Monsanto, the company that produces Roundup, has developed soybeans, corn, cotton, and other crops that are resistant to Roundup.
Counter to the genetically modiﬁ  ed Roundup Ready crops, organic 
agriculture—the production of crops without the use of synthetic or industrially produced pesticides and fertilizers—is also on the rise in North America. In wealthier parts of the world, the demand for organic products has risen exponen-tially in recent years. Sales of organic food in the United States, for example, went from under $200 million in 1980 to $1.5 billion by the early 1990s to over $10 billion by 2003 and $24.8 billion in 2009. Organic foods are now just under 4 percent of all food sales in the country. The growth rate is so strong that some predict organic sales will approach 10 percent of total U.S. food sales within a decade. Parts of western Europe are already approaching that ﬁ  gure—notably Denmark, Sweden, 
Finland, and parts of Germany.
Agricultural ﬁ  elds are devoted to organic agriculture in the core, semi-periphery, 
and periphery. Fields devoted to organic agriculture produce all kinds of foodstuffs, including fruits, vegetables, coffee, tea, grains, nuts, and spices. Compared to all agri-cultural land, the organic segment is still quite small and relatively scattered, but a farmer who can gain organic certiﬁ  cation from a government or an internationally recognized third party is increasingly at a competitive advantage (Fig. 11.2).
Although organic crops are grown everywhere, most organic foods are sold in 
the global economic core: in the United States, Canada, Japan, Europe, and Australia. The best-selling organic crops in the United States are fruits and vegeta-bles, accounting for 39 percent of organic food sales, followed by nondairy bever-ages at 15 percent and dairy at 13 percent. Organic products typically cost more than conventional products in the grocery store. Nonetheless, a 2002 report issued by the United States Department of Agriculture explains that in 2000 organic foods crossed a threshold, moving out of health food stores and into supermarkets: “for the ﬁ  rst time, more organic food was purchased in conven-tional supermarkets than in any other venue.” Organic foods are sold in 54 percent of conventional grocery stores in the United States, with increasing demands for organic animal products such as meats and dairy.
Organic agriculture is an increasingly important part of agricultural produc-
tion and consumption in wealthier countries. In the core, organic farming has helped some farmers extract themselves to a degree from the control of large, external corporate interests by tapping a niche market. The role of organic agricul-ture in the periphery and semi-periphery is similar to that of other major cash crops: production is almost entirely for export to the global economic core. Yet, in the periphery and semi-periphery, when organic agriculture bears a fair trade certi-ﬁ cation, more wealth typically goes directly to the producers (see the discussion 
of fair trade coffee in the last section of this chapter).
The organic movement has some clear environmental beneﬁ  ts, particularly 
in reducing levels of synthetic chemicals in soil and water. The putative health and taste advantages of organic produce help ensure the continued growth of the organic movement. The continually increasing demand for organic products has led the United States Department of Agriculture to certify organic products in the country, giving some degree of standardization to organic agriculture.c11Agriculture.indd Page 366  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 366  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

In this chapter, we examine the origins of agriculture and trace the geography of 
changes in the production of food and the raising of livestock from the earliest domes-
tication of plants to such contemporary developments as genetic modiﬁ  cation and 
the turn toward large-scale agribusiness. In the process, we describe the early hearths of agriculture, the geography of technological changes in agriculture, the global pattern of agricultural production, and the imprint of agriculture on the cultural landscape.

368 Chapter 11   Agriculture
WHAT IS AGRICULTURE, AND WHERE DID 
AGRICULTURE BEGIN?
Agriculture is the deliberate tending of crops and 
livestock to produce food, feed, ﬁ  ber, and fuel. When we 
think about agriculture, we tend to think about the pro-duction of foodstuffs for humans. Grain is also used for feed, grains fed directly to livestock. Raising livestock for their milk, eggs, or meat makes up a large segment of U.S. agriculture. Feed also comes from the remnants of biofuel production, and in 2009, 25 percent of all grain produced in the United States was used to produce fuel for cars, not for human or animal consumption.
A common way of classifying economic activities is to 
focus on what is being produced. Economic activities that involve the extraction of economically valuable products from the earth, including agriculture, ranching, hunting and gathering, ﬁ  shing, forestry, mining, and quarrying, are called primary economic activities. Both the growing of food or feed and the raising of livestock are considered primary eco-nomic activities. Activities that take a primary product and change it into something else such as toys, ships, processed foods, chemicals, and buildings are secondary economic activities. Manufacturing is the principal secondary eco-nomic activity. Tertiary economic activities are those ser-vice industries that connect producers to consumers and facilitate commerce and trade or help people meet their needs. People who work as bankers, lawyers, doctors, teach-ers, nurses, salespeople, clerks, and secretaries belong to the tertiary sector. Some analysts separate specialized services into quaternary and quinary economic activities, distin-
guishing between those services concerned with information or the exchange of money or goods (quaternary) and those tied to research or higher education (quinary). In this chap-ter, however, for simplicity’s sake we limit ourselves to three categories: primary, secondary, and a broadly conceived ter-tiary or service sector.
By classifying economic activities into sectors and 
analyzing the percentage of the population employed in each sector, we can gain insight into how the production of goods is organized, as well as the employment struc-tures of different societies. As we explained in our discus-sions of world-systems theory in Chapters 8 and 10, the story of any product (such as wheat or rice) can be better illuminated by focusing on how the good is produced (the kinds of technology, research, wages, and education that go into its production), rather than focusing simply on what is produced. Examining the proportion of people employed in a given economic sector gives us a basic idea of how the good is produced. For example, in Guatemala the agriculture sector accounts for 13.5 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), yet 50 percent of the labor force is employed in agriculture. Contrast that with Canada, where the agriculture sector accounts for 2.3 percent of GDP and only 2 percent of the labor force is employed in agriculture. The tertiary sector in Canada accounts for 75 percent of the labor force and over 71 percent of GDP , and the tertiary sector in Guatemala accounts for 35 percent of the labor force and 62 percent of the country’s GDP .
These data do not tell us exactly how goods are pro-
duced, but they are revealing. The high proportion of the labor force involved in agriculture in Guatemala (relative to the role of agriculture in the GDP) tells us that agriculture is still quite labor dependent in Guatemala, implying a lack of mechanization. In Canada, the United States, and the rest of the global economic core, agriculture is produced on a large scale for commercial consumption. When agricul-tural goods are produced in these ways, the number of peo-ple working directly in the ﬁ  eld is quite small. In the United States, less than 2 percent of the workforce is involved in agricultural production. Thousands of others participate in supporting agricultural production by working in the ter-tiary sector as research scientists for universities, seed com-panies, or chemical (antibiotics, pesticides, and herbicides) producers; as lobbyists for industry groups such as wheat producers or cattle ranchers; as engineers who design farm implements; as the people who sell and repair the imple-ments; and as owners and clerks at retail establishments where farmers buy other farm and nonfarm goods.
In the United States, total agricultural production is at 
an all-time high, but the proportion of the labor force in agri-culture is at an all-time low. Mechanization and efﬁ  ciencies 
created by new technologies have led to a signiﬁ  cant decrease 
in the number of workers needed in agricultural production. In 1950, one farmer in the United States produced enough to feed 27 people; today, one farmer in the United States pro-duces enough to feed 135 people. The mechanization of agriculture goes beyond machinery such as combines and harvesters. New technologies include hybrid seeds and genetically engineered crops, pesticides, and herbicides, all of which are designed to increase yields. The drive toward economic efﬁ  ciency has meant that the average size of farms (acres in production) in the United States has been growing, regardless of the kind of agricultural good produced. The U.S. Department of Agriculture keeps data showing the dol-lar value of agricultural production. The farms with the highest total production have at least $500,000 in annual production in 2007 dollars. These high-producing farms accounted for 53.7 percent of agricultural goods produced in 2007 (compared with 28.9 percent in 1989).
Agriculture in the United States has changed enor-
mously in the last decade. A recent study by the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences identiﬁ  es four major issues that affect food security world-
wide: “1) varying abilities to balance production and con-sumption across regions and countries, 2) accelerating conversions of agricultural land to urban uses, 3) increas-ingly energy-intensive food production methods in a world c11Agriculture.indd Page 368  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 368  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

of shrinking fossil fuel resources, and 4) expanding use of 
food crops for biofuel production.” Agricultural production changes rapidly as farmers worldwide react to price ﬂ  uctua-
tions in fossil fuels, seeds, fertilizers, crops, and land.
T o set the stage for understanding the contemporary 
agriculture picture, in the next section of the chapter, we discuss how people lived before the origins of agriculture and the circumstances that gave rise to the domestication of plants and animals many millennia ago.
Hunting, Gathering, and Fishing
Before the advent of agriculture, hunting, gathering, and ﬁ shing were the most common means of subsistence 
throughout the world. Of course, what people hunted or gathered depended on where they lived. North America provides a good example of the diversity of regional special-izations among hunter-gatherers. The oak forests of parts of North America provided an abundant harvest of nuts, sometimes enough to last more than a full year; American Indian communities living in and around these forests therefore collected and stored this food source. Other American Indians living near the Paciﬁ  c Ocean became adept at salmon ﬁ  shing. The bison herds of the Great Plains provided sustenance, and so bison served as a focal point for many plains cultures. In the colder climates of North America, people followed the migrations of the caribou herds. In the north, in the coastal zone stretching from present-day Alaska to Russia, the Aleut developed special-ized techniques for ﬁ  shing and for sea mammal hunting.
The size of hunting and gathering clans varied 
according to climate and resource availability. Hunting and gathering communities in areas of abundance could support larger populations. People living on the margins of forests could gather food in the forest when hunting yielded poor results and then return to hunting when cir-cumstances improved.
Terrain and Tools
Before developing agriculture, hunter-gatherers worked on perfecting tools, controlling ﬁ  res, and adapting environ-ments to their needs. The ﬁ  rst tools used in hunting were simple clubs—tree limbs that were thin at one end and thick and heavy at the other. The use of bone and stone and the development of spears made hunting far more effective. The fashioning of stone into hand axes and, later, handle axes was a crucial innovation that enabled hunters to skin their prey and cut the meat; it also made it possible to cut down trees and build better shelters and tools.
The controlled use of ﬁ  re was another important early 
achievement of human communities. The ﬁ  rst opportuni-
ties to control ﬁ  re were offered by natural conditions (light-ning, spontaneous combustion of surface-heated coal). Archaeological digs of ancient settlement sites suggest that people would capture a ﬁ  re caused accidentally and would work to keep the ﬁ  re burning continuously. Later, people learned that ﬁ  re could be generated by rapid hand rotation of a wooden stick in a small hole surrounded by dry tinder. Fire became the focal point of settlements, and the camp-ﬁ re took on symbolic and functional importance. It was a 
means of making foods digestible, and it was used to drive animals into traps or over cliffs.
In addition to hunting game on land, humans har-
vested shellﬁ  sh, trapped ﬁ  sh by cutting small patches of 
standing water off from the open sea, and invented tools to catch ﬁ  sh, including harpoons, hooks, and baskets.
Using tools and ﬁ  re, human communities altered their 
environments, which helped to establish more reliable food supplies. Along with hunting and gathering, early humans were adept at keeping track of the migration cycles of ﬁ  sh 
and other animals. American Indians along the Paciﬁ  c Coast 
and on Arctic shores, the Ainu of Japan and coastal East Asia, and communities in coastal western Europe caught salmon as they swam up rivers and negotiated rapids and falls. Archaeologists have found huge accumulations of ﬁ  sh 
bones at prehistoric sites near salmon runs.
Hunter-gatherers migrated to take advantage of cycli-
cal movements of animals and to avoid exhausting the supply of edible plants in any one area. After the summer salmon runs, people hunted deer during the fall and again in the spring, taking advantage of seasonal movements to trap deer where they crossed rivers or in narrow valleys. During the winter, people lived off dried meat and other stored foods.
The First Agricultural Revolution
Out of areas of plenty came agriculture, the deliberate tend-ing of crops and livestock to produce food, feed, ﬁ  ber, and 
fuel. Geographer Carl Sauer believed the experiments nec-essary to establish agriculture and settle in one place would occur in lands of plenty. Only in such places could people afford to experiment with raising plants or take the time to capture animals and breed them for domestication. Sauer studied the geography of the First Agricultural Revolution, focusing on the location of agriculture hearths and what kinds of agricultural innovations took place in those hearths.
Where did plant domestication begin? Sauer, who 
spent a lifetime studying cultural origins and diffusion, suggested that Southeast and South  Asia may have been 
the scene, more than 14,000 years ago, of the ﬁ  rst domesti-
cation of tropical plants. There, he believed, the combina-tion of human settlements, forest margins, and fresh water streams may have given rise to the earliest planned cultiva-tion of root crops—crops that are reproduced by cultivat-ing either the roots or cuttings from the plants (such as tubers, including manioc or cassava, yams, and sweet pota-toes in the tropics). A similar but later development may have taken place in northwestern South America.c11Agriculture.indd Page 369  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 369  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
370 Chapter 11   Agriculture
The planned cultivation of seed crops, plants that 
are reproduced by cultivating seeds, is a more complex 
process, involving seed selection, sowing, watering, and well-timed harvesting. Again, the practice seems to have developed in more than one area and at different times. Some scholars believe that the ﬁ  rst domestication of seed plants occurred in the Nile River Valley in North Africa, but the majority view is that this crucial development took place in a region of Southwest Asia (also called the Fertile Crescent), through which ﬂ  ow the two major rivers of 
present-day Iraq: the Tigris and the Euphrates (Fig. 11.3). The cultivation of seed crops marked the beginning of what has been called the First Agricultural Revolution.
Archaeologists note that a number of changes 
occurred in Southwest Asia along with plant domestica-tion. First, the plants themselves changed because peo-ple would choose seeds from the largest, heartiest plants to save for planting, yielding domesticated plants that grew larger over time than their counterparts in the wild. Archaeologists in Southwest Asia have found pre-served seeds, which tell them which plants were being domesticated and when. The grain crops wheat and bar-ley grew well in the warm Southwest Asian climate. Soon, people found that the river-inundated plains of Mesopotamia provided irrigable ﬁ  elds for farming. Agriculture provided a reliable food source, and grain surpluses enabled people to store grain for long-term distribution and use and to settle permanently in one place. In the process, the population of settlements began to increase.

 What Is Agriculture, and Where Did Agriculture Begin? 371
Figure 11.4 depicts the global distribution of plant 
domestication hearths. In Southeast Asia (Region 1), taro, 
yams, and bananas were the leading food plants. In Southwest Asia (Region 4), plant domestication centered on wheat, barley, and other grains. In the Mesoamerican region (Region 6), the basic plants were maize (corn), squashes, and several kinds of beans.
Archaeologists continually ﬁ  nd new sites to excavate, 
and as places are analyzed further, academics revise their assumptions about the timing of the emergence of agricul-tural hearths. The Central China hearth (Region 7) has recently attracted greater attention because new evidence supports a much earlier development of agriculture in this region—so early, in fact, that Chinese farmers may have been among the world’s ﬁ  rst. Another agricultural source region lies in West Africa (Region 9). Archaeological research on agriculture in this area is relatively recent, and analysts are not certain whether agriculture developed independently there.
T able 11.1 may be overwhelming at ﬁ  rst glance, but 
it is worth careful attention. It reveals the enormous range of crops that were cultivated around the world, as well as how, at various times and in different locales, particular groups of crops became the mainstays of life. Soon the knowledge needed to farm such crops diffused outward from these agricultural hearths. For example, both millet and sorghum diffused from the West African region—millet to India and sorghum to China.In many cases, what we now think of as centers of 
production of particular crops are not the places where those crops were originally domesticated. The corn (maize) we associate with the American Corn Belt diffused from Mesoamerica (Region 6) into North America. Later, the Portuguese brought it across the Atlantic, and corn became a staple in much of Africa. The white potato we associate with Ireland and Idaho came originally from the Andean highlands but was brought to Europe in the 1600s where it became a staple from Ireland to the eastern expanses of the North European Plain. The banana we associate with Mesoamerica came from Southeast Asia, as did a variety of yams. Diffusion of crops and seeds was greatly accelerated by worldwide trade and communica-tions networks established with the development of mer-cantilism and European colonialism.
Domestication of Animals
Some scholars believe that animal domestication began earlier than plant cultivation, but others argue that animal domestication began as recently as 8000 years ago—well after crop agriculture. Whichever is the case, goats, pigs, and sheep became part of a rapidly growing array of domes-ticated animals, and in captivity they changed considerably from their wild state. As with the growing of root crops, the notion of animal domestication must have emerged over time, in stages.

 What Is Agriculture, and Where Did Agriculture Begin? 373
The process of animal domestication began as peo-
ple became more sedentary. People kept animals for cer-
emonial purposes as well as for pets or for other reasons. Quite possibly, animals attached themselves to human settlements as scavengers (foraging through garbage near human settlements) and even for protection against predators, thus reinforcing the idea that they might be tamed and kept. Orphaned young probably were adopted as pets; some wild animals were docile and easily penned up. Goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains (in the Fertile Crescent) as long as 10,000 years ago; sheep some 9500 years ago in Anatolia (T urkey); and pigs and cattle shortly thereafter. The advantages of ani-mal domestication—their use as beasts of burden, as a source of meat, and as providers of milk—stimulated the rapid diffusion of this idea among interlinked places and gave the sedentary farmers of Southwest Asia and else-where a new measure of security.
Archaeological research indicates that when animals 
such as wild cattle are penned in a corral, they undergo physical changes over time. In a pen, animals are pro-tected from predators, allowing the survival of animals that would have been killed in the wild. Our domestic ver-sions of the goat, the pig, the cow, and the horse differ considerably from those ﬁ  rst kept by our ancestors. In 
early animal domestication, people chose the more docile, often smaller animals to breed. Archaeologists discern the beginnings of animal domestication in a region by inspect-ing the bones of excavated animals. They look for places where bones get smaller over time, as this usually indi-cates early domestication.
As with plant domestication, archaeologists can 
use the combination of bone fragments and tools to identify general areas where the domestication of par-ticular animals occurred. In Southwest Asia and adja-cent parts of the Mediterranean basin, people domesti-cated the goat, sheep, and camel. Southeast Asians domesticated several kinds of pigs, the water buffalo, chickens, and some water fowl (ducks, geese). In East India and West Burma (South Asia), people domesti-cated cattle, and cattle came to occupy an important place in the regional culture. In Central Asia, people domesticated the yak, horse, some species of goats, and sheep. In the Mesoamerica and the Andean Highlands, early Americans domesticated the llama and alpaca, along with a species of pig and the turkey.
Some species of animals may have been domesti-
cated almost simultaneously in different places. The water buffalo, for example, was probably domesticated in both Southeast and South Asia during the same period. Camels were domesticated in both western and eastern ends of Southwest Asia. The pig was domesticated in numerous areas. Different species of cattle were domesticated in regions other than South Asia. Dogs and cats attached themselves to human settlements very early (they may have been the ﬁ  rst animals to be domesticated) and in widely separated regions. Single, speciﬁ  c hearths can be 
pinpointed for only a few animals, including the llama and the alpaca, the yak, the turkey, and the reindeer.
Efforts to domesticate animals continue today. In East 
Africa, people are attempting to domesticate the eland, to serve as a source of meat in a region where a stable protein source is greatly needed. Several experimental stations in the savanna are trying to ﬁ  nd ways to domesticate Africa’s 
wildlife. They have had some success with a species of eland, but less so with various species of gazelles; they have been unable to domesticate the buffalo (Fig. 11.5). In fact, throughout the world only some 40 species of higher ani-mals have ever been domesticated—and most of these were domesticated long ago. Jared Diamond, author of Guns, 
Germs, and Steel, explains that only ﬁ  ve domesticated mam-mals are important throughout the world: the cow, sheep, goat, pig, and horse. According to Diamond, if we select only the big (over 100 pounds), herbivorous, terrestrial ani-mals, we have 148 species that meet these criteria in the “wild.” Only 14 of those 148 have been domesticated suc-cessfully, and each of these 14 was domesticated at least 4500 years ago. Modern attempts at animal domestication, even those driven by knowledgeable geneticists, have failed because of problems with the animal’s diet, growth rate, breeding, disposition, or social structure.
Thus, the process of animal domestication, set in 
motion more than 8000 (and perhaps as long as 14,000) years ago, continues. The integrated use of domesticated plants and domesticated animals eased the work burden for early farmers. Animal waste fertilized crops, animals pulled plows, and crops fed animals. The ﬁ  rst place where domesticated plants and animals were successfully inte-grated was Southwest Asia (the Fertile Crescent).
Subsistence Agriculture
Subsistence agriculture—growing only enough food to survive—was the norm throughout most of human his-tory. Subsistence farmers often hold land in common; sur-pluses are shared by all the members of the community; accumulation of personal wealth is restricted; and indi-vidual advancement at the cost of the group as a whole is limited. Subsistence agriculture declined during the 1900s with the diffusion of industrialized agriculture and the goal of constantly increasing production both to feed growing populations and to sell more agricultural goods. The United States and other industrialized countries sought to move farmers “beyond” subsistence into indus-trialized production as part of development programs begun in the 1960s (see Chapter 10).
A return to subsistence agriculture has taken hold in 
parts of the world where farmers feel production for the global market has not beneﬁ  ted them either ﬁ  nancially or 
culturally. For example, indigenous people in the southern c11Agriculture.indd Page 373  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 373  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
Mexican states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Guerrero have 
largely returned to subsistence agriculture. The Nation  
reported in 2010 that Zapatista farmers have “in effect chosen to withdraw from the national economy, some weaning themselves off expensive chemical fertilizers and 
subsisting on corn they can grow , harvest, and barter.”
Some subsistence farmers are sedentary, living in one 
place throughout the year, but many others move from place to place in search of better land. The latter engage in a form of agriculture known as shifting cultivation. This type of agriculture is found primarily in tropical and subtropical zones, where traditional farmers had to abandon plots of land after the soil became infertile. Once stripped of their natural vegetative cover and deprived of the constant input of nutri-ents from decaying vegetative matter on the forest ﬂ  oor, soils 
in these regions can quickly lose their nutrients as rain water leaches out organic matter. Faced with these circumstances, farmers move to another parcel of land, clear the vegetation, turn the soil, and try again. Shifting cultivation gave ancient farmers opportunities to experiment with various plants, to learn the effects of weeding and crop care, to cope with envi-ronmental vagaries, and to discern the decreased fertility of soil after sustained farming.
With shifting cultivation, parcels of land are worked 
successively. The farmers ﬁ  rst clear vegetation from a par-cel of land. Next they plant crops that are native to the region: tubers in the humid, warm tropical areas, grains in the more humid subtropics, and vegetables and fruits in cooler zones. When the village grows too large and the distance to usable land becomes too great, part of the vil-lage’s population may establish a new settlement some distance away. Population densities in areas of shifting agri-
culture cannot be very high; therefore, shifting cultivation continues only in areas where population densities are low.
One speciﬁ  c kind of shifting cultivation is slash-and-
burn agriculture (also called swidden, milpa, or patch Field Note
“Attempts to tame wildlife started in ancient times, and still continue. At Hunter’s Lodge on the Nairobi-Mombasa road, we met an agricultural ofﬁ  cer who reported that an animal domestication experiment station was located not far into the bush, about 10 miles south. On his invitation, we spent the next day observing this work. In some herds, domestic animals (goats) were combined with wild gazelles, all penned together in a large enclosure. This was not work-ing well; all day the gazelles seek to escape. By comparison, these eland were docile, manageable, and in good health. Importantly, they also were reproducing in captivity. Here, our host describes the program.”

agriculture), reﬂ  ecting the central role of the controlled use 
of ﬁ re in places where this technique is used. T rees are cut 
down and all existing vegetation is burned off. In slash-and-burn, farmers use tools (machetes and knives) to slash down trees and tall vegetation, and then burn the vegetation on the ground. A layer of ash from the ﬁ  re settles on the ground and contributes to the soil’s fertility.
As we discuss in the next section, agriculture has fun-
damentally changed since shifting cultivation was the global norm, but hundreds of millions of farmers continue to practice some form of subsistence agriculture.
Settling down in one place, a rising population, and the switch to agriculture are interrelated occurrences in human history. Hypothesize which of these three happened ﬁ  rst, 
second, and third and explain why.
HOW DID AGRICULTURE CHANGE 
WITH INDUSTRIALIZATION?
For the Industrial Revolution (see Chapter 12) to 
take root, a Second Agricultural Revolution had to take 
place—one that would move agriculture beyond subsis-tence to generate the kinds of surpluses needed to feed thousands of people working in factories instead of in agricultural ﬁ  elds. Like the Industrial Revolution, the 
Second Agricultural Revolution was composed of a series of innovations, improvements, and techniques, in this case initially in Great Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, and other neighboring countries.
By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European 
farming underwent signiﬁ  cant changes. New crops came into Europe from trade with the Americas, including corn and potatoes. Many of the new crops were well suited for the cli-mate and soils of western Europe, bringing new lands (previ-ously deﬁ  ned as marginal) into cultivation.
The governments of Europe helped create the condi-
tions necessary for the Second Agricultural Revolution by passing laws such as Great Britain’s Enclosure Act, which encouraged consolidation of ﬁ  elds into large, single-owner 
holdings. Farmers increased the size of their farms, pieced together more contiguous parcels of land, fenced in their land, and instituted ﬁ  eld rotation. Methods of soil prepara-tion, fertilization, crop care, and harvesting improved.
New technologies improved production as well. The 
seed drill enabled farmers to avoid wasting seeds and to plant in rows, making it simpler to distinguish weeds from crops. By the 1830s, farmers were using new fertilizers on crops and feeding artiﬁ  cial feeds to livestock. Increased agricultural output made it possible to feed much larger urban populations, enabling the growth of a secondary (industrial) economy. In 1831, Cyrus McCormick, a farmer in Lexington, Virginia, perfected his father’s design for a mechanical reaper (Fig. 11.6). At the time, farmers

were limited in their production not by what they could 
sow (plant), but what they could reap (harvest) because harvesting required much more time and labor than plant-ing. Harvesting involved laborers cutting grain with a scythe followed by more laborers who bundled the grain into bales. McCormick’s mechanical reaper, which was pulled by horses, both cut and bundled grain. His inven-tion took off in the 1840s purportedly increasing yields of individual farmers by at least ten times. McCormick’s com-pany eventually became International Harvester and now Case IH, one of the largest agriculture implement compa-nies in the world today.
Advances in breeding livestock enabled farmers to 
develop new breeds that were either strong milk produc-ers or good for beef. The most common breeds of dairy cattle found in North America today trace their lineage back to the Second Agricultural Revolution in Europe. In the 1700s and 1800s, European farmers bred dairy cattle to adapt to different climates and topography. For exam-ple, the black and white Holstein dairy cow came from the Netherlands and is well suited to graze on grass and pro-duce high quantities of milk. Scottish farmers bred the red and white Ayrshire breed of dairy cattle to produce milk well suited for butter and cheese and to forage for food in rough, rocky topography.
Innovations in machinery that occurred with the 
Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s and early 1900s helped sustain the Second Agricultural Revolution. The railroad helped move agriculture into new regions, such as the United States’ Great Plains. Geographer John Hudson traced the major role railroads and agriculture played in changing the landscape of that region from open prairie to individual farmsteads. The railroad companies advertised in Europe to attract immigrants to the Great Plains region, and the railroads took the new migrants to their new towns, where they would transform lands from prairie grass to agricultural ﬁ  elds. Later, the internal com-
bustible engine made possible the invention of tractors, combines, and a multitude of large farm equipment. New banking and lending practices helped farmers afford the new equipment.
Understanding the Spatial Layout of Agriculture
When commercial agriculture is geared to producing food for people who live in a nearby town or city, a geo-graphichal pattern of land use based on the “perishability” of products and cost of transportation often emerges. In the 1800s, Johann Heinrich von Thünen (1783–1850) experienced the Second Agricultural Revolution ﬁ  rst-
hand: he farmed an estate not far from the town of Rostock, in northeast Germany. Studying the spatial pat-terns of farming around towns such as Rostock, von Thünen noted that as one moved away from the town,  Figure 11.7

Market gardening and dairyingForestIncreasingly extensive field crops, grainsRanching, livestock1 2 3 4one commodity or crop gave way to another. He also 
noted that this process occurred without any visible change in soil, climate, or terrain. When he mapped this pattern, he found that each town or market center was surrounded by a set of more-or-less concentric rings within which particular commodities or crops dominated.
Nearest the town, farmers produced commodities 
that were perishable and commanded high prices, such as dairy products and strawberries. In this zone, much effort would go into production in part because of the value of the land closer to the city. In von Thünen’s time, the town was still surrounded by a belt of forest that provided wood for fuel and building; but immediately beyond the forest the ring-like pattern of agriculture continued. In the next ring crops were less perishable and bulkier, including wheat and other grains. Still farther out, livestock raising began to replace ﬁ  eld crops.
Von Thünen used these observations to build a 
model of the spatial distribution of agricultural activities around settlements (Fig. 11.7). As with all models, he had to make certain assumptions. For example, he assumed that the terrain was ﬂ  at, that soils and other environmen-tal conditions were the same everywhere, and that there were no barriers to transportation to market. Under such circumstances, he reasoned, transport costs would govern c11Agriculture.indd Page 376  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 376  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Did Agriculture Change with Industrialization?  377
the use of land. He reasoned that the greater the distance 
to market, the higher the transport costs that had to be added to the cost of producing a crop or commodity.
The Von Thünen model (including the ring of for-
est) is often described as the ﬁ  rst effort to analyze the spa-tial character of economic activity. The Thünian patterns discerned in many parts of the world are not solely the result of the forces modeled by von Thünen. Differences in climate type and soil quality weigh heavily on the kinds of goods produced in a place. Y et if you drive east out of Denver, heading for Nebraska, you cannot miss a certain concentric zonation that puts dairying and market gar-dening nearest the city, cash grains such as corn (plus soy-beans) in the next “ring,” more extensive grain farming and livestock raising beyond, and cattle ranching in the outermost zone.
Geographer Lee Liu studied the spatial pattern of 
agricultural production in one province of China, giving careful consideration to the intensity of the production methods and the amount of land degradation. Liu found that the farmers living in a village would farm lands close to the village as well as lands far away from the village with high levels of intensity. However, the methods used varied spatially, resulting in land improvements close to the vil-lage and land degradation farther from the village. In lands close to the village, farmers improved lands through “decades of intensive care,” in particular putting organic material onto the ﬁ  elds, which made the grasslands close to the village “fertile and productive.” In lands more remote from the village, farmers tended to use more “chemical fertilizer, pesticides, and herbicides” and fewer conservation tactics, resulting in land degradation, whereby “the originally fertile remote land became degraded.” Liu argued that this pattern in modern China occurs in large part because farmers live in the village, not in the remote ﬁ  elds, and therefore put most of their time 
and energy into the ﬁ  elds closest to them.
Even when agricultural production does not conform 
to the concentric rings of von Thünen’s model, his under-lying concern with the interplay of land use and transpor-tation costs frequently still explains agricultural patterns. The fresh ﬂ  owers grown in the Caribbean for sale in New Y ork City could be viewed as the application of the von Thünen model on a larger scale, for it is less expensive to grow ﬂ  owers in the Caribbean and ship them to New Y ork 
City than it is to grow them in other locations.
The Third Agricultural Revolution
The Third Agricultural Revolution, also called the 
Green Revolution, dates as far back as the 1930s, when agricultural scientists in the American Midwest began experimenting with technologically manipulated seed varieties to increase crop yields. In the 1940s, American philanthropists funded research on maize (corn) produc-tion in Mexico, trying to ﬁ  nd a hybrid seed that would grow better. They did, and by 1960 Mexico was no longer importing corn because production within the country was high enough to meet demand. In the 1960s, the focal point of the Green Revolution shifted to India, when sci-entists at a research institution in the Philippines crossed a dwarf Chinese variety of rice with an Indonesian variety and produced IR8. This new rice plant had a number of desirable properties: it developed a bigger head of grain, and it had a stronger stem that did not collapse under the added weight of the bigger head. IR8 produced much bet-ter yields than either of its parents, but the researchers were not satisﬁ  ed. In 1982 they produced IR36, bred from 
13 parents to achieve genetic resistance against 15 pests and a growing cycle of 110 days under warm conditions, thus making possible three crops per year in some places. By 1992, IR36 was the most widely grown crop on Earth, and in September 1994, scientists developed a strain of rice that was even more productive than IR36. In addition to improving the production of rice, the Green Revolution brought new high-yield varieties of wheat and corn from the United States to other parts of the world, particularly South and Southeast Asia.
Coming at a time of growing concern about global 
hunger, the increased yields of the Green Revolution were truly extraordinary. In subsequent decades, most famines resulted from political instability rather than failure in production. India became self-sufﬁ  cient in grain produc-
tion by the 1980s, and Asia as a whole saw a two-thirds increase in rice production between 1970 and 1995. These drastic increases in production stemmed not only from new seed varieties but also from the use of fertilizers, pes-ticides, irrigation in some places, and signiﬁ  cant capital 
improvements.
The geographical impact of the Green Revolution 
is highly variable, however. Its traditional focus on rice, wheat, and corn means that it has had only limited impact throughout much of Africa, where agriculture is based on different crops and where lower soil fertility makes agriculture less attractive to foreign investment. But innovations are continually being developed. Researchers at the International Rice Research Institute, for example, are working to breed a genetically modiﬁ  ed 
“super rice” that will not have to be transplanted as seed-lings but can be seeded directly in the paddy soil. It may yield nearly twice as much rice per acre than the average for strains in current use. The charting of the genome of rice (the 12 chromosomes that carry all of the plant’s characteristics) may make it possible to transform rice genetically so that it will continuously acquire more desirable properties. Not only could yields improve; so could resistance to diseases and pests.
Increasingly, researchers are turning their attention 
to new agricultural products, and this could expand the c11Agriculture.indd Page 377  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 377  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

geographical impact of the Green Revolution. Research 
has already led to methods for producing high-yield cas-sava and sorghum—both of which are grown in Africa. Beyond Africa, research on fattening livestock faster and improving the appearance of fruits is having an impact in North and South America.
The promise of increasing food production in a 
world in which almost a billion people are malnourished has led many people to support genetically engineered foods. Others, however, question whether gene manipula-tion could create health risks and produce environmental hazards. Environmentalists have speculated about the impacts of pollen dispersal from genetically modiﬁ  ed 
plants and the potential for disease-resistant plants to spur the evolution of super-pests. Moreover, the large-scale monocropping that is often part of Green Revolution agriculture can make farms vulnerable to changes in cli-mate or the infestation of particular pests. One vocal opponent of the Green Revolution in India, Vandana Shiva, argues that
[t]he Green Revolution has been a failure. It has led to reduced genetic diversity, increased vulnerability to pests, soil erosion, water shortages, reduced soil fertility, micronu-trient deﬁ  ciencies, soil contamination, reduced availability of nutritious food crops for the local population, the displace-ment of vast numbers of small farmers from their land, rural impoverishment and increased tensions and conﬂ  icts. 
The beneﬁ  ciaries have been the agrochemical industry, large petrochemical companies, manufacturers of agricul-tural machinery, dam builders and large landowners.
It is no easy matter to weigh the enormous increases in food production that have occurred in places that have adopted Green Revolution approaches against the types of social and environmental issues highlighted by Shiva.
There is growing concern that higher inputs of 
chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides associated with Green Revolution agriculture can lead to reduced organic matter in the soil and to groundwater pollution. Moreover, the Green Revolution has worked against the interest of many small-scale farmers who lack the 
resources to acquire genetically enhanced seeds and the necessary chemical inputs to grow them.
A 2005 report in Scientiﬁ  c American explains that the 
Green Revolution has done little to alleviate poverty in areas where most farmers still work small plots of land: “The supply-driven strategies of the Green Revolution, however, may not help subsistence farmers, who must play to their strengths to compete in the global market-place. The average size of a family farm is less than four acres in India, 1.8 acres in Bangladesh and about half an acre in China.” Smaller farmers are in a poor competitive position, and their position is further undermined by the fact that a few large corporations with the seed patents for genetically modiﬁ  ed grains and a virtual monopoly of the 
needed chemical inputs can have tremendous power over the agricultural production process. In addition, the need for capital from the West to implement Green Revolution technologies has led to a shift away from production for local consumers toward export agriculture. In the process, local places become subject to the vicissitudes of the global economy, where a downward ﬂ  uctuation in the 
price of a given crop can create enormous problems for places dependent on the sale of that crop.
New Genetically Modiﬁ  ed Foods
An entire ﬁ  eld of biotechnology has sprung up in con-
junction with the Third Agricultural Revolution, and the development of genetically engineered crops (GE) or genetically modiﬁ  ed organisms (GMOs) is its principal 
target. Since the origin of agriculture, people have experi-mented with hybrid crops and cross-breeding of animals. T oday, according to the Grocery Manufacturers of America, genetically modiﬁ  ed organisms are found in 75 
percent of all processed foods in the United States. The United States leads the world in the production of geneti-cally engineered crops, with 88 percent of all acres in corn (up from 25 percent in 2000) and 94 percent of all acres in soybeans (up from 54 percent in 2000) sown with geneti-cally engineered seeds.
Some regions have embraced genetically engineered 
crops, and others have banned them. Many of the poorer countries of the world do not have access to the necessary capital and technology. Moreover, ideological resistance to genetically engineered foods is strong in some places—particularly in western Europe. Agricultural ofﬁ  cials in 
most west European countries have declared genetically modiﬁ  ed foods to be safe, but in many places, the public has 
a strong reaction against them based on combined concerns about health and taste. Such concerns have spread to less afﬂ uent parts of the world as well. In many poorer regions, 
seeds are a cultural commodity, reﬂ  ecting agricultural 
lessons learned over generations. In these regions, many resist the invasion of foreign, genetically engineered crops.
Regional and Local Change
Recent shifts from subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture have had dramatic impacts on rural life. Land-use patterns, land ownership arrangements, and agricul-tural labor conditions have all changed as rural residents cope with shifting economic, political, and environmental conditions. In Latin America, dramatic increases in the production of export crops (or cash crops such as fruits and coffee) have occurred at the expense of crop production for local consumption. In the process, subsistence farming has been pushed to ever more marginal lands. In Asia, c11Agriculture.indd Page 378  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 378  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
where the Green Revolution has had the greatest impact, 
the production of cereal crops (grains such as rice and wheat) has increased for both foreign and domestic mar-kets. Agricultural production in this region remains rela-tively small in scale and quite dependent on manual labor. In Subsaharan Africa, total commercialized agriculture has increased, but overall agricultural exports have decreased. As in Asia, farm units in Subsaharan Africa have remained relatively small and dependent on intensi-ﬁ ed manual labor.
What this regional-scale analysis does not tell us is 
how these changes have affected local rural communities. These changes can be environmental, economic, and social. A recent study in the small country of Gambia (West Africa) by Judith Carney has shown how changing agricultural practices have altered not only the rural envi-ronment and economy, but also relations between men and women (Fig. 11.8). Over the last 30 years, interna-tional developmental assistance to Gambia has led to ambitious projects designed to convert wetlands to irri-gated agricultural lands, making possible production of rice year-round. By the late 1980s, virtually all of the country’s suitable wetlands had been converted to year-round rice production. This transformation created ten-sions within rural households by converting lands women traditionally used for family subsistence into commercial-ized farming plots. In addition, when rice production was turned into a year-round occupation, women found them-selves with less time for other activities crucial for house-hold maintenance.
This situation underscores the fact that in Africa, as 
in much of the rest of the less industrialized world, agri-cultural work is overwhelmingly carried out by women. In Subsaharan Africa and South Asia, 60 percent of all employed females work in the agriculture sector. A geo-graphical perspective helps to shed light on how changes in agricultural practices throughout the world not only alter rural landscapes but also affect family and commu-nity relationships.

I am interested in women and rural develop-
ment in Subsaharan Africa. In 1983, I went to Gambia to study an irrigated rice project that was being implemented to improve the availability of rice, the dietary staple. What grabbed my attention? The donors’ assur-ance that the project would beneﬁ  t women, 
the country’s traditional rice growers. Imag-ine my surprise a few months after project implementation when I encountered hun-dreds of angry women refusing to work because they received nothing for their labor from the ﬁ  rst harvest.
In registering women’s traditional rice 
plots as “family” land, project ofﬁ  cials effec-
tively sabotaged the equity objectives of the donors. Control now was concentrated under male heads of household who reaped the income produced by female labor. Contemporary economic strategies for Africa depend increasingly upon labor intensiﬁ  -
cation. But whose labor? Human geography provides a way of seeing the signiﬁ  cance of gender in the power relations that mediate culture, environment, and economic development.

change their livelihoods. In many cases, the state places 
pressures on hunter-gatherers to settle in one place and farm. Cyclical migration by hunter-gatherers does not mesh well with bounded, territorial states. Some nongov-ernmental organizations encourage settlement by digging wells or building medical buildings, permanent houses, or schools for hunter-gatherers. Even hunter-gatherers who continue to use their knowledge of seeds, roots, fruits, berries, insects, and animals to gather and trap the goods they need for survival do so in the context of the world-economy.
Unlike hunting and gathering, subsistence farming 
continues to be a relatively common practice in Africa, Middle America, tropical South America, and parts of Southeast Asia (Fig. 11.9). The system of cultivation has changed little over thousands of years. The term subsis-
tence can be used in the strictest sense of the word—that is, to refer to farmers who grow food only to sustain them-selves and their families, and ﬁ  nd building materials and 
ﬁ rewood in the natural environment, and who do not 
enter into the cash economy at all. This deﬁ  nition ﬁ  ts 
farmers in remote areas of South and Middle America, Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. Y et many farm fam-ilies living at the subsistence level sometimes sell a small quantity of produce (perhaps to pay taxes). They are not subsistence farmers in the strict sense, but the term subsis-tence is surely applicable to societies where farmers with small plots periodically sell a few pounds of grain on the market but where poverty, indebtedness, and tenancy are ways of life. For the indigenous peoples of the Amazon Basin, the sedentary farmers of Africa’s savanna areas, vil-lagers in much of India, and peasants in Indonesia, subsis-tence is not only a way of life but a state of mind. Experience has taught farmers and their families that sub-sistence farming is often precarious and that times of comparative plenty will be followed by times of scarcity.
Subsistence farming has been in retreat for centu-
ries. From 1500 to 1950, European powers sought to “modernize” the economies of their colonies by ending subsistence farming and integrating farmers into colonial systems of production and exchange. Sometimes their methods were harsh: by demanding that farmers pay some taxes, they forced subsistence farmers to begin selling some of their produce to raise the necessary cash. They also compelled many subsistence farmers to devote some land to a crop to be sold on the world market such as cot-ton, thus bringing them into the commercial economy. The colonial powers encouraged commercial farming by conducting soil surveys, building irrigation systems, and establishing lending agencies that provided loans to farm-ers. The colonial powers sought to make proﬁ  ts, yet it was difﬁ cult to squeeze very much from subsistence-farming 
areas. Forced cropping schemes were designed to solve this problem. If farmers in a subsistence area cultivated a certain acreage of, say, corn, they were required to grow a speciﬁ  ed acreage of a cash crop as well. Whether this crop 
would be grown on old land that was formerly used for grain or on newly cleared land was the farmers’ decision. If no new lands were available, the farmers would have to give up food crops for the compulsory cash crops. In many

areas, severe famines resulted and local economies were 
disrupted.
Subsistence land use continues to give way to more 
intensive farming and cash cropping—even to mecha-nized farming in which equipment does much of the actual work. In the process, societies from South America to Southeast Asia are being profoundly affected. Land that was once held communally is being parceled out to individuals for cash cropping. In the process, small land-owners are often squeezed out, leaving the land in the hands of wealthier farmers and the owners of commercial-ized farming operations.
For too long, the question has been how “to tempt 
[subsistence farmers] into wanting cash by the availability of suitable consumer goods,” as A. N. Duckham and G. B. Maseﬁ  eld wrote in Farming Systems of the World in 1970. 
In the interests of “progress” and “modernization,” sub-sistence farmers were pushed away from their traditional modes of livelihood even though many aspects of subsis-tence farming may be worth preserving. Regions with shifting cultivation do not have neat rows of plants, care-fully turned soil, or precisely laid-out ﬁ  elds. Y et shifting cultivation conserves both forest and soil; its harvests are often substantial given environmental limitations; and it requires better organization than one might assume. It also requires substantially less energy than more modern techniques of farming. It is no surprise, then, that shifting cultivation and speciﬁ  cally slash-and-burn agriculture 
have been a sustained method of farming for thousands of years.
Many arguments have been raised about the impacts of the Green Revolution, both pro and con. How might the scale at which the Green Revolution is examined affect the arguments that are made about it? What types of fac-tors are likely to be considered if the question is, “has the Green Revolution been good for Asia” as opposed to “has the Green Revolution been good for a village or a particular agricultural community in India?”
WHAT IMPRINT DOES AGRICULTURE MAKE 
ON THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE?
Flying from the West Coast of the United States to 
the East Coast, if you have a window seat you will see the 
major imprint agriculture makes on the American cultural landscape. The green circles standing out in the grain belts of the country are places where center-pivot irrigation systems circle around a pivot, providing irrigation to a circle of crops. The checkerboard pattern on the land-scape reﬂ  ects the pattern of land survey system and land ownership in much of the country.
The pattern of land ownership seen in the landscape 
reﬂ ects the cadastral system—the method of land survey 
through which land ownership and property lines are deﬁ ned. Cadastral systems were adopted in places where 
settlement could be regulated by law, and land surveys were crucial to their implementation. The prevailing sur-vey system throughout much of the United States, the one that appears as checkerboards across agricultural ﬁ  elds, is 
the rectangular survey system. The U.S. government 
adopted the rectangular survey system after the American Revolution as part of a cadastral system known as the township-and-range system. Designed to facilitate the movement of non-Indians evenly across farmlands of the United States interior, the system imposed a rigid grid 
like pattern on the land (Fig. 11.10). The basic unit was the 1 square mile section—and land was bought and sold in whole, half, or quarter sections. The section’s lines were drawn without reference to the terrain, and they thus imposed a remarkable uniformity across the land. Under the Homestead Act, a homesteader received one section of land (160 acres) after living on the land for ﬁ  ve years 
and making improvements to it. The pattern of farms on the landscape in the interior of the United States reﬂ  ects 
the township-and-range system, with farms spaced by sec-tions, half sections, or quarter sections.
The imprint of the rectangular survey system is evi-
dent in Canada as well, where the government adopted a similar cadastral system as it sought to allocate land in the Prairie Provinces. In portions of the United States and Canada different cadastral patterns predominate, how-ever (Fig. 11.11). These patterns reﬂ  ect particular notions 
of how land should be divided and used. Among the most signiﬁ  cant are the metes and bounds survey approach 
adopted along the eastern seaboard, in which natural fea-tures were used to demarcate irregular parcels of land. One of the most distinct regional approaches to land divi-sion can be found in the Canadian Maritimes and in parts of Quebec, Louisiana, and T exas where a long-lot survey system was implemented. This system divided land into narrow parcels stretching back from rivers, roads, or canals. It reﬂ  ects a particular approach to surveying that was common in French America.
Many parts of the world do not have cadastral sys-
tems, so ﬁ  eld patterns are irregular. But whether regular or irregular, societies with property ownership have par-cels of land divided into neat, clearly demarcated seg-ments. The size and order of those parcels are heavily inﬂ uenced not just by land partition schemes, but also by 
rules about property inheritance. In systems where one child inherits all of the land—such as the traditional Germanic practice of primogeniture in which all land c11Agriculture.indd Page 381  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 381  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

passes to the eldest son—parcels tend to be larger and 
farmers work a single plot of land. This is the norm in Northern Europe and in the principal areas of Northern European colonization—the Americas, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.
In areas where land is divided among heirs, however, 
considerable fragmentation can occur over time. The lat-ter is the norm throughout much of Asia, Africa, and Southern Europe, as well as most of the allotted Indian reservations in the United States, meaning that farmers living in villages in these areas tend a variety of scattered small plots of land. In some places, land reform initiatives have consolidated landholdings to some degree, but frag-mentation is still common in many parts of the world.
Villages
Throughout this book we take note of various core-periphery contrasts our world presents. Such contrasts are prominent in rural as well as urban areas. T raditional farm-village life is still common in India, Subsaharan Africa, China, and Southeast Asia. In India, farming, much of it subsistence farming, still occupies over 60 percent of the population. As we have seen, however, in the world’s core areas agriculture has taken on a very dif-ferent form, and true farm villages, in which farming or providing services for farmers are the dominant activi-ties, are disappearing. In the United States, where farm-ing once was the leading economic activity, only some 2 percent of the labor force remains engaged in agricul-ture, and the population of most rural villages and towns is a mix of farmers and people who commute to 
work in urban areas.
T raditionally, the people who lived in villages either 
farmed the surrounding land or provided services to those who did the farming. Thus, they were closely connected to the land, and most of their livelihoods depended, directly or indirectly, on the cultivation of nearby farm-land. As such, they tended to reﬂ  ect historical and envi-
ronmental conditions. Houses in Japanese farming villages, for example, are so tightly packed together that only the narrowest passageways remain between them. This village form reﬂ  ects the need to allocate every possi-ble square foot of land to farming; villages must not use land where crops could grow.
Unlike Japan, in the United States Midwest individ-
ual farmhouses lie quite far apart in what we call a dispersed settlement pattern; the land is intensively cultivated but by machine rather than by hand. In the populous Indonesian island of Java, villages are located every half mile or so along a rural road, and settlement there is deﬁ  ned as 
nucleated. Land use is just as intense, but the work is done by people and animals. Hence, when we consider the den-sity of human settlement as it relates to the intensity of land use, we should keep in mind the way the land is culti-vated. Nucleated settlement is by far the most prevalent 
rural residential pattern in agricultural areas (Fig. 11.12). When houses are grouped together in tiny clusters or hamlets, or in slightly larger clusters we call villages, their spatial arrangement also has signiﬁ  cance.
In the hilly regions of Europe, villages frequently are 
clustered on hills, leaving the level land for farming. Often

an old castle sits atop the hill, so in earlier times the site 
offered protection as well as land conservation. In many low-lying areas of western Europe, villages are located on dikes and levees, so that they often take on linear charac-teristics (Fig. 11.13A). Villages oriented along roads also have this characteristic. Where there is space, a house and outbuildings may be surrounded by a small garden; the farms and pasturelands lie just beyond. In other cases, a village may take on the characteristics of a cluster (Fig. 11.13B). It may have begun as a small hamlet at the 
intersection of two roads and then developed by accre-tion. The European version of the East African circular village, with its central cattle corral, is the round village or rundling (Fig. 11.13C). This layout was ﬁ  rst used by Slavic farmer-herdsmen in eastern Europe and was later modi-ﬁ ed by Germanic settlers.
In many parts of the world, farm villages were forti-
ﬁ ed to protect their inhabitants against marauders. T en 
thousand years ago, the ﬁ  rst farmers in the Fertile 
Crescent faced attacks from the horsemen of Asia’s steppes and clustered together to ward off this danger. In Nigeria’s Y orubaland, the farmers would go out into the surround-ing ﬁ  elds by day but retreat to the protection of walled villages at night. Villages, as well as larger towns and cities in Europe, were frequently walled and surrounded by moats. When the population became so large that people had to build houses outside the original wall, a new wall would be built to protect them as well. Walled villages  (Fig. 11.13D) still exist in rural areas of many countries—
reminders of a turbulent past.
More modern villages, notably planned rural settle-
ments, may be arranged on a grid pattern (Fig. 11.13E). Grid patterns are not, however, a twentieth-century invention. Centuries ago the Spanish invaders of Middle America laid out grid villages and towns, as did other colo-nial powers elsewhere in the world. In urban Africa, such imprints of colonization are pervasive.
Although the twentieth century has witnessed unprec-
edented urban growth throughout the world, half of the world’s people still reside in villages and rural areas. As total world population increases, total population in rural areas is increasing in many parts of the world (even though the proportion of the total population in rural areas may be stagnant or declining). In China alone, approximately 50 percent of the more than 1.3 billion people live in rural areas. In India, with a population over 1 billion, about 70 percent of the people live in places the government deﬁ  nes 
as nonurban. Small rural settlements are home to most of the inhabitants of Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and other countries of the global economic periphery, includ-ing those in Africa. The agrarian village remains one of the most common forms of settlement on Earth.
In some places, rural villages have changed as the 
global economy has changed. For example, Mexico has experienced rapid economic change since passage of the North American Free T rade Act (NAFTA) in 1992. Along

major changes in agricultural production and village life have occurred in Mexico. Before the passage of NAFTA, the Mexican government protected corn production because white corn in a staple crop used to make tortillas, the main bread source, in Mexico. Through protection, Mexico’s corn prices were higher than in the United States. With the passage of NAFTA, Mexico entered a 15-year transition away from protecting its corn production. Economists believed the price of corn in Mexico would fall and in turn Mexicans would produce less corn.
What happened instead is that corn prices in Mexico 
ﬂ uctuated over time, tortilla prices rose, and then produc-
tion of corn in Mexico increased. T ortilla prices rose in response to higher prices for corn in the United States as a result of corn being used for fuel. Mexican farmers increased corn production both because of a higher demand for corn in the United States and Mexico and also because indigenous farmers in the south switched to sub-sistence farming of corn to provide for their families and to remove themselves from the ﬂ  uctuating global agricul-ture market and the uncertainties of NAFTA.
Functional Differentiation within Villages
Villages everywhere display certain common qualities, including evidence of social stratiﬁ  cation and differentia-tion of buildings. The range in size and quality of houses, representing their owners’ wealth and standing in the com-munity, reﬂ  ects social stratiﬁ  cation. Material well-being is 
the chief determinant of stratiﬁ  cation in Western commer-cial agricultural regions, where it translates into more elab-orate homes. In Africa, as in most other places, a higher social position in the community is associated with a more impressive house. The house of the chief or headman may not only be more elaborate than others but may also be in a more prominent location. In India, caste still strongly inﬂ  u-
ences daily life, including village housing; the manors of landlords, often comprising large walled compounds, stand in striking contrast to the modest houses of domestic ser-vants, farm workers, carpenters, and craftspeople. The poorest people of the lowest castes live in small one-room, wattle-and-thatch dwellings. In Cambodia, the buildings in stilt villages built throughout the Mekong Basin look simi-lar (Fig. 11.14). The building along the pond in the left foreground of Figure 11.14 has a different function—it is an outhouse. Its location on the pond accounts for a major part of the pollution problem in this village: waste from the outhouses drains directly into the pond, which has become mosquito-infested and severely polluted.
The functional differentiation (like the functional 
zonation of cities whereby different areas of the village play different roles and function differently) of buildings within farm villages is more elaborate in some societies than in

others. Protection of livestock and storage of harvested 
crops are primary functions of farm villages, and in many villages where subsistence farming is the prevailing way of life, the storage place for grains and other food is con-structed with as much care as the best-built house. Moisture and vermin must be kept away from stored food; containers of grain often stand on stilts under a carefully thatched roof or behind walls made of carefully maintained sun-dried mud. In India’s villages, the paddy-bin made of mud (in which rice is stored) often stands inside the house. Similarly, livestock pens are often attached to houses, or, as in Africa, dwellings are built in a circle surrounding the corral.
The functional differentiation of buildings is greatest 
in Western cultures, where a single farmstead may contain as many buildings as an entire hamlet elsewhere in the world. A prosperous North American farm is likely to include a two-story farmhouse, a stable, a barn, and various outbuildings, including a garage for motorized equipment, a workshop, a shed for tools, and a silo for grain storage (Fig. 11.15). The space these structures occupy can exceed that used by entire villages in Japan, China, and other agrarian regions where space is at a greater premium.
Think of an agricultural region where you have visited or lived. Describe the imprint of agriculture on the landscape and consider what the cultural landscape tells you about how agriculture is produced in this region or how produc-tion has changed over time.HOW IS AGRICULTURE CURRENTLY 
ORGANIZED GEOGRAPHICALLY, AND HOW HAS AGRIBUSINESS INFLUENCED THE CONTEMPORARY GEOGRAPHY OF AGRICULTURE?
Understanding global agricultural patterns requires 
looking at more than market location, land use, and trans-
portation costs—the factors analyzed by von Thünen. We must also consider the effects of different climate and soil conditions, variations in farming methods and technol-ogy, the role of governments and social norms, and the lasting impacts of history. Decisions made by colonial powers in Europe led to the establishment of plantations from Middle America to Malaysia. The plantations grew crops not for local markets but for consumers in Europe; similarly, U.S. companies founded huge plantations in the Americas. Over the past few centuries, the impact of this plantation system transformed the map of world agricul-ture. The end of colonial rule did not signal the end of the agricultural practices and systems that had been imposed on the former colonial areas. Even food-poor countries must continue to grow commercial crops for export on some of their best soils where their own food could instead be harvested. Long-entrenched agricultural systems and patterns are not quickly or easily transformed.
Commercial farming has come to dominate in the 
world’s economic core, as well as some of the places in the semi-periphery and periphery. Commercial farming is 
the agriculture of large-scale grain producers and cattle ranches, mechanized equipment and factory-type labor  Figure 11.15

forces, of plantations and proﬁ  t. It is a world apart from 
the traditional farms of Asia and Africa.
The spatial expansion of modern commercial agri-
culture began in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when Europe became a market for agricultural products from around the world: Moreover, European countries manufactured and sold in their colonies the ﬁ  nished prod-
ucts made from imported raw materials. Thus, cotton grown in Egypt, Sudan, India, and other countries colo-nized by Europe was bought cheaply, imported to European factories, and made into clothes—many of which were then exported and sold, often in the very colo-nies where the cotton had been grown in the ﬁ  rst place.
Major changes in transportation and food storage, 
especially refrigeration, further intertwined agricultural production and food processing regions around the world during the twentieth century (Fig. 11.16). The beef indus-try of Argentina, for example, secured a world market when the invention of refrigerated ships made it possible to transport a highly perishable commodity over long dis-tances. European colonial powers required farmers in their colonies to cultivate speciﬁ  c crops. One major impact of 
colonial agriculture was the establishment of monocul-
ture (dependence on a single agricultural commodity) throughout much of the colonial world. Colonies became known for certain crops, and colonizers came to rely on those crops. Ghanaians still raise cacao; Moçambiquans still grow cotton; and Sri Lankans still produce tea. The production of cash crops in poorer countries is still per-petuated by loan and aid requirements from lending coun-tries, the World T rade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank (see Chapter 10).The World Map of Climates
Before we can study the distribution of agriculture in the world today, we need to examine Figure 11.17, the distri-bution of climate zones. All of the elements of weather, absorption of the sun’s energy, rotation of the Earth, cir-culation of the oceans, movement of weather systems, and the jet stream, produce a pattern of climates represented in the map—and those climate patterns have a profound impact on what can be grown where. We owe this remark-able map to Wladimir Köppen (1846–1940), who devised a scheme called the Köppen climate classiﬁ  cation 
system  for classifying the world’s climates on the basis of 
temperature and precipitation.
Köppen’s map provides one means of understanding 
the distribution of climatic regions (areas with similar climatic characteristics) across the planet. The legend looks complicated, but it really is not; here is one of those maps worth spending some time on. For present pur-poses, it is enough to get a sense of the distribution of the major types of climate. The letter categories in the legend give a clear indication of the conditions they represent.
The (A) climates are hot or very warm and generally 
humid. The “no dry season” (Af) regions are equatorial 
rainforest regions. The “short dry season” (Am) climate is known as the monsoon climate. And if you can envisage an African savanna, you know what the (Aw, savanna) desig-nation means.
Once you realize that the yellow and light brown 
colors on the map represent dry climates (BW, desert and BS, steppe), it becomes clear how much of the world has 
limited water availability. Nonetheless, some very large Field Note
“The technology of refrigeration has kept pace with the containerization of seaborne freight trafﬁ  c. When we sailed into the port of Dunedin, New Zealand, I was unsure of just what those red boxes were. Closer inspection revealed that they are refrigeration units, to which incoming containers are attached. Meats and other perishables can thus be kept frozen until they are transferred to a refrig-erator ship.”

population clusters have developed in these water-
deﬁ cient regions, especially at lower (and warmer) lati-
tudes. The world faces a long-term water crisis, and the Köppen map helps show why.
The (C) climates also have familiar names. The (Cf) 
climate, represented by dark green, prevails over the southeastern United States. If you know the local climate in Atlanta or Nashville or Jacksonville, you understand why this climate is often called “humid temperate.” It is moist, and it does not get as cold as it does in Canada or as warm (continuously, anyway) as in the Amazon Basin. If you have experienced this kind of climate, the map gives you a good idea of what it’s like in much of eastern China, southeastern Australia, and a large part of southeastern South America.
The “dry summer” (C) climates are known as 
Mediterranean climates (the small s in Cs means that sum-mers are dry). This mild climate occurs not only around the Mediterranean Sea, and thus in the famous wine coun-tries of France, Italy, and Spain, but also in California, Chile, South Africa’s Cape, and southern parts of Australia. So you know what kind of climate to expect in Rome, San Francisco, Santiago, Cape T own, and Adelaide.
Farther toward the poles, the planet gets rather cold. 
Note that the (D) climates dominate in the United States’ upper Midwest and Canada, but it gets even colder in 2

Siberia. The “milder” (Da) climates (here the key is the 
small a, which denotes a warm summer) are found only in limited parts of Eurasia. Winters are very cold in all the (D) climates and downright frigid (and long) in the (Dfb) and (Dfc) regions. (D) climates are generally continental, on the interior of continents, instead of on coasts. Continental locations make (D) climates generally drier than (C) climates. The continentality of (D) climates also contributes to the large range of temperatures found across the year because land heats and cools much faster than water.
Polar climates, where tundra and ice prevail, are 
found poleward of (D) climates. The polar location of (E) climates means temperatures are cold throughout the year. As a result, plant life does not break down and nour-ish the soil during the year, and also a layer of permafrost (frozen ground) exists year round.
The World Map of Agriculture
When comparing the world map of agriculture (Fig. 11.18) with the distribution of climate types across the world (Fig. 11.17), we can see the correlation between climate and agriculture. For example, drier lands rely on livestock ranching, whereas moister climates are marked with grain SOUTHERN OCEANATLANTIC

production. Understanding the major agricultural zones 
shown in Figure 11.18 requires looking at both environ-mental and social variables.
Cash Crops and Plantation Agriculture
Colonialism profoundly shaped nonsubsistence farming in many poorer countries. Colonial powers implemented agri-culture systems to beneﬁ  t their needs, a practice that has tended to lock poorer countries into production of one or two “cash” crops. Cash farming continues to provide badly needed money, even if the conditions of sale to the urban-industrial world are unfavorable. In the Caribbean region, for example, whole national economies depend on sugar exports (sugar having been introduced by the European col-onists in the 1600s). These island countries wish to sell the sugar at the highest possible price, but they are not in a posi-tion to dictate prices. Sugar is produced by many countries in various parts of the world, as well as by farmers in the global economic core (Fig. 11.18). Governments in the core place quotas on imports of agricultural products and subsi-dize domestic production of the same commodities.
Occasionally, producing countries consider forming 
a cartel in order to present a united front to the importing countries and to gain a better price, as  oil-producing 
states did during the 1970s. Such collective action is dif-ﬁ cult, as the wealthy importing countries can buy prod-
ucts from countries that are not members of the cartel.  Figure 11.18

Also, the withholding of produce by exporting countries 
may stimulate domestic production among importers. For example, although cane sugar accounts for more than 70 percent of the commercial world sugar crop each year, farmers in the United States, Europe, and Russia produce sugar from sugar beets. In Europe and Russia, these beets already yield 25 percent of the annual world sugar har-vest. Collective action by countries producing sugarcane could easily cause that percentage to increase.
When cash crops are grown on large estates, we use 
the term plantation agriculture to describe the produc-tion system. Plantations are colonial legacies that persist in poorer, primarily tropical, countries along with sub-sistence farming. Figure 11.18 shows that plantation agriculture (7 in the legend) continues in Middle and South America, Africa, and South Asia. Laid out to pro-duce bananas, sugar, coffee, and cocoa in Middle and South America, rubber, cocoa, and tea in West and East Africa, tea in South Asia, and rubber in Southeast Asia, these plantations have outlasted the period of decoloni-zation and continue to provide specialized crops to wealthier markets. Many of the most productive planta-tions are owned by European or American individuals or corporations.
Multinational corporations have tenaciously pro-
tected their economic interests in plantations. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Guatemalan government began an agrarian reform program. The plan entailed renting unused land Tropic of Cancer

from foreign corporations to landless citizens at a low 
appraised value. The United Fruit Company, an American ﬁ rm with extensive holdings in the country, was greatly 
concerned by this turn of events. The company had close ties to powerful individuals in the American government, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, CIA director Allen Dulles (the two were brothers), and Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs John Moors Cabot. In 1954, the United States supported the over-throw of the government of Guatemala because of stated concerns about the spread of communism. This ended all land reform initiatives, however, leading many commenta-tors to question the degree to which the United Fruit Company was behind the coup. Indeed, with the exception of President Dwight Eisenhower, every individual involved in the decision to help topple Guatemala’s government had ties to the company. This example illustrates the inextrica-ble links between economics and political motivations—and it raises questions about the degree to which multina-tional corporations based in wealthy countries inﬂ  uence 
decisions about politics, agriculture, and land reform in other parts of the world.
Commercial Livestock, Fruit, 
and Grain Agriculture
As Figure 11.18 shows, by far the largest areas of commer-
cial agriculture (1 through 4 in the legend) lie outside the tropics. Dairying (1) is widespread at the northern mar-gins of the midlatitudes—particularly in the northeastern United States and in northwestern Europe. Fruit, truck, and specialized crops (2), including the market gardens von Thünen observed around Rostock, are found in the eastern and southeastern United States and in widely dis-persed small areas where environments are favorable. In Central Asia and the Sahara, major oases stand out as commercial agriculture on the map.
Mixed livestock and crop farming (3) is widespread in 
the more humid parts of the midlatitudes, including much of the eastern United States, western Europe, and western Russia, but it is also found in smaller areas in Uruguay, Brazil, and South Africa. Commercial grain farming (4) prevails in the drier parts of the midlatitudes, including the southern Prairie Provinces of Canada, in the Dakotas and Montana in the United States, as well as in Nebraska, Kansas, and adja-cent areas. Spring wheat (planted in the spring and harvested in the summer) grows in the northern zone, and winter wheat (planted in the autumn and harvested in the spring of the following year) is used in the southern area. An even larger belt of wheat farming extends from Ukraine through Russia into Kazakhstan. The Argentinean and Australian wheat zones are smaller in area, but their exports are an important component of world trade.
Even a cursory glance at Figure 11.18 reveals the wide 
distribution of livestock ranching (12), the raising of domesticated animals for the production of meat and by-products, such as leather and wool. In addition to the large cattle-ranching areas in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, much of eastern Brazil and Argentina are devoted to ranching, along with large tracts of Australia and New Zealand, as well as South Africa. Y ou may see a Thünian pattern here: livestock ranching on the periphery and con-sumers in the cities. Refrigeration has overcome the prob-lem of perishability, and high volume has lowered the unit cost of transporting beef, lamb, and other animal products.
Subsistence Agriculture
The map of world agriculture labels three types of subsis-tence agriculture: subsistence crop and livestock farming; intensively subsistence farming (chieﬂ  y rice); and inten-sively subsistence farming (chieﬂ  y wheat and other crops). 
In some regions that are labeled as subsistence, that label does not tell the whole story. For example, in Southeast Asia, rice is grown on small plots and is labor-intensive, so that subsistence and export production occur side by side. Despite the region’s signiﬁ  cant rice exports, most 
Southeast Asian farmers are subsistence farmers. Thus, Southeast Asia appears on the map as primarily a subsis-tence grain-growing area.
Mediterranean Agriculture
Only one form of agriculture mentioned in the legend of Figure 11.18 refers to a particular climatic zone: Mediterranean agriculture (6). As the map shows, this kind of specialized farming occurs only in areas where the dry summer Mediterranean climate prevails (Fig. 11.17): along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, in parts of California and Oregon, in central Chile, at South Africa’s Cape, and in parts of southwestern and southern Australia. Farmers here grow a special combination of crops: grapes, olives, citrus fruits, ﬁ  gs, certain vegetables, dates, and oth-
ers. From these areas come many wines; these and other commodities are exported to distant markets because Mediterranean products tend to be popular and command high prices.
Drug Agriculture
There are important agricultural activities that cannot easily be mapped at the global scale and therefore do not appear in Figure 11.18. One of those is the cultivation of crops that are turned into illegal drugs. Because of the high demand for drugs—particularly in the global eco-nomic core—farmers in the periphery often ﬁ  nd it more 
proﬁ table to cultivate poppy, coca, or marijuana plants 
than to grow standard food crops. Cultivation of these plants has increased steadily over the past several decades, and they now constitute an important source of revenue c11Agriculture.indd Page 392  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 392  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

for parts of the global economic periphery. Coca, the 
source plant of cocaine, is grown widely in Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. Over half of the world’s cultivation of coca occurs in Colombia alone.
Heroin and opium are derived from opium poppy 
plants, grown predominantly in Southeast and South Asia, especially in Afghanistan and Myanmar. In the 2008 World Drug Report, the United Nations reported that 92 percent of the world’s opium production took place in Afghanistan. The United States-led overthrow of the T aliban in Afghanistan in 2001 created a power vacuum in the country and an opportunity for illegal drug produc-tion to quickly rebound (the austere T aliban government had virtually eradicated opium production in Afghanistan by 2001). Most opium production in Afghanistan today occurs in ﬁ  ve unstable southern provinces.
United States government policies have affected 
production of illegal drugs in Latin America. During the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. government worked with local authorities to crack down on coca production in Colombia. With this crackdown, much of the drug pro-duction and trafﬁ  cking moved north to northern Mexico. 
In June 2005, the Economist quoted one American ofﬁ  cial 
as reporting that “Mexican criminal gangs ‘exert more inﬂ uence over drug trafﬁ  cking in the U.S. than any other 
group.’ Mexicans now control 11 of the 13 largest drug markets in the United States.” Marijuana and opium pro-duction in Mexico is on the rise, and the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) is concerned about the high potency of marijuana coming out of Mexico and Canada. Although more than 90 percent of the world’s opium production is in Afghanistan, most heroin (which is derived from opium) coming into the United States comes from Mexico or Colombia. The heroin consumed in the western United States comes from opium grown in Mexico, whereas the heroin consumed in eastern United States comes from opium grown in Colombia.
Drug cartels that oversee the drug trade have 
brought crime and violence to the places where they hold sway (Fig. 11.19). There are areas in Rio de Janeiro

where the ofﬁ  cial police have little control, and drug 
lords have imposed reigns of terror over swaths of the countryside in parts of Central and South America, Southwest Asia, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere. The drug trade depends on the voracious appetite for mind-altering substances in North America and Europe in particular.
The supply of marijuana in the United States tra-
ditionally comes from Mexico and Canada, as the DEA has reported. But an increasing amount of marijuana consumed in the United States is grown in the United States. Since 1996, a total of 16 states in the United States have legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes. In addition to Alaska, Hawaii, Michigan, Maine, Vermont, New Jersey and Rhode Island, most of the states with medicinal marijuana are in the western United States. Marijuana production for legal and ille-gal consumption in the United States is estimated to be “the largest cash crop in the United States.” An April 2011 article in the New York Times valued marijuana 
production at $40 billion, “with California, T ennessee, Kentucky, Hawaii and Washington the top ﬁ  ve produc-
tion states,” despite the fact that medicinal marijuana is not legal in T ennessee or Kentucky.
Marijuana production has more than a monetary 
impact. Energy analyst Evan Mills distributed a study in April 2011 that estimates the energy consumed in pro-ducing marijuana in the United States costs about $5 bil-lion a year and accounts for 1 percent of all power con-sumed in the United States. Marijuana grown outdoors has much lower energy costs than marijuana grown indoors. Growers plant crops on public lands, especially in the west, because the remote location of public lands makes detection less likely for growers. Also, the land is public and therefore not owned by any one person to whom a crop could be traced. Marijuana grown indoors consumes massive amounts of electricity. The cost of indoor production includes grow lamps that are the kinds used in operating rooms, dehumidiﬁ  ers, air condi-tioners, electric generators, water pumps, heaters, carbon dioxide generators, ventilation systems, and electrical control systems.
Informal Agriculture
Small-scale informal agricultural activities are also miss-ing from maps of global agricultural patterns, yet these play an important role in the contemporary world. Millions of people cultivate small plots of land in and around their homes for domestic consumption or to trade informally with others. These activities are not captured by formal agricultural statistics, but the food that is grown in this fashion plays a vital role in the lives of literally billions of people. Even city dwellers in many parts of the world are involved in small-scale agricultural activities—cultivating or raising livestock in small plots of land around their dwellings, on rooftop gardens, or in community gardens. Such practices are encouraged in some places—notably China—but more often they are ignored, or even discouraged. Y et the contribution urban agriculture can make to the food security of city dwellers is attracting growing attention, and it is likely to grow in importance in the coming years.
Political Inﬂ  uences on Agriculture
As we noted above, the European colonial period provides a stunning example of the impact of political circum-stances on agriculture. Consider, for example, one of the most signiﬁ  cant contemporary cash crops: cotton. 
Colonialism encouraged the production of plantation-scale cotton in many regions of the world (e.g., India), and colonial powers established a trading network that led to the globalization of the cotton industry.
Cotton cultivation expanded greatly during the 
nineteenth century, when the Industrial Revolution pro-duced machines for cotton ginning, spinning, and weav-ing that increased productive capacity, brought prices down, and put cotton goods within the reach of mass markets. As with sugar, the colonial powers laid out large-scale cotton plantations, sometimes under irrigation. Cotton cultivation was also promoted on a smaller scale in numerous other countries: in Egypt’s Nile Delta, in the Punjab region shared by Pakistan and India, and in Sudan, Uganda, Mexico, and Brazil. The colonial pro-ducers received low prices for their cotton, and the European industries prospered as cheap raw materials were converted into large quantities of items for sale at home and abroad.
Wealthier countries continue to buy cotton, and cot-
ton sales remain important for some former colonies. But they now compete with cotton being grown in the United States, Northeast China, and Central Asia. Moreover, cotton is in competition today with synthetic ﬁ  bers such 
as nylon and rayon. As global supply and demand shifts in response to changing markets and new alternatives, econ-omies that have been built around cotton production can go through wrenching adjustments.
Even as countries emerged from colonial control, 
they were left with a legacy of large landholdings owned or controlled by wealthy individuals or business entities. That legacy contributed to uprisings among the rural poor in places such as Mexico, Cuba, and Guatemala. Efforts on the part of governmental authorities in some ex-colonies to confront this situation provide a different c11Agriculture.indd Page 394  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 394  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Is Agriculture Currently Organized Geographically, and How Has Agribusiness Inﬂ  uenced the Contemporary Geography of Agricu lture?    395
example of the impact of politics on agriculture. In some 
cases governments enacted policies that perpetuated preexisting inequalities; in others land reforms were introduced that served to redistribute land to individuals or communities. The latter were common in parts of Central and South America, leading to a substantial reorganization of the rural landscape—sometimes spreading wealth more broadly. Pressure for land reform continues in many countries, and land issues are at the heart of many social movements in the global economic periphery and semi-periphery.
A more mundane, but common, way in which gov-
ernments inﬂ  uence agriculture is through tax regulations 
and subsidies favoring certain land uses. The U.S. gov-ernment currently spends more than $10 billion subsidiz-ing large-scale farmers. Pushed by a strong farm lobby, these subsidies guarantee ﬂ  oor prices for staple crops and 
protect farmers in bad years. They give large-scale agri-culture an advantage over smaller scale alternatives. But in the past 60 years perhaps the most dramatic examples of politics affecting agriculture have come from the com-munist world. The governments of the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, and Maoist China initiated far-reaching land reforms that led to the creation of large collective farms and agricultural communes. This giant experiment resulted in the massive displacement of rural peoples and irrevocably altered traditional rural social systems. T oday farming privatization is under way in both Russia and China.
Socio-cultural Inﬂ  uences on Agriculture
Agriculture is also affected by social and cultural factors. As incomes rise, many people start consuming more meat and processed foods, seek out better quality fruits and vegetables, or demand fresh produce year round. Consider the case of coffee, one the most important lux-
ury crops  in the modern world. Coffee was ﬁ  rst domesti-
cated in the region of present-day Ethiopia, but today it is grown primarily in Middle and South America, where approximately 70 percent of the world’s annual produc-tion is harvested.
In the early eighteenth century, coffee was virtually 
unknown in most of the world. Y et, after petroleum, cof-fee is now the second most valuable legally traded com-modity in the world. The United States buys more than half of all the coffee sold on world markets annually, and western Europe imports most of the rest. A well-known image of coffee production in North America is Juan Valdez, portrayed as a simple yet proud Colombian peas-ant who handpicks beans by day and enjoys a cup of his own coffee by night. This image is quite contrary to the reality of much coffee production in Latin America, however. In most cases coffee is produced on enormous, foreign-owned plantations, where it is picked by local laborers who are hired at very low wage rates. Most cof-fee is sent abroad; and if the coffee pickers drink coffee, it is probably of the imported and instant variety.
Recently, however, coffee production has under-
gone changes as more consumers demand fair trade coffee and more coffee producers seek fair trade certi-fication. CNN reports that “Retailers who are certi-fied Fair T raders return up to 40 percent of the retail price of an item to the producer.” Once a producer meets the requirements of organic coffee production and a few other criteria, that producer can be regis-tered on the International Fair T rade Coffee Register. Coffee importers then purchase the fair trade coffee directly from the registered producers. Being regis-tered guarantees coffee producers a “fair trade price” of $1.40 per pound of coffee (plus bonuses of $0.30 per pound for organic). Over 1.2 million farmers and workers in 58 countries, mainly in the periphery and semi-periphery, are connected to the 827 fair trade certiﬁ  ed producer organizations worldwide (Fig. 11.20). 
The fair trade campaign pressured Starbucks into sell-ing fair trade coffee, and in 2010, Starbucks committed to doubling the amount of fair trade coffee it pur-chases, which accounts for 40 percent of the fair trade coffee imported into the United States. Other retailers have followed suit; for example, all espresso sold at Dunkin’ Donuts in North America and Europe is fair trade certified. Fair trade coffee is available at large

retail outlets and under corporate brands at T arget, 
Wal-Mart, and Sam’s Club.
The push for fair trade production shows how social 
movements can inﬂ  uence agriculture. And fair trade goes 
beyond coffee. Dozens of commodities and products, ranging from tea, bananas, fresh cut ﬂ  owers, and choco-
late to soccer balls, can be certiﬁ  ed fair trade. According 
to Fair T rade Labeling Organizations International, con-sumers spent more than $4.84 billion on fair trade certi-ﬁ ed products in 2008.
People’s changing tastes also shape the geography of 
agriculture. T ea is a rather recent addition to the Western diet. It was grown in China perhaps 2000 years ago, but it became popular in Europe only during the nineteenth century. The colonial powers (mainly the British) estab-lished enormous tea plantations in Asia and thus began the full-scale ﬂ  ow of tea into European markets. T ea pro-duction, both the fair trade and the traditionally traded varieties, is on the rise globally to meet the increasing demand.
Even as social preferences shape agricultural pro-
duction, the consumption of particular products can have social consequences. Just a few decades ago, city dwellers in West Africa primarily consumed grains grown from nearby ﬁ  elds. Over the past three decades, relatively cheap 
imported rice from Malaysia and Thailand has become an important food source, and many locals came to prefer the taste of the imported rice. This set of circumstances left West Africa vulnerable when the price of imported grains skyrocketed in 2008. Local riots broke out and a food crisis ensued.
Agribusiness and the Changing Geography 
of Agriculture
The commercialization of crop production and the 
associated development of new agricultural technolo-gies have changed how agricultural goods are grown and have sparked the rapid growth of agribusiness. Agribusiness is an encompassing term for the busi-nesses that provide a vast array of goods and services to support the agricultural industry. Agribusiness serves to connect local farms to a spatially extensive web of pro-duction and exchange. At the same time, it fosters the spatial concentration of agricultural activities. Both of these trends are revealed in the development of the poultry industry in the United States.
Early in the twentieth century, poultry production in 
the United States was highly disaggregated, with many farmers raising a few chickens as part of a multifaceted farming operation. Over the past 50 years, however, poul-try production has fundamentally changed. T oday, the farmers on the Delmarva Peninsula account for 8 percent of poultry production in the United States, and they do so by contracting and working directly with four major poul-try companies. In an article on modern agriculture, David Lanegran summarized the impact of this transformation as follows:
T oday, chickens are produced by large agribusiness com-panies operating hatcheries, feed mills, and process-ing plants. They supply chicks and feed to the farm-ers. The farmers are responsible for building a house and maintaining proper temperature and water sup-ply. Once a week the companies ﬁ  ll the feed bins for the 
farmers, and guarantee them a price for the birds. The companies even collect market-ready birds and take them away for processing and marketing. Most of the nation’s poultry supply is handled by a half dozen very large corporations that control the process from chicks to chicken pieces in stores.
Lanegran goes on to show how selective breeding has produced faster growing, bigger chickens, which are housed in enormous broiler houses that are largely mechanized.
Broiler houses are concentrated in northwestern 
Arkansas, northern Georgia, the Delmarva Peninsula (Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia) east of Washington, D.C., the Piedmont areas of North Carolina, and the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia (Fig. 11.21). Lanegran shows that in many respects the “farmers” who manage these operations are involved in manufacturing as much or more than farming. They are as likely to spend their time talking to bank ofﬁ  cers, overseeing the repair of 
equipment, and negotiating with vendors as they are tend-ing their animals. As such, they symbolize the breakdown between the rural and the urban in wealthier parts of the world—as well as the interconnections between rural places and distant markets.
The poultry example is not unusual. During the 
1990s, hog production on the Oklahoma and T exas pan-handles increased rapidly with the arrival of corporate hog farms. John Fraser Hart and Chris Mayda described the quick change with statistics. In 1992, the U.S. Census of Agriculture counted just over 31,000 hogs marketed in T exas County, Oklahoma, and just four years later “the panhandle was plastered with proliferating pork places, and T exas County alone produced 2 million hogs. It was the epicenter of an area that produced 4 million hogs, 4 percent of the national total and one-seventh as many ﬁ nished hogs as the entire state of Iowa.” The availability 
of both inexpensive water and natural gas on the Oklahoma panhandle was enticing for corporate hog farms, which require both. Hart and Mayda explain that the “reasonable” price of land and the accessibility to “growing metropolitan markets of the South and the West” also made the region attractive for hog produc-tion. Similar to poultry production, a corporation built a c11Agriculture.indd Page 396  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 396  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

processing plant, and production (both by farms owned 
by the corporation and those owned privately) increased to meet the demand (Fig. 11.22).
Because of agribusiness, the range and variety of 
products on the shelves of urban supermarkets in the United States is a world apart from the constant quest for sufﬁ cient, nutritionally balanced food that exists in some 
places. A global network of farm production is oriented to the one-ﬁ  fth of the world’s population that is highly urbanized, wealthy, and powerful. Few farmers in distant lands have real control over land-use decisions, for the better off people in the global economic core continue to decide what will be bought at what price. The colonial era may have come to an end, but, as the map of agricultural regions reminds us, its imprint remains strong.Environmental Impacts of Commercial 
Agriculture
Commercial agriculture creates signiﬁ  cant environmen-
tal change. The growing demand for protein-rich foods 
and more efﬁ  cient technologies are leading to overﬁ  sh-
ing in many regions of the world. In many places ﬁ  sh 
stocks are declining at an alarming rate. From mid-cen-tury to the late 1980s, the ﬁ  sh harvest from oceans and seas increased ﬁ  vefold, and there seemed to be no limit to it. Countries quarreled over ﬁ  shing rights, poorer countries leased ﬁ  shing grounds to richer ones, and ﬂ eets of trawlers plied the oceans. International attempts 
to regulate ﬁ  shing industries failed. Then in the 1970s and 1980s, overﬁ  shing began destroying ﬁ  sh stocks. The c11Agriculture.indd Page 397  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 397  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

cod ﬁ  sheries on Canada’s Grand Banks off Newfoundland 
collapsed. In 1975 biologists estimated the Atlantic blue-ﬁ n tuna population at 250,000; today the western stock is 
listed as critically endangered, and the stock in the Mediterranean is listed as endangered. From ocean perch and king crabs off Alaska to rock lobsters and roughies off New Zealand, ﬁ  sh and shellﬁ  sh populations 
are depleted. The total annual catch is also declining and may already be beyond the point of recovery. Much of the damage has already been done, and ﬁ  shing industries 
in many parts of the world have reported dwindling har-vests and missing species.
If you travel to Mediterranean Europe today you will 
see a landscape that reﬂ  ects the clearing of forests in ancient times to facilitate agriculture and trade. Look carefully at many hillslopes and you will see evidence of terraces cut into the hills many centuries ago. The indus-trialization and commercialization of agriculture has accelerated the pace and extent of agriculture’s impact on the environment in recent times. More land has been cleared, and the land that is under cultivation is ever more intensively used.
Signiﬁ  cant agriculturally driven changes to the envi-
ronment go far beyond the simple clearing of land. They range from soil erosion to changes in the organic content of soils to the presence of chemicals (herbicides, pesti-cides, even antibiotics and growth hormones from live-stock feces) in soils and groundwater. In places where large commercial crop farms dominate, the greatest con-cerns often center on the introduction of chemical fertil-izers and pesticides into the environment—as well as soil erosion.

genetically modiﬁ  ed crops carries with it another set of 
environmental concerns.
The growth of organic farming (discussed at the 
beginning of the chapter) and the move toward the use 
of local foods in some communities can beneﬁ  t the envi-ronment. Y et such initiatives have had only modest impacts on the majority of the world’s peoples and places. A telling sign is that the organic movement has had little effect on the production of the staple foods on which billions of people depend. Moreover, large cor-porate entities are playing an increasingly prominent role in the organic movement—raising controversies about standards and rendering illusory the ideal of an independent organic farmer engaged in “sustainable” agriculture. Nonetheless, better regulated organic farming and local food initiatives are clearly on the rise. Their proponents argue that they are priced out of the market by subsidies favoring large farms and by the failure of most agribusiness to incorporate the environmental and health costs of large-scale, intensive farming. And such arguments are gaining traction.
The environmental impacts of large-scale intensive 
agriculture can be particularly severe when agriculture moves into marginal environments, as has happened with the expansion of livestock herding into arid or semiarid areas (see the map of world climates, Fig. 11.17). The nat-ural vegetation in these areas cannot always sustain the herds, especially during prolonged droughts. As a result, ecological degradation and, in some areas, desertiﬁ  cation 
(see Chapter 10) are the result.
In recent decades, the popularity of fast-food chains 
that serve hamburgers has led to the deforestation of wooded areas in order to open up additional pastures for beef cattle, notably in Central and South America. Livestock ranching is an extremely land-, water-, and energy-intensive process. Signiﬁ  cant land must be turned 
over to the cultivation of cattle feed, and the animals themselves need extensive grazing areas. By stripping away vegetation, the animals can promote the erosion of river banks, with implications for everything from water quality to wildlife habitat.
The Challenge of Feeding Everyone
Food riots that break out in low-income countries and stories of famine in countries including Somalia, Sudan, Malawi, and Zimbabwe remind us that food security remains a challenge for millions of people around the globe. Although food production has expanded in some parts of the world, food production per capita has actually declined in Africa over the past decade. Worldwide, nearly 1 billion people are malnourished. Currently, enough food is produced worldwide to feed Earth’s population, but in the face of inadequate distribution systems and a widespread poverty, food security looms as a signiﬁ  cant 
issue for the twenty-ﬁ  rst century.
As cities expand outward, some of the most fertile, 
productive farmlands are lost to housing and retail devel-opments (Fig. 11.23). Many cities were established amid productive farmlands that could supply the needs of their inhabitants. Now the cities are absorbing the productive farmlands as they expand. Between 1987 and 1992, China lost more than one million hectares of farmland to urban-ization. In the United States, the American Farmland T rust, identiﬁ  ed 12 U.S. areas where farmland was giving way to urban uses at a rapid rate in the 1990s, including California’s Central Valley, South Florida, California’s coastal zone, North Carolina’s Piedmont, and the Chicago–Milwaukee–Madison triangle in Illinois–Wisconsin. These 12 areas represent only 5 percent of U.S. farmland, but they produce 17 percent of total agricultural sales, 67 per-cent of all fruit, 55 percent of all vegetables, and one-quarter of all dairy products. Figures for other countries in the richer parts of the world (such as Japan) as well as for poorer countries (such as Egypt) prove that urban expansion into productive farmland is a global problem with serious implications for the future.
The conversion of farmlands into housing develop-
ments is not conﬁ  ned to areas close to major cities that could become suburbs. Expendable wealth and the desire to have a place to “get away from it all” have led highly productive commercial agricultural areas to be converted into regions for second homes. On the Delmarva Peninsula in the United States, where poultry production is concentrated, the price of land has risen as urbanites from Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Maryland, and New Y ork bought land on the eastern shore to build second homes. Many of the new residents on the peninsula are demanding higher envi-ronmental standards. Rising land prices and stricter envi-ronmental standards are placing a squeeze on the cost of chicken production. T yson Foods closed its production facility in spring 2004, and the Washington Times reported 650 lost jobs. As urban population continues to grow and expendable wealth increases for the wealthiest of the popu-lation, more agricultural lands will be converted to housing developments, especially lands in beautiful areas with recre-ational amenities such as the eastern shore of Maryland (the Delmarva Peninsula) and its Chesapeake Bay.
Population growth and the loss of agricultural land 
help to explain why global food prices have been on the rise for more than a decade. Putting further pressure on food prices are consumption increases in countries experiencing rapid developments (e.g. China) and a trend toward using food crops for biofuel production. These factors were behind an almost 50 percent surge in global food prices between April 2007 and March 2008. Food riots broke out in some cities, and the specter of large-scale famine grew. Another more recent spike in food prices was one factor in the outbreak of revolutions in North c11Agriculture.indd Page 399  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 399  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

Africa and Southwest Asia in spring 2011. A convergence 
of changing land use, increasing use of grains for fuel, cor-rupt governments, and environmental impacts works against the provision of adequate food at reasonable prices for the world’s poor.
Despite the severity of the situation, in today’s world 
it is possible for many people to put farming largely out of their minds. As a result of industrialization of agriculture and improvements in transportation, consumers come in contact with farmers much less frequently than did previ-ous generations. On a freezing cold winter day in Cincinnati, Ohio, consumers can purchase fresh straw-berries grown in Chile. Consumers can also purchase highly processed foods with long shelf lives and forget where the item was purchased, much less think of the farm work that went into the ingredients, when they get around to consuming it.
As a result of the growing distance between farmers 
and consumers, geographers have sought to draw attention to food deserts, which are areas with limited access to 
fresh, nutritious foods (Fig. 11.24). Urban food deserts are typically found in low-income neighborhoods where con-sumers have little access to medium-size and large grocery stores and instead have access to small grocery stores ﬁ  lled 
mainly with processed, energy-dense but nutrient poor food. British geographer Hilary Shaw found (2006) that consumers in urban food deserts were more likely to purchase processed, energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods because of the lower expense of these foods relative to fresh fruits and vegetables and also to avoid wasting food.c11Agriculture.indd Page 400  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 400  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

Summary
Agricultural production has changed drastically since the First Agricultural Revolution. 
T oday, agricultural products, even perishable ones, are shipped around the world. Agriculture has industrialized, and in many places, food production is dominated by large-scale agribusiness. A major commonality between ancient agriculture and modern agriculture remains: the need to change. T rial and error were the norms of early plant and animal domestication. Agriculture makes distinct impressions on the cultural land-scape, from how land surveys, to land ownership, to land use. In the globalized economy, what is produced where depends on many factors, from climate and government regula-tion to technology and worldwide demand for crops. Figure 11.24

closed” and replaced with larger national chains in regional 
trade centers. Michimi and Wimberly also found a differ-ence between food deserts in metropolitan and nonmetro-politan areas of the United States. In metropolitan areas, obesity rates increased and the rate of fruit and vegetable consumption decreased with increasing distance from gro-cery stores. They did not ﬁ  nd the same correlation in non-metropolitan areas, however.Geographers Akihiko Michimi and Michael Wimberly 
found that rural food deserts lack not only access to larger grocery stores but also public transportation to reach larger grocery stores. In their study of food deserts and access to fruits and vegetables, the geographers found that since the 1980s in rural areas of the United States a “restructuring of food retail industries has occurred such that local grocery 
stores that once served small rural communities have been c11Agriculture.indd Page 401  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 401  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  Field Note    Branding the Backboard  
  Walking through a relatively poor neighborhood in Skopje, Macedonia, with the 
midday Muslim call to prayer ringing in my ears, the last thing I expected to see was something from my home State of Oregon (Fig. 12.1). But there it was—the unmistakable Nike swoosh on the backboard of a basketball hoop where the local kids play pick-up games!  
  As ubiquitous as the Nike brand of athletic shoes and its trademark swoosh 
are on the landscape, the cultural landscape does not tell us where Nike shoes are produced. University of Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman and one of his former runners, Phil Knight, founded Nike in 1961. Knight designed the wafﬂ  e sole to cre-ate more traction for runners, and Nike sold $8000 in footwear in its ﬁ  rst year. 
Nike has grown to be a giant in the shoe and apparel business with sales of over $19 billion in 2009. With headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, a suburb of Portland, the company is far more than an Oregon concern. Although several thousand    Figure 12.1

 people work for Nike in Beave  r  ton, not a single individual in Oregon is directly 
involved in the process of putting a shoe together. Worldwide, some 30,000 people work directly for Nike t  o  day, and according to Nike, upwards of 800,000 workers are employed by Nike’s almost 700 contract factories in 52 countries. Nike began production in the 1960s by contracting with an Asian ﬁ  rm to manufa  c  ture its 
shoes. In 1974, Nike set up its ﬁ  rst domestic shoe manufacturing facility in the 
small town of Exeter, New Ham  p  shire. By the end of that year, Nike’s workforce was still modest in number. The Oregon contingent concentrated on ru  n  ning the company and expanding sales, while the New Hampshire and the Asian contin-gents focused primarily on the produ  c  tion of shoes.  
  As Nike grew to become the world’s leading manufacturer of athletic shoes 
with almost a 40 percent share of the world’s athletic shoe market, its employ-ment numbers skyrocketed and many new manufacturing plants were established in Asia and beyond. This transformation did not translate into manufacturing jobs in Beave  r  ton, Or  e  gon, however. The employment opportunities now provided by Nike at its world headquarters are for the ﬁ  nancial administrators, marketing and sales specialists, information technology directors, computer techn  i  cians, law-yers, and support personnel needed to run an international company with over $19 billion in annual revenues. The local social and economic geography of Beaverton bears little resemblance to what one might have expected in a town housing an important shoe company 85 years ago.  
  Eighty-ﬁ  ve years ago, economic geographer J. Russel Smith reported that 
“three hundred shoe factories have sales ofﬁ  ces located within a few blocks of 
each other in Boston.” In a leather district close to the city, hides were imported from around the world, and tanneries prepared the hides. In a ring of suburbs around Boston, great “shoe towns” such as Haverhill, Brockton, and Lynn had fac-tories specializing in both men’s and women’s shoes. Writing in 1925, Smith described the process of shoe production in the shoe factory town of Lynn:  
  Walking the streets of Lynn one realizes what concentration an industry can have; the 
signs upon the places of business read—heels, welts, insoles, uppers, eyelets, thread, etc., etc. It is an astonishing proof of the degree to which even a simple commodity like a shoe, so long made by one man, can be subdivided and become the work of scores of industries and thousands of people.  
  Shoe salespeople periodically ﬂ  ocked to shoe company headquarters in   Boston to 
learn about the company’s newest offerings and ﬁ  lled their sample suitcases with shoes to show their clients as they made the rounds of their sales territories.  
  Today, the production and marketing of Nike shoes and apparel involves an elab-
orate global  network of intern  a  tional manufacturing and sales. The global processes have local consequences, as each node of the Nike ne  t  work is functionally specialized, dependent on other nodes, and inﬂ  uenced by the niche it occupies in the ne  t  work.  
  The contemporary geography of industry and services is a product of shifting 
forces that have shaped produ  c  tion and consumption over time. In this chapter, we begin by looking at the origins of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain and its diffusion into mainland Europe. In addition, we look at the rise of manufactur-ing belts in Europe, Asia, and North America. We then explore how industrializa-tion has changed, focu  s  ing on the emergence of global labor networks and such concepts as ﬂ  exible production and the global division of labor. We also consider how the expanding service economy is changing the nature of emplo  y  ment and the economic bases of many places.  c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 404  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 404  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 Where Did the Industrial Revolution Begin, and How Did It Diffuse? 405
  WHERE DID THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
BEGIN, AND HOW DID IT DIFFUSE?  
  The manufacturing of goods began long before the 
Industrial Revolution. Families and communities pro-
duced goods in workshops, and merchants traded manu-factured products throughout the world. For example, in the towns and villages of India, workshops produced goods made of iron, gold, silver, and brass. India’s carpenters were artists as well as art  i  sans, and their work was in 
demand wherever it could be bought. India’s textiles, made 
on individual spinning wheels and hand looms, were con-s  i  dered the best in the world. These industries were sus-
tained both by local aristocrats and by international trade. 
Within individual homes in rural villa  g  es of Great Britain, 
rural residents spun thread or wove fabric into textiles dur-
ing the winter months. The quality of production varied a  c  cording to place. India’s textiles were so ﬁ  nely produced 
that British textile makers rioted in 1721, demanding legis-
lative protection against i  m  ports from India.  
  China and Japan also possessed a substantial indus-
trial base long before the Industrial Revolution. European 
industries, from the textile makers of Flanders and Britain to the iron smelters of Thüringen, had become su  b  stantial 
operations. However, in price and quality, Europe’s prod-ucts could not match those of other parts of the world. Commercial companies, including the Dutch and British East India Companies, laid the groundwork for Europe’s colonial expansion. Europeans gained control over local indu  s  tries in India, Indonesia, and elsewhere, proﬁ  ting 
from political chaos that ensued in the wake of European intervention, and pi  t  ted local factions against one another. 
British merchants imported tons of raw ﬁ  ber for their 
expanding textile industries. With the eve  n  tual develop-
ment of technologies that allowed for mass production, the British were able to bury local industries in Asia and Africa by ﬂ  ooding the market with inexpensive products and forcing their colonies to purchase i  m  ported goods.  
  The Industrial Revolution  
  During the eighteenth century, markets for European 
goods were growing, especially in the colonies. Producers urgently needed better machines, especially for spinning and weaving. The ﬁ  rst steps in the   Industrial Revol  u  tion   
did not involve a revolutionary ene  r  gy source; improved 
spinning wheels were powered by foot pedals, and new 
water looms were driven by water running dow  n  slope.  
  The eighteenth century was marked with a series of 
inventions that brought new uses for known energy 
sources (coal) and new machines to improve efﬁ  ciencies 
(steam engines), which in turn enabled other new i  n  ven-
tions including water pumps and railroads. Funding inven-
tions and supporting inventors and inventions required money. The eighteenth century was marked by an expand-ing trade network focused on western Europe that brought wealth to those in a position to take advantage of changing circumstances (Fig. 12.2). These develo  p  ments enabled 
investors to fund inventors and to perfect inventions. For 
example, James Watt is credited with impro  v  ing the steam 
engine by creating a separate chamber to house the steam 
and by perfecting the pistons and getting them to perform correctly. The invention did not happen overnight: a series of attempts over a few de  c  ades ﬁ  nally worked when Watt 
partnered with toymaker and metal worker Ma  t  thew 
Boulton who inherited great wealth from his wife. Boulton 
ﬁ nanced the ﬁ  nal trials and errors that made Watt’s steam 
engine fun  c  tional and reli  a  ble.  
  During the Industrial Revolution, innovations in 
iron manufacturing enabled the production of the steam 
engine and a variety of other products. In Coalbrookdale, England, in 1709, iron worker Abraham Darby found a way to   smelt   iron. By burning coal in a vacuum-like envi-
ronment, the English already knew they could cook off 
impurities, leaving behind coke, the high-carbon po  r-
  tion of coal. In 1709, Darby put iron ore and coke in a 
blast furnace, and then pushed air into the furnace, a combination that allowed the furnace to burn at a much higher temperature than wood charcoal or coal allowed. Mixing the iron ore with limestone (to attract impuri-ties) and water and smelting it with coke enabled iron workers to pour melted iron ore into molds (instead of shaping it with anvils), yielding   cast iron  . The use of 
molds allowed more consistency in iron parts and 
increased production of iron components. As the top-onym indicates, the residents of Ironbridge, a town neighboring Coalbrookdale, still take pride in their   Key Questions   For Chapter 12

town’s bridge, the ﬁ  rst in the world to be co  n  structed 
entirely from cast iron in 1779 (Fig. 12.3).  
  The steam engine, with its multitude of uses, also 
had a dramatic impact on industry. It was used to pump 
water out of coal mines, enabling coal workers to reach deeper coal seams, to power spinning wheels that spun 100 plus spools of thread at a time, to power dozens of looms in a factory all at once, and to create a new mode of transportation: the railroad. In 1830, Manchester, a ce  n  ter of textile manufacturing, was connected by rail to 
the nearby port of Liverpool, a westward-facing port 
that linked Britain with the colonies. In the next several de  c  ades, thousands of miles of iron and then steel track 
were laid. Ocean shipping also entered a new age when 
the ﬁ  rst steam-powered vessel crossed the Atlantic in 1819.  
  With the advent of the railroad and steam ship, 
Great Britain enjoyed even greater advantages over the 
rest of the world than it did at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Not only did the British hold a near-monopoly over the production of many pro  d  ucts that were in demand around the world, but it alone 
 possessed the skills necessary to make the machines that 
manufactured them. Continental Europe and America wanted railroads and locomotives, and England had the know-how, the experience, and the capital to supply them. Soon, Bri  t  ish inﬂ  uence around the world was 
reaching its peak.  
  Meanwhile, the spatial pattern of modern Europe’s 
industrial development began to take shape. In the early 
part of the Industrial Revolution, before the railroad connected nodes of industry and reduced the transpor-tation costs of coal, manufactu  r  ing needed to be located 
close to coalﬁ  elds. Manufacturing plants also needed to 
be connected to ports, where raw materials could a  r  rive 
and ﬁ  nished products could depart. In the ﬁ  rst decades 
of the Industrial Revolution, plants were usually con-
nected to ports by a broad ca  n  al or river system. In 
Britain, densely populated and heavily urbanized indus-
trial regions developed near the coal ﬁ  elds (Fig. 12.4). The lar  g  est such r  e  gion was the Midlands of north-
central England.     Figure 12.2

  Diffusion to Mainland Europe  
  In the early 1800s, as the innovations of Britain’s Industrial 
Revolution diffused into mainland Europe, the same set of locational criteria for industrial zones applied: prox-imity to coal ﬁ  elds and connection via water to a port remained crucial to industrial development. A belt of major coal ﬁ  elds extends from west to east through main-land Europe, roughly along the southern margins of the North Eur  o  pean Lowland—across northern France and southern Belgium, the Netherlands, the German Rühr, western Bohemia in the Czech R  e  public, and Silesia in 
Poland. Colonial empires gave France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and, later, Germany, access to the ca  p  ital 
necessary to fuel industrialization and in some cases the raw materials necessary for production. Iron ore is dis-persed along a sim  i  lar belt, and the map showing the 
pattern of diffusion of the Industrial Revolution into 
Europe reﬂ  ects the resulting concentr  a  tions of economic 
activity (Fig. 12.5).

 Where Did the Industrial Revolution Begin, and How Did It Diffuse? 409
  Industrial developments in one area, such as the 
Rühr area of present-day Germany (Germany was not 
consolidated into a single cou  n  try until the 1870s) 
changed the port cities to which they are linked—in this case Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The Rhine River ﬂ ows through the Rühr area and enters the sea at 
Rotterdam. Over the last 200 years, the Dutch have radi-cally altered the port of Rotterdam to facilitate transpor-tation and make it the most important port in Europe and a hub of global commerce.  
  Once the railroads were well established, some 
manufacturing moved to or expanded inside of existing 
urban areas with large markets, such as London and Paris. London was a particularly attractive site for indus-try because of its port location on the Thames River and, more importantly, because of its major role in the ﬂ  ow of 
regional and global capital. By locating itself in London, an industry put itself at the center of Bri  t  ain’s global net-
work of inﬂ  uence. Paris was already continental Europe’s 
greatest city, but like London, it did not have coal or iron 
d  e  posits in its immediate vicinity. When a railroad system 
was added to the existing network of road and waterway 
connections to Paris, however, the city became the larg-est local market for manufactured products for hundreds of miles. Pa  r  is attracted major industries, and the city, 
long a center for the manufacture of luxury items (jew-
elry, perfumes, and fashions), experienced substantial growth in such industries as metallurgy and chemical manufa  c  turing. With a ready labor force, an ideal 
regional position for the distr  i  bution of ﬁ  nished prod-
ucts, the presence of governmental agencies, a nearby 
ocean port (Le Havre), and France’s largest domestic market, Paris’s deve  l  opment as a major industrial center 
was no accident.  
  London and Paris became, and remain, important 
industrial complexes not because of their coal ﬁ  elds but 
b  e  cause of their commercial and political connectivity to 
the rest of the world (Fig. 12.6).   Germany still ranks 
among the world’s leading producers of both coal and 
steel and remains Europe’s leading industrial power (T   a  ble 12.1). By the early twentieth century, industry 
began to diffuse far from the original European hearth 
to such places as northern Italy (now one of Europe’s major industrial regions), Catalonia (anchored by Barcelona) and northern Spain, southern Sw  e  den, and 
southern Finland.  
  Diffusion beyond Europe  
  Western Europe’s early industrialization gave it a huge 
economic head start and put the region at the center of a developing world economy in the nineteenth century. But, it was not long before industrialization began to   Field Note  
  “Paris and the Paris Basin form the industrial as well as agricul-tural heart of France. The city and region are served by the Seine Ri  v  er, along which lies a string of ports from Le Havre at the mouth to Rouen at the head of navigation for oceango-ing ships. Rouen has become a vital center on France’s indus-trial map. As we a  p  proached on the river, you could see the famous cathedral and the city’s historic cultural landscape to the left (north), but on the right bank lay a major industrial com-plex i  n  cluding coal-ﬁ  red power 
facilities (although France leads Europe in nuclear energy), petro-chemical plants, and oil installa-tions. It is all part of the indus-trial region ce  n  tered on Paris.”

di  f  fuse beyond Europe’s western fringe. The   primary 
industrial regions   that stand out on the world map of 
i  n  dustrial centers by the 1950s were western Europe, east-
ern North America, western Russia and Ukraine, and East 
Asia (Fig. 12.7).  
  North America  
  By the beginning of the twentieth century, the only seri-
ous rival to Europe was a territory settled predominantly by Europeans and with particularly close links to Britain, which provided links to the capital and innova-tions that fueled industrialization there: North America. Manufacturing in North America began in New England du  r  ing the colonial period, but the northeastern States 
were not especially rich in mineral resources. North Ame  r  ica, however, beneﬁ  ted from the ability of its com-
panies to acquire needed raw materials from overseas 
sources. Industries developed along the Great Lakes where canal, river, and lakes connected with ra  i  lroads on 
land to move resources and goods in and out of industrial centers. There was no need to go abroad in search of energy, ho  w  ever. Coal was the chief fuel for industries at 
the time, and there was never any threat of a coal shortage in the United States: U.S. coal reserves are among the world’s largest and are widely distributed, being found from Appalachian Pennsylvania to the northwestern Great Plains (Fig. 12.8).    Russia and Ukraine  
  The St. Petersburg region is one of Russia’s oldest manu-
facturing centers. T sar Peter the Great planned and con-structed the city not only to serve as Russia’s capital but also to become the country’s industrial core. Peter the Great encouraged western European artisans with skills and specializations to migrate to the region, and he imported high-quality machine building, optical prod-ucts, and medical equipment. The St. Petersburg region soon attracted industries including shipbuilding, chemical production, food processing, and textile making. A  f  ter 
World War I, the newly formed Soviet Union annexed Ukraine and used the rich resources and industrial poten-tial of Ukraine, especially the coal-rich Donbass region, to become an industrial power. The Soviet Union (and Russia today) was resource rich. Soviet leaders directed an economic plan to industrialize the Moscow r  e  gion. 
Communist leaders developed industries in Nizhni Novg  o  rod, southeast of Moscow, which came to be known 
as the “Soviet Detroit.”  
  East Asia  
  In less than a century after the beginning of the Industrial 
Revolution, Japan became one of the world’s leading industrial countries. With limited natural resources, man-ufacturing in Japan depended upon raw materials TABLE 12.1

i  m  ported from other parts of the world. In the late 1800s 
and early 1900s, Japan colonized Korea, T aiwan, and por-
tions of mainland China, which brought capital and resources for industry.   Japan’s dominant region of i  n  dus-
trialization and urbanization is the   Ka  n  to Plain   (Fig. 12.7), 
which contains about one-third of the nation’s population 
and includes the T okyo–Y okohama–Kawasaki metropoli-tan area.   Japan’s second largest indu  s  trial complex extends 
from the eastern end of the Seto Inland Sea to the Nagoya 
area and includes the Kobe–Kyoto–Osaka triangle, which is a vast industrial region with steel mills, a major chemical industry, automobile man  u  facturing, shipbuilding, textile 
factories, and many other types of production.  
  Examine the map of diffusion of the Industrial Revolution into Europe (Fig. 12.5) and hypothesize what other charac-teristics (aside from the presence of coal) were necessary for industrialization to take hold in these regions.  
  HOW HAVE THE CHARACTER 
AND GEOGRAPHY OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION CHANGED?  
  Economic geography provides context for under-
standing a multitude of human geographic developments. 
In this book, we have already made reference to economic geography to help explain globaliz  a  tion in Chapter 1, 
local and popular cultures in Chapter 4, identities and scale in Chapter 5, language loss and toponyms in Cha  p  ter 7, 
c  o  lonialism and political disputes in Chapter 8, and the 
geography of development in Chapter 10. In this section 
of the chapter, we incorporate economic geography principles we introduced in earlier chapters with other economic geography concepts to provide a context for understanding changes in the character and geo  g  raphy of 
manufacturing and service industries since World War II.  
  In Chapter 1, we deﬁ  ned   globalization   as a set of 
processes that are increasing interactions, deepening rela-
tio  n  ships, and heightening interdependence without 
regard to country borders. We e  x  plained that globaliza-
tion is also a set of outcomes that are felt from these global processes—outcomes that are unevenly distributed and di  f  ferently manifested across the world. Improvements in 
transportation and communication technologies are at the root of globalization. The i  m  provement of sailing 
ships and navigation methods helped establish global trade routes and the ﬁ  rst wave of colonialism (Chapter 8). 
The advent of the steam ship, the diffusion of rai  l  roads, 
and the telegraph and then telephone quickened global trade and connected empires in the second wave of colo-nialism. Through colonialism and trade, capitalism became the economic foundation of the world-economy (Chapter 8).  
  Fordist Production  
  The manufacturing boom of the twentieth century can be 
traced in part to early innovations in the production pro-cess. Perhaps the most signiﬁ  cant of these innovations was 
the mass-production assembly line pioneered by Henry Ford, which allowed for the inexpensive pr  o  duction of 
consumer goods at a single site on a previously unknown scale. So signiﬁ  cant was Ford’s idea that the dominant mode of mass production that endured from 1945 to 1970 is known as   Fordist  . In addition to of its role in facilitating 
mass production, economic geogr  a  phers also see the 
Fordist system as encompassing a set of political-economic 
structures (corporations and p  o  litical institutions sup-
porting each other) and ﬁ  nancial orders (such as the Bretton Woods arrangement, under which countries adopted the gold standard, agreeing to peg the values of their currency to the price of gold) that supported mass production by corporations.  
  The Fordist period is marked by a surge in both mass 
production and mass consumption. On the Ford assembly 
line, machines replaced people, and unskilled workers instead of craftsmen worked on the assembly lines. Ford paid his workers a good wage, and droves of job seekers migrated to the Detroit area to work in the automobile industry (see Chapter 9). Ford’s goal was to mass produce goods at a price point where his workers could afford to purchase them. Production of automobiles at Ford’s River Rouge plant in Dearborn, Michigan (Fig. 12.9) e  x  empli-
ﬁ ed the   vertical integration   of production common dur-
ing the Fordist period. Ford imported raw mat  e  rials, from 
coal to rubber to steel, from around the world and brought 
them to his plant on the River Rouge in Dea  r  born, just west 
of Detroit. The massive River Rouge Ford plant is better 
described as an industrial complex. The Henry Ford Foundation d  e  scribes Ford’s goal in building the complex 
of 93 buildings with more than 120 miles of conveyor belts that covered an area 1 by 1.5 miles as follows: “Henry Ford’s ultimate goal was to achieve total self-sufﬁ  ciency 
by owning, operating and coordinating all the resources needed to produce complete automobiles.” The River Rouge complex included a power plant, boat docks, ﬁ  re 
stations, a police department, and a rai  l  road.  
  Under Fordist production, distance was a major con-
sideration in the location of industry. For example, in the c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 411  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 411  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
412 Chapter 12   Industry and Services
United States, furniture manufacturing shifted from Boston 
in 1875 to Cincinnati by 1890 and then Grand Ra  p  ids, 
Michigan by 1910. Furniture man  u  facturing took off in 
North Carolina when northern entrepreneurs built manu-
facturing plants there in the early 1900s to take advantage of North Carolina’s “abundance of lumber, low-cost labor combined with Reconstruction era wood-working skills and attitudes, and infrastructure providing good proximity” to customers as well as a humid climate (Walcott 2011, 10). High Point and other furniture centers clustered together to take advantage of not only the location and resources but also the services and i  n  frastructure that grew to accommo-
date and aid furniture manufacturers in the region.  
  Finished furniture is a bulky commodity. Whenever 
furniture manufactures have considered locating outside 
of North Carolina and the Piedmont region or moving operations abroad, one of the key issues has been the   fri  c-
  tion of distance  : the increase in time and cost that usually 
comes with increased distance over which commod  i  ties 
must travel. If a raw material has to be shipped hundreds of 
miles to a factory, rather than being manufa  c  tured right 
next door, the friction of distance increa  s  es. A corollary to    Figure 12.7

the concept of the friction of distance is what geographers 
call distance decay (see Chapter 4), which assumes that the impact of a function or an activity will decline as one moves away from its point of origin. Distance decay suggests that manufacturing plants will be more concerned with serving the markets of nearby places than more distant places. This basic principle is important in understanding the locational dynamics of furniture manufacturing. The vast majority of North Carolina’s furniture customers were in the northeast or in the southeast. Either way, furniture could be trucked to customers in less than a day.    Agglomeration  
  British economist Alfred Marshall (1842–1924), a leader in 
economic theory who is often credited with pi  o  neering the 
ﬁ eld of industrial location theory, argued that a particular 
industry, whether automobile manufactu  r  ing or furniture 
production, clusters in an area. He called this process local-
ization. Marshall held that localized industries would attract 
workers with i  n  dustry-speciﬁ  c skills, share information, 
and attract industry-speciﬁ  c support services.

(1868–1958) developed a basic model explaining where 
industries would cluster. Weber helped develop loc  a  tional 
studies in economic geography by focusing on the loca-tion of manufacturing facilities. In   Theory of the Location of 
Industries   (1909), Weber focused on speciﬁ  c factors that 
would pull industry to particular locations.  
  Weber’s   least cost theory   focused on a factory own-
er’s desire to minimize three categories of costs. The ﬁ  rst 
and most important of these categories was   transportation  . 
Weber suggested that the site where transportation costs are lowest is the place where it is least expensive to bring 
raw materials to the point of production and to distribute ﬁ nished products to consumers. The second cost was that 
of   labor  . Higher labor costs tend to reduce the margin of 
proﬁ t, so a factory might do better if it is farther away 
from raw mat  e  rials and markets if cheap labor compen-
sates for the added transport costs.  
  The third factor in Weber’s model was similar to 
Marshall’s theory of localization. Weber described the 
adva  n  tages afforded by like industries clustering, which    Figure 12.8

he termed   agglomeration  . When a substantial number of 
e  n  terprises cluster in the same area, as happens in a large 
industrial city, Weber held that the industries can assist 
each other through shared talents, services, and facil  i  ties. 
For example, all manufacturers need ofﬁ  ce furniture and 
equipment. One or more ofﬁ  ce equipment store in a city could provide supplies for all industries in the area. As such, agglomeration can make a big-city location more attractive, potentially overcoming higher transport  a  tion 
or labor costs.  
  Flexible Production and Product Life Cycle  
  Fordist production was based on both mass production 
and mass consumption. Money ﬂ  owed through the world-
economy as consumers purchased like items often manu-factured in large-scale complexes. As the global economy became more integrated and transportation costs decreased, the advantages of concentrating produ  c  tion in 
large-scale complexes declined. As a result, in the latter third of the twentieth century many enterprises began moving toward a post-Fordist, ﬂ  exible production model. The post-Fordist model refers to a set of pr  o  duction pro-
cesses in which the components of goods are made in dif-ferent places around the globe and then brought t  o  gether as needed to meet customer demand. The term   ﬂ exible 
production systems   is used to describe this state of affairs 
because ﬁ  rms can pick and choose among a multitude of 
suppliers and production strategies in distant places, and 
then quickly shift their choices in response to adjustments in production costs or consumer demand. These systems are thus designed to respond to consumers who want the newest/best/greatest offering or a custom offering that helps distinguish them from other co  n  sumers.  
  Capitalism continues as an economic system not 
only because people consume but also because produ  c  ers 
continue to promote and respond to consumer demand. 
They do this by adapting to changing consumer pre  f  er-
ences and by commodifying goods. Through the process of   commodiﬁ  cation  , goods that were not previously 
bought, sold, and traded gain a monetary value and are 
bought, sold, and traded on the ma  r  ket. A new good, such 
as a mobile tablet, starts at a high price and becomes somewhat of a status symbol because of its high cost. The longer the mobile tablet is on the market and the greater the number of ﬁ  rms producing mobile tablets, the lower 
the price drops. Eventually, companies move the pro-duction of mobile tablets to lower the price of pr  o  duction 
and thus the price of the good, in order to compete. Changes in the production of a good over time take place as part of a   product life cycle  .     Figure 12.9

416 Chapter 12   Industry and Services
  Following the production of televisions around the 
globe gives us insight into the workings of the pro  d  uct life 
cycle, the global division of labor, and shifts in production 
that occur as goods become standard co  m  modities of trade. 
Commercial produ  c  tion of television sets began after 
World War II, with a variety of small and medium-sized 
ﬁ rms in Europe, Asia, and North America involved in pr  o-
  duction. Firms in the United States, including  Zenith, 
were the dominant producers of televisions until the 1970s. During the 1970s and 1980s a dr  a  matic shift occurred, with 
a small number of large Asian producers—particularly in 
Japan—seizing a much la  r  ger percentage of the market and 
with a few European ﬁ  rms increasing their position as well. 
By 1990, ten large ﬁ  rms were responsible for 80 percent of the world’s color television sets; eight of them were Japanese and two European. Only one ﬁ  rm in the United States, 
Zenith, remained, and its share of the global market was rel  a  tively small.  
  The television production industry has three key 
elements: research and design; manufacture of compo-
nents; and assembly. Research and design was and contin ues 
to be located in the home countries of the major telev  i  sion 
manufacturers. During the 1970s, the major ﬁ  rms began 
to move the manufacture of components and a  s  sembly 
out of the country. U.S. ﬁ  rms moved these functions to the   maquiladora   of Mexico (discussed in Cha  p  ter 10) and 
the special economic zones of China (described in 
Chapter 9); Japanese ﬁ  rms moved component manufac-
turing and assembly to T aiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and South Korea. Because the assembly stage was the most labor intensive, television manufacturers tapped into labor pools around the world, locating a  s  sembly plants 
not just in Mexico, China, and Southeast Asia, but also in India and Brazil. By the 1990s, telev  i  sion manufacturing 
methods had changed to employ greater mechanization in the production and assembly process. Starting in the 1980s, the major television producers in Japan (by then dominating the market) moved a number of their offshore production sites to Europe and the United States, regions with suitable i  n  frastructure, skilled labor, and accessible 
markets. Recently, the process began again, with research and development in high-deﬁ  nition and plasma televi-
sions leading to production of these high-end televisions in Japan—and more recently into Ch  i  na and South Korea.  
  The Global Division of Labor  
  T racing the production of televisions throughout the 
world over time helps us see how the   global division of 
labor   currently works. Under this arrangement, labor is 
concentrated in the global economic periphery and semi-
periphery to take adva  n  tage of lower labor costs, whereas 
research and development is primarily located in the core. But nothing is ﬁ  xed, and as methods of a  s  sembly and products themselves change, production may be moved to take advantage of infrastructure, skilled labor, and acces-sible markets.  
  Geographically, the concept of time–space compres-
sion is the easiest way to capture the dramatic temporal 
and spatial changes taking place in the contemporary global economy. Time–space compression is based on the idea that developments in communication and transporta-tion technologies have accelerated the speed with which things happen and made the distance between places less signiﬁ  cant (see Chapter 4). David Harvey, who coined the 
term   time–space compression  , argues that modern capitalism 
has so accelerated the pace of life and so changed the 
nature of the relationship between places that “the world seems to collapse inwards upon us.” Flu  c  tuations in the 
T okyo stock market affect New Y ork just hours later. 
Overnight, marketing ca  m  paigns can turn a product inno-
vation into a fad in far-ﬂ  ung corners of the globe. Kiwis 
picked in New Zealand yesterday can be in the lunch boxes 
of boys and girls in Canada tomorrow. And decisions made in London can make or break a fast-developing deal over a transport link between Kenya and T anz  a  nia.  
  Time–space compression has fundamentally altered 
the division of labor. When the world was less interco  n-
  nected, most goods were produced not just close to raw 
materials, but close to the point of consumption. Thus, the major industrial belt in the United States was in the Northeast both because of readily available coal and other raw materials and because the major concentration of the North American population was there. With   just-in-time 
delivery   this has changed. Rather than keeping a large 
inventory of components or products, companies keep just 
what they need for short-term production and new parts are shipped quickly when needed. In turn, corporations can draw from l  a  bor around the globe for di  f  ferent components 
of production.  
  Advances in information technologies and shipping 
coupled with the global division of labor enable compa-
nies to move production from one site to another based on calculations of the “new place-based cost advantages” in a decision process ge  o  grapher David Harvey has called a 
  spatial ﬁ  x   (Walcott 2011, 7). In choosing a production 
site, location is only one consideration. “Distance is nei-
ther determinate nor insigniﬁ  cant as a factor in produ  c-
  tion location decisions” today (Walcott 2011, 9).  
  Major global economic players, including General 
Motors, Philips, Union Carbide, and Exxon, take advan-

to grow proﬁ  ts is to cut costs, and labor (wages, beneﬁ  ts, 
insurance) makes up a sizable proportion of pr  o  duction 
costs. Most multinational corporations have moved the 
labor-intensive manufacturing, particularly a  s  sembly 
activities, to peripheral countries where labor is cheap, 
regulations are few, and tax rates are low. The manufac-turing that remains in the core is usually highly mecha-nized. T echnologically sophisticated manufactu  r  ing also 
tends to be sited in the core because both the expertise 
and the infr  a  structure are there.  
  Where to produce or assemble a good is only one 
small aspect of decisions made in a commodity chain (see 
Chapter 10) for any good produced in an economy based on ﬂ  exible production. A large part of business dec  i  sion 
making today focuses on sourcing, on where to get the component parts that are eventually assembled. Business magazines and textbooks discuss nimble sourcing deci-sions, proving that not only is production ﬂ  ex  i  ble, but the 
sourcing is too.  
  China and other lower wage countries are major 
recipients of industrial work that is   outsourced   or moved 
  of  f  shore  . Each of the steps in commodity production that 
used to take place within the conﬁ  nes of a single factory is 
now often outsourced to suppliers, which focus their pro-duction and offer cost savings. When outsourced work is located outside of the country, it is said that it takes place   offshore  . 
Research and development a  c  tivities tend to be con-
centrated in the core, where high levels of education and 
access to technology are the norm. The global division of labor has reshaped the role different economic sectors play within countries. With mechanized, highly efﬁ  cient 
agriculture (see Chapter 11) and with the move of manu-facturing jobs to the semi-periphery and periphery, core countries now have large labor forces e  m  ployed in the ter-
tiary (service) sector of the economy.  
  Supporting the global division of labor are elaborate 
trading networks and ﬁ  nancial relations. T rade itself is a 
tertiary economic activity of considerable importance to 
the global economy. Regardless of where goods are pro-duced, consumption is still concentrated in the core and, increasingly, among the wealthy and middle classes of the semi-periphery. Newly industrializing countries of the semi-periphery send manufactured goods to the core  . 
T rade ﬂ  ows among countries in the periphery are typi-cally low because, for peripheral countries, the dominant ﬂ ow of goods co  n  sists of e  x  ports to the core.  
  Made in America or Designed in America?  
  In 2011, ABC World News featured a segment called 
“Made in America,” where journalists knocked on doors and challenged homeowners to look at every item in their home for the “made in” sticker. The news crew then helped families move all goods not “Made in America” onto the street so the fa  m  ily could visualize how much of 
what is in their home is made in the America and how much is made elsewhere in the world. The ABC World News crew then, according to their website, “took on the challenge of trying to ﬁ  ll three rooms in a home entirely with 100 percent American-made pro  d  ucts.”  
  Would an iPod get to stay in the house redesigned by 
ABC World News? When you open a new iPod or other 
Apple product, a sticker greets you that says “Designed in California.” “Designed in” instead of “Made in?” The iPod would not pass the ABC “made in” test, but we should ask whether it is better for the American eco  n  omy 
for a good to be made in or designed in America. Three authors asked this exact question in the journal   Communications of the ACM   in 2009. Linden et al. asked 
who captures the va  l  ue in a $299 iPod touch.  
  Using published sources on computer machinery 
and component parts, the authors ﬁ  gured out the iPod 
supply chain and calculated the value added at each step in 
the commodity chain (Fig. 12.10). The components of an iPod are produced by companies in Japan, Korea, T aiwan, and China. The most expensive component in the iPod is the hard drive, which is produced and designed by T oshiba, a Japanese company. One component that sets the iPod apart from other MP3 players is the microchip that controls access to songs and movies on the iPod. The microchip is housed in a wheel on the iPod classic and iPod nano and is pr  o  duced by PortalPlayer, a Ca  l  ifornian 
company with ofﬁ  ces in India.

418 Chapter 12   Industry and Services
  In his piece on PortalPlayer called “The World in an 
iPod,” journalist Andrew Leonard explains that Po  r  talPlayer 
has a 24-hour development cycle because eng  i  neers in 
California and in India can work around the clock (with 
time zones 12 hours apart) to design and redesign the microchip. The actual microchips are created in T aiwan. The commodity chain for PortalPlayer (Figure 12.11) reveals how people and places around the world intercon-nect to design and create the company’s microchip.  
  Linden et al. estimate that the PortalPlayer compo-
nent is a small fraction of the cost of an iPod but that the 
r  e  search and development that goes into PortalPlayer and 
other innovative components that differentiate the iPod 
from its competitors receive more va  l  ue from the sale of one 
iPod than does Invotec, the company that actually assembles 
the iPod. Linden et al. concluded that “While the iPod is manufactured offshore and has a global ro  s  ter of suppliers, 
the greatest beneﬁ  ts from this innovation go to Apple, an 
American company, with predom  i  nantly American employ-
ees and stockholders who reap the beneﬁ  ts” (2009, 143) and 
that the second greatest beneﬁ  t goes to the two Japanese companies that produce components that help differentiate the iPod, the hard drive and the di  s  play screen.    The act of consumption is an end point of a com-
modity chain. It is also the beginning of the product’s 
afterlife. What happens when you discard or donate the item? What are the costs or beneﬁ  ts created by the funds (whether funds for a charity or proﬁ  ts for a corporation) generated by your purchase? Corporations such as A  p  ple, 
which sells the iPod, work to reduce consumer waste by recycling iPods and computers, and by offering di  s  counts 
to consumers who recycle their old iPods. Nonetheless, in many global cities in poorer parts of the world, adults and children work in garbage dumps to recover valuable cop-per wire and other components of computers and related electronic devices made by Apple and its competitors.  
  T racing the commodity chain of the iPod demon-
strates that rarely does the consumption of a particular 
product have an unambiguous positive or negative conse-quence. In addition to the fact that components are made all over the world and assembly is only one small part of the commodity chain, we should consider the environmental consequences of steps in commodity chains. Jobs created by industry in one place can cause environmental da  m  age 
in another. Consumption, or pu  r  chasing an item, is the end 
point in a commodity chain that affects places in a variety of Hsinchu, TaiwanSeoul, Korea

different ways. The importance of studying the geography 
of commodity chains is that such an unde  r  taking sheds light 
on the or  i  gins of products and helps explain why produc-
tion occurs where and how it does and how production 
affects places and peoples at each step in the chain.  
  Major Inﬂ  uences on the Contemporary 
Geography of Manufacturing  
  As the iPod example illustrates, multinational corporations 
frequently subcontracts many of the steps in the produc-tion and retailing process to outside companies or su  b  sid-
iaries, including the extraction of raw materials, manufac-
turing, marketing, and distribution. As such, industrial location is not just inﬂ  uenced by wage rates. The other key 
variables include transportation costs and options, regula-tory constraints, expertise, and access to energy.  
  Transportation  
  Relatively inexpensive transportation is one of the foun-
dations on which the ﬂ  exible production system rests. Whereas a century ago the cost of transportation accounted for half or more of the ﬁ  nal price of many goods traveling over signiﬁ  cant distances, that ﬁ  gure is now down to ﬁ  ve 
percent or less. In an era of vastly improved infrastructure, relatively cheap oil, and container ships, spatially disaggre-gated production systems are cost e  f  fective.  
  Efﬁ cient transportation systems enable manufactur-
ers to purchase raw materials from distant sources and to 
distribute ﬁ  nished products to a widely dispersed popula-
tion of consumers. Cost is not the only issue. Manufacturers also consider the availability of alternative systems in the event of emergencies (e.g., truck routes when rail service is interrupted). Since World War II, major developments in transportation have focused on improving   intermodal conne  c  tions  , places where two or 
more modes of transportation meet (including air, road, 
rail, barge, and ship), in order to ease the ﬂ  ow of goods 
and reduce the costs of transportation.  
  The current volume of resources and goods shipped 
around the globe daily could not be supported without the 
invention of the container system, whereby goods are packed in containers that are picked up by special, mecha-nized cranes from a container ship at an intermodal con-nection and placed on the back of a semitrailer truck, on a barge, or on a railroad car. This innovation lowered costs and increased ﬂ  exibility, permitting many manufacturers 
to pay less attention to transportation in their location decisions. Refrigerated containers also ease the shipment of perishable goods around the globe.  
  Jacques Charlier has studied the major changes to the 
Benelux (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) 
seaport system and the role containerization played in these changes. Charlier stressed the importance of co  n-
  tainerization to the growth of sea trade in the Benelux 
ports and explained the locational advantage of Rotte  r  dam, 
which is no more than six hours by rail or truck from 
85 percent of the population of western Europe.  
  The container system and the growth in shipping at 
Rotterdam and other Benelux ports have combined to foster 
the development of other industries in the region, helping to make the Netherlands, in Charlier’s words, a war  e  house 
for Europe. The Netherlands is now home to more than 
1800 U.S. ﬁ  rms, including call centers, distrib  u  tion centers, 
and production centers, esp  e  cially for food. Over 50 per-
cent of all goods entering the European Union pass through 
Rotterdam or Amsterdam (also in the Net  h  erlands).  
  Regulatory Circumstances  
  Regional trade organizations such as the North American 
Free T rade Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union (EU) have trade agreements that inﬂ  uence where 
imported goods (and components of goods) are pr  o  duced. 
Similarly, governments have individual agreements with each other about production and imports, and most gov-ernments (153 as of 2011) are part of the World T rade Organization (WTO), which works to negotiate rules of trade among the member states.  
  The WTO promotes freer trade by negotiating 
agreements among member states, agreements that push 
the world in the direction of free trade, typically dismiss-ing import quota systems and discouraging protection by a country of its domestically produced goods. Agreements negotiated under the WTO are typically enacted in steps in order to avoid a major shock to a state’s economy. In 2001 when Europe and the United States agreed to allow China to become a member of the WTO, they also agreed to remove the quota system that restricts the importation of Chinese goods into Europe and the United States (dis-cussed in Chapter 10). Soon after these quotas were elimi-nated, both the United States and the European Union issued “safeguard quotas” against ce  r  tain Chinese imports. 
These quotas buffered the impact of Chinese goods on domestic producers. But most of the quotas have now expired, paving the way for mass exports from China to the United States and Europe.  
  In addition to the growth of the purview of the 
WTO, the proliferation of regional trade associations in 
the last two decades is unprecedented. The list of acro-nyms for regional trade associations is almost over-whelming: EU, NAFTA, MERCOSUR, SAFTA, CARICOM, ANDEAN AFTA, COMESA, to name but a few (see Chapter 8). The World T rade Organization estimates that close to 300 regional trade organizations are in existence. R  e  gional trade organizations are similar 
to bilateral agreements on trade between two countries, 
although they i  n  volve more than two countries. Most c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 419  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 419  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
420 Chapter 12   Industry and Services
regional trade agreements encourage movement of pro-
duction within the trade region and promote trade by diminishing (or deleting) trade quotas and tariffs among member countries. A regional trade agreement sets up a special free trade agreement among parties to the associ-ation, leaving no  n  member countries to trade through the 
rules of the WTO or an existing bilateral agreement. 
Whether regional or global, trade agreements directly affect the location of pr  o  duction and even what is pro-
duced in a place.  
  Regulations at the state and local scales matter as 
well. Not infrequently, the location of industrial opera-
tions is inﬂ  uenced by a range of state and local regulations that inﬂ  uence the cost of production. These range from tax regulations to environmental and safety standards. In many cases, governments actively seek to recruit industry through incentives that include tax breaks, subsidies, and exemptions from particular bureaucratic requirements. Export processing zones such as the   maquiladoras   dis-
cussed in Chapter 10 pr  o  vide a case in point. There are 
now many hundreds of such zones around the world, and 
they are shaping the global geography of industry.  
  Energy  
  During the mid-twentieth century, the use of coal as an 
energy source in industry increasingly gave way to oil and gas. Dependence on external fuel supplies affects three of the four world industrial regions that were the principal regions of industrial development during the mid-twentieth century. Despite discoveries of oil and gas in the North Sea, Europe still depends on foreign shipments of petro-leum. The United States has two neighbors with substan-tial fossil fuel reserves (Mexico’s oil and gas may rank among the world’s largest), but its own supplies are far too limited to meet demand. Japan is almost totally dependent on oil from distant sources.  
  The role of energy supply as a factor in industrial 
location decisions has changed over time. Earlier in the 
chapter, we explained that at the start of the Industrial Revolution manufacturing plants were often established on or near coal ﬁ  elds; today major industrial complexes 
are not conﬁ  ned to areas near oil ﬁ  elds. I  n  stead, a huge 
system of pipelines and tankers delivers oil and natural 
gas to manufacturing regions throughout the world. For some time during and after the global oil supply crises of the 1970s, fears of future rises in oil costs led some indus-tries that r  e  quire large amounts of electricity to move to 
sites where energy costs were low. When the crisis waned, 
national energy-conservation goals were modiﬁ  ed, and in 
the early 2000s the United States’ reliance on foreign energy resources was even greater than it had been in the 1970s. Energy supply has become a less signiﬁ  cant factor 
in industrial loc  a  tion, but securing an energy supply is an 
increasingly important national priority.    U.S. consumption of petroleum and natural gas 
today is about 20 percent of the annual world total. By 
2007, the United States required more than 20.6 million barrels of petr  o  leum per day to keep its power plants, 
machinery, vehicles, aircraft, and ships functioning. However, U.S. production of oil in r  e  cent years has aver-
aged about 10 percent of the world total, and even includ-ing the known Alaskan potential, U.S. oil reserves are est  i-
  mated to amount to only about 4 percent of the world 
total. More so than many countries, the United States taps the oil that it has. In 2009 the country was the third largest oil producer in the world (Fig. 12. 12). Even with this level of production, the United States remains heavily depen-dent on foreign oil supplies, with all the uncertainties that involves. There is, consequently, a push for the United States to expand offshore dril  l  ing in the hope of expand-
ing its production of oil. Many oppose the idea on envi-ronmental grounds, however, pointing to the major BP oil spill that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 as an example of what can happen when offshore oil resources are exploited without careful safeguards.  
  The United States leads world demand and con-
sumption not just in oil, but in natural gas as well. As 
Figure 12.8 shows, natural gas often occurs in association with oil deposits. The use of natural gas has increased eno  r  mously since World War II. One result of the 
increased use of natural gas is the proliferation of pipe-lines shown on the map. In North America in 2006, there were over 4 million kilometers (2.5 million miles) of pipe-lines, including parts of a new pipeline designed to carry Alaskan natural gas across Canada to the U.S. market.  
  Countries with large reserves of oil and natural 
gas—Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Russia, and others—
occupy a special position in the global economic pic-ture. None of these countries except Russia is a major industrial power, but they all played a key role in the industrial boom of the twentieth century. And while oil has brought wealth to some in Southwest Asia, it has also ensured that outside powers such as the United States and Great Britain are involved and invested in what happens in the region. This set of circumstances has produced an u  n  easy relationship (at best) between 
countries in the oil producing region and the major 
industrial powers of the “West.”  
  New Centers of Industrial Activity  
  As a result of advances in ﬂ  exible production, over the last 
30 years many older manufacturing regions have exper  i-
  enced   deindustrialization  , a process by which companies 
move industrial jobs to other regions, leaving the newly 
deindustrialized region to work through a period of high unemployment and, if poss  i  ble, switch to a service econ-
omy (see the last major section of this chapter). At the same c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 420  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 420  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Have the Character and Geography of Industrial Production Changed? 421
time, the places with lower labor costs and the right mix of 
laws attractive to businesses (often weak enviro  n  mental 
laws and pro-free trade laws) have become newly industrial 
regions. The new industrial regions emerge as shifts in politics, laws, capital ﬂ  ow, and labor availability o  c  cur.  
  East Asia has become a particularly important new 
region of industrialization. Some of the economic policies 
we discussed in Chapter 10, such as structural adjustments and import quotas, help encourage foreign direct i  n  vest-
ment, and many draw industrial developers seeking to take advantage of economic breaks and inexpensive labor. From T aiwan to Guangdong and from South Korea to Sing  a  pore, the islands, countries, provinces, and cities 
fronting the Paciﬁ  c Ocean are caught up in a frenzy of 
industrialization that has made the geographic term   Paciﬁ c 
Rim   synonymous with ma  n  ufacturing.  
  The Rise of East Asia  
  Throughout the better part of the twentieth century, 
Japan was the only global economic power in East Asia, and its regional dominance seemed beyond doubt. Other nodes of manufacturing existed, but these were no threat, and certainly no match, for Japan’s industrial might. The picture began to change with the rise of the so-called Four Tigers of East and Southeast Asia: South Korea, T aiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore in the 1960s and 1970s. Beneﬁ  ting from the shift of labor-intensive industries to 
areas with lower labor costs, government efforts to pro-tect developing industry, and government investment in education and training, the tigers emerged as the ﬁ  rst 
  newly industrializing countries (NICs)  . South Korea 
developed signiﬁ  cant manufacturing di  s  tricts exporting 
products ranging from automobiles and grand pianos to 
calculators and computers. One of these districts is cen-tered on the capital, Seoul (with 10 million inhabitants), and the two others lie at the southern end of the penin-sula, anchored by Pusan and Kwangju, respectively. T aiwan’s economic planners promoted high-technology industries, including personal computers, telecommuni-cations equipment, precision electronic i  n  struments, and 
other high-tech products. More recently the South Koreans have moved in a similar dire  c  tion.  
  Just a trading colony ﬁ  ve decades ago, Hong Kong 
exploded onto the world economic scene during the 1950s 
with textiles and light manufactures. The success of these industries, based on plentiful, cheap labor, was fo  l  lowed 
by growing production of electrical equipment, appli-ances, and other household products. Hong Kong’s situa-tional advantages contributed enormously to its ec  o  nomic 
fortunes. The colony became mainland China’s gateway to the world, a bustling port, ﬁ  nancial center, and   break-
of-bulk point, where goods are transferred from one 
mode of transport to another.   In 1997 China took over the 
government of Hong Kong from the British, and a show-place of capitalism came under Chinese communist con-
trol. But the Chinese can ill afford to undercut Hong Kong’s economic dynamism. Hence, Hong Kong has the status of a Special Administrative District in China, which gives it a high degree of autonomy from the mainland.  
  The industrial growth of Singapore also was inﬂ  u-
enced by its geographical setting and the changing global 
ec  o  nomic division of labor. Strategically located at the 
tip of the Malay Peninsula, Singapore is a small island 
i  n  habited by a little over 4 million people, mos  t  ly ethnic 
Chinese but with Malay and Indian minorities. Fifty years 
ago, Singapore was mainly an entrepôt (transshipment point) for such products as rubber, timber, and oil; today, the bulk of its foreign revenues come from exports of manufactured goods and, incre  a  singly, high-technology 
products. Singapore is also a center for quaternary indus-tries, selling services and expertise to a global market.  
  Rapid economic growth entails risks, and in 1997 
risky lending practices and government investment deci-
sions caused Thailand’s currency to collapse, followed by its stock market; banks closed and bankruptcies abounded. Soon Malaysia and Indonesia were affected, and by early 1998 one of the Four Tigers, South Korea, required a massive infusion of dollars (provided by the International Monetary Fund, a Washington-based 
bank) to prevent economic chaos. But the reforms that allowed the region to overcome these economic troubles served to strengthen East and Southeast Asia’s econo-mies, and the Four Tigers continue to exert a powerful regio  n  al—and international—economic role.  
  The Chinese Juggernaut  
  Although some industrial growth occurred in China dur-
ing the period of European colonial inﬂ  uence, and later 
during the Japanese occupation, China’s major industrial expansion occurred during the communist period. When communist planners took over in 1949, one of their lead-ing priorities was to develop China’s r  e  sources and indus-
tries as rapidly as possible.  
  China is a vast country and has a substantial resource 
base. The quality of its coal is good, the quantity eno  r-
  mous, and many of the deposits are near the surface and 
easily extracted. China’s iron ores are not as productive and are generally of rather low grade, but new ﬁ  nds are 
regularly being made.  
  Until the early 1960s, Soviet planners helped pro-
mote China’s industrial development. China was spatially 
co  n  strained by the location of raw materials, the develop-
ment that had taken place before the 1949 communist tak  e  over, the pattern of long-term urbanization in the 
country, the existing transport network, and the location of the population, which was clustered mostly in the east of the country. Like their Soviet allies, China’s rulers were determined to speed up the industrialization of the c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 421  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 421  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

economy, and their dec  i  sions created several major and 
lesser industrial districts.  
  Under state planning rules, the   Northeast district   
(formerly known as Manchuria and now called Dongbei) 
b  e  came China’s industrial heartland, a complex of heavy 
industries based on the region’s coal and iron deposits located in the basin of the Liao River. Shenyang became the “Chinese Pittsburgh,” with metallurgical, machine-making, engineering, and other large industries. Anshan, to the south, emerged as China’s leading iron- and steel-producing center. Harbin to the north (China’s northern-most large city, with more than 5.4 million inhab  i  tants) 
produced textiles, farm equi  p  ment, and light manufac-
tures of many kinds (Fig. 12.13).  
  The second largest industrial region in China, the 
  Shanghai and the Chang Jiang district  , developed in and 
around the country’s biggest city, Shanghai. The Chang 
Jiang district, containing both Shanghai and Wuhan, rose to prominence and, by some measures, exceeded the Northeast as a contributor to the national economy. Another industrial complex that developed farther u  p  stream, along the Chang Jiang River, focused on the    Figure 12.12

city of Chongqing. The Chang Jiang district has become a 
pacesetter for Chinese industrial growth, if not in terms of iron and steel production, at least in terms of its diversi-ﬁ ed production and local specializ  a  tions. Railroad cars, 
ships, books, foods, chemicals—an endless variety of pro  d  ucts—come from the Chang Jiang district.  
  China’s large labor force has attracted hundreds of 
international companies. In addition to the enormous 
labor force, wages are comparatively low, one factor in why ﬁ rms have relocated their manufacturing to China. Rather 
than move entire companies, however, the production and sourcing of goods is typically outsourced to China, largely in order to lower the cost of pr  o  duction. China’s special 
economic zones have transformed cities and towns in the 
region by attracting corporations seeking a favorable busi-ness cl  i  mate.

Xiamen, and Shenzhen, pollution-belching smokestacks

  “Beijing, Shanghai, and other Chinese cities are being trans-
formed as the old is swept away in favor of the new. Locals, powerless to stop the process, complain that their neigh-borhoods are being destroyed and that their rel  o  cation to remote apartment complexes is a hardship. Urban planners argue that the ‘historic’ neighborhoods are often dilapi-dated, deca  y  ing, and beyond renovation. The housing shown in Figure 12.13 (top) was demolished to make room for what is going up in Figure 12.13 (bottom), a scene repeated count-less times throughout urba  n  izing China.”

tile roofs on the outskirts of the expan  d  ing city must make 
way for often faceless tenements (Fig. 12.13). Decaying 
remnants of the old city stand amid the glass-encased tow-ers that symbolize the new economic order. Modern sky-scrapers now dominate the skyline of the cities at the top of the Chinese urban-economic and administrative hierar-chy—including Beijing, Shanghai, and cities in SEZs. 
China’s major cities now play host to gleaming new air-ports, daring architecture, spectacular public projects, and the terminuses of efﬁ  cient high speed rai  l  roads.  
  At the same time, the Northeast has become China’s 
“Rust Belt.” Many of its state-run factories have been sold 
or closed, or are operating below capacity. Unemployment is high, and economic growth has stalled. Event  u  ally, the 
Northeast is likely to recover because of its resources and its favorable geographic site, but under the state’s new economic policies, the dynamic eastern and southern provinces have grown into major manufactu  r  ing belts and 
have changed the map of this part of the Paciﬁ  c Rim.  
  T oday, the Chinese government is pushing industri-
alization into the interior of the country, with new inves  t-
  ment ﬂ  owing into poorer parts of the central and western 
portions of the country. China is also looking to take advantage of its proximity to South and Southeast Asia through efforts to deepen transnational economic coo  p-
  eration. From a global perspective, what is particularly 
striking is the magnitude and inﬂ  uence of the Chinese 
economic juggernaut. On August 15, 2010, China ofﬁ  -
cially surpassed Japan as the world’s second largest eco  n-
  omy. China has become the world’s largest exporter, and 
its energy and raw materials demands are now affec  t  ing 
the global supply of key resources. T oday more passenger vehicles are purchased in China each year than in the United States, and Ch  i  na invests more domestically than 
any other country in the world.  
  None of the foregoing means that China will inevi-
tably become the dominant power of the twenty-ﬁ  rst cen-
tury. China’s economy still depends heavily on exports and 
foreign investment, and China’s GDP per capita, while on the rise, is 10 times smaller than J  a  pan’s and 12.5 times 
smaller than that of the United States. Moreover, there are potentially destabilizing social and environmental costs to China’s rapid rise, and with labor costs growing in China relative to Southeast Asia, China could be vulnera-ble to some of the very forces that gave it an adva  n  tage 
over other places not long ago.  
  The Wider World  
  Other newly industrializing countries have become 
increasingly signiﬁ  cant global nodes of production. Over 
the past decade manufacturing has surged in South and Southeast Asia, in South Africa, and in parts of Central and South America. Br  a  zil, Russia, India, China, and 
South Africa are increasingly grouped under the acronym c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 424  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 424  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

BRICS (each letter standing for one of these countries) 
because these are the countries that are evidence of a shift in global economic power away from the traditional ec  o-
  nomic core. As we have seen, China is currently leading 
the way, but India has recently become the world’s sixth largest economy. A  l  though industrial production in India 
is modest in the context of the country’s huge size and enormous popul  a  tion, major industrial complexes have 
developed around Calcutta (the Eastern district, with engineering, chem  i  cal, cotton, and jute industries, plus 
iron and steel based on the Chota Nagpur reserves), Mumbai (the Western district, where cheap electricity helps the cotton and chemical industries), and Chennai (the Southern district, with an emphasis on light engi-neering and te  x  tiles) (Fig. 12.15).  
  India has no major oil reserves, so it must spend 
heavily on oil energy. On the other hand, the country has 
a great deal of hydroelectric potential and access to ample coal. Its Bihar and Karnataka iron ore reserves may be   Field Note  
  “Humen is one of the Pearl River Delta cit-ies that has been transformed by the rise of China. The small textile factory I visited pr  o  vided insights into the opportunities and challenges that are confronting China today. The 40 or so employees were mostly young, but there were a few older folks. They were making women’s clothes for the French ma  r-  ket. Most of them made the clothes from start to ﬁ  nish, although there were a few unskilled laborers who were ironing the fab-ric, cutting off loose ends of thread, and so on. Into each of the items of clot  h  ing was sewn a label with a fancy-sounding Italian name. The clothes are sold in Humen for the equivalent of $1.50–$2.50 each, but most of them were destined for France, where they would be sold for 20 times that amount. The employees work under a contract that stipu-lates a 9 hour day and a base wage of about $275/month plus basic room and board. They can work more hours, however, and are compensated based on how much they produce during the extra hours. Apparently, almost all employees choose to work extra hours—typically seven days a week, with breaks only on Sunday evenings and one day at the beginning of each month. If they work that hard, they can earn the equivalent of close to $500/month. The main workroom had decent lighting and ventilation (it was hot, of course). The manager told me there had been signiﬁ  cant upward pressure on the wages of employees in the last few years, making it harder for him to earn much of a proﬁ  t. He worried about factories relocating to lower-wage countries. In addition, he said that he was having an increasingly difﬁ  cult time recruiting employees. He also noted with some mixture of amus  e  ment and annoyance that the people who had made out the best in his part of the city were the former farmers, who either had received substantial co  m  pensation (in the form of apartments) for being displaced or who were getting some share of rent for buildings co  n  structed on the land they used to farm.”

  Where from Here?  
  The diffusion of manufacturing activity to the semi-
periphery and periphery and the associated sensation of a shrin  k  ing world have led a few commentators to suggest 
that we are entering an era characterized by the “end of geo  g  raphy.” Alvin T ofﬂ  er ﬁ rst suggested this idea in his 
  Future Shock   (1970). More recently, Richard O’Brien 
a  d  vanced a similar idea in   Global Financial Integr  a  tion: The 
End of Geography   (1992) and Thomas Friedman suggested 
  The World Is Flat   (2005). Each author argues that a combi-
nation of technological changes and deve  l  opments in the 
global economy have reduced the signiﬁ  cance of location 
and made place differences increa  s  ingly insigniﬁ  cant. c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 425  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 425  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  HOW HAVE DEINDUSTRIALIZATION AND 
THE RISE OF SERVICE INDUSTRIES ALTERED GLOBAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY?  
  Service industries (tertiary industries) do not gener-
ate an actual, tangible product; instead, they encompass 
the range of services that are found in modern societies. So many different types of activities can be thought of as “service activities” that, as we saw in Cha  p  ter 11, special-
ized aspects of the service economy were given their own designations:   quaternary industries   for the collection, pro-
ces  s  ing, and manipulation of information and capital 
(ﬁ nance, administration, insurance, legal services, com-
puter services) and   quinary industries   for activ  i  ties that 
facilitate complex decision making and the advancement 
of human capacities (scientiﬁ  c research, higher education, 
high-level management).  
  Distinguishing among types of services is useful, 
given the extraordinary growth in the size and complexity 
of the service sector. In the global economic core, service industries employ more workers than the primary and secondary industries combined, yet these service indus-tries range from small-scale retailing to tourism services to research on the causes of cancer. Placing all of these activities in a single category seems unwarranted.  
  Speciﬁ  city in terminology is also useful in high-
lighting different phases in the development of the ser-
vice sector. In the early decades of the twentieth  century, 
the domestic and quasi-domestic tertiary industries were experiencing rapid growth in the industrialized world. With the approach of World War II, the quater-nary sector began expanding rapidly, and this expansion continued after the war. During the last three decades, both the quaternary and quinary sectors have experi-enced very rapid growth, giving greater meaning to the term   postindustrial  .  
  The expanding service sector in the core economies 
is only one aspect of the changing global economy. 
A  c  companying, and in some cases driving, this expansion 
are several other developments that have already been mentioned: the increasing mechanization of production, particularly in manufacturing enterprises operating in the core; the growth of large multinational corporations; and the dispersal of the production process.  Geographers who study industrial production recognize that the nature and meaning of loc  a  tion and place have 
changed greatly in recent times, but they also note that 
these changes do not create a ge  o  graphically undifferenti-
ated world. Hence, what is needed is a greater understand-
ing of how places have changed as a result of new produc-tion methods, new co  r  porate structures, and new patterns 
of industry, as well as an examination of how the interplay 
between global processes and local places is creating oppo  r-
  tunities and constraints for different parts of the planet.  
   Think about a cutting-edge, high-technology product that 
is still quite expensive to purchase and not yet broadly used (perhaps something you have read about but not even c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 426  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 426  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Have Deindustrialization and the Rise of Service Industries Altered Global Economic Activity? 427
  Geographical Dimensions of the 
Service Economy  
  Deindustrialization and the growth of the service economy 
unfolded in the context of a world-economy that was already characterized by wide socioeconomic disparities. Only areas that had industry could deindustrialize, of course, and at the global scale the wealthier industrial regions were the most successful in establishing a posti  n-
  dustrial service economy. Deindustrialization did little to 
change the basic di  s  parities between core and periphery 
that have long characterized the global economy. Even in 
the man  u  facturing realm, the availability of capital, mech-
anization, and innovative production strategies allowed 
the core industrial regions to retain their dominance. In the ﬁ  rst decade of the twenty-ﬁ  rst century, eastern Asia, 
western Russia and Ukraine, western E  u  rope, and North 
America still account for well over 75 percent of the world’s 
total output of manufactured goods.  
  Despite its continued dominance in the manufactur-
ing arena, the core has experienced some wrenching 
changes associated with the economic shifts of the past four decades. Anyone who has ever spent time in northern Ind  i  ana, the British Midlands, or Sil  e  sia (southern Poland 
and northeastern Czech Republic) knows that there are 
pockets of signiﬁ  cant hardship in relatively prosperous 
countries (Fig. 12.16). These are the result of large-scale deindustrialization. In the United Kingdom, the major industrial zones of Newcastle, Liverpool, and Manche  s  ter 
lost much of their industrial bases during the 1960s and 
1970s. Similarly, the industrial zone of the northeastern 
United States (around the Great Lakes) lost much of its industrial base in the same time period, with steel manufac-turing jobs moving to areas of the world with lower wages. This region of the United States, which used to be called the Manufacturing Belt, is now commonly called the Rust 
Belt, evoking the image of long-abandoned, rusted-out steel factories (Fig. 12.17). More recently, the global eco-nomic downturn that began in 2008 has resulted in devas-tating job losses in communities dependent on both se  c-
  ondary and tertiary industries. These examples serve to 
remind us that not all deindustrialized regions ﬁ  nd their 
niche easily in the new service eco  n  omy and that a tertiary 
economy, once established, does not necessarily buffer 
places from recessionary trends.  
  Nonetheless, some secondary industrial regions 
have made the transition to a viable service economy 
fairly su  c  cessfully. The   Sun Belt   is the southern region 
of the United States, stretching through the Southeast 
to the Southwest. Both the population and economy of this region have grown over the last few decades, as ser-vice sector businesses have chosen to locate in areas such as Atlanta and Dallas where the climate is warm and the local laws welcome their presence. The eastern part of the Sun Belt served as an early indu  s  trial region, 
with Birmingham developing an iron and steel econ-
omy and Atlanta an industrial economy around cotton, tobacco, and furniture. In recent decades, high-tech and ﬁ  nancial indu  s  tries changed the economy and land-
scape of the Sun Belt, as can be seen in the toponyms of 
stadiums in the region, such as Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Flo  r  ida; Bank of America Stadium in 
Cha  r  lotte, North Carolina; and American Airlines 
Center in Dallas, T exs.     Figure 12.16   
  Liverpool, England, United Kingdom.     With the 
deindustrialization of the Liverpool region, the city 
has lost thousands of jobs and the city’s population has decreased by one-third. Abandoned streets, such as this one, are a re  ﬂ    ection of the city’s industrial 
decline.

428 Chapter 12   Industry and Services
  New Patterns of Economic Activity  
  With the striking growth of the service sector and infor-
mation technologies, new factors have come into play that are affecting patterns of economic activity. Most ser-vice industries are not tied to raw materials and do not need large amounts of energy. Hence, those factors of production are markedly less important for service indu  s-
  tries than for traditional manufacturing concerns. Market 
accessibi  l  ity is more relevant for the service sector, but 
advances in telecommunications have rendered even that 
factor less important for some types of service i  n  dustries.  
  T o understand the inﬂ  uences that shape the location of 
services, it is useful to go back to our distinction among 
 tertiary, quaternary, and quinary industries. T ertiary services 
related to transportation and communication are closely tied to population patterns and to the location of primary and secondary industries. As the basic facil  i  tators of interac-
tion, they are strongly linked to the basic geography of 
 production and consumption. Other te  r  tiary services—
restaurants, hotels, and retail establishments—are inﬂ  u-enced mainly by market considerations. If they are located 
far from their consumers, they are unlikely to succeed.  
  Employing technologies such as Geographic 
Information Systems (GIS) (see Chapter 1), geographers 
can model the best locations for new businesses, ofﬁ  ce 
complexes, government centers, or transportation conne  c-
  tions. Major retailers not only shape the lan  d  scapes of the 
places where they choose to put stores, but they also change 
the economic prospects and physical landscapes of the places where their headquarters are located. Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, provides a particu-larly striking example. If producers of co  n  sumer products 
want to sell their goods in Wal-Mart stores, they must 
travel to Bentonville, Arkansas, to neg  o  tiate deals with 
Wal-Mart. In order to provide low prices to consumers, 
Wal-Mart negotiates very low prices with major producers. T o create lower-priced products, companies have moved production abroad, and to create good relationships with the world’s number one retailer (with sales of $405 billion in ﬁ  scal year 2010), a variety of companies have moved into 40°

high-level services aimed at the collection, processing, 
and manipulation of information and capital—are more diverse. Some of these services are strongly tied ge  o-
  graphically to a particular locus of economic activity. 
Retail banking and various types of administrative se  r-
  vices require a high level of interpersonal contact and 
therefore tend to be located near the businesses they are serving. Other types of quaternary services can operate almost anywhere as long as they have access to digital processing equipment and telecommunications. When you send in your credit card bill, it is unlikely to go to the city where the headquarters of the issuing bank is located. Instead, it is likely to go to North Dakota, South Dakota, N  e  braska, or Colorado. Similarly, many “back-ofﬁ  ce” tasks related to insurance are performed in places such as 
Des Moines, Iowa, not Chicago or Hartford. Many of the call centers for technical help for computers and related industries (software, hardware) are l  o  cated in India and 
the Philippines. With relatively high levels of college 
education, vast numbers of English speakers, and phones routed through the Internet, “help desks” need not be located down the hall or even down the street. These locational curiosities occur b  e  cause technological 
advances in the telecommunications sector have made it 
possible for all sorts of quaternary industries to be located far away from either producers or consumers. What mat-ters most is infrastructure, a workforce that is sufﬁ  ciently 
skilled but not too expensive, and favorable tax rates.  
  Those who work in the quinary sector tend to be 
concentrated around governmental seats, universities, 
and corp  o  rate headquarters. Corporate headquarters 
tend to be located in large metropolitan areas, whereas 
seats of gover  n  ment and universities can be found in   Guest Field Note

  For most geographers, the simple act of 
daily observation of the world around them becomes a profoundly sati  s  fying habit. For the last 17 years, my daily observations have been of the rapidly changing urban/ eco-nomic landscape of northwest Arkansas, one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States. Wal-Mart originated in Bentonville, Arkansas, and as it became increasingly successful, it remained commit-ted to its home in this affordable, rural cor-ner of the mid-South. By the early 1990s the company’s growth had fueled the growth of other service industries and had contributed to the retention of several other major cor-porations. A recent decision to require Wal-Mart suppliers to locate ofﬁ  ces in the region 
has similarly boosted growth in the area. Procter & Gamble put its ofﬁ  ce in Fayetteville only 25 miles from Wal-Mart’s 
home in Bentonville. Do  z  ens of other major corporations have a presence in the r  e  gion as well. The results have been bo th 
positive and negative. Property prices have risen, with rising tax revenues and better public service provision, and the  corp  o  rations have proven to be generous philanthropists. However, sprawl, congestion, overc rowded schools, and s  e  rious 
waste disposal issues have also followed. This once-rural corner of America has become a metropolitan growth pole,  complete with national coffee shops, rush hour congestion, and sprawling golf-course subdivisions of 6000- square-foot “Eur  o  pean” mansions.

places that were chosen long ago as appropriate sites 
for administrative or educational activities based on cultural values or political compr  o  mises. The American ideal of the 
 “university town” (which originated in Germany) led to 
the establishment of many universities at a di  s  tance 
from major commercial and population centers, in such 
towns as Champaign-Urbana, Illinois; Norman, Oklahoma; and Eugene, Oregon. Political compro-mises led to the establishment of major seats of govern-ment in small towns. O  t  tawa, Canada, and Canberra, 
Australia, are examples of this phenomenon. The point 
is that historical location d  e  cisions inﬂ  uence the geog-
raphy of the quinary sector. And it is not just university 
professors and government ofﬁ      cials who are affected. 
All sorts of high-level research and development activi-
ties are located on the fringes of universities, and a host of specialized consultants are concentrated around governmental centers. These then b  e  come major nodes 
of quinary activity.  
  High-Technology Clusters  
  A high-technology corridor is an area designated by local 
or state government to beneﬁ  t from lower taxes and high-technology infrastructure, with the goal of providing high-technology jobs to the local population. The goal of a high-technology corridor is to attract designers of com-puters, semiconductors, telecommunications, sophisti-cated medical equipment, and the like.  
  California’s Silicon Valley is a well-known example 
of a high-technology corridor. Several decades ago a 
nu  m  ber of innovative technology companies located 
their research and development activities in the area 
around the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University near San Francisco, California. They were attracted by the prospect of developing links with existing research communities and the availability of a highly educated workforce. Once some high-technology businesses located in the Silicon Valley,  others were drawn to the area as well. The area became 
what geographers call a   growth pole  , not just because 
other high-technolgy bus  i  nesses came to Silicon Valley, 
but because the concentration of these businesses 
spurred economic development in the surrounding area  .   T oday, the Silicon Valley is home to dozens of 
computer companies, many of which are familiar to the 
computer literate (such as Cisco Systems, Adobe, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, IBM, and Ne  t  scape). The 
resulting collection of high-technology industries pro-
duced what Manuel Castells, Peter Hall, and John Hutriyk call a   technopole  , an area planned for high 
technology where agglom  e  ration built on a synergy 
among technological companies occurs. A similar sort of technopole developed outside Boston, where the 
co  n  centration of technology-based businesses close to 
Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of 
T ec  h  nology gave rise to what is called the Route 128 
high-technology corridor. The Route 128 corridor has 
been largely supported by the federal government rather than the local government, which supports many other tec  h  nopoles.  
  T echnopoles can be found in a number of countries 
in western Europe, eastern Asia, North America, and 
Au  s  tralia. Few are on the scale of Silicon Valley, but they 
are noticeable elements of the economic landscape. 
Many of them have sprung up on the edges of good-sized cities, particularly near airports. In Brussels (Belgium), for example, the route into the city from the airport passes an array of buildings occupied by com-puter, commun  i  cation, and electronics ﬁ  rms. In 
Washington, D.C., the route from Dulles International 
Airport (located in the Virginia suburbs) to the city passes buildings housing the headquarters of companies such as AOL, MCI, and Orbital Sciences (the Dulles Corridor). In the T elecom Corridor of Plano-Richardson (just outside of Dallas, T exas), telecom com-panies such as Nortel and Ericsson have taken root, but so too have numerous high-technology companies that are not telecom related (Fig. 12.19). In each of these technopoloes, the presence of major multinational com-panies attracts other startup companies ho  p  ing to 
become major companies, provide services to major 
companies, or be bought by major companies.  
  Many of the technology ﬁ  rms are multinationals, 
and like their counterparts in other countries, they func-
tion in an information environment and market their products all over the world. Being near raw materials or even a particular market is unimportant for these ﬁ  rms; 
what matters to them is proximity to major networks of tran  s  portation and communication. High-technology 
industries have become such an important symbol of the 
pos  t  industrial world that local, regional, and national 
governments often pursue aggressive policies to attract 
ﬁ rms in this sector. Bidding wars sometimes develop 
between localities seeking to attract such industries. Although high-technology industries often bring a vari-ety of economic beneﬁ  ts, they have some drawbacks as well. Communities that have attracted production facili-ties ﬁ  nd that the manufacture of computer chips, sem  i-
  conductors, and the like requires toxic chemicals and 
large quantities of water. And even more research-ori-ented establishments sometimes have negative environ-mental impacts in that land must be cleared and buil  d-
  ings constructed to house them. Despite these 
drawbacks, the high-technology sector is clearly here to stay, and areas that can tap into it are likely to ﬁ  nd them-
selves in an advantageous economic position in the com-ing years.  c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 430  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 430  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Have Deindustrialization and the Rise of Service Industries Altered Global Economic Activity? 431
  Tourism Services  
  Every service industry has its own locational characteris-
tics, but tourism is almost in a class by itself due to its geographical extent and economic signiﬁ  cance. Once a rela-tively small activity conﬁ  ned to a set of specialized locations, tourism is now the world’s largest service sector industry.  
  T ourism grew dramatically during the second half of 
the twentieth century. The tourism boom began in the 
global economic core as incomes and leisure time increased for a rapidly expanding segment of the population. Over the past three decades, the number of East and Southeast Asian tourists has risen much faster than the global average, reﬂ ecting the economic boom in many of the Paciﬁ  c Rim 
cou  n  tries. The combination of a weakening global econ-
omy and concerns over political stability caused noticeable 
dips in travel at the begi  n  ning and end of the ﬁ  rst decade of 
the twenty-ﬁ  rst century, but absent a major economic or 
geopolitical crisis, tourism is likely to continue to expand.  
  In Chapter 10 we looked at some of the social and 
cultural impacts of tourism, but it is important to recog-
nize that tourism is a major industry as well. Communities all over the world have worked hard to promote tourism, and many are now notably reliant on tourist receipts. The tourist industry has transformed downtowns, ports, hin-terlands, parks, and waterfronts. High-rise, ultramodern hotels dominate urban skylines from Boston to Bri  s  bane. 
The Port of Miami and Fort Lauderdale’s Port Everglades 
have been reconstructed to serve the cruise i  n  dustry, and 
many ports from T okyo to T ampa have added cruise termi-
nals complete with shopping malls and re  s  taurants. Theme 
parks such as Disney’s establishments near Orlando, Paris, 
T okyo, and Los Angeles draw millions of visitors and d  i  rectly and indirectly employ thousands of workers. 
Dubai has constructed an indoor ski run in the Mall of the 
Emirates in an effort to attract more visitors. Once-remote wildlife parks and nature reserves in East Africa and South Asia now receive thousands of visitors, requiring expanded facil  i  ties and sometimes causing ecological damage. 
Formerly isolated beaches are now lined by high-rise 
hotels and resorts; in the Caribbean and the Paciﬁ  c, some 
entire islands have been taken over by tour oper  a  tors.  
  The economic impacts of tourist-related development 
are far-reaching. The monetary value of goods and se  r  vices 
associated with tourism is now conservatively estimated at 
more than $2 trillion—and if spillover effects are taken into consideration, the ﬁ  gure could be twice as large. With the growing middle class in China and India and with increases in average life expectancy, the ﬁ  gure is likely to continue to grow, affecting the prospects of places all over the world.  
  Place Vulnerabilities in a Service Economy  
  Every type of economy carries with it potential vulnera-
bilities. In the early stages of industr  i  alization the eco-
n  o  mic destinies of places was tied to the manufacturing 
operations established in those places. As a result, such places were vulnerable to wrenching adjustments when demand shifted for the goods produced by local manufac-turers or when the changing costs of transportation or labor lead business owners to downscale or shift produc-tion elsewhere. Many older industrial areas in the United States and Europe exper  i  enced such adjustments, and 
their best hope for rebuilding often lay in the service economy. Thus, in Dui  s  burg—a city at the heart of

Germany’s Ruhr Valley—abandoned steel mills were 
turned into tourist attractions and warehouses were con-verted into retail establishments, restaurants, and o  f  ﬁ ces 
(Fig. 12.20).  
  Service economies have their own vulnerabilities. 
T ourism can fall off in the face of economic downturns or 
natural hazards, and ofﬁ  ce work can be outsourced to dis-tant places. Mechanization can also have a negative impact. We usually think of manufacturing jobs b  e  ing affected by 
mechanization, but service jobs are vulnerable as well. In 
recent decades countless jobs in the travel planning industry have been lost to the Internet, scanning machines in s  u  per-
markets have reduced the need for employees, and auto-
mated answering services have taken the place of live voices in many businesses. Changes of this sort can create the same sorts of hardships and pressures for ec  o  nomic rea  d  justment 
that communities reliant on secondary industries face.  
  At a different spatial scale, the very geographical struc-
ture of large-scale service economies can affect the fo  r  tunes 
of places, regions, countries, and even the globe. Places 
dominated by the service sector cannot exist without exten-sive connections with other places because those living in such places still need food and material products, and they often need a large market to sustain their services. Hence, the dramatic shift away from the primary and secondary sec-tors that has taken place in some parts of the world is ine  x  tri-
cably tied to economic globalization. But economic decision 
making in a globalized economy can easily become discon-nected from the fate of individual places and regions.  
  The burgeoning ﬁ  nancial service industry provides a 
case in point. That industry has grown explosively over the past few decades with the development of increasingly inno-
vative products and arrangements. Some people made spec-tacular amounts of money in the process, but in recent decades key ﬁ  nancial instruments and proc  e  dures were 
developed based on unrealistic assumptions about concrete 
circumstances. Banks made loans they should not have made, and mortgages were issued to people who were unlikely to be able to meet their pa  y  ments. These practices 
helped to bring about the dramatic economic downturn that 
began in 2008, when a hou  s  ing slump precipitated high lev-
els of defaults on so-called subprime mortgages. A banking 
crisis ensued that rippled throughout the eco  n  omy and, in 
our interconnected world, affected the fortunes and pros-
pects of places near and far. The crisis serves as a reminder of the continuing vulnerabilities of places in a service economy, even in the absence of any direct challenge to the speciﬁ  c 
service industries on which particular local econ  o  mies are 
based. It also raises a key question with a geographical foun-
dation: what are the consequences of d  i  vorcing the develop-
ment of wealth in a knowledge economy from the fate of 
individual places, regions, or cou  n  tries?  
  How does a place change when deindustrialization occurs? 
Consider a place that has experienced deindustrial  i  zation, and research recent news articles on the Internet to ﬁ  nd out 
how the economy of the place has changed since the loss of industry. What has ha  p  pened to the place and its economy?

  Summary  
  The Industrial Revolution transformed the world economically, politically, and socially. 
Many of the places where industrialization ﬁ  rst took hold have since become deindus-trialized, both with the relocation of manufacturing plants and with the outsourcing of steps of the production process domestically and offshore. With changing ec  o  nom-
ics, places change. Some now look like ghost towns, serving merely as a reminder that industrialization took place there. Others have booming economies and are thriving, having kept industry or having successfully deve  l  oped a service economy. Still other 
places are redeﬁ  ning themselves. In the next chapter, we consider another las  t  ing effect 
of industrialization and deindustrialization: environmental change.

  Watching the horrors of the tsunami of December 26, 2004 unfold on screen 
(Fig. 13. 1), I found it quite e  e  rie to see such devastation in places where earlier I 
walked and drove and rode—like that Sri Lankan train on which I took a group of 
students in 1978 including my own children—now smashed by the waves, the car-riages toppled, killing more than a thousand passengers, some of them tourists. And the beaches near   Phuket   in Thailand, so serene and beautiful in memory, now p roved 
a fatal attraction leading to disaster for thousands more, tourists and workers alike.  
  I went online to follow the events of that day and those that followed, horriﬁ  ed 
by the rising death toll and by the images of destruction and devastation. The in-box of my e-mail began to include messages from former students who remembered my in-ﬁ  eld assessment of the tsunami risks in Southeast Asia. But I had not been

especially prescient. Just like people farming the fertile soils on the slopes of an active 
volcano, people living at or near sea level near an earthquake zone live with risk.  
  A few weeks later I began to hear and read stories about an English girl named 
  Tilly   Smith, who had been vacationing with her parents at a hotel on the beach at   Phuket   and was on   Maikhao   Beach when she saw the water suddenly recede into the distance.   Tilly   had just taken a geography class in her school not far from London, and her teacher, Mr. Andrew Kearney, had told the class what happens when a tsu-nami strikes: the huge approaching wave ﬁ  rst sucks the water off the beaches and 
then the sea foams, rises and returns as a massive, breaking wall that crashes over and inundates the whole shoreline.   Tilly   saw what was happening and alerted her par-ents, her father told hotel security, and they ran back and forth, screaming at beach-goers to seek shelter on higher ground in the hotel behind them. About a hundred people followed the Smith family into the   building  , and they all survived. Of those who stayed behind, none did. Being aware of some of the basics of physical geog-raphy has its advantages, and Mr. Kearney clearly had the attention of his students.  
  Newspaper editors could use some of this awareness. Many headlines referred 
to the tsunami as a tidal wave, but a tsunami has nothing to do with the tides that affect all oceans and seas. A tsunami results from an undersea earthquake involv-ing a large displacement of the Earth’s crust. Most submarine earthquakes do not generate tsunamis, but in some cases, fortunately relatively rare ones, a large piece of crust is pushed up or pulled under (or both), and this causes the water overhead to pile up and start rolling away in all directions. If you were on a cruise ship some-where in the middle of the ocean, nothing catastrophic would mark the passing of this tsunami wave; your ship would be lifted up and then lowered, but it would not overturn. But when such a huge wave reaches a beach, it does what all waves do: it breaks. Most of us have seen this happen with waves several feet (or even tens of feet) high. But imagine a wave over 200 feet high approaching a beach. As it begins to break, it pulls the water away, exposing wide swaths of muddy bottom. Then it comes crashing into the shore, pushing deep inland.  
  Tsunamis of the magnitude of 2004 are not common, but as the deadly tsu-
nami that struck the northeast coast of Japan in 2011 reminds us, the hazard is  continuous. As the Earth’s human population has grown, so have the numbers of people vulnerable to such a calamity. As we learn more about the submarine zones where earthquakes are most likely to occur, we can begin to determine where the hazards are greatest. Here we combine two major ﬁ  elds of study in geography, phys-ical geography and human geography. Ge  o  graphers who work in this arena study human-environmental relationships—the reciprocal relationships between human societies and natural environments. Both, clearly, are dynamic. The environment is not a passive stage, and environmental change affects human societies. At the same time, humans have an impact on their natural environments. The study of hazards, not just from tsunamis but also from volcanic eruptions, terrestrial earthquakes, landslides, ﬂ  oods, avalanches, and other threats, is a key part of this research.  
  The tsunami that struck coasts along the Indian Ocean from Indonesia to 
Somalia and from Thailand to the Maldives resulted from a violent earthquake measuring more than 9.0 on the (10-point) Richter scale off the west coast of the island of Sumatra (Indonesia).  
  There, two of the planet’s tectonic plates are colliding, forcing one beneath 
the other (Fig. 13.2). A series of tremors and quakes affects the crust in such   sub-duction   zones, but sometimes a major shock occurs. In this case, the towering wave generated by the December 26 earthquake had but a short distance to travel to reach northern Sumatra, where it struck in full force. By the time it had done its c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 435  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 435  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

damage in remote Somalia (in Africa), it had claimed approximately 300,000 lives 
and ruined the livelihoods of millions more. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami illus-trated one consequence of the tourist indu  s  try: drawing millions of tourists and workers to coasts makes them more vulnerable to coastal hazards.   
  Geography is a discipline in which the relationship between humans and the 
environment is a primary concern. One of the most inﬂ  uential nineteenth-century 
texts on this relationship,   Man and Nature    (1865), was written by the geographer 
George Perkins Marsh. In 1955, geographers were centrally involved in an inter-national interdisciplinary symposium on “Man’s Role in Changing the Face of the Earth.” This symposium, like Marsh’s earlier book, focused primarily on local and regional changes. More recently, a symposium led by geographers on “The Earth as Transformed by Human Action” picked up where the 1955 discussion left off, addressing global env  i  ronmental changes. The geographer’s concern with how things are organized on Earth and how places are connected provides an analytical platform from which to consider human-induced environmental change.  
  As the study of environmental change has moved forward, one of the most 
important lessons we have learned is that global environmental systems are inter-connected at numerous temporal and spatial scales. For example, the release of   chloroﬂ  uorocarbons   (CFCs) in the northern hemisphere contributed to a hole in 
the Earth’s ozone layer over Antarctica. Industrial production in the Netherlands and Germany contributes to acid rain in Scandinavia. The use of water from the Rio Grande for irrigation in northern New Mexico affects the amount and quality of the river’s water that ﬂ  ows along the Texas-Mexico border. Human actions—the activities we undertake individually and collectively—are increasingly important factors in all sorts of global environmental changes. To confront these changes, we must consider the complex relationship between humans and environment.  00 4000 2000 6000 Kilometers

 How Has Earth’s Environment Changed Over Time? 437
  HOW HAS EARTH’S ENVIRONMENT 
CHANGED   OVER   TIME?  
  Environmental variation, spatial as well as temporal, 
is one of Earth’s crucial characteristics. T emperatures rise 
and fall, precipitation waxes and wanes. Forests ﬂ  ourish 
and wither, deserts expand and contract. Humanity has evolved during a series of altern  a  tively warm and cold 
phases of an Ice Age that is still in progress. But today humanity itself is part of the process.  
  Modern   Homo sapiens   emerged less than 200,000 
years ago (and possibly not much more than 100,000 years 
ago). Humans altered their environment from the begin-ning by setting ﬁ  res to kill herds of reindeer and bison, or hunting entire species of large mammals to extinc-tion. The Maori, who arrived in New Zealand not much more than 1000 years ago, greatly altered native species of animals and plants long before the advent of modern technology. Elsewhere in the Paciﬁ  c realm, Pol  y  nesians 
reduced forest cover to brush and, with their penchant for wearing bird-feather robes, exterminated more than 80 percent of the regional bird species by the time the ﬁ  rst 
Europeans arrived. Europeans r  a  vaged species ranging 
from Galapagos turtles to Antarctic seals. European fash-ions had a disastrous impact on African species ranging from snakes to leopards. T raditional as well as modern societies have had devastating impacts on their ecosys-tems (ecological units consisting of self-regulating a  s  so-
ciations of living and nonliving natural elements) as well as on ecosystems into which they migrated.  
  Human alteration of environment continues in 
many forms today. For the ﬁ  rst time in history, how-
ever, the co  m  bined impact of humanity’s destructive and 
exploitative actions is capable of producing environmen-tal changes at the global scale. Consider for a moment the history of human life on Earth. Early human societies had relatively small popul  a  tions, and their impacts on the 
physical environment were limited in both duration and intensity. With the development of agrarian and   prein-
dustrial   societies, human alterations of the physical envi-
ronment increased, yet the effects of these early activities were still limited in scale.   Even the onset of urbaniza-
tion and the development of urban centers, which con-
ce  n  trated large numbers of people in particular places,   Key Questions     For   Chapter 13

last 500 years, however, both the rate and the scale at 
which humans modify Earth have i  n  creased dramatically. 
Particularly during the last half-century, every place on earth has been transformed, either directly or indirectly, by h  u  mans.  
  During our brief presence on this planet, humans 
have had a powerful impact on environments ranging 
from rainforests to   tundras  . Long before we became tech-
nologically proﬁ  cient we exterminated wildlife by the mil-
lions and burned grasslands and forests by the hundreds of thousands of square miles. The twentieth-century surge in the size of the human population, combined with a ra  p  id escalation in consumption, magniﬁ  es human-
ity’s impact on Earth in unprecedented ways. Although   Homo sapiens   have not domina  t  ed this world long, we have 
had enough of an impact that atmospheric chemist Paul 
  Crutzen   deﬁ  ned a new geologic epoch called the   anthr  o-
  pocene   to acknowledge the incredible role humans play 
in shaping Earth’s environment.  
  Tectonic Plates  
  How representative is the short-term present of the long-
term past? Over the past century, geographers and other scientists have been engaged in a joint mission to recon-struct our planet’s history on the basis of current evi-dence. One of them, the climatologist-geographer Alfred   Wegener  , used his spatial view of the world to make a key 
contribution. Viewing the i  n  creasingly accurate maps of 
the opposite coastlines of the North and South Atlantic 
oceans, he proposed a hypothesis that would a  c  count for 
the close “ﬁ  t” of the shapes of the facing continents, which, 
he argued, would be unlikely to be a matter of chance. His co  n  tinental drift hypothesis required the preexistence of a 
  supercontinent  , which he called   Pangaea  , that   broke apart 
into the fragments we now know as Africa, the Americas, 
Eurasia, and Australia (Fig. 13.3).   Wegener’s   hypothesis 
engendered the later theory of plate tectonics and   crustal   
spreading, and scientists now know that Pangaea and its 
fragmentation were only the latest episodes in a cycle of continental coalescence and spli  n  tering that spans billions 
of years. This latest   Pangaean   breakup, however, began 
only 180 million years ago and continues to this day.  c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 437  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 437  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  At plate boundaries,   tectonic plates   either   diverge   
(spread apart),   converge   (come together) or   transform   
(slide past one another). In the Atlantic Ocean, the North 
American plate is diverging from the Eurasian plate. Along this plate boundary, new oceanic crust is constantly being created where the plates diverge. A chain of volca-noes called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have formed on the ocean ﬂ  oor.     Figure 13.3

 How Has Earth’s Environment Changed Over Time? 439
  Where the Indian plate meets the Eurasian plate, the 
two plates are converging. The Himalaya Mountains on 
this plate boundary were built through convergence. The Himalayas are still lifting, and earthquakes are relatively common in the region as a result. When an oceanic plate converges with a continental plate, it is called a   subduction   
zone. In a   subduction   zone, the denser oceanic plate   sub-
ducts   under the continental plate, creating a trench along 
the boundary as well as volcanoes and strong earthquakes. Most of the strongest earthquakes that occur, including Haiti, Chile, and Japan in 2010 and 2011, happen along   subduction   zones.  
  Where the North American plate meets the Paciﬁ  c 
plate, in and near California, the two tectonic plates are 
moving past each other, which   is   called a transform plate 
boundary. Earthquakes are also common in this region. However, vo  l  canoes are not. Compare Figure 13.2 with 
Figure 13.5, and look for the correlation between   subduc-
tion   zones and active volcanoes. Focus on the transform 
boundary in and near California. Earthquakes are com-mon but volcanoes are not. This is because unlike diver-gent boundaries where a magma source is creating new crust, often through volcanoes, or a   subduction   zone 
where one plate is being crushed to mo  l  ten rock under 
the heat and pressure of another plate, magma is not com-mon in transform boundaries. Rather, the plates move past each other, pressure builds up, and that pressure is released in earthquakes.  
  Ocean and Atmosphere  
  Earth is often called the Blue Planet because more than 
70 percent of its surface is covered by water and views from space are dominated by blue hues and swirls of white clouds. We do not know with any certainty how Earth acquired its watery cloak or exactly when. Some scientists hypothesize that the water was originally trapped inside Earth during its formation and rose to the surface during the time when heavier constituents sank to form the core. Others calc  u  late that most of the 
water that did reach the surface in this way would have 
been evaporated into space by the searing heat then prevailing, suggesting that another source must be iden-tiﬁ ed. This has led to the comet hypothesis, which pro-
poses that icy comets bombarded Earth for more than a billion years while its atmosphere was still thin, accu-mulating fresh water from space that ﬁ  lled the basins in the formative crust.  
  Neither do we know precisely how the atmosphere 
formed. Originally, the atmosphere was loaded with the 
gas carbon dioxide (CO  
2  ), and if you could have looked 
up at the sky it would have been bright red because CO  2   
scatters red light. Eventually, however, the primitive 
ocean, still heated from below, began to absorb CO  2   in huge quantities. A very long time passed before oxygen 
became a substantial gas in the atmosphere. Around 1500 million years ago, green algae started to spread across Earth’s ocean surfaces, and as their colonies grew, their   photosynthesis   (the conversion of carbon dioxide 
and water into carbohydrates and oxygen through the 
absorption of sunlight) raised the atmosphere’s oxygen co  n  tent. About 800 million years ago, the oxygen con-
tent in the atmosphere was about one-twentieth of its 
present strength, or just 1 percent of the total. But that was enough to support the emergence of the ﬁ  rst single-
celled animals, the prot  o  zoa.  
  Fire and Ice  
  T oday major volcanic eruptions happen infrequently 
enough that they make the news.   Krakatoa   (1883), 
Mount St. Helens (1980), Pinatubo (1991), and   Merapi   
(2010) took many lives, damaged property, and, in the case of Pinatubo, even changed global climate slightly. In 2010 a relatively mild eruption of the Icelandic volcano   Eyjafjallajökull   spewed enough ash in the air to disrupt 
air trafﬁ  c across the northern Atlantic for more than a 
week. Over the past three decades, ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea volcano have a  l  tered the coastline of the Big 
Island of   Hawai’i   (Fig. 13. 4).  
  Y et such events are relatively minor compared to 
one billion years ago, when Earth’s crust was still imma-
ture and subject to huge bursts of volcanic activity. Such episodes poured incalculable volumes of gases and ash into the atmosphere, causing   mass depletions   (loss 
of diversity through a failure to produce new species) 
and contributing to the three   mass extinctions   (mass 
destruction of most sp  e  cies) known to have occurred over 
the past 500 million years.  
  The Earth’s most recent experience with mass vol-
canism took place between 180 and 160 million years ago, 
when the   supercontinent   Pangaea began to fracture. Lava 
poured from ﬁ  ssures and vents as South America separated 
from Africa and India moved northeast. Skies were black-ened, the atmosphere choked with ash. Animals responded as they always have in time of crisis: by migra  t  ing, frag-
menting into smaller groups, and speeding up their adap-
tive, evolutionary response. Physical geographers hypoth-esize that the earliest phase of Pangaea’s fragmentation was also the most vi  o  lent, that the plate separations that started 
it all were driven by built-up, extreme heat below the   s  u  per-
continent  , but that the motion of the plates has since slowed 
down. The   Paciﬁ  c Ring of Fire  —an ocean-girdling zone 
of   crustal   instability, volcanism, and earthquakes—is but a 
trace of the paroxysm that marked the onset of Pangaea’s 
breakup (Fig. 13.5). Y et, as we saw with the tsunami in Japan in 2011, tectonic events have cost millions of humans their lives and altered the course of history.  c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 439  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 439  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
440 Chapter 13  The Humanized Environment
  When Pangaea still was a   supercontinent  , an Ice 
Age cooled the Earth and may have contributed to, if not 
caused, the greatest known extinction crisis in the history of life on Earth. Ice Ages are not uniform cooling events: surges of col  d  ness and advances of glaciers are interrupted 
by temporary warming spells long enough to reverse much of the glacial impact. By the time the   Pleistocene   
epoch opened, less than 2 million years ago, the planet 
was in a deep freeze.  
  The Pleistocene epoch was marked by long   glacia-
tions   and short, warm   interglacials  . When the Pleistocene 
glaciations were most severe, permanent ice advanced deep 
into the landmasses of the Northern Hemisphere. Plants, an  i  mals, and hominids saw their living space diminished, 
their refuges shrunk, their niches unusable. Such glacia-
tions could last as long as 100,000 years, but eventually a warming spell would arrive, the ice would recede, and space as well as opportun  i  ty expanded again. A warming 
phase of this kind occurred between about 120,000 and 
100,000 years ago.  
  After this warm-up came the most recent   glaciation   
of the Pleistocene, the   Wisconsinan      Glaciation  , which left its mark on much of the Northern Hemisphere 
(Fig. 13.6).   But resourceful humans managed to survive 
where their pred  e  cessors could not, and there is ample evi-
dence of human occupation in ice-covered Europe, rang-
ing from cave art to tool kits. Even during a glacial advance brief periods of milder climate emerge. Thus, Figure 13.6 represents a glacial extreme, not the whole picture. So human communities—ﬁ  shing, hunting and gathering, and 
using increasingly sophisticated tools (and probably means of verbal communication)—exploited the milder times to expand their frontiers, then hunkered down when it got cold again.  
  About 73,500 years ago, something happened that 
appears to have come close to exterminating human-
ity altoget  h  er. A volcano, Mount   T oba  , erupted on the 
Indonesian island of Sumatra. This was not just an erup-tion: the entire mountain exploded, sending millions of tons of debris into orbit, obscuring the sun, creating long-term darkness, and alte  r  ing global climate. Mount 
  T oba’s   detonation could hardly have come at a worse 
time. Earth’s habitable zone was a  l  ready constricted 
because of   glaciation  . Anthropologists refer to this event   Field Note  
  “Kilauea has been erupting almost cont  i  nu-ously since 1983, making it one of Earth’s most active volcanoes. After ﬂ  ying over 
the volcano in a helicopter and looking down at the molten lava, I asked the pilot to take us to the coast where the lava was spilling into the sea. What we saw provided a stirring r  e  minder that the environment is anything but static. Lava had poured across the road that ran along the coast, and the conﬁ  guration of the coast was being 
remade before our eyes.”

as humanity’s “evolutionary bottleneck,” suggesting that 
much genetic diversity was lost. T oday, the ﬁ  lled-in cal-
dera mar  k  ing   T oba’s   cataclysm is 90 kilometers (55 miles) 
long and 50 kilometers (30 miles) wide, silent witness to the greatest threat to our existence ever to come from any source (Fig. 13.7).  
  The   Wisconsinan     Glaciation   eventually gave way to 
a full-scale   interglacial  , the current warm interlude that 
has been given its own designation, the   Holocene  . Global 
warming began about 18,000 years ago, and for the next 
6000 years, temperatures rose rapidly. Although the ice sheets were thinning and giant, mud-laden ﬂ  oods sped 
down the Mississippi Valley, building the river’s enormous delta, ice continued to cover most of northern North America as recently as 13,000 years ago.  
  T o our human ancestors in the northern hemisphere, 
who inhabited much of western and eastern Eurasia and 
may just have been entering the Americas (some schol-ars argue that American Indians were here much earlier), this warming must have been a welcome exp  e  rience. 
Slight temperature increases happened earlier, during the   Wisconsinan     Glaciation  , but were quickly fo  l  lowed by 
colder times. So persistent was this most recent warming that people ventured farther and farther   poleward  .  
  The Little Ice Age in the Modern Era  
  T o the farmers, winegrowers, and seafarers of the four-
teenth century, increasing cold, decreasing rainfall, frigid winds, and shortened growing seasons made for dwin-dling harvests, failing farms, and seas too stormy for ﬁ  sh-
ing. By the turn of the fourteenth century, alpine glaciers began to advance. Greenland’s small settlement had long since disappeared, and Iceland was abandoned as well. Weather extremes abounded, not only in the form of record cold snaps but also as sea  r  ing summer heat and 
raging storms.  
  Famines struck all over Europe, just at a time when 
more people were clustered in towns than ever before. 
The climatic record, pieced together from farmers’ dia-ries (winegrowers’ diaries are especially useful), tree ring research (  dendochronology  ), ice cores, contem-
porary writings, illustrative paintings, and surviving 
sketches and drawings, justify the designation of the post–1300 period as a shift in the direction of   reglaci-
ation  . We now know that this return to colder times, 
marked by advancing mountain glaciers and thickening 
  Subarctic   ice, would end in the mid-nineteenth cen-
tury and that even the worst of it, starting in the late 
1600s, did not lead to full-scale Pleistocene   glaciation  . 
Whatever   was happening precipitated s  e  rious social 
disruptions   in Europe and in other parts of the world 
as well, but of course those who experienced it were 
unaware of the long-term implications. Only when new methods of analysis became avai  l  able did scien-
tists realize what had happened—and then they gave 
the episode an inappropriate name. This temporary cooling was no ice age: it was a minor   glaciation   and not

the ﬁ  rst over the past 6000 years. But the name   Little 
Ice Age   certainly was more dramatic than “Minor 
  Glaciation  ,” and it stuck.  
  In his book   The Little Ice Age   (2000), archaeolo-
gist Brian Fagan described how the Franz Josef Glacier 
on New Zealand’s South Island “thrust   downslope   into 
the valley below, smashing into the great rainforests . . . 
felling giant trees like matchsticks.” In North America, our growing understanding of the Little Ice Age helps explain why the Jamestown colony collapsed so fast, a failure attributed by historians to ineptitude and lack of preparation. The chief cause may well have been environmental. Geographer David   Stahle   (1998) and 
his team, studying tree ring records that go back eight 
centuries, found that the Jamestown area experienced a seven-year drought between 1606 (the year before the c  o  lony’s founding) through 1612, the worst in nearly 
eight centuries. European colonists and American 
Indians were in the same situation, and their relations worsened as they were forced to compete for dwindling food and falling water tables. The high rate of starva-tion was not unique to the colonists. They, and their American Indian neighbors, faced the rigors of the Little Ice Age as well.  
  As the Little Ice Age continued into the 1800s, a 
large-scale volcano had a major impact on human soci-
ety. On April 5, 1815, the   T ambora   Volcano on the island 
of Sumatra in what was then the Dutch East Indies, 
located not   far east   of Bali, rumbled to life. Less than 
a week later it was pulverized in a series of explosions 
that could be heard a thousand miles away, killing all but 26 of the island’s population of 12,000. When it was over, the top 4000 feet of the volcano were gone, and much of what is now Indonesia was covered by debris. Darkness enveloped most of the colony for weeks, and tens of thousands died of famine in the months that fol-lowed. Colonial reports describe ﬁ  elds covered by poi-
sonous ash and powder, waters clogged by trees and cinders, and air rendered   unbreathable   by a fog of acid 
chemicals.  
  Since the 1850s, when the Little Ice Age waned 
and a slow but nearly continuous warming phase 
began, climatologists and other scientists have sought answers to crucial questions relating to climate change: what causes alternating cycles of global warming and cooling? Given the enormous quantities of pollution poured into the planet’s atmosphere as the Industrial Revolution gathered momentum, how large is the human contribution to the associated   greenhouse 
effect   (that results when greenhouse gases trap heat 
and raise temperatures)? This worldwide, interna-
tional effort to answer such questions involves the use of sophisticated computers and complicated models, and as discussed below, it has achieved an alarming consensus.  
  Take time to search the Internet and read about what has happened to   Phuket  , Thailand, since the Indian Ocean tsu-nami hit in December 2004. Look for before and after images of   Phuket  —how did it look before the tsunami hit and after? Research how   Phuket   has been rebuilt and determine why   Phuket   has been rebuilt the way it has.  
  HOW   HAVE   HUMANS ALTERED 
EARTH’S ENVIRONMENT?  
  Biologists estimate that as many as 25 million types 
of organisms inhabit Earth, perhaps even more. Most 
have not yet been identiﬁ  ed, classiﬁ  ed, or studied. No spe-
cies, not even the powerful dinosaurs, ever affected their environment as strongly as humans do today. An impact by comets probably made the dinosaurs and many other species extinct. Some   bi  o  geographers   suggest that the 
next great extinction may be caused not by asteroids but by humans, whose numbers and demands are destroying mi  l  lions of species.  
  The natural environment is being modiﬁ  ed and 
stressed by human activity in many obvious and some less 
o  b  vious ways. Some   environmental stress   is more obvi-
ous because it takes place around human habitats, such 
as cutting forests and emitting pollutants into the atmo-sphere. Less obvious environmental stress takes place away from dense concentrations of humans, including mou  n  tain top mining, burying toxic wastes that contam-
inate groundwater supplies, and dumping vast amounts 
of garbage into the oceans. Humans have built seawalls, terraced   hillslopes  , dammed ri  v  ers, cut canals, and modi-
ﬁ ed the environment in many constructive as well as 
destructive ways. All of these activities have an i  m  pact 
on environment and have given rise to a number of key 
concerns. Among these are the future of water supplies, the state of the atmosphere, climate change, desertiﬁ  ca-
tion, deforestation, soil degradation, and the disposal of i  n  dustrial wastes.  
  Water  
  Resources that are replenished even as they are being 
used are   renewable resources  , and resources that are 
present in ﬁ  nite quantities are   nonrenewable resources  . 
Water, essential to life, is a renewable resource. But the 
available supply of fresh water is not distributed evenly across the globe.

a whole is enormous; spread out evenly, it would cover the land area of the planet with about 83 centimeters (33 inches) of water each year. Much of that water is lost through runoff and evaporation, but enough of it seeps downward into porous, water-holding rocks called   aqui-
fers   to provide mi  l  lions of wells with steady ﬂ  ows. In the 
United States alone, it is estimated that there is   50 times 
as much water   stored in aquifers as there is precipitation 
falling on the land surface every year.  
  Despite such favorable data, the supply of water is 
anything but plentiful (Fig. 13.8). Chronic water short-
ages afﬂ  ict tens of millions of farmers in Africa and hun-
dreds of thousands of city dwellers in Southern California; water rationing has been imposed in rainy South Florida and in Spain, which faces the Mediterranean Sea.  
   In many areas of the world, people have congre-
gated in places where water supplies are insufﬁ  cient, 
undependable, or both. In California, people are some-
times not allowed to wash their cars or reﬁ  ll their swim-
ming pools; these are minor inconveniences compared to the fate faced by millions of Sudanese trying to escape their country’s civil war by ﬂ  eeing to parched pans of the Sahara. In Florida, where the urban population depends on the Biscayne Aquifer for most of its water, the long-term prospect is troubled: whe  n  ever seasonal rainfalls do 
not reach their projected averages, Floridians overuse the Biscayne Aquifer, and saltwater enters the aquifer from the nearby Atlantic Ocean. The invasion of saltwater over time can permanently destroy a fresh water aquifer.    Hundreds of millions of people still cluster along 
several of Earth’s great rivers. Indeed, nearly three-
quarters of all the fresh water used annually is consumed in farming, not in cities. In California, where about 80 per-cent of available water is used for irrigation, this has led to an intense debate: should cities be provided with ample water at the expense of Central Valley farms, and should fruits and vegetables be bought from elsewhere, even overseas, rather than be grown locally?  
  Industries use another 20 percent of the world’s 
water supply, contributing heavily to pollution when the 
used water is returned to streams, lakes, and aquifers. When communist rule ended in   eastern   Europe, tests 
indicated that the region’s rivers and groundw  a  ter were 
among the most severely polluted in the world because industries there had not been ad  e  quately regulated.  
  As human populations have expanded, people have 
increasingly settled in arid regions. One of the great 
ecological disasters of the twentieth century occurred in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, whose common boundary runs through the Aral Sea. Streams that fed this large body of water were diverted to irrigate the surrounding desert, mainly for commercial cotton production. Heavy use of chemical pesticide ruined the groundwater below, caus-ing a health crisis that some o  b  servers describe as an “eco-
logical Chernobyl” (referring to the 1986 nuclear reactor meltdown in the Ukraine). In the meantime the Aral Sea began to dry up, and by the mid-1990s it had lost more than three-quarters of its total surface area (Fig. 13.9).  
  School children are not typically taught to think 
about the geography of water—how varying precipita-
tion and human uses of water affect its availability and quantity. T extbooks teach that water is a constant whose   Field Note

distribution is sustained through the   hydrologic cycle  , 
where water from oceans, lakes, soil, rivers, and veg-
etation evaporates, condenses, and then precipitates on landmasses. The precipitation inﬁ  ltrates and recharges 
groundwater or runs off into lakes, rivers, and oceans (Fig. 13.10). Physical geographer J  a  mie Linton questions 
the utility of any model of the water cycle that does not 
take into account the role of humans and culture, su  g-
  gesting that by “representing water as a constant, cycli-
cal ﬂ ow, the hydrologic cycle establishes a norm that is at 
odds with the hydr  o  logical reality of much of the world” 
(Linton 2008, 639).  
  Linton argues that the hydrologic cycle does not 
take into account the norms of water in arid regions of the 
world, and it also assumes water cycles in a predictable, lin-ear fashion. The amount of water cycling through is not a co  n  stant. For instance,   landcover   changes how much 
water is in the cycle. In the global south, Linton, contends, 
forests “can actually promote   evapotranspiration   at rates 
much higher than for short crops,” which has “the overall 
effect of   reducing   the quantity of water available for runoff 
or groundwater recharge” (Linton 2008, 643).  
  Instead of the hydrologic cycle, Linton advocates 
thinking of water as a system rather than a cycle (Fig. 13.11). 
He deﬁ  nes the water system as the “integration of physi-
cal, biological, biogeochemical, and human components” of the global water sy  s  tem.  
  Water Security  
  Throughout the world, people have come to depend on 
water sources whose future capacity is uncertain. Rocky Mountain and Sierra Nevada snows feed the Colorado River and the aquifers that irrigate the California Central Valley. Aqueducts snake their way across the desert to urban communities. None of this has slowed the popu-lation’s move to the Sun Belt (see Chapter 12), and the water situation there is becoming problematic. In coastal eastern Spain, low water pressure in city pipes sometimes deprive the upper ﬂ  oors of high-rise buildings of water. 
In Southwest Asia and the Arabian Peninsula, grow-ing populations strain ancient water supply systems and desalinization plants are a necessity. Water plays a role in regional conﬂ  icts in places including the Darfur region 
of Sudan  .  
  When relations between countries and peoples are 
problematic, disputes over water can make them even 
worse. As populations grow and as demand for water rises, fears of future shortages intensify.  
  Water and Politics in the Middle East  
  Water supply is a particularly difﬁ  cult problem affecting 
relations among Israel and its neighbors. With 7.7 mil-lion people, Israel annually consumes nearly three times as much water as Jordan, the West Bank Palestinian areas, and Gaza combined (total population: over 7 mi  l  lion).   As 
much as half of Israel’s water comes from sources outside the Israeli state.  
  The key sources of water for the entire area are 
the Jordan River and an aquifer beneath the West Bank. 
When Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria and the West Bank from Jordan during the 1967 war, it gained control over both of these sources, including the Jordan KAZAKHSTAN KAZAKHSTAN KAZAKHSTAN

River’s important tributary, the   Yarmuk   (Fig. 13.12). As 
the map shows, the Sea of Galilee forms a large fresh water 
reservoir in the Jordan River Valley. This is the source of most of Israel’s water (desalinization facilities do not yet contribute signiﬁ  can  t  ly).  
  The water supply complicates the relationships 
between Israel and its Palestinian neighbors in the West 
Bank and Gaza. The aquifer beneath the West Bank yields about 625 million cubic meters of water through hundreds of wells linked together by a system of pipelines. Of this, some 450 million cubic meters go directly to Israel; another 35 million are consumed by Israeli settlers on the West Bank, and only some 140 million are allotted to the West Bank’s nearly 2 million Arabs.  
  This is unfair, say the Palestinian Arabs: if the West 
Bank is to become an independent Palestinian territory, the 
water below the surface should belong to the Palestinians. But the Israeli cities of T el Aviv and Jerusalem depend heav-ily on water from the West Bank, and Israel cannot survive without this source.    The water issue will complicate any hoped-for 
settlement of territorial disputes among Israel and its 
neighbors. Israel might contemplate the return of most of the Golan Heights to Syria, but about 30 percent of all water reaching the Sea of Galilee comes from the Golan Heights. Israel might support the establishment of an independent state in the West Bank, but approximately 30 percent of Israel’s water supply comes from the West Bank aquifer. Any effort to negotiate a lasting peace in the region will have to take these geographical circumstances into account.

land, sustaining crops and forests and replenishing soils 
and wells.  
  In 1883 the Indonesian volcano   Krakatau   erupted 
catastrophically, throwing 10 cubic kilometers (2.5 cubic 
miles) of rock and ash into the atmosphere. T otal dark-ness prevailed in the area for nearly three days; dust from the explosion e  n  circled Earth and created vividly col-
ored sunsets for years afterward. However, eventually the atmosphere cleared, and all traces of the eruption dis-a  p  peared. In 1980 the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 
the northwestern United States caused a similar, though much smaller, globe-encircling cloud of volcanic dust in the upper atmosphere. Again, the a  t  mosphere cleared that 
volcanic dust.  
  Scientists are concerned that human pollution of 
the atmosphere will result in longer lasting, possibly 
permanent, damage. T rue, the air disperses even the densest smoke and most acrid chemical gases. However, anthropogenic sources of pollution from two centuries of industrial expansion are pouring into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate. While the United States remains the world’s largest per capita leader in terms of pollutants generated, China has overtaken the United States in total volume, India’s share is ri  s  ing rapidly, and 
other growing economies are compounding a problem 
that can only be solved by determined international action. Such coordinated action has different economic implications for different cou  n  tries, making it difﬁ  cult 
to achieve.  GAZA

448 Chapter 13  The Humanized Environment
  Climate Change  
  Growing populations and increased human activity, rang-
ing from the burning of tropical forests to pollution of the atmosphere by industry and automobiles, are having an unprecedented impact on the atmosphere. The amounts of key “greenhouse” gases, carbon dioxide (CO  
2  ), methane, 
and nitrous oxides in the atmosphere have been increas-
ing at a rate of about 2 percent per decade; automobiles, steel mills, reﬁ  neries, and chemical plants account for a 
large part of this increase. A simple experiment in a college chemistry lab shows that an increase in the level of CO  
2   in 
the atmosphere traps more heat. Hence, it is not surprising 
that an overwhelming majority of climate scientists have concluded that   tropospheric   pollution from anthropogenic 
(human) sources is causing the Earth to retain increasing 
amounts of heat, with effects that will increase during the course of the twenty-ﬁ  rst ce  n  tury and beyond.  
  While estimates of the degree of human-induced 
  climate change   differ, climate records from recent decades 
show that global temperatures are rising, which is why 
climate change is sometimes called global warming. Climate change is a more accurate term, however, because while the global te  m  perature is rising, the outcome will 
vary greatly across regions of the world.  
  Sea-level rise is only one aspect of climate change. 
While the rise in global temperatures will undoubtedly 
be i  n  terrupted by occasional spurts of cooling, computer 
models predict that warmer temperatures will melt polar and gl  a  cial ice and that sea levels will rise as much as 50 
centimeters or more over the next 90 years. Certain calcu-lations project an even greater sea-level rise. Alarmed gov-ernment leaders whose nations inhabit low-lying Paciﬁ  c 
and Indian Ocean islands talk of buying higher ground in other countries and of suing the governments of polluting states over lost real estate.  
  Changes in climate involve changes in the amount of 
water vapor in the atmosphere, which affects patterns of 
precipitation. Changes in precipitation affect where cer-tain types of vegetation can grow, altering everything from agricultural patterns to the location of animal hab  i  tats.  
  While there is no doubt that sustained global warm-
ing would cause such changes, predicting exactly where, 
and in what magnitude, these changes will occur is dif-ﬁ cult. What is clear is that those living on the margins of 
sustainability are facing even riskier f  u  tures.  
  Extreme Weather Events  
  In recent years, climatologists have begun to focus on 
abrupt weather events: a process that appears to be cou-pled with “swings” in climate such as the Little Ice Age and the current phase of climate change. Research has already shown that the onset of the global warming that led to the retreat of the   Wisconsinan   glaciers from north-
ern latitudes, gigantic storms swept across central North America, picked up millions of tons of pulverized rock and deposited it in thick layers in what is today the U.S. Midwest. Climatologists believe that the warming after the   Wisconsinan     Glaciation   included extraordinary tem-
perature swings and extreme weather events.  
  Extreme weather events have also accompanied 
periods of global cooling. When the Little Ice Age cooled 
Europe in the 1300s, some chroniclers described snow-fall increasing so rapidly that glaciers ﬂ  owing from their 
Alpine valleys “like white lava’ onto neighboring plains as rivers raged and crops withered.  
  Atmospheric scientists are investigating the relation-
ship between current changes in the climate and extreme 
weather events. If you follow the news, you have read headlines from around the world about cold snaps that are the worst in the century, ﬂ  oods the highest in memory, 
and droughts the longest on record. Many of the computer models used to simulate these events show a link between warming global temperatures and changing regional weather systems.  
  Acid Rain  
  A by-product of the enormous volume of pollutants 
spewed into the atmosphere is   acid rain  . Acid rain forms 
when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are released into 
the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas). These pollutants combine with water vapor in the air to form dilute solutions of sulfuric and nitric acids, which then are washed out of the atmosphere by rain or other types of precipitation, such as fog and snow.  
  Although acid rain usually consists of relatively mild 
acids, it is caustic enough to harm certain natural ecosys-
tems (the mutual interactions between groups of plant and animal organisms and their environment). Already we know that acid rain has acidiﬁ  ed lakes and streams (with 
resultant ﬁ  sh kills), stunted growth of forests, and dam-aged crops in affected areas. In cities, acid rain has acceler-ated corrosion of buildings and monuments.  
  The geography of acid rain is most closely associated 
with patterns of industrial concentration and middle- to 
long-distance wind ﬂ  ows. The highest densities of coal 
and oil burning are associated with large concentrations of heavy man  u  facturing, such as those in Europe, the 
United States, and China. As industrialization expanded in these places during the second half of the twentieth century, many countries (i  n  cluding the United States in 
1970) enacted legislation establishing minimal clean-air standards.  
  In the United States and western Europe, compli-
ance with legislated emission reductions is having posi-
tive results. In Canada as well as in Scandinavia, where acid rain from neighboring industrial regions damaged forests and acidiﬁ  ed lakes, recovery came faster than most scientists had predicted. This evidence is now c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 448  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 448  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Have Humans Altered Earth’s Environment?  449
encouraging other countries to impose stricter controls 
over factory emissions.  
  The Land  
  Over the centuries, human population growth has put 
increasing pressure on land surfaces. More land is cleared and placed under cultivation, trees are cut down, and cities expand. The effects can be seen   almosteverywhere   and are 
so extensive that it is often difﬁ  cult even to reconstruct what 
an area might be like in the absence of humans. The human impact on Earth’s land surface has several key aspects, the most signiﬁ  cant of which are defor  e  station, soil erosion, 
waste disposal (discussed here) and biodiversity loss.    Field Note  
  “This was one of the most depressing days of this long South 
American ﬁ  eld trip. We had been briefed and had seen the 
satellite pictures of the destruction of the rainforest, with ugly gashes of bare ground pointing like rows of arrows into the woods. But walking to the temporary end points of some of these new roads made a lot more impact. From the remaining forest around came the calls of monkeys and other wildlife, their habitat retreating under the human onslaught. Next week this road would push ahead another mile, the logs carted away and burned, the ﬁ  rst steps in a process that would clear this land, ending billions of years of nature’s dominance.”

  Deforestation  
  Forests cover 31 percent of the total surface of the Earth 
from the tropical Amazon Basin to high-latitude North America and Eurasia. The world’s forests, especially those of lower and middle latitudes, play a critical role in what   biogeographers   call the   oxygen cycle  . Atmospheric oxy-
gen is consumed by natural processes as well as by human 
activities. Forests counteract this loss through photosyn-thesis and related processes, which release oxygen into the atmosphere. The d  e  struction of vast tracts of forest 
is called   deforestation  . Ecologists and others warn of 
unforeseeable and i  n  calculable effects not only for the 
affected areas but for the planet as a whole.  
  In the early 1980s, the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations undertook 
a study of the rate at which forests were being depleted. This analysis showed that 44 percent of the tropical rain-forest had already been affected by cutting and that more than 1 percent was being logged every year (Fig. 13.13).  
  In 2010, the FAO released a report on the world’s 
forests with good news: the rate of deforestation world-
wide d  e  clined in the last decade. According to the FAO, 
during the 1990s, humans deforested 16 million hectares a year, mostly by converting tropical rainforests to agri-culture land. Between 2000 and 2010, humans deforested 13 million hectares a year. Lower deforestation rates have been coupled with tree planting programs, especially in Brazil and Indonesia. As a result, the “net loss of forests was 5.2 million hectares per year between 2000 and 2010, down from 8.3 million hectares annually in the 1990s.”  
  Deforestation is not a singular process: it has been 
going on for centuries, and the motivations for deforesta-
tion vary vastly. Forests are cut and reforested for wood and paper products; forests are preserved for the main-tenance of biod  i  versity; and other forests are cleared for 
new agricultural production.  
  The reforestation (and harvesting) of deforested 
areas is not the whole answer to the problem, even if it 
could be done on a large scale. Forests in the United States, for example, consist mainly of second-growth trees, which replaced the original forest after it was logged. Ho  w  ever, 
the controlled second-growth forest does not (as the natu-ral forest did) have many trees dying of old age after their trunks and limbs become soft from rot. As a result, many animal species that depend on holes in trunks and hollows in tree limbs cannot ﬁ  nd places to nest (thus, the spotted 
owl dispute in the Paciﬁ  c Northwest of the United States). 
For them the forest has ceased to be a f  a  vorable habitat.  
  Soil Erosion  
  The loss of potentially productive soil to erosion has 
been described as a “quiet crisis” of global proportions. Ecologists Lester Brown and Edward Wolf point out that the increasing rate of this loss over the past generation c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 449  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 449  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
450 Chapter 13  The Humanized Environment
is not the result of a decline in the skills of farmers but 
rather of the pressures on farmers to produce more. In an integrated world food econ  o  my, the pressures on land 
resources are not conﬁ  ned to particular countries; they 
permeate the entire world.  
  Why has   soil erosion   increased so much? Part of 
the answer lies in population pressure: world population 
is over 7 billion. Associated with population growth is the cultivation of ever-steeper slopes, with hastily constructed te  r  races or without any terraces at all (Fig. 13.14). As the 
pressure on land increases, farmers are less able to leave part of their soil fallow (unused) to allow it to recover its nutrients. Shifting cultivators (see Chapter 11) must shorten their ﬁ  eld rotation cycle, and as a result their soil, too, is less able to recover. Altogether 99.7 percent of all human food is grown in soil (some is grown in water), and annual soil erosion shrinks the cropland available for agri-culture. A 2006 study reported that globally about 37,000 square miles (10 million hectares) of cropland are lost to soil erosion each year.  
  Soil erosion is caused by a variety of factors: live-
stock are allowed to graze in areas where they destroy 
the natural vegetation; lands too dry to sustain farming are plowed, and wind erosion follows. Soil is a renew-able resource because with proper care it can recover. However, it is being “mined” as if it were a nonrenewable resource. International cooperation in food distribution, education of farmers and governments, and worldwide dissemination of soil conservation methods are urgently needed to solve this “quiet crisis.”    Waste Disposal  
  If anything has grown faster than population itself, it is 
the waste generated by households, communities, and industries—much of it a matter of bulk, some of it a source of danger.  
  The United States, the world’s largest consumer 
of resources, is also the largest producer of   solid waste  , 
debris, and garbage discarded by those living in cities, 
industries, mines, and farms. According to current esti-mates, the United States produces about 2 kilograms (4.5 pounds) of solid waste per person per day, which adds 
up to more than 226 million m  e  tric tons (250 million tons) 
per year. But the United States is not alone. Other high-technology economies with a high ratio of disposable materials (containers, packaging) face the same problems.  
  Disposal of these wastes is a major worldwide prob-
lem. The growing volume of waste must be put some-
where, but space for it is no longer easy to ﬁ  nd. In poorer countries waste is often thrown onto open dumps where vermin multiply, decomposition sends methane gas into the air, rain and waste liquids carry contaminants into the groundwater below, and ﬁ  res pollute the surround-ing atmo  s  phere. In countries that can afford it, such open 
dumps have been replaced by   sanitary landﬁ  lls  . The 
waste is put in a hole that has been dug and prepared for 
the purpose, including a ﬂ  oor of materials to treat seeping liquids and soil to cover each load as it is co  m  pacted and 
deposited in the ﬁ  ll.  
  The number of suitable sites for sanitary landﬁ  lls 
is decreasing, however, and it is increasingly difﬁ  cult to    Figure 13.14

design new sites. In the United States landﬁ  ll capacity has 
been reached or will soon be reached in about a dozen 
States, most of them in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, and those States must now buy space from other States for this purpose. T rucking or sending garbage by rail to distant landﬁ  lls is very expensive, but there are few alternatives.  
  Similar problems arise on a global scale. The 
United States, the European Union, and Japan export 
solid (including hazardous) wastes to countries in Africa, Middle and South America, and East Asia. While these countries are paid for accepting the waste, they do not always have the capacity to treat it properly. So the waste often is dumped in open lan  d  ﬁ lls, where it creates the very 
hazards that the exporters want to avoid. In the late 1980s, the wealthier countries’ practice of “managing” waste by exporting it became a controversial issue, and in 1989 a treaty was drawn up to control it. The treaty did not (as many poorer countries wished) prohibit the exporting of hazardous waste, although it did place some restri  c  tions 
on trade in hazardous materials.  
  It is useful to differentiate between   toxic wastes  , in 
which the danger is caused by chemicals, infectious mate-
rials, and the like, and   radioactive wastes  , which are of 
two types: low-level radioactive wastes, which give off 
small amounts of radiation and are produced by industry, hospitals, research facilities, and nuclear power plants; and high-level radioactive wastes, which emit strong radi  a  tion and are produced by nuclear power plants and 
nuclear weapons factories. In the United States, low-level radioactive wastes have for many years been disposed of in steel drums placed in six special government-run landﬁ  lls, 
three of which are now closed.  
  High-level radioactive waste is extremely dangerous 
and difﬁ  cult to get rid of. Fuel rods from nuclear reactors 
will remain radioactive for thousands of years and must be stored in remote places where they will not contaminate water, air, or any other part of the environment. In fact, no satisfactory means or place for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste has been found. Among many suggested disposal sites are deep shafts in the bedrock, chambers dug in salt deposits (salt effectively blocks radiation), ice cham-bers in Antarctica, sediments beneath the ocean ﬂ  oor, and 
volcanically active   midocean   trenches. Meanwhile, spent 
fuel rods (which last only about three years in the reactor) are put in specially d  e  signed drums and stored in one of 
about 100 sites, all of them potentially dangerous.  
  There is a related problem: transportation of waste. 
Even if secure and safe storage can be found for high-level 
r  a  dioactive waste, the waste has to be transported from its 
source to the disposal site. Such transportation presents an a  d  ditional hazard; a truck or train accident could have 
disastrous consequences.  
  The dimensions of the waste-disposal problem are 
growing and globalizing. The threat to the planet’s envi-ronment is not just over the short term but can exist for 
centuries, indeed millennia.  
  Biodiversity  
  A signiﬁ  cant change that is related to all of the develop-
ments discussed so far is the accelerating loss of   biodiver-
sity  . An abbreviation of “biological diversity,” biodiver-
s  i  ty refers to the diversity of all aspects of life found on the 
Earth. Although the term is commonly used when refer-
ring to the diversity of species, it encompasses the entire range of biological divers  i  ty, from the genetic variability 
within individuals of a species to the diversity of ecosys-tems on the planet.  
  How many species are there? Estimates range from 
10 million to 100 million, and no one is quite sure how 
many. So far only some 1.75 million species have been identiﬁ  ed, and new species, particularly new species of 
insects, are being discovered regularly. Y et species are also becoming extinct at a rapid rate. It is difﬁ  cult to say 
exactly how quickly extin  c  tions are occurring, since we 
do not know how many species there are. What is clear, however, is that although extinction is a natural process, humans have dramatically increased rates of extinction, particularly over the last few hundred years. Estimates from the United Nations Environment Pr  o  gram’s Global 
Biodiversity Assessment indicate that 8 percent of plants, 5 percent of ﬁ  sh, 11 percent of birds, and 18 percent of the world’s mammal species are currently threatened.  
  Where is biodiversity most threatened? Whether a 
species is threatened with extinction depends on the range 
of the species, its scarcity, and its geographic concentra-tion. If a species with a small range, a high degree of scar-city, and a small geographic concentration has its habitat threatened, extinction can follow. Because most species have small ranges, change in a small area can affect a sp  e-
  cies. A 2005 report in   Scientiﬁ  c American   explained that 
“Clearing a forest, draining a wetland, damming a river 
or dynamiting a coral reef to kill its ﬁ  sh can more readily eliminate species with small ranges than more widespread species.”  
  Human impacts on biodiversity have increased over 
time. The domestication of animals, followed by the agri-
cultural domestication of plant life, caused signiﬁ  cant 
changes in our relationship with other species. Large ver-tebrates have a  l  ways been particularly hard hit by human 
activities. Many birds and mammals have been hunted not only for food but also for their skins, feathers, and so forth. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, beaver populations in North Amer  i  ca were drastically 
reduced as the beavers were trapped and skinned for their pelts. Many bird species were hunted for their feathers, which were sold to decorate fashionable hats. Worldwide, elephants and walruses continue to be hunted for their c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 451  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 451  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

ivory tusks. From historical records we know that over 
650 species of plants and over 480 animal species have become extinct in just the last 400 years. These represent only the documented extinctions. The actual number of extinctions that o  c  curred during this period is almost cer-
tainly much higher.  
  Humans have also indirectly contributed to extinc-
tions. Human travel, for instance, introduced new spe-
cies to areas around the globe—rats are among the more destructive of these; they have had devastating effects on oceanic islands. Introduced species may cause extinctions by preying upon native species or competing with them for resources. A fa  m  ous example is the dodo bird (  Raphus   
  cuculatus  ), which was hunted to extinction by humans, 
dogs, and rats on the island of Mauritius. Introduced spe-
cies may also carry new diseases, leading to the decimation and extinction of local populations. Species on islands are particularly susceptible to extinction because of the more insular ecosystems found on is  l  ands. An estimated 2000 
species of birds on tropical Paciﬁ  c Islands became extinct following human settlement.  
  Identifying the nature and extent of environmen-
tal changes is only a ﬁ  rst step toward understanding the 
extent of human alteration of the planet. A second, and 
more complicated step is to consider the forces driving these changes.  
  What is the greatest environmental concern facing the region where you live, and in what other regions of the world is that concern also present? How do differences between your region and the other regions sharing the concern inﬂ  u-
ence how it is understood and approached?  
  WHAT ARE THE MAJOR FACTORS 
CONTRIBUTING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE TODAY?  
  Environmental change occurs at all levels of scale, 
from local to global. For example, deforestation has local 
effects by reducing the diversity of species even in a small area. It has regional consequences by increasing sediment runoff into streams and rivers. And, globally, it results in the increased release of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which affects planetary climates.  
  Several interrelated factors inﬂ  uence the escalating 
impact of human activities on the natural environment. 
The past two centuries have witnessed dramatic growth in the human population, a fourfold increase (from about 1.5 billion to 6 billion) in the twentieth century alone. Per capita consumption of virtually everything, from water and farm products to metals and energy resources, has i  n  creased rapidly as well. Fast-developing technologies 
allow us to alter the natural environment ever more. Each of these factors can be studied at all scales from global to local.  
  Global environmental changes express themselves at 
all scales, from local to global. For example, deforestation 
can have a local effect by reducing the diversity of spe-cies in a particular area. It can have regional impacts by increasing s  e  diment runoff into rivers. Finally, at a global 
scale, deforestation is associated with the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and may affect global climate by altering processes that occur at the land surface. T o fully understand d  e  forestation, we must keep all of these 
scales in mind.  
  Several interrelated factors are responsible for the 
expanding impact of humans on the environment over 
the past two centuries. One of these factors is the dra-matic growth of the human population. Even consider-ing the minimal needs for human survival, there can be little doubt that the fourfold increase in the human popu-lation in the twentieth century had signiﬁ  cant environ-
mental impacts. Another factor is consumption, which has increased dramatically in the modern world. Y et another is technology, which has both expanded the human capac-ity to alter the environment and brought with it i  n  creas-
ing energy demands. Each of these interrelated factors that contribute to environmental change can be studied broadly, focusing on the general impacts of each factor on the global enviro  n  ment. Y et, when we shift scales to the 
local and regional, and we consider the context of human actions at these scales, we often ﬁ  nd that the causes of 
environme  n  tal change vary depending on the local and 
regional context.  
  Political Ecology  
  Leslie Gray and William Moseley describe the ﬁ  eld of 
political ecology, beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, as a 
way of cons  i  dering the roles of “political economy, power 
and history in shaping human-environmental interac-tions.” Political ecologists use scale to consider how attempts to affect environmental change, such as defores-tation, differ depending on the level of spatial detail used to examine the issue.  
  At the local scale, Moseley has studied the conserva-
tion behaviors of farmers in southern Mali (Fig 13.15). He 
found that one view that is widely held at the global scale—that poorer people degrade the land more than wealthier people—was not true at the local scale. Through exten-sive ﬁ  eldwork, interviews, and soil surveying, Moseley c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 452  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 452  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
found that poorer farmers in southern Mali were more 
likely to use organic materials to preserve topsoil and that wealthier farmers were more likely to use inorganic fert  i  l-
izers and pesticides. Aside from being able to afford inor-ganic fertilizers, wealthier farmers did so in order to pro-duce cotton more easily. Policies and power relationships at the local, national, and global scales help explain why wealthier farmers in southern Mali produce cotton. For example, the government of Mali’s agricu  l  tural extension 
service singled out the wealthiest households for cotton farming, which “helped these households become even wealthier in the short term.”  
  Population  
  Because humans across the world do not consume or pol-
lute in exactly the same ways, we cannot make a simple chart showing that each additional human born on Earth results in a certain amount of consumption or  pollution. 
We can, howe  v  er, recognize that humans affect the envi-ronment and that a greater number of people on Earth 
translates into a greater capacity for environmental change.  
  Similarly, environmental change inﬂ  uences humans 
differently, depending in part on who they are and 
where they live. T o underscore the spatial differences in environmental impact on humans, we can consider two maps of natural disaster hot spots published by the Earth Institute at Columbia University and the World Bank in a 2005 report. The maps highlight the places in the world most susceptible to natural disasters, whether caused by drought, tectonic activity (earth-quakes and volcanoes), or hydrological h  a  zards (ﬂ  oods, 
cyclones, and landslides) (Fig. 13.16). Comparing the 
map of mortality risk with the map of total economic loss risk demonstrates that when a natural disaster hits a wealthier area, the place will more likely be hit ﬁ  nan-
cially, whereas, in a poorer area of the world, the place will likely be hit by both ﬁ  na  n  cial loss and the loss of 
lives. This relationship was certainly borne out when

  In this photo, a young man brings home the cotton harvest in the vil-
lage of Try in southern Mali. Prior to my graduate studies in geography, I spent a number of years as an international development worker con-cerned with tropical agriculture—both on the ground in Africa and as a policy wonk in Washington, D.C. I drew at least two important lessons from these experiences. First, well-intentioned work at the grassroots level would always be limited if it were not supported by broader scale policies and economics. Second, the people making the policies were often out of touch with the real i  m  pacts their decisions were having in the ﬁ  eld. As such, geography, and the subﬁ  eld of political ecology, were appealing to me because of its explicit attention to processes operat-ing at multiple scales, its tradition of ﬁ  eldwork, and its longstan  d  ing 
attention to human–environment interactions. I employed a political ecology approach during ﬁ  eldwork for my dissert  a  tion in 1999–2000. Here, I sought to test the notion that poor farmers are more likely to degrade soils than their wealthier counterparts (a concept widely pro-claimed in the development policy literature of the 1990s). Not only did I interview rich and poor farmers about their management prac-tices, but I tested their soils and questioned policymakers at the provin-cial, national, and international levels. My ﬁ  ndings (and those of others) have led to a questioning of the poverty–environmental degradation paradigm.

and $XX in damages.   
  Patterns of Consumption  
  We humans rely on Earth’s resources for our very sur-
vival. At the most basic level, we consume water, oxygen, and o  r  ganic and mineral materials. Over time we have 
  developed increasingly complex ways of using resources 
in pursuit of agricultural intensiﬁ  cation and industrial 
production. Consequently, many societies now consume resources at a level and rate that far exceed basic subsi  s-
  tence needs. In a 1996 article on “Humanity’s Resources” 
in   The Companion Encyclopedia of Geography:     The 
Environment and Humankind  , I. G. Simmons notes that 
a hunter-gatherer could subsist on the resources found 
within an area of about 26 square kilometers, whereas today many people living in urban centers in the global economic core have access to r  e  sources from all over the 
planet.  
  Generally, the smaller numbers of people in the parts 
of the world belonging to the global economic core make 
far greater demands on Earth’s resources than do the much larger numbers in the poorer countries. It has been estimated that a baby born in the United States during the ﬁ rst decade of the twenty-ﬁ  rst century, at current rates, 
consumes about 250 times as much energy over a lifetime as a baby born in Bangladesh over the same lifetime. In terms of food, housing, and its comp  o  nents, metals, paper 
(and thus trees), and many other materials, the consump-tion of individuals in afﬂ  uent countries far exceeds that 
of people in poorer countries. Thus, rapid population growth in the periphery tends to have local or regional environmental impacts. Population growth in the core is also a ma  t  ter of concern, one whose impact is not just local 
or regional but global.  
  The foregoing discussion underscores the importance 
of thinking geographically about human impacts on the 
natural world. People living in the global economic periph-ery tend to affect their immediate environment, putting pressure on soil, natural vegetation, and water supplies, and polluting the local air with the smoke from their ﬁ  res. The 
reach of afﬂ  uent societies is much greater. The demand for low-cost meat for hamburgers in the United States has led to deforestation in Central and South America to make way for pastures and cattle herds. In the process, water demand has increased in such areas (T able 13.1). This example shows just one of the many ways in which the American (and European, Japanese, and Australian) consumer has an impact on distant env  i  ronments.  
  Globally, consumption is tied to technology, for (as 
we saw in Chapter 12) the industrialized core has access to 
a vast array of transportation and communication technol-ogies that allow advertisers to stimulate demand for par-ticular goods around the world and allow manufacturers to bring goods from distant places. The growth of wealth over the last ten years in the semi-periphery, including India and China, and their growing middle and upper classes, has i  n  creased the global consumption of con-
sumer goods. For example, in 2008 the Indian company   T ata   (which we talked about at the beginning of Chapter 
4) created the   Nano  , an automobile for the Indian market 
that is priced below $2500.   T ata   plans to produce 250,000 
  Nano   cars a year.  
  T echnological developments have expanded the pro-
duction of consumer goods. Those same developments have 
allowed humans to manipulate atmospheric, land, oceanic, and biological systems in profound ways. Understanding the complex ties between technology and environmental change requires consideration of several different facets of the tec  h  nology picture.  
  Industrial Technology  
  T echnological advances have increased rapidly since the 
Industrial Revolution and today affect all aspects of our lives. We are continually developing technologies that we hope will improve our standard of living, protect us against disease, and allow us to work more efﬁ  ciently. 
These technologies come with a cost. Resource extrac-tion practices such as mining and logging, which pr  o  vide 
the materials to produce technologies, have created severe environmental problems. T echnological innovations have produced hazardous and toxic by-products, creating pol-lution and health problems that we are only now begin-ning to recognize. Most signiﬁ  cant for our discussion of 
global environmental change, however, is the fact that tec  h  nology has enabled humans to alter large portions of 
the planet in a short period of time.  
  There are many dramatic examples of the role of 
industrial technology in environmental change. The 
impacts include degradation of the oceans (oil and gas exploitation and spills, pollution dumping, and massive   overﬁ  shing  ), land surfaces (open pit and mountain top   TABLE 13.1

mining, dams, and irrigation projects), the biosphere 
(deforestation, vegetation loss), and the atmosphere (air po  l  lution).  
  Transportation  
  Changing modes of transportation are a product of some 
of the most important technological advances in human history. Each innovation in transportation has required increased resource use, not only to make the vehicles that move people and goods, but also to build and maintain the related infrastructure—roads, railroad tracks, airports, parking structures, repair facilities, and the like. With each innovation the impacts seem to widen. As David   Headrick   points out in a study discussed in the   Companion 
Encyclopedia of Geography  , Chicago’s O’Hare Airport cov-
ers a larger area (approximately 28 square kilometers or 
17 square miles) than Chicago’s central business district (which covers approximately 8 square kilometers or 5 square miles). Moreover, transportation innovations offer access to remote areas of the planet. There are vehicles that allow people to travel through extreme climates, to the bottoms of the ocean, and across the polar ice caps. These places, in turn, have been altered by human activity.  
  T ransportation is also implicated in global environ-
mental change—albeit sometimes indirectly. Advances 
in transpo  r  tation have produced signiﬁ  cant pollution, as 
seen in the extent of oil spills along major shipping lanes (Fig. 13.17).    T ransportation facilitates the types of global net-
works necessary to sustain the patterns of consump-
tion outlined ea  r  lier. Many of the products available in 
stores—be they electronics or clothing or food—come from distant places. R  e  sources are required to produce 
and ship them, and except those that meet basic subsis-tence needs, they all contribute to the greater strains placed on the environment that come from those living in wealthier parts of the world. This realization has led some individuals to reduce their levels of consumption or to consume more environmentally friendly, locally produced products. These changes have had some effect, but so far their impact on the geography of global consumption has been marginal.  
  Energy  
  Consumption of material goods is closely linked to con-
sumption of energy. It takes energy to produce mate-rial goods, energy to deliver them to markets, and, for many products (such as appliances and automobiles), energy to keep them running. The resulting d  e  mands 
for energy are a factor in environmental change. Much 
of our energy supply comes from nonrenewable fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Moreover, the evolution of tertiary, quaternary, and   quinary   economic 
activities has led to an increase in the consumption of 
nonrenewable resources. As populations grow, so does the d  e  mand for energy, and we can expect that over the ATLANTIC

 What Are the Major Factors Contributing to Environmental Change Today?  457
coming decades energy production will expand to meet 
the increased demand. In developing countries in par-ticular, demands for more energy are met by i  n  creasing 
the development of fossil fuel sources. This helps explain 
why, according to the United States Energy Information Administration, global oil produ  c  tion increased from 
45.89 million barrels per day in 1970 to 85.86 million 
barrels per day in 2010.  
  Oil is a ﬁ  nite resource. It is not a question of   if   the 
world’s oil supply will run out but   when  . Because discov-
eries of new reserves continue to be made, and because 
the extraction of fossil fuels is becoming ever more efﬁ  -
cient, it is difﬁ  cult to predict exactly how much longer oil will remain a viable energy source. Many suggest that the current level of oil co  n  sumption can be sustained for up 
to 100 years, although some argue for much shorter or much longer time frames. D  e  spite the range of opinion, 
the majority of scientists believe that by the middle of this century alternative sources will have to play a much more signiﬁ  cant role than they do now.  
  When one considers that oil could become an 
increasingly scarce commodity within the lifetimes of 
many college students today, the importance of develop-ing alternative energy sources becomes apparent. Adding further urgency to the quest are the pollution problems associated with burning fossil fuels and the geopolitical tensions that arise from global dependence on a resource co  n  centrated in select parts of the world. Moving away 
from a dependence on oil carries with it some clear posi-
tives, but it could lead to wrenching socioeconomic adjust-ments as well.  
  The effects of a shift away from oil will certainly 
be felt to some degree in the industrial and postin-
dustrial countries, where considerable retooling of the economic infrastructure will be necessary. It is the  oil-producing countries, however, that will face the 
grea  t  est adjustments. More than half of the world’s 
oil supply is found in the Middle Eastern countries of 
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Iran. In each of these countries, the extrac-tion and e  x  portation of oil account for at least 75 percent 
of total revenue and 90 percent of export-generated 
income. What will ha  p  pen to these countries when 
their oil reserves run dry?  
  Consider the case of Kuwait—a country in which the 
incomes of 80 percent of the wage earners are tied to oil. 
Kuwait’s citizens are currently guaranteed housing, educa-tion, and health care, and each adult couple receives a one-time stipend when a child is born. All of these programs are provided tax free, and when workers retire, their pensions are close to the salaries they earned as active members of the workforce.  
  Concerns over the long-term implications of a 
decline in oil revenue in Kuwait have led to efforts 
to ﬁ  nd an alternative source of wealth: potable water. In a part of the world that can go for months without rain, water is a most precious r  e  source. Some people in 
Kuwait joke that for each million dollars spent in the 
quest for sources of fresh water, all that is found is a bil-lion dollars worth of oil! But where fresh water cannot be found, it can potentially be made, and Kuwait has begun to position itself to become one of the world’s leaders in the ﬁ  eld of desalinization, the conversion of saltwater to fresh water. This is currently a very expensive pro-cess, but Kuwait is able to devote some of its oil reve-nues to research and development on the desalinization process. Absent a major technological breakthrough, in the short term income generated by desalinization will amount to only a tiny fraction of the income provided by oil production. The long term may be a different story, however. If not, Kuwait—and other countries in its position—will be facing a socioeconomic adjus  t  ment 
of enormous proportions.  
  Alternative Energy  
  T echnology has played a key role in amplifying human-
induced environmental change. At the same time, tech-nologies are being developed to identify and solve envi-ronmental problems. Some of these technologies offer alternative approaches to local energy production. In recent decades, a number of countries have established implementation programs that encourage both the devel-opment of “clean” renewable energy technol  o  gies and 
increased energy efﬁ  ciency in buildings, transportation, 
and manufacturing. Y et even alternative energy sources have environmental effects. At the core of the wind tur-bines that generate “clean” energy are rare earth miner-als, the extraction and processing of which have negative environmental consequences.  
  A single wind turbine (Fig. 13.18) that is made of 
ﬁ berglass, weighs hundreds of metric tons, and stands 90 
meters high “fundamentally relies on roughly 300 kilo-
grams of soft, silvery metal known as neodymium—a so called rare earth” (  Biello   2010, 16). Neodymium is used 
for the powerful magnets in a wind turbine that generate electricity. It is one of 17 elements on the perio  d  ic table 
that are considered rare earth elements.  
    Rare earth elements   are in demand because they 
are used not only in wind turbines but also in alterna-
tive energy cars, computers, screens, compact ﬂ  uo-
rescent light bulbs, cell phones, MRI machines, and advanced weapons systems (  Biello   2010). Rare earth 
elements are found in rock, and 97 percent of rare earth 
elements mined today come from China. The mining is only the ﬁ  rst step because making rare earth elements usable requires separating el  e  ments that are bound 
together in the rock. Hence, once the rocks are mined, 
Chinese companies intensively boil the elements in acid, repeating the process “thousands of times because the c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 457  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 457  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

the   nedymium   from other rare earth elements (  Bie  l  lo   
2010, 17).  
  The chemical processing of rare earth elements uses 
electricity and water and leaves behind chemicals and 
residuals, including thorium (a radioactive metal) and salt. The environmental consequences of rare earth element mining have historically been costly enough that produc-tion stopped at Mountain Pass Mine in California in 2002, in part because of the cost of complying with enviro  n  men-
tal laws in the United States.  
  A combination of looser environmental laws and 
labor costs led to increased production of rare earth ele-
ments in China during the last decade (Fig. 13.19). In Inner Mongolia, China, the extraction of rare earth ele-ments at the   Bayan  -Obo mine alone accounts for 40 per-
cent of the world’s supply. China closed off access to the mine to all outsiders, but the mine’s enormous pits and waste ponds can still be viewed from space and even seen using Google Earth (Fig. 13.20).  
  Because rare earth elements can be used in weap-
ons systems, the United States military blocked the 
sale of Mountain Pass Mine to a Chinese company as a matter of national security. Instead,   Molycorp   bought 
Mountain Pass Mine and has begun extracting rare 
earth elements again. Environmental regulations pre-vent some of the steps in the processing of rare earths from taking place in California. China will likely remain the leading producer of rare earth elements. However, recycling rare earth elements from discarded devices and new mining efforts in the United States, Australia, and Vietnam will likely improve the availability of rare earth elements from sources ou  t  side of China in years 
to come.

 What Policies Are Being Adopted in Response to Environmental Change? 459
  Go back to the last Thinking Geographically question—what 
is the greatest environmental concern facing the region where you live? Now, add to your answer by concentrating on how people in the community (leaders, students, locals, businesses) discuss this environmental concern. Read newspaper accounts of the debate over this environmental concern. Are the actors in this debate thinking and operating at different scales?  
  WHAT POLICIES ARE BEING ADOPTED 
IN   RESPONSE   TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE?  
  The extent and rapidity of recent environmental 
changes have led to the adoption of numerous policies 
aimed at protecting the environment or reversing the negative i  m  pacts of pollution. These policies range from 
local ordinances that restrict urban development in envi-ronmentally sensitive areas to global a  c  cords on topics 
such as biodiversity and climate change.  
  A major challenge in confronting environmental 
problems is that many of those problems do not lie within 
   Figure 13.20

rights reserved.   a single j  u  risdiction. Environmental pollution crosses 
political boundaries, and people sometimes move across 
those boundaries in response to environmental pressures. Designing policy responses is thus complicated by the fact that the political map does not reﬂ  ect the geogra-
phy of env  i  ronmental issues. The problem is particularly 
acute when environmental problems cross international boundaries, for there are few international policymak-ing bodies with signiﬁ  cant authority over multin  a  tional 
environmental spaces. Moreover, those that do exist—the European Union, for example—often have limited authority and must heed the concerns of member states. Those concerns, in turn, may not coincide with the inter-ests of the environment. Within democracies, politicians with an eye to the next election may h  e  sitate to tackle 
long-term problems that require short-term sacriﬁ  ces. 
Most authoritarian regimes have an even worse record, as can be seen in the policies of the Soviet-dominated gov-ernments of eastern Europe during the communist era. Moreover, governmental lea  d  ers in poorer countries ﬁ  nd 
it very difﬁ  cult to take action when, as is often the case, 
action requires reductions in already marginal standards of living and even greater difﬁ  culties in meeting the kinds of debt payments discussed in Chapter 10.  
  Despite these obstacles, the growing extent and 
urgency of global environmental changes have led to a 
number of international agreements to address some severe problems. Some of these have been spearheaded by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that operate outside of the formal political arena. They tend to focus on speciﬁ  c issues and problems, often in particular pla  c  es. 
With the 1972   United Nations Conference on the     Human 
Environment   in Stockholm, international governmental 
organizations began playing a major role in environmen-
tal policy.  
  The framework that currently guides international 
governmental activity in the environmental arena evolved 
from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. The del  e  gates to UNCED gave the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF)—a joint project of the United 
Nations and the World Bank—signiﬁ  cant authority over 
environmental action on a global scale. The GEF funds projects related to six issues: loss of biodiversity, climate change, protection of inte  r  national waters, depletion of 
the ozone layer, land degradation, and persistent organic 
pollutants. The delegates to UNCED believed that sig-niﬁ cant progress could be made through these funded 
projects, along with bilateral (that is, government-to-government) aid. They also made it easier for NGOs to participate in international environmental policymaking.  
  These actions hold the promise of a more coherent 
approach to environmental problem solving than is pos-
sible when decisions are made on a state-by-state basis. Y et individual states continue to inﬂ  uence decision making c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 459  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 459  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

in all sorts of ways. T ake the case of the GEF . Between 
1991 and 2010, the GEF provided $4.5 billion in grants, primarily to projects involving climate change or biodi-versity. Even though the GEF is charged with protecting key elements of the global environment, it still functions in a state-based world, as suggested by Fi  g  ure 13.21—a 
map from a 1994 World Bank technical report on the forest sector in   Subsaharan   Africa that divides the realm 
into “major regions” that follow state, rather than ecologi-
cal borders. Moreover, the GEF nonetheless serves the important role of providing ﬁ  nancial resources to four 
major international conventions on the environment: the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations Framework Convention on Cl  i  mate Change, the United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertiﬁ  cation, and the 
Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Poll  u  tants.  
  A few global environmental issues are so press-
ing that efforts are being made to draw up guidelines for 
action in the form of international conventions or treaties. The most prominent examples are in the areas of biologi-cal diversity, prote  c  tion of the ozone layer, and global 
climate change.    Biological Diversity  
  International concern over the loss of species led to calls 
for a global convention (agreement) as early as 1981. By the beginning of the 1990s, a group working under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Program reached agreement on the wording of the convention, and it was submitted to UNCED for approval. It went into effect in late 1993; as of 2011, 168 countries had signed it. The convention calls for establishing a system of pro-tected areas and a coordinated set of national and inter-national regulations on activities that can have signiﬁ  cant 
negative impacts on biodiversity. It also provides funding for developing countries that are trying to meet the terms of the convention.  
  The biodiversity convention is a step forward in 
that it both afﬁ  rms the vital signiﬁ  cance of preserving 
biological diversity and provides a framework for coop-eration toward that end. However, the agreement has proved difﬁ  cult to implement. In particular, there is an 
ongoing struggle to ﬁ  nd a balance between the need of poorer countries to promote local ec  o  nomic development    Figure 13.21

and the need to preserve biodiversity, which happens 
to be richest in parts of the global economic periph-ery. Also, there has been controversy over the sharing of costs for conservation programs, which has led to heated debates over ratiﬁ  cation of the convention in some countries. Nevertheless, this convention, along with a host of voluntary efforts, has helped to focus attention on the biodiversity issue and to promote the expansion of protected areas. Whether those areas will succeed in providing long-term species protection is an open question that will occupy geographers and biolo-gists for years to come.  
  Protection of the Ozone Layer  
  When found in the troposphere (0 to 16 kilometer or 
1.0 to 10 mile altitude), ozone (O  3  ) gas is a harmful 
pollutant closely associated with the creation of smog. 
However, a naturally occurring   ozone layer   exists in 
the stratosphere (between 30 and 45 kilometer altitude). 
The ozone layer is of vital importance because it pro-tects Earth’s surface from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays. In 1985, a group of British scientists working in Antarctica discovered that the thickness of the ozone layer above the South Pole was dramatically reduced, from 300 Dobson units (  DUs  ) in the 1960s to a  l  most 200 
  DUs   by 1985. Studies revealed that the main culprits in 
ozone depletion were a group of human-made gases col-
lectively known as CFCs (chloroﬂ  uorocarbons). These 
gases, used mainly as refrigerants in ﬁ  re extinguishers 
and in aerosol cans, had only been in use since the 1950s and were thought to be completely harmless to humans. The strength of the scie  n  tiﬁ c evidence pointing to a 
rapid reduction of the ozone layer led to an unusually 
rapid and united international response.  
  International cooperation began in 1985 with 
the negotiation of the   Vienna Convention for the 
Protection of the Ozone Layer  . Speciﬁ  c targets and 
timetables for the phase-out of production and con-
sumption of CFCs were deﬁ  ned and agreed upon as part of the international agreement known as the   Montreal 
Protocol  , which was signed in September 1987 by 105 
countries and the European Community. The original 
agreement called for a 50 percent reduction in the pro-duction and consumption of CFCs by 1999. At a meet-ing in London in 1990, scientiﬁ  c data showing that ozone depletion would continue for many years after a   phaseout   of CFCs led the   signators   of the Montreal 
Protocol to agree to halt CFC production entirely by 
the year 2000. Finally, at a meeting in Copenh  a  gen in 
1992, the timetable for CFC   phaseout   accelerated. Par-
ticipants agreed to eliminate CFC production by 1996 
and to accel  e  rate the   phaseout   of other ozone-depleting 
chemicals such as   halons  ,   hydrochloroﬂ  uorocarbons  , carbon tetrachloride, methyl chlor  o  form, and methyl 
bromide. This response is an encouraging example of 
international cooperation in the face of a signiﬁ  cant, 
albeit clearly d  e  ﬁ ned, problem.  
  Global Climate Change  
  Beginning in the late 1980s, growing concern about cli-
mate change led to a series of intergovernmental con-ferences on the nature and extent of human impacts on climate. In December 1990, the United Nations General Assembly approved the start of treaty negotiations. A draft convention called on developed countries to take measures aimed at r  e  ducing their emissions to 1990 levels 
by the year 2000 and to provide technical and ﬁ  nancial 
support for emission-reduction efforts in the developing countries. The European Comm  u  nity (precursor to the 
European Union) and 154 other states signed the con-vention, commonly called the Earth Summit, in Rio de J  a  neiro.  
  In 1997, the Kyoto Agreement set a target period of 
2008–2012 for the United States, the European Union, 
and Japan to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 7, 8, and 6 percent, respectively, below 1990 levels. The agree-ment reached in Kyoto did not obligate less developed countries to adhere to speciﬁ  c reduction goals; instead it 
called for voluntary emission reduction plans to be imple-mented individually by those countries with ﬁ  nancial 
assistance from industrialized countries.  
  Neither the United States nor China, the world’s 
two largest emitters of carbon dioxide, signed the 
Kyoto Protocol, which is slated to expire in 2012.   The 
United States continues to be the largest producer of 
carbon dioxide emissions, per person, in the world.   The 
United States emitted 19.4 tons of carbon dioxide per 
capita in 2007, and it was followed by the Eur  o  pean 
Union with 8.6 tons, China with 5.1 tons, and India 
with 1.8 tons (Fig. 13.22). However, in 2006, China took the lead as the world’s single largest total emit-ter of carbon dioxide, pushing the United States out of the top spot. The Beijing Olympics in 2008 opened the world’s eyes to the incredibly high emissions level in China (Fig. 13.23).  
  In 2009, the Copenhagen Agreement endorsed the 
continuation of the Kyoto Accord in the wake of a 2007 
report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded that “changes in the atmosphere, the ocean, and glaciers and ice caps now show unequivocally that the world is warming due to human activities.” A total of 141 countries have signed the nonbinding Copenhagen Accord, which states that the countries agre  e  ing to the accord will work to 
keep global temperature increases less than 2 degrees 
Celsius above   preindustrial   levels. With most countries c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 461  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 461  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

continuing to prioritize economic concerns over efforts 
to make serious inroads in the reduction of greenhouse gases, there is much doubt as to whether signiﬁ  cant 
progress will be made in confronting the human role in climate change. Hence, policy makers and scientists are  increasingly focusing their attention on adaptation strat  e  gies.

  Summary  
  What will the future be like? Many would agree with geographer Robert   Kates  , who 
foresees a “warmer, more crowded, more co  n  nected but more diverse world.” As we 
consider this prospect, we must acknowledge that global environmental changes illus-
trate the limits what we know about our planet. Global environmental change is not always anticipated and is often nonlinear. Some changes are “chaotic” in the sense that future conditions cannot be reliably predicted. Nonlinearity means that small actions in certain situations may result in large impacts and may be more important than larger actions in causing change. Thresholds also exist in many systems, which, once past, are irreversible. Irreversible changes occur, for e  x  ample, when the habitat for a species is 
diminished to the point where the species quickly dies off. Unfortunately, we may not be able to identify these thresholds until we pass them. This leaves open the possibility of “surprises”—unanticipated responses by physical sy  s  tems.  
  The complexity and urgency of environmental change will tax the energies of the 
scientiﬁ  c and policy communities for some time to come. Geography must be an essen-
tial part of any serious effort to grapple with these challenges. The major changes that 
are taking place have different origins and spatial expressions, and each results from a unique combination of physical and social processes. We cannot simply focus on sys-tem dynamics and generalized causal relationships. We must also consi  d  er emerging 
patterns of environmental change and the impacts of differences from place to place on the operation of general processes. Geography is not the backdrop to the changes tak-ing place; it is at the very heart of the changes themselves.

  Globalization and the 
Geography of Networks  
  Field Note    Happiness is in the Eye of the Beholder  
  Traveling through a rural village 
in Andhra Pradesh, India, we stopped to take in a weekend morning mar-ket. Women sold spices stored in heaps of col-ored ﬂ  akes; a man had a chair set up and was cutting a li  t  tle boy’s hair; a group of men sold rebar from shops behind vegeta-ble stands. I was used to see-ing the colorful   sarees   and    sa  l  war     kameez   worn by Indian women. Then, an older woman from one of India’s scheduled tribes caught my eye. I ﬁ  rst noticed her clothing. The colors were as bright as any   saree  , but the silver, mirrors, and beads adorning her dress stood out. I looked up at her, our eyes connected, and then she smiled (Fig. 14. 1). I asked if I could take her picture, and she 
nodded yes.  
  I think of her when I am teaching human 
geography. Often, students in their ﬁ  rst college-
level geogr  a  phy class are excited at the end of the semester to have learned so much about the world. Some have had their eyes opened to the world for the ﬁ  rst time as an adult. Others have ﬁ  nally under-
stood the roots of a conﬂ  ict they have only heard 
about on television. And many feel overwhelmed.   Too much information.     Too many people.   Too little they can do to help.

 Happiness is in the Eye of the Beholder  465
  Everyone feels this frustration to some degree, since no one can understand 
all of the complexities that govern life on Earth. But the ideas and perspectives set 
forth in this book give you insight into what it means to think geographically about the world. That type of thinking is critical if you are to raise the types of questions that go beyond the generalizations and stereotypes that can work against deeper understanding.  
  So many books try to simplify the world in an alarmist way. The world is ﬂ  at 
(Thomas Friedman)! There’s a population bomb (Paul Ehrlich)! We live in a post-American world (  Fareed     Zakaria  )! Such books o  f  ten start from an interesting observation, but then overlook how geography affects what is happening.  
  Each of us can attest that the world is anything but ﬂ  at. Millions of people in 
India may be co  m  peting on a more level playing ﬁ  eld with those in North America than was true in the past, but many other mi  l  lions live in a different world that we ignore at our peril. As geographer Yi Fu Tuan said, “People make places.” Each place is an imprint of culture, a reﬂ  ection of diffusion, and a dynamic entity. Each place 
has its own ide  n  tity, which makes it unique.  
  It is important not just to understand that the world is diverse, but to 
appreciate that the uniqu  e  ness of places cuts against the stereotypes that circu-late about them. Many in India do not live in a ﬂ  at world, but that does not mean they are unhappy or are unaffected by the wider world. The image of the tribal woman in India is the counterbalance to the images of the developing world I saw when I was growing up. I remember seeing pi  c  tures of women in remote parts of South America wearing exotic clothing. I also saw television coverage of children in   Subsaharan   Africa with distended stomachs and hunger in their faces. But in these images of the developing world that I saw as a child, no one was smiling.  
  The images I saw growing up formed the identities I had for the developing 
world and people in it. My experiences since then have changed the ways I see the world and my own place in it.  
  The king of Bhutan, a small country nestled in the foothills of the Himalaya 
Mountains, decided that st  a  tistics that calculate the wealth of a country, from gross national income (GNI) to Internet access, did not acc  u  rately measure the state of people’s lives. In the 1970s, the preceding king of Bhutan coined the term gross national happiness, stating that the government needed to focus on achieving happiness instead of focu  s  ing on gross domestic product (GDP). In 2008, the current leader of Bhutan, King   Wangchuck  , r  e  leased a new measure-ment, an index called gross national happiness (GNH) (Fig. 14. 2). King   Wangchuck   explained that measurements such as gross domestic product (GDP) or GNI emphasize production and consumption instead of conservation of resources and environment.  
  The Center for Bhutan Studies measures nine dimensions of happiness and 
calculates a single numerical index reported as GNH. The nine dimensions include measurements of psychological well-being, time use, community vitality, cul-ture, health, education, environmental diversity, living standard, and governance. R  e  gardless of the accuracy of the GNH index, we welcome a critical and reﬂ  ective 
look at how we measure our world.  
  Our hope is that this textbook has helped you think through the ways you 
make sense of the world. In this chapter, we consider how identities have changed in a globalizing world. In an effort to deepen our understanding of globalization, we also examine how ne  t  works operate in our world, in order to encourage you to consider the possibilities for tomorrow.  c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 465  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 465  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400 F-400F-400

We infuse places with meaning and emotions based on 
our experiences in those places. Relatively few people liv-ing in today’s   globalized   world are world tra  v  elers. And

cities, living the lives of businesspeople (vi  s  iting air-
ports, ofﬁ  ce buildings, and hotels), or staying in luxuri-
ous resorts (separated from the “local”) as tou  r  ists. How, 
then, can a person have a global identity if he or she has 
not experienced the globe?  
  Globalization networks link us with other people and 
places, and the ﬂ  ow of information technology is a daily 
way in which we are interlinked with the globe. A person may be overwhelmed by the ﬂ  ow of information and choose to ignore it, but even such a person has a global identity. People identify themselves by identifying with or against others at local, regional, and global scales. As the ﬂ  ow of 
information continues, many people feel a need to make sense of the world by identifying with people and places. People personalize the ﬂ  ow of inform  a  tion, and in so doing 
they feel more connected to the globe and alter their local 
cultural landscapes to reﬂ  ect their feeling of co  n  nectedness.  
  In 1995,   National Geographic   discussed the future of 
the digital age and argued that as a result of technologi-
cal a  d  vances and the Internet, people were interacting in 
person less. However, the author also claimed that people would continue to have “a need for skin,” a desire to inter-act with other humans in person. As evidence, the a  u  thor 
cited how busy a mall is when the people in the mall could just as easily be ordering all of their purchases from home on the Internet.  Tropic of CancerArctic Circle

468 Chapter 14  Globalization and the Geography of Networks
  This discussion of a pull between a faceless Internet 
and the “need for skin” took place nine years before 
Mark   Zuckerberg   created   Facebook   in 2004. People with 
  Facebook   or T witter accounts (see chapter 4) can feel con-
nected without sharing skin by posting a quip or thought, which friends around the world can respond to imme-diately. Psychologists also recognize that the prolifera-tion of reality television shows is connected to d  e  clining 
human interaction through membership in service orga-niz  a  tions and clubs in the United States.  
  In the 1990s, at the launch of the digital revolution, 
psychologists predicted people would have poorer social 
skills because of the lack of personal or face to face inter-action in the digital age. We can certainly see evidence of this in our daily lives, from people answering a phone call or text message when they are in the middle of a conversa-tion with someone in person to   students     texting   or mul-
titasking on laptops during a geography lecture. T oday, 
psychologists recognize that the networks created among people through digital technology also enable greater per-sonal interaction and opportunities for empathy. Someone with medical problems can post a journal on   a cite   such as 
Caring Bridge and hundreds can follow the person’s recov-
ery and offer words of support. A young boy with a medical condition that makes it difﬁ  cult to leave home can post lip 
synched videos on Y ou T ube, develop followers around the world, and end up with recording artists stopping by to lip sync with him. Social networks can be used for good or for ill, but either way, they tend to be a major way by which individ  u  als, in a global, digital age can develop a sense of 
belonging and a personal connectedness to people who are 
separated by computer screens.  
  Personal Connectedness  
  Sixteen years before hundreds of millions around the world 
watched a live feed of the wedding of Price William and Catherine Middleton (chapter 4) on the Internet and on television, the news that Prince William’s mother, Princess Diana, had died traveled quickly from global television, radio, and print media sources among friends, family, and even strangers. Many felt the need to mourn for a prin-cess they had never met in a place they had never been. Some wanted to leave a token offering for the princess: a rose, a note, a candle, a photograph. I  m  promptu shrines 
to Princess Diana cropped up at the British embassy in 
Washington, D.C., and at British emba  s  sies and consulates 
around the world. People in Britain left countless ﬂ  owers at 
the royal palace in London, where Pri  n  cess Diana resided.  
  In an incredibly divided world, in which the rift 
between rich and poor is growing at the global scale, what 
made people feel connected to a woman who represented the royal family ruling over one modest-sized country, an elite group of people of wealth and privilege? What, sixteen years later, made people want to see how her son turned out and “get to know” who he was marrying by watching television programs and reading stories on line and in print about Catherine Middleton leading up to the wedding?
The idea that people around the world are linked and 
have shared experiences, such as death, tragedy, sorrow, and even joy, draws from Benedict Ande  r  son’s concept 
of the nation as an imagined community (see chapter 8). 
When massive tragedies such as 9/11, Hurricane K  a  trina, 
or the Japan tsunami occur, people often talk about some-
one they knew who was in the place (or had been at some point), someone who died (even those they did not know but heard about in the news), or an act of bravery or tri-umph that occurred in the midst of tragedy. The desire to   personalize  , to   localize,   a tragedy or even a joyous event 
feeds off of the imagined global community in which we 
live. In the process of personalizing and localizing, events can be   globalized   in an effort to appeal to the humanity of 
all people with the hope that all will feel or experience the 
loss or joy tange  n  tially.  
  In the case of a death or a tragedy, how do people 
choose a local space in which to express a personal and/
or global sorrow? In a world where some commentators argue that place and territory are unimportant because things like global superhighways of information transcend place, people continue to recognize territories and create places. In the case of Princess D  i  ana’s death, people created 
hundreds of spaces of sorrow to mourn the loss of a seem-
ingly magnanimous person whose life was cut short. In the case of September 11, people tran  s  formed homes, schools, 
public spaces, and houses of worship into spaces of reﬂ  ec-
tion by creating human chains, pa  r  ticipating in moments 
of silence, or holding prayer vigils for the victims.  
  In his book   Shadowed Ground: America’s Landscapes 
of Violence and Tragedy  , Kenneth Foote examines the 
“spontaneous shrines” created at a place of loss or at a 
place that represents loss and describes these spontane-ous shrines as a “ﬁ  rst stage in the commemoration of a disaster.” Foote draws from extensive ﬁ  eld research of lan  d  scapes of tragedy and violence in the United States 
to show how people mark or do not mark tragedy, both 
imm  e  diately with spontaneous shrines and in the longer 
term with permanent mem  o  rials (Fig. 14.3). He exam-
ines the struggles over whether and how to memorialize 
signiﬁ  cant people or experienced tragedy. His research 
focu  s  es on the United States, and after tracing and fol-
lowing the stories of hundreds of people and places, 
Foote concludes that “the debate over what, why, when, and where to build” a memorial for a person or event is “best considered a part of the grieving process.”  
  Foote realized that the ways sites are memorialized 
or not vary over time and across a multitude of circu  m-
  stances, depending on whether funding is available, what 
kind of structure is to be built, who is being reme  m  bered c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 468  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 468  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400 F-400F-400
(only those who died or also those injured?), whether the 
site represents a socially contested event (which often hap-pens when racism is involved), and whether people want to remember the site. In recent American hi  s  tory, major ter-
rorist attacks have been memorialized, often with the word 
“closure” evoked. Oklahoma City permanently memori-alized the site of a terrorist attack at the   Murrah   Federal 
Building on the ﬁ  ve-year annive  r  sary of the tragedy. Other 
tragedies, such as that experienced at the World T rade 
Center in New Y ork City on September 11, 2001, take longer to memorialize. Millions of people have a personal connection to the World T rade Center site, and so choos-ing a design and building a memorial took longer  .  
  The mass of information coming our way each day 
is often overwhelming. As people ﬁ  lter through or ignore 
the ﬂ  ow of information, they may personalize the infor-
mation and either make a connection or differentiate themselves from particular people or pla  c  es. In the end 
many people’s identities are shaped by developments unfolding at the global scale. Living in a world, at a scale we have not experienced previously, changes us and pro-foundly changes places. Globalization, for good or for ill, has modiﬁ  ed how we int  e  ract with one another and has 
shaped how we make  sense of ourselves in our world, our state, our region, and our locality.  
  Think of a national or global-scale tragedy, such as September 11 or World War II. In what ways do memor  i  als of that tragedy reﬂ  ected both globalization and localization at 
the same time?    Guest Field Note  
  Columbine, Colorado  
  I took this photo at the dedica-
tion ceremony for the memorial to the victims of the Columbine High School shooting of April 20, 1999. Columbine is located near Littleton, Colorado, in Denver’s southern suburbs. The memo-rial, dedicated on Se  p  tember 21,2007, provides a quiet place for meditation and reﬂ  ection 
in a public park adjacent to the school. Hundreds came to the ceremony to honor those killed and wounded in the attack, one of the deadliest school shoot-ings in U.S. history.  
  After tragedies like the 
Columbine shootings, creating a memorial often helps to rebuild a sense of community. Pu  b  lic ceremonies like this can set an example for survivors who may otherwise have difﬁ  culty facing 
their loss in private. A group memorial helps to acknowledge the magnitude of the community’s loss and, by so doing, helps assure families and survivors that the victims did not suffer alone—that their deaths and wounds are grieved by the entire community. Memorials are important too because they can serve as a focus for reme  m  brance and commemoration long into the future, even after all other evidence of a tragedy has disappeared.  
  In my research for   Shadowed Ground   I have visited hundreds of such places in the United States and Europe. I am still 
surprised by the power of such places and the fact that shrines and memorials resulting from similar tragedies are tended lovingly for decades, generations, and centuries. They produce strong emotions and som  e  times leave visitors—including me—in tears. But by allowing individuals to share loss, tragedy, and sorrow with others, they create a sense of common pu  r  pose.

470 Chapter 14  Globalization and the Geography of Networks
  WHAT IS GLOBALIZATION, AND 
WHAT ROLE   DO   NETWORKS PLAY IN GLOBALIZATION?  
  Whether you are in favor of or opposed to globaliza-
tion, we all must recognize that globalization is “ne  i  ther 
an inevitable nor an irreversible set of processes,” as John 
  O’Loughlin  , Lynn   Staeheli  , and Edward Greenberg put 
it. Andrew Kirby explains that globalization is “not pro-ceeding according to any particular playbook. It is not a smoothly evolving state of capitalist development.” Rather, it is fragmented, and its ﬂ  ows are “chaotic in terms of origins and destinations.”  
  Globalization   is a “chaotic” set of processes and 
outcomes created by people, be they corporate CEOs, 
unive  r  sity administrators, readers of   blogs  , electrical 
engineers, or protesters at a trade meeting. The processes of globalization and the connectedness created through globalization occur across scales and across networks, r  e  gardless of state borders.  
  The backbone of economic globalization is trade; as 
such, debates over globalization typically focus on trade. 
T o visualize how trade fosters globalization, examine a map of shipping routes (Fig. 14.4). The density of the net-works on the map tells us how extensively connected the world really is. But what are the consequences of those co  n  nections? The arguments in favor of globalization, as 
explained by economist Keith   Maskus  , are that “free trade 
raises the well-being of all countries by inducing them to specialize their resources in those goods they produce relatively most efﬁ  ciently” in order to lower production 
costs, and that “competition through trade raises a coun-try’s long-term growth rate by expanding access to global technologies and promo  t  ing innovation.”  
  This view of free trade underpins what is sometimes 
called the   Washington Consensus   because it is shared by 
the leaders of many international economic institutions 
with ofﬁ  ces in Washington, D.C., including   the World 
Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World 
T rade Organization. Y et not everyone accepts this “co  n-
  sensus.” Indeed, many have questioned its underlying 
assumptions in the wake of the global economic dow  n-
  turn that began in 2008. Opponents view the Washin  g  ton 
Consensus as part of a Western-dominated effort to get the 
rest of the world to privatize state-owned entities, to open ﬁ nancial markets, to liberalize trade by r  e  moving restric-
tions on the ﬂ  ow of goods, and to encourage foreign direct 
investment. (Fig. 14.5) They argue that the countries of 
the global economic core continue to protect their own 
economies while forcing the cou  n  tries of the semi-periphery 
and periphery to open their economies in ways that can    Figure 14.4

 What Is Globalization, and What Role do Networks Play in Globalization?   471
have signiﬁ  cant negative l  o  cal consequences. According 
to   Maskus  , the rules negotiated for the World T rade 
Organization “inevitably r  e  ﬂ ect the economic interest of 
powerful lobbyists” in places such as the United States 
and the European Union, and have heightened wealth dif-ferences between more and less prosperous regions, and strengthened an inhe  r  ently unequal global system.  
  However one views these arguments, the globalizing 
trends of the last few decades mean that we are, in many 
respects, living on an unprecedented scale. In Andrew Kirby’s words, we are living “not so much in a world without   boundaries, or in a world without geography—  but   more lit-
erally in a world  , as opposed to a neighbo  r  hood or a region” 
(emphasis added).   
  Networks  
  Manuel   Castells   deﬁ nes   networks   as “a set of intercon-
nected nodes” without a center. A nonhierarchical ne  t-
  work is horizontally structured, with power shared among 
all participants and ideas ﬂ  owing in all directions. The 
multitude of networks th  at exist in the world—ﬁ  nancial, 
transportation, communication, kinship, corporate, non-
governmental, trade, government, media, education, social and dozens of others—enable globalization to o  c  c  ur 
and create a higher degree of interaction and interde-pendence among people than ever before in human hi  s-
  tory. But there are deeply entrenched hierarchies in the networks that knit together the contemporary world, and 
these affect the character of different places and the inter-actions among them.  
  While networks have always existed,   Castells   says 
that they have fundamentally changed since 1995 as a 
result of the diffusion of information technology that links places in a global, yet uneven, way. Through infor-mation technology networks,   Ca  s  tells   argues that global-
ization has proceeded by “linking up all that, according to dominant interests, has value anywhere in the planet, and discarding anything (people, ﬁ  rms, territories, r  e  sources) 
which has no value or becomes devalued.” Information tec  h  nology networks link some places more than others, 
helping to create the spatial unevenness of globalization as well as the uneven outcomes of globa  l  ization.  
  Time–Space Compression  
  Access (or lack of access) to information technology net-
works creates time–space compression (chapters 1 and 4). Time–space compression means that certain places, such as global cities (especially in the core), are more i  n  tercon-
nected than ever through communic  a  tion and transpor-
tation networks, even as other places, such as those in the 
periphery, are farther removed than ever. According to   Castells  , the age of information technology ne  t  works has 
been more revolutionary than the advent of the printing 
press or the Industr  i  al Revolution. He claims that we are   Field Note  
  “ ‘You cannot come to southern Brazil without see-
ing our biggest city,’ said the vintner who was showing me around the   Cooperativa   Aurora, the huge winery in Bento   Gonçalves  , in the State of Rio Grande do   Sul  . ‘B  e  sides, it’s January, so they’ll be ha  v  ing the big marches, it’s almost like carnival time in Rio!’  
  So I headed for Porto   Alegre  , only to ﬁ  nd that a 
hotel room was not to be had. Tens of thousands of dem-onstr  a  tors had converged on the State’s capital, largest port, and leading industrial city—and what united them was opposition to globaliz  a  tion.  
  It was not quite a carnival, but the banners held 
aloft by the noisy, sometimes singing and dancing dem-onstr  a  tors left no doubt as to their common goals.  
  The World Social Forum has become an annual 
event held in cities around the world, with ever-larger marches and meetings to protest the actions of the world’s dominant states, especially the United States. The World S  o  cial F  o  rum is a network of   antiglobalizationists  —people 
who seek an alternative economic reality for the globe, one not centered on accumulation of capital. Socialist ec  o  nomic vie ws, 
leftist political leanings, and support for minority causes combine each year at the World Social Forum in a show of strength.”

472 Chapter 14  Globalization and the Geography of Networks
just at the beginning of this age “as the Internet becomes 
a universal tool of interactive communic  a  tion, as we shift 
from computer-centered technologies to network-diffused 
technologies, (and) as we make pr  o  gress in nanotechnol  o  gy 
(and thus in the diffusion capacity of information devices).”  
  A major divide in access to information technology—
sometimes called the   Digital Divide  —is both a hall-
mark of the current world and an example of the 
uneven outcomes of globalization. The International T elecommun  i  cations Union reported the levels of digital 
access for developing and developed regions of the world. In 2010, the International T elecommunications Union reported that on a  v  erage developed (high income) states 
had 41.6 telephone connections, 114.2 cellular connec-tions, and 68.8 Internet users for every 100 people. On average, developing (low income) states had 11.9 tele-phone connections, 70.1 cellular connections, and 21.1 Internet u  s  ers for every 100 people.  
  The quickening pace of technological change is 
another hallmark of globalization and magniﬁ  es the 
global technological divide. We may be shocked to see 
how quickly technology has changed and diffused. In

 What Is Globalization, and What Role do Networks Play in Globalization?   473
1992, the highest income states had on average only 10 
cellular subscribers and 2.5 Internet users per 1000 people (co  n  trasted with 849 and 571, respectively, in 2005).  
  Global Cities  
  Time–space compression has helped to create and rein-
force a network of highly linked global cities. In Chapter 9, we discussed the growth of   global cities   in the core, semi-
periphery, and periphery of the globe and the growth in 
their connectedness. We considered research published by geographers in the Globalization and World Cities group based in the United Kingdom, who use network analyses to examine levels of connectivity among cities, based on such factors as air travel between cities, and the interpenetration of ﬁ  nancial and a  d  vertising networks.  
  The  se   researchers generated data for 315 global 
cities. They measured the information technology ﬂ  ows 
among the cities by tracking the ﬂ  ow of advanced ser-
vices among the cities, focusing on accounting, advertis-
ing, ban  k  ing/ﬁ  nance, insurance, law, and management 
consulting. Figure 14.6 shows the 30 cities they found to

be most connected to New Y ork City, as measured by the 
ﬂ ow of producer serv  ices. By tracking ﬂ  ows, the authors 
found that Miami, not Los Angeles, is the U.S. city most 
closely linked to Latin America and New Y ork is the sec-ond most   globally   linked city in the world (behind London 
and ahead of T okyo). Chicago is also a highly ranked 
member of the global city network, coming in seventh. The researchers found that New Y ork and Chicago stand apart from other world cities in that these American cit-ies have greater domestic linkages than global cities in the Paciﬁ  c Rim or the European Union.  
  The linkages among global cities provide insights into 
the spatial character of the networks that underlie   globa  l  ized   
processes. A multitude of   globalized   processes such as ﬁ  nan-
cial transactions and ﬂ  ows (represented here by banking/
ﬁ nance and accounting) occur across the network of global 
cities. Similarly, this network reﬂ  ects the ﬂ  ow of advertising and marketing consultation services, which in turn reﬂ  ects 
the ﬂ  ow of ideas through the media across the globe.  
  Castells   claims that the age of information technology is more revolutionary than either the advent of the printing press or the Industrial Revolution. Do you agree with him?

  HOW DO NETWORKS OPERATE 
IN A GLOBALIZED WORLD?  
  The term   network   deﬁ  nes any number of   interlink-
ages   across the globe, whether transportation, educational, 
ﬁ      nancial, or social. In this section we examine three types 
of networks in the world today: those designed to promote 
a social end  ,   those concerned with the development and 
dissemination of information, and those that underlie eco-
nomic exchange. We consi  d  er both the global and local or 
regional scales of activity for each type of network. Within 
each type, nodes interact at a global scale, and ind  i  viduals 
have created their own local or regional networks, often in 
response to the network operating at the glo  b  al scale.  
  Networks with a Social Focus  
  In the spring awakening of 2011, Egyptians rose up to pro-
test government repression by President   Hosni     Mub  a  rak  , 
who had ruled the country for 29 years. Protests rose 
around North Africa and Southwest Asia, from T un  i  sia to Y emen to Iran to Syria and to Libya. Several factors 
prompted the revolutions in the region. In T unisia, a young man named Hamada Ben   Amor   took the stage name of El 
  Général   and posted videos on   Y ouT ube   and   Facebook   of 
rap songs he wrote in protest of his president and the cor-
ruption rampant in his government (see chapter 4). During protests in Egypt in spring 2011, El   Général’s   anthems 
caught hold and inspired Egyptians to pr  o  test, as well.  
  Social networks  , especially   Facebook   and T witter, 
were credited with making revolutions in T unisia and 
Egypt possible.   First, through protest rap music and sec-
ondly by constructing and carrying out plans for protest.   
In Egypt, a Google employee anonymously created a 
  Facebook   page titled “We are all   Khaled   Said” in honor of a 
young Egyptian businessman who was beaten and killed by 
two police ofﬁ  cers. The page garnered 473,000 supporters, and it “helped spread the word about the demonstrations in Egypt,   which   were ignited after a revolt in neighboring 
T unisia toppled the government there.”   (Preston 2011, 1).  
  Rap or hip hop music   were   powerful commonalities 
among protestors in large part because Islam, the pre-
dominant religion in the region, instructs followers to learn the Arabic language (chapters 6 and 7). El   Général’s   
raps, spoken in Arabic, were readily understood by Arabic 
speakers around the region. In Ar  a  bic, El   Général   rapped, 
“My president, your country is dead/ People eat garbage/
Look at what is happening/Misery everywhere/  Nowhere   
to sleep/I’m speaking for the people who suffer/Ground 
under feet.” Another reason El   Général’s   rap music dif-
fused quickly through North Africa and Southwest Asia 
was its simplicity and its ability to be ﬁ  lmed and posted 
with little production cost.  
  Participatory Development  
  Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are nonproﬁ  t 
institutions outside of formal governance structures that 
are established to promote particular social or humanitar-ian ends. Each NGO is a social network, where people with like interests communicate to achieve a goal. A sizeable community of NGOs is concerned with develo  p  ment, and 
in recent decades they have propagated a web of global net-
works in response to the top-down dec  i  sion making (e.g., 
structural adjustment loans) coming from global organi-
zations dom  i  nated by the major state-tied development 
institutions (e.g., the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund). As a result of their networks, NGOs have considerable inﬂ  uence on the deve  l  opment landscape.  
  NGO development networks serve as a counter-
balance to the power of the major decision makers in the 
world. The stated goal of many development-oriented NGOs is to include the voices of the poor and those directly a  f  fected by development, permitting them to 
express their opinions and lifestyles. Some NGOs have been crit  i  cized for falling far short of this goal, but devel-
opment networks now make it possible for NGOs in c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 474  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 474  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400 F-400F-400
 How Do Networks Operate in a Globalized World?  475
different parts of the world to work together to reach a 
consensus on how to achieve economic development and to r  e  spond to crises. The power of these networks was 
very much in evidence in the wake of the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, when NGOs from far-ﬂ  ung parts of 
the globe cooperated in an effort to respond to the cr  i  sis.  
  Despite the goal of sharing power across a network, 
most development networks (like other networks) have 
power differences within them. Indeed,   Leroi   Henry, 
Giles Mohan, and Helen   Yanacopulos   ﬁ nd that power 
r  e  lationships exist both within and between networks—
often privileging the views of NGOs in the core, as opposed to those in the periphery.  
  A growing number of development entities are pro-
moting local solutions to development.   Participatory 
deve  l  opment  —the idea that locals should be engaged in 
deciding what development means for them and how to 
achieve it—is another response to top-down decision mak-ing. Stuart   Corbridge   has studied how the global push for 
participatory development has encouraged the government 
of India to enact participatory development pr  o  grams. 
  Corbridge   and his colleague Sanjay Kumar describe the 
goal of participatory development as giving the people 
who are directly affected by policies and programs a voice in making the policies and programs—that is, to use local networks to shape development for local goals. Kumar and   Corbridge   found that “[t]here can be no doubting the sin-
ce  r  ity of” participatory development programs “to engage 
the rural poor” in India. However, they also found that 
local politics factor into the distribution of poverty allevia-tion schemes because richer farmers and elites in rural areas tend to be most involved with develo  p  ment program.  
  This situation is a failure not of development, they 
maintain, but rather of the deﬁ  nition of success. The goal 
of the program they studied in India was to get seeds to 
farmers and to create irrigation schemes. The pr  o  gram 
has succeeded in this respect for many farmers, though not for the poorest farmers. Their lack of pa  r  ticipation is 
not a reason to abandon the participatory program, how-ever. According to Kumar and   Corbridge  , the program 
(like other participatory development programs) has to “operate in an environment that is dom  i  nated by bet-
ter off farmers and particular community groups.” They argue that the deﬁ  nition of success must change because development organizations cannot expect the poorest to “participate in groups that have little meaning for them.”  
  The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, 
and even state governments are increasingly embrac-
ing the ideal of participatory development, loosening demands for trade liberalization in the periphery and semi-periphery. As Kumar and   Corbridge   explain, poli-
tics will enter participatory development, just as it enters the development networks and the global development organizations. The goal of participatory development is worthwhile, even if the short-term results do not mesh with Western concepts of success.    Networks and Information  
  The global diffusion of products and ideas associated 
with popular culture depends largely on   globalized   media 
and retail store networks, as well as the advertising prac-tices in which both engage. T oday’s media encompasses much more than print, radio, and telev  i  sion; also part 
of the picture are spaces of entertainment, such as the New Amsterdam Theater in Times Square in New Y ork (owned by Disney); songs produced under record labels like RCA, Jive, and BMG (all owned by Bertelsmann); games played on PlayStation (owned by Sony); movie i  n  formation disseminated through   MovieFone   and online 
directions to movie theaters that can be found through   MapQuest   (both owned by Time-Warner, as is the New 
Line Cin  e  ma movie you chose to see).  
  Through a series of mergers and consolidations 
occurring mostly in the post–Cold War era, global media 
are controlled largely by six globe-spanning corporations: Time-Warner, Disney, Bertelsmann, Viacom, News Co  r  poration, and   Vivendi   Universal. These six m  e  dia 
corporations (along with other media corporations) are masters of   vertical integration  . A vertically integrated 
corporation is one that has ownership in all or most of the 
points along the production and consumption of a com-modity chain.  
  In a 2003 report, Miguel Mendes Pereira noted 
that media companies compete for three things:   con-
tent, deli  v  ery  , and   co  n  sumers  . Through consolidation and 
mergers, vertically integrated global media companies 
such as the Walt Disney Corporation (Fig. 14.7) con-trol content (through ownership of production compa-nies, radio shows, television stations, ﬁ  lm pr  o  ducers, and 
publishers) and delivery (through ownership of radio, 
television stations, magazines, and movies). Delivery of content also refers to the infrastructure of technology—the pr  o  prietary technologies used for creating and shar-
ing digital media. Vertical integr  a  tion also helps media 
giants attract and maintain customers through   synergy  , 
or the cross promotion of vertically integrated goods. 
For e  x  ample, within the vertical integration of Disney, 
you can visit Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom to 
catch the Festival of the Lion King, based on the Disney Theatrical Production that was based on the Walt Disney Picture.  
  Vertical integration of media changes the geog-
raphy of the ﬂ  ow of ideas around the globe by limiting 
the ult  i  mate number of   gatekeepers  , that is, people or 
corporations with control over access to information. A 
gat  e  keeper can choose not to tell a story and the story will 
not be heard. Some are concerned, then, that the consol  i-
  dation of media is resulting in fewer ultimate gatekeepers. 
The big media conglomerates, in this view, have b  e  come 
the ult  i  mate gatekeepers. Or we can focus on the com-
petition for customers and the proliferation of sources of delivery for media (the vast number of cable television c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 475  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 475  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400 F-400F-400
476 Chapter 14  Globalization and the Geography of Networks
channels, radio stations, Internet sources, and magazines) 
and argue that there are more gatekeepers in the world today. The diversity of media outlets su  p  ports the latter 
proposition, with television channels geared to speciﬁ  c 
segments (or markets) of the population. For example, both the wide-reaching Al-  Jazeera   sate  l  lite television 
station and the new cable channels in the United States 
that are targeted toward Muslim Americans are geared 
to speciﬁ  c segments of the global or U.S. popul  a  tion.  
  Blogs  
  Historically, governments and journalists had the abil-
ity to be strong gatekeepers by choosing what stories to release or tell. T oday, with the extraordinary growth of   blogs   (“web logs”) on the Internet (upwards of 8 mi  l  lion 
in 2004 and over 133 million in 2010), tight   gatekeeping   
is much more difﬁ  cult. A   blog   allows individuals, without 
cost, to post thoughts, photographs, and exp  e  riences, and 
to create links to websites or other   blogs  .   Blogs are local, 
regional, national or global networks that respond to and 
stand separate from global media networks.     
  Anyone with access to the Internet can read a   blog-
ger’s   postings and comment on them.   Blogger  , the origi-
nal   blog   site created by the small company   Pyra   Labs in 
1999, was sold to Google. Media giants are ﬁ  nding their 
way into the   blogosphere   (as the   blog   space of the Internet 
is called) with sites such as MSN spaces and AOL journals. 
The   blog   site hosts your   blog   for free and provides a for-
mat for your   blog  , so that you need know next to nothing 
about website publishing.   Blogs   inﬂ  uence elections, and 
they help generate interest in particular st  o  ries and events.  
  Networks and Economic Exchange  
  Unlike major media corporations that are vertically 
integrated—with ownership of relevant suppliers and pr  o  ducers—major retail corporations are typically hori-
zontally integrated. A horizontally integrated corpora-
tion is one that acquires ownership of other corpor  a  tions 
engaged in similar activities. The retail industry may appear 
to be dominated by a large number of different companies; however, many retail companies bearing different names are in fact owned by the same horizontally integrated pa  r  ent corporation.  
  Horizontal integration   means that when you shop 
for similar products in different places or across a mall, 
your dollars often support the same parent corporation. If you go to the mall to buy a pair of jeans, your choice to shop at   Banana Republic  , the Gap, and Old Navy sends 
your dollars to the same parent company. And your choice 
to take a break at the food court to drink a Gatorade, eat a bag of Doritos, and buy a Quaker granola bar also sends your dollars to the same parent corporation (in this case, Peps  i  Co). Y ou might wonder when T aco Bell started selling DISNEY VERTICAL INTEGRATION

  Analyzing the global consolidation of media, the 
global networking of NGOs concerned with develop-
ment, and the global presence of retail corporations helps us see the diversity of global networks, with some i  n  creas-
ingly centralized and others increasingly disaggregated. Aside from the spatial characteristics of the network itself, what is interesting for geographers is the impact of these networks on local places, for   globa  l  ized   networks do not 
affect individual places in the same way. People interact with the global network, sha  p  ing it, resisting it, embracing 
it, and re  s  ponding to globalization in unique ways.  
  Community-Supported Agriculture  
  In the von   Thunen   model (Chapter 11), farms surrounded 
urban areas in a regular pattern and provided fresh food to the people in the cities by bringing their products to mar-
kets in the cities. With the industrialization of agriculture (chapter 11), the distance between farmers and co  n  sumers 
has increased, ﬁ  guratively and literally. Consumers often 
do not consider the source of their food, and some pro-
cessed foods look so little like natural foods that it is all too easy to forget farmers were involved in producing the food. Container ships and refrige  r  ated trucking and ship-
ping (chapter 12) now allow consumers in cold regions of the world in winter months to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables grown thousands of miles away, in warmer cli-mates. In 2007, when the United States co  n  ducted its last 
Census of Agriculture, it found the number of principal operators of farms in the United States had grown by 4 percent, to 2.2 mi  l  lion people. According to geographer 
Steven Schnell, one of the reasons the number of farm-ers in the United States has increased is the growth in the number of   community-supported agriculture   groups, 
known as   CSAs   (Fig. 14. 8). Schnell explains that   CSAs

  CSAs   in the contiguous United States, 2011.     Schnell (2007) found that   CSAs   are more 
likely to be found in urban or suburban areas where people have higher levels of education and 
are actively involved in discussing politics.     Courtesy of  : L  o  cal Harvest.org  c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 477  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 477  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400 F-400F-400

began in Japan in the 1960s when a group of women “dis-
satisﬁ  ed with imported, processed, and pesticide-laden 
food, made arrang  e  ments directly with fa  r  mers to provide 
natural, organic, local food for their tables.”  
  From its hearth in Japan,   CSAs   diffused to Europe 
and then to the United States. The ﬁ  rst CSA in the United 
States was in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts. By 2011, the number of   CSAs   in the United States had 
risen to over 4000 according to Local Harvest, an orga-nization that maps   CSAs   to help consumers and farmers 
connect (Fig. 14.9).  
  Through a CSA, a farmer and consumers create a 
network whereby both assume risk. Consumers pay for a 
share of the farmer’s harvest, typically fruits and vegeta-bles, before the growing season begins. Farmers use the cash to purchase seed and plant and then deliver goods to consumers over a period of weeks during the growing season. Both Schnell and Local Harvest agree that CSA farmers typically use organic growing standards (cha  p  ter 
11) but do not take the time to certify their land and pro-
duce as organic.

  Summary  
  Globalization has been compared to a runaway train blowing through stations leaving 
much of the world to stare at its caboose. Y et this description is not entirely accurate. Globalization is a series of processes, not all of which are headed in the same direction. Even those processes headed down the globalization track are often stopped, sent back to the previous station, or derailed. The globalization track is not inevitable or irrevers-ible (in the words of   O’Loughlin  ,   Staeheli  , and Greenberg). Many of the most important 
global  i  zation processes take place within networks of global cities (see chapter 9), of 
places linked by popular culture (see chapter 4), of gover  n  ments (see chapter 8), of trade c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 478  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 478  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400 F-400F-400

MapsAAPPENDIX
The geographer’s greatest ally is the map. Maps can 
 present enormous amounts of information very effectively, 
and can be used to establish theories and solve problems. Furthermore, maps often are fascinating, revealing things no other medium can. It has been said that if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a map is worth a million.
Maps can be fascinating, but they often do not get the 
attention they deserve. Y ou may spend 20 minutes care-fully reading a page of text, but how often have you spent 20 minutes with a page-size map, studying what it reveals? It is difﬁ  cult to summarize every pattern a map shows in a 
caption or paragraph of text. Readers should actively read maps by looking for patterns and themes. For example, in chapter 2 on population we study several maps that depict the human condition by country, including birth and death rates, infant mortality, hunger index, and life expectancy. In the text, we can refer only to highlights (and low points) on those maps. But make a point of looking beyond the main issue to get a sense of the global distributions these maps represent. It is part of an intangible but important process: to enhance your mental map of the world.
While on the topic of maps, we should remind our-
selves that a map—any map—is an incomplete representa-tion of reality. In the ﬁ  rst place, a map is smaller than the real world it represents. Second, it must depict the curved surface of our world on a ﬂ  at plane, for example, a page of this book. And third, it contains symbols to convey the in-formation that must be transmitted to the reader. These are the three fundamental properties of all maps: scale, projec-tion, and symbols.
Understanding these basics helps us interpret maps 
while avoiding their pitfalls. Some maps look so convinc-ing that we may not question them as we would a para-graph of text. Y et maps, as representatives of the world all, to some extent, distort reality. Most of the time, such dis-tortion is necessary and does not invalidate the map’s mes-sage. But some maps are drawn deliberately to mislead. Propaganda maps, for example, may exaggerate or distort reality to promote  political aims. We should be alert to 
 cartographic mistakes when we read maps. The proper 
use of scale, projection, and symbolization ensures that a map is as  accurate as it can be made.
MAP SCALE
The scale of a map reveals how much the real world 
has been reduced to ﬁ  t on the page or screen on which it appears. It is the ratio between an actual distance on the ground and the length given to that distance on the map, using the same units of measurement. This ratio is often represented as a fraction (e.g., 1:10,000 or 1/10,000). This means that one unit on the map represents 10,000 such units in the real world. If the unit is 1 inch, then an inch on the map represents 10,000 inches on the ground, or slightly more than 833 feet. The metric system certainly makes things easier. One centimeter on the map would actually represent 10,000 cm or 100 meters. Such a scale would be useful when mapping a city’s downtown area, but it would be much too large for the map of an entire state. As the real-world area we want to map gets larger, we must make our map scale smaller. As small as the fraction 1/10,000 seems, it still is 10 times as large as 1/100,000, and 100 times as large as 1/1,000,000. If the world maps in this book had fractional scales, they would be even smaller. A large-scale map can contain much more detail and be far more representative of the real world than a small-scale map. Look at it this way: when we devote a half page of this book to a map of a major city (Fig. A.1), we are able to represent the layout of that city in considerable detail. But if the entire country in which that city is located must be represented on a single page, the city becomes just a large dot on that small-scale map, and the detail is lost in favor of larger-area coverage (Fig. A.2). So the selection of scale depends on the objective of the map.

A-2 Maps
But when you examine the maps in this book, you 
will note that most, if not all, of them have scales that are 
not given as ratios or fractions, but in graphic form. This method of representing map scale is convenient from sev-eral viewpoints. Using the edge of a piece of paper and marking the scale bar’s length, the map reader can quickly—without calculation—determine approximate distances. And if a map is enlarged or reduced in reproduction, the scale bar is enlarged or reduced with it and remains accu-rate. That, of course, is not true of a ratio or fractional scale. Graphic scales, therefore, are most common in this book.
MAP PROJECTIONS
For centuries cartographers have faced the challenge 
of creating map projections, ways representing the spheri-cal Earth, or part of it, on a ﬂ  at surface. T o get the job done, there had to be a frame of reference on the globe itself, a grid system that could be transferred to the ﬂ  at page. Any modern globe shows that system: a set of horizontal lines, usually at 10-degree intervals north and south from the equator, called parallels, and another set of vertical lines, converging on the poles, often shown at 15-degree inter-vals and called meridians (see box, “Numbering the Grid Lines”). On the spherical globe, parallels and meridians intersect at right angles (Fig. A.3).
Numbering the Grid Lines
When cartographers girdled the globe with their imagi-nary grid lines, they had to identify each line by number, that is, by degree. For the (horizontal) latitude lines, that was easy: the equator, which bisects the Earth midway between the poles, was designated as 0
/H11034 (zero degree) 
latitude, and all parallels north and south of the equator were designated by their angular position (Fig. A.3). The ⛪

parallel midway between the equator and the pole, thus, 
is 45/H11034 north latitude in the northern hemisphere and 45 /H11034 
south latitude in the southern hemisphere.
But the (vertical) longitude lines presented no such 
easy solution. Among the parallels, the equator is the only one to divide Earth into equal halves, but all meridians do this. During the second half of the nineteenth century, maps with conﬂ  icting numbers multiplied, and it was clear that a solution was needed. The most powerful country at the time was Britain, and in 1884, international agreement was reached whereby the meridian drawn through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, would be the prime meridian, 0
/H11034 (zero degree) longitude. All meridians east 
and west of the prime meridian could now be designated by number, from 0
/H11034 to 180 /H11034 east and west longitude.
But what happens when these lines of latitude (paral-
lels) and longitude (meridians) are drawn to intersect at right angles on a ﬂ  at piece of paper? At the equator, the 
representation of the real world is relatively accurate. But go toward the poles, and distortion grows with every de-gree until, in the northern and southern higher latitudes, the continents appear not only stretched out but also misshaped (Fig. A.4). Because the meridians cannot be made to converge in the polar areas, this projection makes Antarctica look like a giant, globe-girdling landmass.
Looking at this representation of the world, you might 
believe that it could serve no useful purpose. But in fact, the Mercator projection, invented in 1569 by Gerardus Mercator, a Flemish cartographer, had (and has) a very par-ticular function. Because parallels and meridians cross (as they do on the spherical globe’s grid) at right angles, direc-tion is true everywhere on this map. Thus the Mercator pro-jection enabled navigators to maintain an accurate course at sea simply by adhering to compass directions and plotting straight lines. It is used for that purpose to this day.
The spatial distortion of the Mercator projection 
serves to remind us that scale and projection are intercon-nected. What scale fraction or graphic scale bar could be used here? A scale that would be accurate at the equator on a Mercator map would be quite inaccurate at higher latitudes. So the distortion that is an inevitable byproduct of any map projection also affects map scales.
One might imagine that the spatial (areal) distor-
tion of the Mercator projection is so obvious that no one would use it to represent the world’s countries. But in fact, many popular atlas maps (Mercator also intro-duced the term atlas to describe a collection of maps) and wall maps still use a Mercator for such purposes. The National Geographic Society published its world maps on a Mercator projection until 1988, when it ﬁ  nally aban-
doned the practice in favor of a projection developed by the American cartographer Arthur Robinson (Fig. A.5). During the news conference at which the change was an-nounced, a questioner rose to pursue a point: Why had the Society waited so long to make this change? Was it because the distortion inherent in the Mercator projec-tion made American and European middle-latitude coun-tries large, compared to tropical countries in Africa and elsewhere? Although that was not the goal of the National Geographic Society, the questioner clearly understood the misleading subtleties inherent even in so apparently neutral a device as a map projection.
The Mercator projection is one of a group of pro-
jections called cylindrical projections. Imagine the globe’s lines of latitude and longitude represented by a wire grid, at the center of which we place a bright light. Wrap a piece of photographic paper around the wire grid, extending it well beyond the north and south poles, ﬂ  ash the bulb, and the photographic image will be that of a Mercator pro-jection (Fig. A.6). We could do the same after placing a cone-shaped of paper over each hemisphere, touching the grid, say, at the 40th parallel north and south; the result would be a conic projection (Fig. A.7). If we wanted a map of North America or Europe, a form of conic projection would be appropriate. Now the meridians do approach each other toward the poles (unlike the Mercator projec-tion), and there is much less shape and size distortion. And if we needed a map of Arctic and Antarctic regions, we would place the photographic paper as a ﬂ  at sheet against the North and South Poles. Now the photographic image would show a set of diverging lines, as the meridians do from each pole, and the parallels would appear as circles (Fig. A.8). Such a planar projection is a good choice for a map of the Arctic Ocean or the Antarctic continent.
Projections are chosen for various purposes. Just as the 
Mercator is appropriate for navigation because direction is true, other projections are designed to preserve areal size, keep distances real, or maintain the outlines (shapes) of land-masses and countries. Projections can be manipulated for many needs. In this book, we examine global distributions of

various phenomena. The world map that forms the base for 
these displays is one that is designed to give prominence to land areas at the expense of the oceans. This is achieved by “interrupting” the projection where loss of territory (in this case water area) is not problematic.
When a map is planned, therefore, the choice of 
projection is an important part of the process. An inap-propriate selection may weaken the effectiveness of a map and may lead to erroneous interpretations. Of course, the problem diminishes when the area to be mapped is smaller and the scale larger. We may consider various alternatives when it comes to a map of all of North America, but a map of a single State presents far fewer potential problems of distortion. And for a city map—even of a large city such as Chicago—the projection problem virtually disappears.
The old problem of how to represent the round Earth 
on a ﬂ  at surface has been attacked for centuries, and there is no single best solution. What has been learned in the pro-cess, however, will be useful in ﬁ  elds of endeavor other than Earthly geography. In the age of planetary exploration, space probes send back images of the surfaces of the Moon, Mars, Jupiter, and other components of our solar system, and we will have to agree once again on grids, equators, and prime meridians to map these bodies. What has been learned in our efforts to map and represent the Earth will be useful in depicting the universe beyond. Figure A.4
Mercator’s Projection greatly exaggerates the size and shape of higher-latitude landmasses, 
but direction is true everywhere on this map. In this Mercator map of the world, Africa and Greenland look to be about the same size, but in reality, Africa is 14 times larger than Greenland.160°E 0° 20°W 40°W 60°W 80°W 100°W 120°W 140°W 160°W 140°E 120°E 100°E 80°E 60°E 40°E 20°E

SYMBOLS ON MAPS
The third fundamental property of a map is its sym-
bolization. Maps represent the real world, and this can be 
done only through the use of symbols. Anyone who has used an atlas map is familiar with some of these symbols: prominent dots (perhaps black or red) for cities; a large dot with a circle around it, or a star, for capitals; red lines for roads, double lines for four-lane highways, black lines for railroads; and patterns or colors for areas of water, forest, or farmland. Notice that these symbols respectively represent points, lines, and areas on the ground. For our purposes, we need not go further into map symbolization, which can become a very complex topic when it comes to highly

 specialized cartography in such ﬁ  elds as geology and me-
teorology. Nevertheless, it is useful to know why symbols such as those used on the maps in this book were chosen.
Point symbols, as we noted, are used to show individ-
ual features or places. On a large-scale map of a city, dots can represent individual houses or locations of businesses. A dot map shows a spatial distribution, such as the distribution of Starbucks coffee shops in Washington, D.C. (Fig. A.9).

A July 2005 story in the Washington Post reported a corre-
lation between income and Starbucks locations in the city. Starbucks are clustered around federal and corporate build-ings downtown and in northwest neighborhoods, where  incomes are higher (see Fig. 1.17). Lower income neighbor-
hoods in southeast D.C. have few Starbucks retail outlets. 
Line symbols include not only roads and railroads, 
but also political and administrative boundaries, rivers, and other linear features. Again scale plays a crucial role: on a large-scale map, it is possible to represent the fenced boundaries of a single farm, but on a small-scale map, such detail cannot be shown.
Some lines on maps do not actually exist on the 
ground. When physical geographers do their ﬁ  eld work 
they use contour maps, lines that represent a certain con-sistent height above mean sea level (Fig. A.10). All points  Figure A.9

on such a contour line thus are at the same elevation. The 
spacing between contour lines immediately reveals the nature of the local topography (the natural land surface). When the contour lines at a given interval (e.g., 100 feet) are spaced closely together, the slope of the ground is steep. When they are widely separated, the land surface slopes gently. Of course contour lines cannot be found in the real world, and neither can the lines drawn on the weather maps in our daily newspaper. These lines connect points of equal pressure (isobars) and temperature (iso-therms) and show the development of weather systems. Note that the letters iso (meaning “the same”) appear in these terms. Invisible lines of this kind are collectively known as isolines, lines of equal or constant value. These are abstract constructions, but they can be of great value in geographic research and representation.
Area symbols take many forms, and we will see some 
of them on the maps in this book. Area symbols are used in various ways to represent distributions and magni-tudes. Maps showing distributions (of such phenomena as regionally dominant languages or religions in human geography, and climates or soils in physical geography) show the world, or parts of it, divided into areas shaded or colored in contrasting hues. But be careful: those sharp dividing lines are likely to be transition zones in the real world, and a dominant language or religion does not imply the exclusion of all others. So distribution maps, and there are many in this book, tend to be small-scale generalizations of much more complex patterns than they can reveal. Maps showing magnitudes also must be read with care. Here the objective is to reveal how much of a phenomenon prevails in one unit (e.g., country) on the map, compared to others. The maps on population in chapter 2 are examples of such maps. The important cartographic decision has to do with color. Darker should mean more, and lighter implies less. That is relatively easily done when the dominant color is the same. But on a multicolored map, the use of reds, greens, and yellows can be confusing, and ﬁ  rst impressions may have to be 
revised upon examination of the key.
Some students who are ﬁ  rst drawn to the discipline 
of geography go on to become professional cartographers, and their work is seen in atlases, newspapers, magazines, books, websites, and many other venues.  Figure A.10

A-17the GNI, that is, the Gross National Income per person 
and what this would buy in each country. In the language 
of economic geographers, this is called the GNI-PPP , the per-capita Gross National Income in terms of its Purchasing Power Parity.
Indexes that may not be immediately obvious to you 
include Arithmetic Population Density, the number of 
people per square kilometer in each country; Physiologic 
Population Density, the number of people per square kilometer of agriculturally productive land; Birth and Death Rates per thousand in the population, resulting in the national population’s rate of Natural Increase; a pop-ulation’s Infant Mortality, the number of deaths per 
thousand in the ﬁ  rst year of life, thus largely reﬂ  ecting the 
number of deaths at birth; Child Mortality, the deaths per thousand of children in their ﬁ  rst ﬁ ve years; the Cor-
ruption Index, based on T ransparency International data in which 10.0 is perfect and 0.1 is the worst; the Big Mac 
Price index, which tells you why Argentina in 2011 was the best place to buy a hamburger in U.S. dollars; and the Per Capita GNI ($U.S.), the GNI-PPP index referred 
to above, which tells you how spendable income varies around the globe. For additional details on sources and 
data, please consult the Data Sources section of the Preface.This Data T able is a valuable resource, and should be consulted throughout your reading. Like all else in this book, this table is subject to continuous revision and modiﬁ  cation. Compared to previous editions, we have 
deleted some indices, elaborated others, and introduced new ones. For example, in a world with ever-slower pop-ulation growth, the so-called Doubling Time index—the number of years it will take for a population to double in size based on its current rate of natural increase—has lost most of its utility. On the other hand, when it comes to Life Expectancy  and Literacy , general averages con-
ceal signiﬁ  cant differences between male and female 
rates, which in turn reﬂ  ect conditions in individual coun-tries, so we report these by gender. Also in this edition, we continue to use the Corruption Index , not available 
for all countries but an important reﬂ  ection of a global 
problem. The Big Mac Price index, a measure intro-duced by the journal The Economist, tells you much more than what a hamburger with all the trimmings would cost in real dollars in various countries of the world—it also reﬂ  ects whether those countries’ curren-cies are overvalued or undervalued. And the ﬁ  nal col-
umn, in which we formerly used to reported the per-capita GNP (Gross National Product), now reveals BMappB.indd Page A-17  9/30/11  1:41 PM user f-400BMappB.indd Page A-17  9/30/11  1:41 PM user f-400 F-400F-400

  surface of the Earth as expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds of 
  latitude  , 0° to 90° north or south of the equator, and   longitude  , 0° to 
180° east or west of the   Prime Meridian   passing through Greenwich, 
England (a suburb of London).  
  Accessibility     The degree of ease with which it is possible to reach a 
certain location from other locations. A  c  cessibility varies from place to 
place and can be measured.  
  Acid rain     A growing environmental peril whereby acidiﬁ  ed rainwater 
severely damages plant and animal life; caused by the oxides of sulfur and 
nitrogen that are released into the atmosphere when coal, oil, and natu-ral gas are burned, especially in major manufacturing zones.  
  Acropolis     Literally “high point of the city.” The upper fortiﬁ  ed part of 
an ancient Greek city, usually devoted to religious purposes.  
  Activity (action) space     The space within which daily activity occurs.  
  Agglomeration     A process involving the clustering or concentrating of 
people or activities. The term often refers to manufacturing plants and 
businesses that beneﬁ  t from close proximity because they share skilled-labor pools and technological and ﬁ  nancial amenities.  
  Aging index   the number of people aged 65 years and older per 100 
children aged zero to 14 years in a given population.  
  Agora     In ancient Greece, public spaces where citizens debated, lectured,

by others.  
  Agricultural village     A relatively small, egalitarian village, where most 
of the population was involved in a  g  riculture. Starting over 10,000 years 
ago, people began to cluster in agricultural villages as they stayed in one 
place to tend their crops.  
  Agriculture     The purposeful tending of crops and livestock in order to 
produce food and ﬁ  ber.  
  AIDS (Acquired Immune Deﬁ  ciency Syndrome)     Immune system 
disease caused by the Human Immun  o  deﬁ ciency Virus (HIV) which 
over a period of years weakens the capacity of the immune system to ﬁ ght off infection so that weight loss and weakness set in and other   af-

ﬁ city than   region  . For example, “u  r  ban area” alludes very generally to a 
place where urban development has taken place, whereas “urban region” 
requires certain speciﬁ  c criteria on which a delimitation is based (e.g., the spatial extent of commuting or the built townscape).  
  Arithmetic population density     The population of a country or   re-
gion expressed as an average per unit area. The ﬁ  gure is derived by divid-
ing the population of the areal unit by the number of square   kilometers 
or miles that make up the unit.  
  Assimilation     The process through which people lose originally dif-
ferentiating traits, such as dress, speech particularities or mannerisms, 
when they come into contact with another society or culture. Often used to d  e  scribe immigrant adaptation to new places of residence.  
  Asylum     Shelter and protection in one state for refugees from another 
state.  
  Atmosphere     Blanket of gases surrounding the Earth and located 
some 350 miles above the Earth’s surface.

Originally denoting the dispersal of Jews, it is increasingly applied to other population dispersals, such as the involuntary relocation of Black peoples during the slave trade or Chinese peoples outside of Mainland China, T aiwan and Hong Kong.  
  Diffusion     The spatial spreading or dissemination of a culture element 
(such as a technological innovation) or some other phenomenon (e.g., a

how far a crop locates from the market.  
  Washington Consensus     Label used to refer to the following fundam-
netal principles of free trade: 1) that free trade raises the well-being of all 
countries by inducing them to devote their resources to production of those goods they produce relatively most efﬁ  ciently; and   2) that compe-
tition through trade raises a country’s long-term growth rate by expand-
ing access to global technologies and promoting   innovation.  
  Wisconsinan Glaciation      The most recent glacial period of the 
Pleistocene, enduring about 100,000 years and giving way, beginning

  World city     Dominant   city   in terms of its role in the global political 
economy. Not the world’s biggest city in terms of population or indus-
trial output, but rather centers of strategic control of the world economy.

country’s population living in urban places is its level of urbanization. 
The process of urbanization involves the movement of people to, and the clu  s  tering of people in, towns and cities—a major force in every 
geographic realm today. Another kind of urbaniz  a  tion occurs when an 
expanding city absorbs the rural countryside and transforms it into sub-urbs; in the case of cities in the developing world, this also generates peripheral   shantytowns  .
