xlii WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONThe Agricultural Revolution
Around 10,000 years ago, or about 8000 B.C.E., the climate was warming 
from an Ice Age. As it did, humans began to plant crops and raise animals for 
food. This change, called the Agricultural Revolution , began in the Middle 
East. Because of this development, people began to produce a surplus of food. 
For the first time in human history, one part of the population produced enough 
food to feed everyone. This allowed part of the population to specialize in non-
food producing activities. This specialization change transformed every aspect 
of human life, causing innovations and trends that have existed ever since:
• The population grew. People lived in larger settlements that eventually 
developed into cities.
• People became highly skilled at one job. Artisans made tools and 
weapons. Merchants engaged in trade. Priests conducted rituals. 
• People developed new technology. They learned how to improve 
irrigation systems, make use of the wheel in transportation, and replace 
stone with metals such as bronze and iron for making tools and art.
• People created more extensive governments and taxation. The desire to 
keep records about trade and taxes led to the invention of writing.
• Competition for resources and the accumulation of wealth increased 
group conflicts. However, the development of government provided a 
more peaceful way to settle conflicts between individuals.
• People became more sharply divided into social classes by wealth and 
occupation. In general, the status of women declined. 
The First Civilizations
Trends that began to emerge after the Agricultural Revolution led to the first 
civilizations, large societies with cities and a powerful state. Most were in 
river valleys, places with fresh water and fertile land. 
Mesopotamia  The world’s first civilization was in Mesopotamia, a 
region around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is today Iraq. Several 
cultures emerged in this region, many based on city-states. A city-state  is an 
independent state made up of a city and its surrounding territory. All city-
states were highly patriarchal, built monumental architecture such as religious 
temples called ziggurats, and engaged in long-distance trade. The people were 
polytheistic, believing in many gods.
Sumer was a city-state along the southernmost region of ancient 
Mesopotamia. As taxes and trade became more complex, the Sumerians 
invented cuneiform, the first written language in history. They used cuneiform 
to record the first written laws.
Egypt  In the Nile River valley, Egypt prospered. Though it shared many 
traits with Mesopotamia, Egypt was highly centralized under one ruler, called 
a  pharaoh. The Egyptians developed their own writing system (hieroglyphics) 
xliii PROLOGUEand a complex system of mathematics. They built monumental architecture 
(pyramids) that demonstrated the pharaoh’s power. Egyptian women were 
allowed to own property, and they were recognized as legally equal to men in 
court. These rights gave women a higher social standing than their counterparts 
in other patriarchal civilizations.
Indus  Archaeological remains show the sophistication of ancient 
civilizations along the Indus River in South Asia. Cities such as Harappa and 
Mohenjo-Daro engaged in long-distance trade with Mesopotamia, practiced 
polytheism, developed technology such as indoor plumbing, and planned the 
layout of urban areas. However, no one has deciphered their language, so less 
is known about them than about other early civilizations. 
China  Along the Huang He River in northern China, a highly patriarchal 
and centralized system developed. One of its distinctive features was the 
special honor that its people gave to their ancestors. 
Non-River Valley Civilizations  Two early civilizations in the Americas 
did not develop in river valleys. The Olmec in Mesoamerica and the Chavin in 
the Andes were complex societies that participated in extensive trade.

reflected the power of early governments to organize workers to build large structures.

xliv WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONHinduism and Judaism 
At the same time that cities were growing, people began developing new ideas 
about religion. In animism, most deities were identified with specific places. 
Over time, people developed more abstract beliefs in which deities were not 
fixed in location. As people moved, they could take their deities with them. In 
some places, belief in many gods (polytheism) was replaced with a belief in 
just one supreme deity, monotheism.
Hinduism  The belief now called Hinduism  is sometimes categorized 
as polytheistic and sometimes as monotheistic. The origins of Hinduism go 
back at least 3,500 years. People called Aryans from north of the Himalaya 
Mountains migrated south to what is now Pakistan and India. They spoke an 
Indo-European language, and they brought with them scriptures called the 
Vedas and a belief that many deities existed. However, over time, people came 
to regard all deities as the expression of one supreme deity. 
The Vedas taught that the soul of a person is reborn, or reincarnated, 
many times. Eventually, a soul would spiritually advance enough to become 
liberated from this cycle of death and rebirth. The Vedas taught that people 
should organize society into sharply defined classes, called castes. The 
caste system prohibited social mobility. While the caste system kept society 
stratified, society was also unified. 
Zoroastrianism  A clear example of an early form of monotheism is 
Zoroastrianism. This belief system developed in Persia. Followers of this faith 
focus on human free will and the eternal battle between the forces of good and 
evil.
Judaism  The most influential example of monotheism is Judaism . Its 
earliest adherents were known as Hebrews or Israelites, but they have long 
been called Jews. Judaism developed in and around what is now the state of 
Israel. The Jewish people trace their history to the teachings of Abraham, who 
lived about 4,000 years ago. 
Jews believe that they have entered into a covenant, or mutual promise, 
with their God, whom they call Yahweh. In return for their devotion, Yahweh 
would consider them his chosen people. Judaism was further developed with 
the codification of Hebrew Scriptures, sometimes called the Old Testament. 
Like Judaism, two other faiths—Christianity and Islam—are also 
monotheistic religions that looked back to Abraham as an important figure. 
Christianity and Islam will be discussed later in this Prologue. 
xlv PROLOGUEPart 2:  The Classical Era, c. 600 B.C.E.  
to c. 600 C.E. 
Several great empires that arose between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E. became the 
core foundations of later civilizations in their region: 
• western Eurasia: the Persian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine empires
• southern Asia: the Mauryan and Gupta empires 
• eastern Asia: the Qin and Han dynasties
• Mesoamerica: the Mayan Empire
These empires provided political and economic security for their people. 
Goods and ideas flowed along land routes such as the ones in Eurasia known 
as the Silk Roads and maritime routes in the Mediterranean Sea and Indian 
Ocean. These trade routes fostered the development of such great cities as 
Rome (Italy), Constantinople (Turkey), Damascus (Syria), Pataliputra (India), 
and Chang’an (China).

Buddhism and Developments in South Asia
While intense spirituality and distinct social organization have provided 
continuity in South Asian history, strong political centralization has not. The 
region was unified under a single government only twice during the Classical 
Period. The most influential development in South Asia was the development 
of the religion of Buddhism.
xlvi WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONBeginning of Buddhism  The founder of Buddhism  was Siddhartha 
Gautama. Born into a wealthy Hindu family around 530 B.C.E., he became 
sharply aware of all the suffering people endured. To understand why people 
suffered, he left his wealthy family and pursued a life of poverty and meditation. 
According to Buddhist traditions, Siddhartha had been meditating for several 
days underneath a bodhi tree when he finally understood the cause of suffering 
and how to end it. He called himself the Buddha or “enlightened one,” and 
sought to teach others what he had come to understand. 
Buddhist doctrines became summarized in the Four Noble Truths, which 
sought to eliminate desire and suffering by following the Eightfold Path. This 
path requires an individual to meditate, reflect, and refrain from excessive 
earthly pleasures. The goal is, over time, to achieve enlightenment and the 
peaceful bliss known as nirvana, which would end the cycle of reincarnation. 
The Spread of Buddhism  Buddhism provided an alternative to the Vedic 
beliefs that were the foundation of Hinduism. Because Buddhism rejected 
the caste system, it became popular with members of the lower caste. It 
spread quickly throughout India and across Asia. Those spreading it included 
missionaries and merchants along the Silk Roads and around the Indian Ocean. 
Unlike Hinduism and Judaism, which remained the faiths of particular 
groups of people in particular places, Buddhism was a universalizing religion, 
one that actively sought converts among all people. Buddhism is also a 
monastic faith, one that develops monastery communities for men and women.
The Mauryan Empire  The first period of unity in South Asia was under 
the Mauryan Empire  (322 B.C.E.–187 B.C.E.) It reached its high point 
during the rule of Ashoka. He promoted prosperity by creating an efficient 
tax system and by building roads that connected commercial centers. Ashoka 
spread knowledge of the law by inscribing his edicts on pillars throughout the 
empire. 
Ashoka is one of the few powerful rulers in history who converted from 
one faith—Hinduism—to another. He became a Buddhist. His conversion 
helped spread the faith throughout India. After Ashoka, the Mauryan Empire 
soon declined in power, resulting in political decentralization.
The Gupta Empire  The second period of unity in South Asia was under  
the Gupta Empire . It ruled from c. 320 C.E. to c. 550 C.E. (C.E. stands 
for Common Era, sometimes called A.D.; c. stands for circa  and means 
approximately). This period is referred to as the Golden Age of India. Under 
a centralized government based in Pataliputra, a city in northwestern India, 
intellectual and cultural life flourished. In public hospitals, physicians 
made advances in medicine, such as using inoculations to prevent disease. 
Mathematicians developed a numbering system that combined a small number 
of symbols, 0 through 9, and the idea of place value. The system was so 
efficient that it is used throughout most of the world today. 
The social structure in the Gupta era was patriarchal. Men held most 
positions of power in public life. To unify people, the Gupta strongly supported 
Hinduism. Hinduism is the most common religion in India today.
xlvii PROLOGUEConfucianism and Developments in East Asia
Central China was united under the Zhou Dynasty (1076 B.C.E.–256 B.C.E.). 
However, as the dynasty weakened, China suffered a time of instability and 
decentralization referred to as the Warring States period.
Mandate of Heaven  One legacy of the Zhou Dynasty in China was in 
how people thought about government. This was the concept of a Mandate 
of Heaven,  the idea that “heaven,” or some universal force, provided the 
justification for an emperor and his family to rule China. If the ruler was corrupt 
or ineffective, “heaven” would show its displeasure in the form of natural 
disasters. These disasters, such as drought or famine, were a sign to the Chinese 
people that the ruler had lost the Mandate of Heaven. Several major peasant 
uprisings in China were a direct result in this belief.
Confucianism  During the Warring States period, around 551 B.C.E., the 
philosopher K’ung Fu-tzu, whose westernized name is Confucius , was born. He 
lived around the same time as the Buddha in India. The teachings of Confucius, 
written down by his followers in the Analects , describe how people should 
behave in everyday life. Unlike the teachings of Hinduism and Judaism, the 
Analects  do not focus on any deity. Rather, Confucius focused on education, 
benevolence, virtue, respect for those with authority (especially the emperor), 
and a patriarchal social structure. He emphasized filial piety, the duty of people 
to honor their ancestors. The teachings of Confucius affected Chinese beliefs 
and values more than any other philosophy. 
Daoism  A second response to the chaos of the Warring States period was 
Daoism. While Confucianism focused on how people could live in harmony 
with one another, Daoism  focused on how people could live in harmony with 
nature. The practices of Daoism emphasized internal reflection more than 
external behavior. Daoism would be influential throughout Chinese history.
The Qin and Han Dynasties  China regained stability when the Qin  
Dynasty  (221 B.C.E.–207 B.C.E.) and Han Dynasty  (206 B.C.E.–220 C.E.) 
established centralized control. The Qin standardized Chinese script, established 
a uniform system of weights and measures, and built canals and roads. Together, 
these changes provided the foundation for increased trade and prosperity.
Building on the accomplishments of the Qin, the Han Dynasty became a 
Golden Age of Chinese history. Under the Han, China was more peaceful and 
its population grew. Chinese science and technology prospered, producing such 
developments as the magnetic compass, paper, and the sternpost rudder. Under 
Han regulation, trade extended from Chang’an, the capital of the empire, west 
to the Mediterranean Sea. Most of the trade was in luxury items such as spices, 
gems, precious metals, tea, and, most famously, silk.
The Han transformed China’s government by creating a civil service exam . 
It required students to analyze Confucian teachings. Those who scored well 
received prestigious jobs in the government bureaucracy. This system produced 
a government of well-educated individuals and allowed for some social mobility. 
xlviii WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONCivilizations of Western Eurasia and Christianity
In western Eurasia between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E., strong civilizations 
developed in Persia, Greece, and Rome. Trade, war, and the flow of ideas 
connected these civilizations to one another. Each civilization prospered 
through a combination of trade and military strength.
Persia  Around 559 B.C.E., a large empire developed in Persia (modern-
day Iran) under the leadership of Cyrus the Great. The Persian Empire  
included most of the lands from the Aegean Sea in the west to the border of 
India in the east. The empire also became known as the Achaemenid Empire. 
With a strong centralized government, efficient bureaucracy, and network 
of roads, the Persian empire promoted trade, prosperity, and stability. The 
vast empire was ethnically and religiously diverse, which the government 
recognized by practicing religious toleration. 
Greece  While Persia was a vast but united empire, Greece was divided 
into approximately 1,000 city-states. The numerous islands and mountainous 
terrain made unifying the Grecian region under one leader very difficult. 
One cultural trait shared by Greeks was religion. Unlike the monotheistic 
Hebrews who worshipped a single all-powerful God, the Greeks believed in 
many deities and each possessed human frailties. These frailties help explain 
why Greeks developed a feeling that they controlled their own destiny.
Two of the largest city-states, Athens and Sparta, reflected the great variety 
among Greece’s many city-states. 
• Spartans organized their society around a powerful military. Women, 
the elderly, and enslaved people all filled roles that allowed free men to 
train as soldiers and fight when needed. 
• Athenians made impressive advances in architecture, literature, theater, 
and philosophy. Many of these came during its Golden Age in the 
late 400s B.C.E. Athens also developed the concept of democracy , a 
system of government in which a large part of the population runs the 
government. Athens allowed free adult males the ability to participate 
directly in making political decisions. 
In the 300s B.C.E., the army of Alexander the Great spread Greek culture 
into Egypt, across Persia, and east to India. This region became known as the 
Hellenistic world. 
Rome  According to legend, Rome was founded in 753 B.C.E. Roman 
culture borrowed heavily from the Greeks. The Romans incorporated the 
Greek gods into their pantheon of deities, relied on slavery, and made advances 
in government that continue to have lasting influence on governments today. 
Romans developed the practice of a representative government and of the 
judicial concept “innocent until proven guilty.” To protect individual rights, 
the Romans publicly displayed written laws known as the Twelve Tables. 
Spreading awareness of laws provided a check on abuses of government 
power, a concept that would be built into numerous constitutions in the future.
xlix PROLOGUELike Greece, Rome had a patriarchal society. However, compared to 
Greek women, Roman women gained more rights, including the right to own 
and inherit property and the right to initiate divorce proceedings. 
While the Greek city-states remained small, Rome expanded outward 
in all directions, turning the Mediterranean Sea into “a Roman lake.” At the 
peak of its power, the Roman Empire ruled territory from Scotland to northern 
Africa to the Middle East. In the large size of its territory, Rome was more like 
Persia. Both Rome and Persia were land-based empires under a strong central 
government. Both fostered trade and prosperity with well-maintained roads 
and strong militaries to protect travelers. Rome was also famous for other 
publicly funded projects, such as aqueducts, which were systems to transport 
water to cities, and large stadiums for public entertainment. 
Despite Rome’s wealth and power, it faced many challenges. Roman 
leaders over-extended the Roman military, were often corrupt, and failed to 
deal with devastating epidemics caused by smallpox and the bubonic plague. 
Gradually, trade and urban populations declined. As a result, Roman lands 
suffered economically. Rome’s decline was made worse by invasions from 
groups such as the Huns, Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and Vandals. By 476 C.E., the 
empire was so weak that a non-Roman became emperor for the first time in 
more than a thousand years.   
The Development of Christianity  Rome’s most enduring legacy was 
not in its military or its engineering achievements. It was in religion. Rome 
generally tolerated all faiths as long as subjects agreed to accept the divine 
nature of the emperor. People with polytheistic beliefs could do this easily.

l WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONHowever, monotheists could not. In particular, Jews living the Middle East 
refused to recognize any deity but their own. Roman persecution of Jews 
living in the Middle East contributed to the diaspora,  or spreading, of Jews 
to lands throughout northern Africa and Europe as they looked for places to 
worship freely.
One leader who emerged from the Jewish community was Jesus. For 
his teachings, he was executed by the Romans. Since the followers of his 
teachings considered him the Christ, or savior of humanity sent by God, they 
became known as Christians. Despite persecution by the Romans, Jesus’s 
disciples continued to spread his teachings. By the end of the 1st century C.E., 
Christians were practicing their faith throughout the empire. 
This new faith was particularly attractive to the poor because it taught that 
people could have a better life after death if they believed in Jesus. Despite 
continued persecution, Christianity  grew stronger. In the 4th century, under 
the emperor Constantine, Christianity became legal and was accepted as the 
official religion of the empire. 
Constantine’s endorsement of Christianity accelerated its growth. Like 
Buddhism, Christianity was a universalizing religion, meaning it actively 
sought converts and it was easily adaptable to areas outside its place of origin. 
It also offered monastic lifestyles for men (monks) and women (nuns) to 
devote their lives to practicing the faith. This new monotheistic faith would 
have far-reaching impact on future civilizations. 
Byzantine  By the middle of the 4th century, the eastern half of the Roman 
Empire had become wealthier and politically more powerful than the western 
half. For this reason, in 330, Emperor Constantine moved the capital of the 
empire eastward to Byzantium and renamed the city Constantinople (Istanbul 
today). In 395, the Roman Empire  was divided into two distinct entities. 
Rome became the capital in the west, and Constantinople became the capital 
in the east. 
Constantinople quickly became a political and economic hub. Geography 
aided its rise to prominence as rivers from the north flowed into the nearby 
Mediterranean and Black seas. As an entrep ôt, or coastal trading center , 
Constantinople prospered  as raw goods arrived from northern Europe, cereals 
came from Egypt, and precious spices and finished products came from the 
east. 
At its height, the Byzantine Empire  extended throughout the eastern 
half of the Mediterranean world. The reign of Justinian the Great (527–565) 
included great accomplishments. One was the construction of a magnificent 
church called Hagia Sophia (537). Another was the creation of the Justinian 
Code. This consolidation of Roman law would serve as the foundation of legal 
knowledge in Europe into the 19th century. Though constantly threatened by 
foreign incursion, the Byzantine Empire would survive for another 900 years.

Early American Civilizations
Afro-Eurasian civilizations developed in isolation from American civilizations 
during the classical era. Two of the most important were in Mesoamerica, the 
region that is now Mexico and Central America.
Teotihuacan  One of the most important civilizations in the Americas was 
based in the city of Teotihuacan , located near modern-day Mexico City. It 
was a multicultural urban area that prospered through regional trade. By the 
6th century C.E., its population of 125,000 made it one of the largest cities 
in the world. Teotihuacan featured streets laid out on a grid and monumental 
religious temples dedicated to the gods of the sun and moon. The city was 
abandoned by 650, but the “city of the gods” as it was called, would later 
influence other powerful civilization such as the Aztecs. 
The Mayans  South of Teotihuacan lived the Mayans . They were the most 
influential classical civilization in the Americas. The Mayans can be traced as 
far back as 1500 B.C.E. They reached their height of population and wealth 
between 250 C.E. and 900 C.E. The Mayans developed the most complex 
written language in the Americas before contact with people from Europe. 
Mayan priests created a very accurate calendar, a sign that they studied and 
understood the movement of Earth through space. Mayans understood the 
importance of the concept of zero, something people in the Mediterranean 
world had not grasped in this period. 
lii WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONComparisons in the Classical Age
The  empires that emerged between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E. shared several 
traits in economics and politics. In general, increased trade, technological 
innovation, and centralized government worked together to make the lives of 
people longer, safer, and more comfortable. In general, the empires also shared 
similar reasons for their decline. 
Early Trade Networks  As technological developments made trade easier, 
strong and stable governments provided the wealth and security to foster and 
sponsor trade. The Eurasian exchange networks utilized the strength of the 
Roman and Han innovations, such as stirrups that made riding horses easier 
and networks of places to rest and eat that made long journey travel more 
dependable.  
Other key technologies included the improvements in sail design and ship 
hulls that enabled ships to maneuver in less than favorable wind conditions. 
The knowledge of monsoon winds facilitated trade along the entrepôts in the 
Indian Ocean. The improvements to the camel saddle made caravan trade 
profitable and possible across the Sahara. 
The Mediterranean Sea lanes continued to facilitate cultural exchange and 
goods between the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, and people of North Africa. 
Long-distance trade was only beginning to hit its stride. These developments 
ushered in the first Golden Age of the Silk Roads.
Decline of Classical Empires  By 600 C.E., many of the great classical 
empires were losing or had lost their unity and political power. As a result, 
people faced growing problems that they could not agree on how to address. 
Each unsolved problem then made peace and prosperity more precarious:
• challenges collecting taxes weakened government
• declines in trade decreased access to foreign goods and markets
• spread of disease reduced urban populations
• increases in the gap between the rich and poor created social conflict
• lack of broad support for leadership made solving problems harder
• attacks by outside groups led to a need for more spending on defense
In some areas, the spread of a common religion helped keep society unified 
even as a government failed. In later centuries, this unity would help new 
empires arise. For example, in Europe, the Roman Empire broke apart in the 
5th century, but Christianity held society together. Confucianism filled a similar 
role in China, while Hinduism and Buddhism did the same in South Asia.

c. 600–c. 1200
In many parts of the world, the decline of classical civilizations was marked 
by a century or more of declines in trade, intellectual innovation, and social 
stability. However, new centralized states that promoted peace and prosperity 
emerged to replace them. Throughout Afro-Eurasia, trade intensified after 
600 as networks of exchange widened and became more profitable. The Silk 
Roads, the Indian Ocean trade networks , and the trans-Saharan trade 
routes were brimming with items such as porcelain, ivory, teakwood, spices, 
and silk. These networks of exchange also provided ways for technology and 
ideas to move from one culture to another. More and more regions became 
familiar with the compass, the astrolabe, new forms of credit, paper money, 
and new religious beliefs. 
However, all of this exchange came with a high price. Deadly diseases 
also spread along these same pathways. 
Afro-Eurasia and the Americas remained separate, but people in 
Mesoamerica and the Andes Mountains experienced similar developments. 
The growth of more centralized states in each region also promoted trade and 
the spread of ideas.

At the beginning of the 7th century, the people of the Middle East were a 
mixture of animists, Zoroastrians, Jews, Christians, and others. A merchant 
named Muhammad living on the Arabian Peninsula believed that he had 
received revelations from God. These revelations were later recorded in the 
Quran, the sacred scriptures of the religion of Islam . Those who followed 
the teachings in the Quran became known as Muslims. They believed that 
Muhammad was last in a line of great prophets that included Abraham, Moses, 
and Jesus.  
The Teachings of Islam  The core principles of the Quran became known 
as the Five Pillars of Islam: a belief in one god called Allah, ritual prayer, 
almsgiving, fasting, and making a pilgrimage to Mecca. They evolved a law 
code based on the Quran, called sharia , to regulate Muslim religious and civic 
behavior. Unlike the laws of the Romans, sharia made no distinction between 
religious and civil law. 
Sunnis and Shi’as  Through Muhammad’s leadership, Islam quickly 
unified and brought peace to the warring tribes of the Arabian Peninsula. 
However, Islam experienced a crisis upon the death of Muhammad in 632. 
He had made no provision for a successor. People fell into two warring camps  
over who should become the political leader, called the caliph, of the Islamic 
community. This rift, which continues today, created a divide between the 
two major branches of Islam: Sunni and Shi’a. Sunni Muslims felt that the 
caliph could be selected from among all leaders in the Islamic community. 
lv PROLOGUEShi’a Muslims felt that the caliph should be a blood relative of Muhammad. 
Today, Sunnis form the majority of Muslims in the world. Shi’a Muslims are 
strongest in Iran and Iraq. 
Expansion of Islam  Despite this early division among Muslims, Islam 
spread rapidly. In less than a century, Islam had united southern Spain, North 
Africa, the Middle East, and parts of India. This area became known as the 
House of Islam, or Dar al-Islam . 
The Abbasids  The most influential rulers in Dar al-Islam were those of 
the Abbasid Caliphate  (750–1258). Under them, Islamic culture experienced  
a golden age. A stable government allowed trade to once again prosper. The 
Abbasids helped China, then under the Tang Dynasty, reestablish a booming 
trade along the Silk Roads. They also facilitated the growth of trans-Saharan 
trade to West Africa and were major participants in the diffusion of ideas and 
goods throughout the Indian Ocean. 
Islamic society, particularly in the capital in Baghdad, thrived under the 
Abbasids. The empire became a center of learning where people made advances 
in medicine, built astronomical observatories, developed algebra, improved the 
astrolabe, and preserved Greek and Roman texts. The government practiced a 
degree of religious toleration. Non-Muslims could keep their faith by paying 
an additional tax called the jizya . 
The Abbasids ended female infanticide and strengthened the marriage and 
property rights of women. The Abbasids continued to support the veiling of 
women and the right of a man to take up to four wives.

lvi WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONChina 
After the Han Dynasty declined in the 3rd century, China suffered three 
centuries of turmoil and disunity. However, after that, China experienced 
several centuries of growth.
Sui Dynasty  China’s period of troubles was ended by the short-lived 
Sui Dynasty  (581–618). By reconstituting a centralized government, the 
Sui provided the foundation on which China again became prosperous. The 
dynasty’s most dramatic accomplishment was the construction of the Grand 
Canal. Stretching over 1,000 miles, it connected the agricultural south to the 
population centers in the north. Besides fostering economic growth, the Grand 
Canal helped unify the varied ethnic and cultural groups of China.
Tang Dynasty  Building on the accomplishments of the Sui, the Tang 
Dynasty  (618–907) extended China’s boundaries north into Mongolia, 
west into Central Asia, and south into Vietnam. China’s population grew 
significantly under the Tang. Learning to grow a fast-ripening variety of rice 
allowed peasants to produce more calories per acre, so the land could support 
more people. 
The Tang expanded the civil service exam and the empire’s bureaucracy, 
which developed into an ongoing feature of the Chinese government. Under 
the Tang, the Chinese invented gunpowder and developed paper money,  
which facilitated trade. Political stability and steady demand for China’s silk, 
porcelain, and other goods ushered in a second golden age of the Silk Roads.

lvii PROLOGUEThe Chinese had long viewed their country as the “Middle Kingdom,” 
possibly because they believed they were at the center of cultural advances 
in the world.  Based on this viewpoint, they developed the tributary system, 
the idea that surrounding kingdoms should make payment, or tribute, to the 
Chinese and officially submit to their rule in exchange for trading privileges.
The strength of the Tang eventually declined. A combination of internal 
peasant uprisings and invasions from the west and north led to the downfall 
of the dynasty.
Song Dynasty  After the Tang collapsed, a new dynasty, the Song Dynasty 
(960 –1279), was able to restore order. Under the Song, China continued its 
golden age. Chinese meritocracy allowed for more upward mobility than any 
other hiring system of its time. China became the leading manufacturer in the 
world, producing iron, steel, silk, and porcelain, and it had the largest cities in 
the world. Neo-Confucianism, a melding of Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist 
philosophies that had begun under the Tang, became popular. It was during 
this time that paper money and the magnetic compass was exported from East 
Asia to other parts of the world. 
Japan
Between about 800 and 1200, Japan had its own golden age of achievements 
in painting and literature. Though influenced by China, Japan always had a 
separate and distinctive culture. However, by the end of this period, powerful 
clans of land-owning nobles were eroding the emperor’s power. As government 
became more decentralized, warfare between these clans increased. A strong 
political and social hierarchy developed over the control of land and included 
hierarchical obligations. At the top was the shogun , a military general, 
followed by powerful landlords called daimyos . Each daimyo had a force of 
warriors called samurais who pledged loyalty to serve him. Below the samurai 
were the peasants, followed by merchants. 
Culturally, Japan’s official religion was Shinto , a set of beliefs centered 
on the veneration of ancestors and nature spirits. However, missionaries from 
China and Korea brought Buddhism to the country, and it became popular at 
this time. Many Japanese adopted Buddhism yet keep their Shinto beliefs. 
Africa 
In most of sub-Saharan Africa between 600 and 1200, people often lived in 
small self-governing chiefdoms in which many people were related. These kin-
based communities often cooperated with one another and sometimes formed 
larger political units. While cultures were as diverse as the geography of the 
continent, similarities existed. Some similarities resulted from the migrations 
of Bantu-speaking people out of a region in west central Africa between  
c. 1000 B.C.E. and c. 1500 C.E. These migrating people spread a language, 
farming techniques, and knowledge of how to work with iron. 
lviii WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONBy 1000 C.E., complex agricultural practices such as irrigation and 
the allocation of land for people to cultivate demanded the development of 
more complex forms of government. With a stronger government came more 
control over production and distribution of surplus products. This government 
regulation, combined with the introduction of the camel and use of the camel 
saddle, led to long-distance trade across the Sahara. Muslim merchants greatly 
increased trade, which benefited the kingdom of Ghana  (c. 700–c. 1240). The 
trans-Saharan trade route allowed Ghana to become very wealthy. The rulers of 
Ghana protected these trade routes and taxed the gold and salt that continually 
entered or exited their trading centers. 
The development of trade also affected the religion of the people of West 
Africa. As Muslim merchants from North Africa traded in the region, they 
spread Islam. The region became part of Dar al-Islam. The legacy of this 
period can be seen today in the large number of Muslims in some countries. In 
Nigeria, about 50 percent of the population identifies as Muslim. In Mali, over 
90 percent do. 
On the east coast of Africa, merchants linked into the Indian Ocean trading 
network. Through it, Africans and people from the Middle East, South Asia, 
and Southeast Asia were all connected. African merchants exported gold, ivory, 
and enslaved people. They imported porcelain, silk, and spices. 
While governments were generally small and local in most of Africa, 
outside of West Africa, one large kingdom arose in the southeast part of the 
continent, Great Zimbabwe . It dominated the region between the 12th and 
15th centuries. The reasons Great Zimbabwe declined are not clear, though one 
reason was probably the reduced output of gold mines in the region.
South Asia and Southeast Asia
After the fall of the Gupta empire in 550, South Asia was riddled by disunity 
and fighting. Despite this decentralization, Hinduism and the caste system kept 
southern India unified and relatively stable. Northern India, however, suffered 
a series of invasions and weak confederations. One of those invasions brought 
Islam to the region in 711. 
Despite a period of divisions and conflict, South Asian trade flourished. As 
people better understood the pattern of the monsoon winds , India’s location 
made it the hub of Indian Ocean trade. Silks and porcelain from East Asia, 
spices from southeast Asia, horses from the Middle East, and enslaved people 
and ivory from Africa were all traded in India.
Religion and trade dominated South Asia’s influence on Southeast Asia. 
Buddhists and Hindus used trade networks to spread their religions’ teachings. 
Islam also significantly influenced Southeast Asia at this time. Muslim 
merchants, though often not consciously missionaries, spread their faith by 
settling in new regions with their families. Islam soon became the dominant 
religion in the Spice Islands and the Malay peninsula.

Europe
The Postclassical period saw a dramatic shift in Europe. The Eastern Roman 
Empire, based in Constantinople, flourished. In contrast, the decline of the 
Western Roman Empire left a power vacuum in the rest of the continent. 
Invasions of people from Northern Europe, known as the Vikings, brought 
another group of people into the cultural exchanges. Central and western 
Europe devolved into thousands of duchies and fiefdoms. As a result of the 
lack of strong central governments, Europe could not provide the protection 
and stability merchants desired. It did not benefit from long distance Afro-
Eurasian trade as much as other regions did. 
Just as Hinduism provided cultural unity to a politically divided South 
Asia, Christianity became the one unifying force in central and western Europe. 
In 800, the pope demonstrated his power and authority by bestowing on the 
French king, Charlemagne, the title of “Emperor of the Romans.” However, 
European Christian unity would not endure. In 1054, it split into two branches, 
the Roman Catholic Church in the west and the Orthodox Church  in the 
east.  
In 1095, the Roman Catholic pope called for a Holy Crusade to free 
Jerusalem and the lands around it from Islamic control. The early crusaders 
had some limited success. But after two centuries of trying, the crusades failed 
to seize power. However, they had a large impact culturally. The Crusades 
made Europeans more aware of the achievements of the Middle East and the 
rest of Asia. This awareness was one factor in stimulating Europe to become 
more interested in intellectual and technological advances. 
lx WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONThe Americas
By the year 900, the Mayan golden age in Mesoamerica was ending. A 
combination of environmental degradation, drought, and warfare caused 
Mayans to abandon many of their cities. However, some Mayan cities, such as 
Chichen Itza, continued to be inhabited. 
Two other large civilizations developed in the Western Hemisphere during 
this time. One was the Mississippian  civilization, near present-day St. Louis. 
It flourished between the 8th century and the 16th century. Its city of Cahokia 
was a major trade hub with a population larger than that of London. 
The other was the Toltecs  civilization, which emerged in the 10th century 
in Mesoamerica. The Toltecs adopted many Mayan practices, including a 
religion that was both polytheistic and animistic. The Toltecs had a major 
influence on a later empire in the region, the Aztecs.

lxi PROLOGUEThe World in 1200
By 1200, much of the world had recovered from the decline of the classical 
civilizations. In many regions, new states were emerging that were promoting 
trade and the transfer of ideas among regions:
• Africa, Europe, and Asia were connected through Indian Ocean trade, 
the Silk Roads, and trans-Saharan trade routes.
• The Byzantine Empire and various Islamic empires provided some 
stability in the region from Eastern Europe through the Middle East to 
South Asia.
• China and Dar al-Islam continued to be leading centers of learning and 
innovation.
• Western Europe and Japan had decentralized systems of government 
that featured powerful land-owning nobles. 
• Africa largely remained stateless, except for some regions in West 
Africa and East Africa that were part of Dar al-Islam.
• Afro-Eurasia, America, and Oceania were developing in isolation from 
each other.
In 1200, people in Africa and Eurasia might have predicted that in the next 
three centuries, the regions of the world would remain on their paths. China 
would grow wealthier, Islamic states would become stronger, and Europe 
would continue to learn from other regions. However, few could have guessed 
that in the 13th century a little-known group of nomads from Central Asia 
would upend life in Eurasia. Then, in 1492, a voyage by a European would 
reshape the lives of people around the world.

Understand the Context
Between 1200 and 1450, several large empires emerged around the world. Some 
were modified revivals of earlier empires in their region. Others represented 
new developments. All were shaped by the context of regional trade, which had 
been increasing since around 600. 
The Revival of Large Empires  Between 1200 and 1450, the wealthiest 
and most innovative empire in the world was the Song Dynasty in China. It 
was the latest in a series of states that had ruled a unified and prosperous China. 
Similarly, in Mesoamerica, the rise of the Aztec was influenced by an earlier 
empire under the Mayans. Two other centers of great intellectual achievement, 
Baghdad and Spain, reflected the emphasis on learning in the Islamic world. 
However, in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, the growth of regional 
trade produced larger and more complex states than had previously existed in 
those regions. Trade across the Sahara resulted in the West African empires of 
Ghana and Mali. Trade in the Indian Ocean provided the context for large states 
in =imbabwe in East Africa and various states in India and Southeast Asia.
Unity in Central Eurasia  Shaping the context for events throughout 
Eurasia between 1200 and 150 was the remarkable emergence of the 
Mongols. A group of nomads from Central Asia, the Mongols conquered lands 
from central Europe to the Pacific Ocean, creating the largest land empire in 
human history. The conquest came with great devastation. However, the unity 
of so much territory under the rule of one group allowed trade to flourish once 
again across Eurasia, with new ideas and technology spreading easily. These 
developments set the stage for the intensifying  global interactions that helped 
define the period after 150.

DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIA 3
1.1
Developments in East Asia
From now on, our ordinances will be properly enforced  
and the morality of our people will be restored. 
—Ming Dynasty “Prohibition Ordinance” (1368–1644)
Essential Question:   How did developments in China and the rest of East 
Asia between c. 1200 and c. 1450 reflect continuity, 
innovation, and diversity? 
The Song Dynasty in China 60±12 was the leading example of diversity 
and innovation in Afro-Eurasia and the Americas during the 1th century. 
China enjoyed great wealth, political stability, and fine artistic and intellectual 
achievements. Neo-Confucian teachings, illustrated in the above quotation, 
supported the government and shaped social classes and the family system. 
In addition, China developed the greatest manufacturing capability in the 
world. However, the spread of Confucianism and Buddhism might be the most 
enduring testimony to Chinese influence. 
Government Developments in the Song Dynasty
The Song Dynasty  replaced the Tang in 60 and ruled for more than three 
centuries. They lost control of northern lands to invading pastoralists from 
Manchuria who set up the Jin Empire. Although the Song ruled a smaller region 
than the Tang, their reign was prosperous and under them the arts flourished.
Bureaucracy  China’s strength was partially the result of its imperial 
bureaucracy , a vast organization in which appointed officials carried 
out the empire’s policies. The bureaucracy had been a feature of Chinese  
government since the Qin dynasty (221 B.C.E.–207 B.C.E.). It represented a 
continuity across centuries and dynasties. Under the Song, China’s bureaucracy 
expanded. Early in the dynasty, this strengthened the dynasty.
Meritocracy and the Civil Service Exam  One of Emperor Song Taizu’s 
great achievements was that he expanded the educational opportunities to 
young men of the lower economic classes so they could score well on the civil 
service exams. By scoring well, a young man could obtain a highly desired job 
in the bureaucracy. These exams were based on knowledge of Confucian texts. 
Because officials obtained their positions by demonstrating their merit on these 
exams, China’s bureaucratic system was known as a meritocracy . Though 
4 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONthe poor were vastly underrepresented in the bureaucracy, the Chinese system 
allowed for more upward mobility than any other hiring system of its time. 
However, by the end of the Song, the bureaucracy had grown so large that it 
contributed to the empire’s weakness. By creating so many jobs and by paying 
these officials so handsomely, the Song increased the costs of government to 
the point that they began drying up China’s surplus wealth. 
Economic Developments in Postclassical China
The flourishing Tang Dynasty had successfully promoted agricultural 
development, improved roads and canals, encouraged foreign trade, and spread 
technology. These accomplishments led to rapid prosperity and population 
growth during the Song Dynasty. The Grand Canal  was an inexpensive and 
efficient internal waterway transportation system that extended over 0,000 
miles. Expanding the canal enabled China, under the Song Dynasty, to become 
the most populous trading area in the world. 
Gunpowder  Although gunpowder had been invented in China in previous 
dynasties, innovators in the Song Dynasty made the first guns. Over centuries, 
the technology of making gunpowder and guns spread from China to all parts 
of Eurasia via traders on the Silk Roads.

5 DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIA 5.ingdom in present-day 9ietnam, greatly expanded agricultural production in 
China. This rice and other strains developed through experimentation allowed 
farming to spread to lands where once rice could not grow, such as lowlands, 
riverbanks, and hills. In some areas, it also allowed farmers to grow two crops 
of rice per year, a summer crop and a winter crop. 
Innovative methods of production contributed to agricultural success. For 
example, Chinese farmers put manure both human and animal on the fields 
to enrich the soil. They built elaborate irrigation systems using ditches, water 
wheels, pumps, and terraces to increase productivity. New heavy plows pulled 
by water buffalo or oxen allowed previously unusable land to be cultivated.
The combination of these changes in agriculture produced an abundance 
of food. As a result, China’s population grew quickly. In the three centuries of 
Song Dynasty rule, China’s population increased from around 25 percent of 
the total world population to nearly 40 percent.
Manufacturing and Trade  Industrial production soared, as did China’s 
population. China’s discovery of “black earth”²coal²in the th century 
B.C.E. enabled it to produce greater amounts of cast iron goods. Though 
massive use of coal to power machines wouldn’t happened until the 18th 
century, China did have the greatest manufacturing capability in the world. 
The Chinese later learned how to take the carbon out of cast iron and began 
to manufacture steel. They used steel to make or reinforce bridges, gates, and 
ship anchors. They also used steel to make religious items, such as pagodas 
and Buddhist figurines. Steel also strengthened the agricultural equipment, 
contributing to the abundance of food production as well. 
Under the Song²and earlier than in Western Europe²China experienced 
proto-industrialization , a set of economic changes in which people in rural 
areas made more goods than they could sell. Unlike later industrialization, 
which featured large-scale production in factories using complex machinery, 
proto-industrialization relied more on home-based or community-based 
production using simple equipment. For example, artisans , or skilled 
craftworkers, produced steel and other products in widely dispersed smelting 
facilities under the supervision of the imperial government. Artisans also 
manufactured porcelain and silk that reached consumers through expanding 
trade networks, especially by sea. Porcelain was highly desired because it 
was light-weight yet strong. Further, it was light-colored, so it could be easily 
painted with elaborate designs.
The Chinese used the compass in maritime navigation, and they redesigned 
their ships to carry more cargo. China’s ability to print paper navigation 
charts made seafaring possible in open waters, out of sight of land, and sailors 
became less reliant on the sky for direction. 
China became the world’s most commercialized society. Its economy 
changed from local consumption to market production, with porcelains, 
textiles, and tea the chief exports. The Grand Canal supported a vibrant internal 
trade while advances in naval technology allowed China to control trade in 
the South China Sea. The military power of the Tang and Song enabled them 
to protect traders from bandits. 
6 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONTaxes  The Song also promoted the growth of a commercial economy by 
changing how they built public projects, such as roads and irrigation canals. 
Instead of requiring that people labor on these projects, the government paid 
people to work on them. This change increased the amount of money in 
circulation, promoting economic growth.
Tributes  Another source of income for the government came from the 
tributary system, an arrangement in which other states had to pay money or 
provide goods to honor the Chinese emperor. This system cemented China’s 
economic and political power over several foreign countries, but it also created 
stability and stimulated trade for all parties involved. The origins of the system 
existed in the Han Dynasty. By the time of the Song Dynasty, Japan, .orea, 
and kingdoms throughout southeast Asia were tributary states. The emperor 
expected representatives from tributary states to demonstrate their respect by 
performing a  kowtow,  a ritual in which anyone greeting the Chinese emperor 
must bow his or her head until it reached the floor. The Chinese sent out 
tremendous fleets led by =heng He to demonstrate the power of the emperor 
and to receive tribute. (Zheng He’s voyages are described in more detail in 
Topic 2..
Social Structures in China
Through most of Chinese history, the majority of people lived in rural areas. 
However, urban areas grew in prominence in this productive period. At the 
height of the Song Dynasty, China was the most urbanized land in the world, 
boasting several cities containing more than 100,000 people. The largest cities, 
Chang’an an ancient capital, Hangzhou at the southern end of the Grand 
Canal, and the port city of Guangzhou were cosmopolitan metropolises²
active centers of commerce with many entertainment options to of fer. 
China’s Class Structure  Though urbanization represented a significant 
development in China, life in rural areas grew more complex as well. The 
bureaucratic expansion created an entirely new social class, the scholar gentry . 
They soon outnumbered the aristocracy, which was comprised of landowners 
who inherited their wealth. The scholar gentry were educated in Confucian 
philosophy and became the most influential social class in China. 
Three other classes ranked below the scholar gentry: farmers, artisans, 
and merchants. The low status of merchants reflected Confucian respect for 
hard work and creating value. The tasks of merchants did not require physical 
strength or endurance, and they simply exchanged goods without growing or 
making anything new.
Lower rungs of Chinese society included peasants who worked for wealthy 
landowners, often to pay off debts, and the urban poor. The Song government 
provided aid to the poor and established public hospitals where people could 
receive free care.
Role of Women  Confucian traditions included both respect for women 
and the expectation that they would defer to men. This patriarchal pattern 
7 DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIAstrengthened during the Tang and Song dynasties. One distinctive constraint on 
women’s activities in China was the practice of foot binding , which became 
common among aristocratic families during the Song Dynasty. From a very 
young age, girls had their feet wrapped so tightly that the bones did not grow 
naturally. A bound foot signified social status, something suitors particularly 
desired. It also restricted women’s ability to move and hence to participate in 
the public sphere. Foot binding was finally banned in 112.
Intellectual and Cultural Developments
During the Tang and Song eras, China enjoyed affluence, a well-educated 
populace, and extensive contact with foreign nations. As a result, intellectual 
pursuits (technology, literature, and visual arts) thrived.
Paper and Printing  The Chinese had invented paper as early as the 2nd 
century C.E., and they developed a system of printing in the th century. They 
were the first culture to use woodblock printing . A Buddhist scripture produced 
in the th century is thought to be the world’s first woodblock printed work. 
For information on the Gutenberg press, a related technology, see Topic 1.6. 
In the Song era, printed booklets on how to farm efficiently were distributed 
throughout rice-growing regions.

With the development of woodblock printing in China, people could make multiple copies of art 
or written texts without laboriously copying each by hand.
8 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONReading and Poetry  The development of paper and printing expanded the 
availability of books. Though most peasants were illiterate, China’s privileged 
classes had increased access to literature. Confucian scholars not only 
consumed literature at a tremendous rate, they were also the major producers 
of literature throughout the era. The Tang and Song dynasties’ emphasis on 
schooling created generations of well-rounded scholar-bureaucrats. Later, 
Europeans with such diverse skills would be called “Renaissance men.”
Religious Diversity in China
Buddhism  had come to China from its birthplace in India via the Silk Roads. 
Its presence is evident during the anarchic period between the later Han and 
the Sui dynasties. However, its popularity became widespread during the Tang 
Dynasty. The th century Buddhist monk ;uanzang helped build Buddhism’s 
popularity in China. 
Buddhism and Daoism  Three forms of Buddhism from India came to 
shape Asia, each developing a different emphasis: 
• Theravada Buddhism  focused on personal spiritual growth through 
silent meditation and self-discipline. It became strongest in Southeast 
Asia.
• Mahayana Buddhism  focused on spiritual growth for all beings and 
on service. It became strongest in China and Korea.
• Tibetan Buddhism  focused on chanting. It became strongest in Tibet.
All three include a belief in the Four Noble Truths, which stress the idea 
that personal suffering can be alleviated by eliminating cravings or desires and 
by following Buddhist precepts. All three also embrace the Eight-Fold Path, 
the precepts including right speech, right livelihood, right effort, and right 
mindfulness that can lead to enlightenment or nirvana. 
Monks introduced Buddhism to the Chinese by relating its beliefs to Daoist 
principles. For example, Buddhism’s idea of dharma became translated as dao 
“the way”. Eventually, Buddhist doctrines combined with elements of Daoist 
traditions to create the syncretic , or fused, faith Chan Buddhism , also known 
as Zen Buddhism . Like Daoism, =en Buddhism emphasized direct experience 
and meditation as opposed to formal learning based on studying scripture. 
Because of its fusion with Chinese beliefs, Buddhism became very popular 
in China. Monasteries²buildings where monks lived together²appeared in 
most major cities. 
The presence of these monasteries became a problem for the Tang 
bureaucracy. Many leaders of the Tang Dynasty, which considered itself the 
“Middle .ingdom,” had trouble accepting that a foreign religion would have 
such prominence in society. Buddhism’s popularity, which drew individuals 
away from China’s native religions, made Daoists and Confucians jealous. 
Despite monasteries’ closures and land seizures, however, Chan Buddhism 
remained popular among ordinary Chinese citizens.
9 DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIABuddhism and Neo-Confucianism  The Song Dynasty was somewhat 
more friendly towards Buddhism, but it did not go out of its way to promote 
the religion. It preferred to emphasize China’s native traditions, such 
as Confucianism. However, Buddhism had a strong presence and many 
Confucians began to adopt its ideals into their daily lives. The development 
of printing had made Buddhist scriptures widely available to the Confucian 
scholar gentry. The Song Dynasty benefited from the Confucian idea of filial 
piety , the duty of family members to subordinate their desires to those of the 
male head of the family and to the ruler. The emphasis on respect for one’s 
elders helped the Song maintain their rule in China.  
Neo-Confucianism  evolved in China between 0 and 80. It was a 
syncretic system, combining rational thought with the more abstract ideas of 
Daoism and Buddhism. This new incarnation of Confucianism emphasized 
ethics rather than the mysteries of God and nature. It became immensely 
popular in the countries in China’s orbit, including Japan, .orea, and 9ietnam.
Comparing Japan, Korea, and Vietnam
An important dynamic in the histories of Japan, .orea, and 9ietnam was 
each country’s relationship with China. When China was unified, its political 
strength, economic wealth, religious traditions, intellectual advances, and 
technological innovations made the world’s most powerful realm. Its smaller 
neighbors benefited from being so close to China but faced a challenge of 
maintaining their own distinctive cultures. Each had to confront the issue of 
sinification, or the assimilation of Chinese traditions and practices.
Japan
Since Japan was separated from China by a sea rather than land, it had more 
ability to control its interactions with China than .orea or 9ietnam could. The 
impact of Chinese culture appeared in many aspects of life:
• Japan’s Prince Shotoku Taishi 5±622 promoted Buddhism and 
Confucianism along with Japan’s traditional Shinto religion. During 
this era, Japan learned how to do woodblock printing from China. 
• During the Heian period  ±1185 Japan emulated Chinese 
traditions in politics, art, and literature. 
• However, Japanese writers also moved in new directions. For example, 
in the 11th century, a Japanese writer composed the world’s first novel, 
The Tale of Genji.  It is the story of a Japanese prince and his life at 
court, particularly his many romances. 
Feudalism For hundreds of years, Japan had been a feudal society without 
a centralized government. Landowning aristocrats, the daimyo , battled for 
control of land, while the majority of people worked as rice fa rmers. 
10 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONJapanese feudalism was similar to European feudalism, which is described 
in Topic 1.6. Both featured very little social mobility, and both systems were 
built upon hereditary hierarchies. In Japan, peasants, known as serfs, were born 
into lives of economic dependency, while samurai were born into their roles as 
protectors and daimyo were born into lives of privilege. In Europe, the three 
groups were serfs, knights, and nobles.
What distinguishes Japanese feudalism from that of Europe was that the 
daimyo enjoyed much more power than the nobility in Europe did. The daimyo 
ruled over vast stretches of land and, in reality, were more powerful than 
either the emperor or the shogun. By contrast, Europe’s hierarchy placed the 
monarch above the nobility. Though there were periods when authority of the 
monarch waned and power was distributed among nobility, the main centralized 
power structure of European feudalism would not change until the Modern  
Industrial Era. 
In Europe, the ideal knight held to the code of chivalry, with duty to 
countrymen, duty to God, and duty to women, the last expressed through 
courtly love and the virtues of gentleness and graciousness. In Japan, the code 
was known as bushido  and stressed frugality, loyalty, the martial arts, and 
honor unto death.
Japan also differed from China in how it was governed. China was ruled by 
an emperor who oversaw a large civilian bureaucracy. For much of its history, 
China had a central government strong enough to promote trade and peace. In 
contrast, when the Heian court declined, a powerful land-owning family, the 
Minamoto clan, took charge. In 1192, the Minamoto installed a shogun, or 
military ruler, to reign. Though Japan still had an emperor, he had little power. 
For the following four centuries, Japan suffered from regional rivalries among 
aristocrats. Not until the 17th century would shoguns create a strong central 
government that could unify the country. (Connect: In a paragraph, explain 
how Buddhism and Confucianism influenced the development of Chinese 
governments in the period from 1200 to 150. See Prologue.
Korea
Korea’s location gave it a very direct relationship with China. The countries 
shared a land boundary, and China extended both the north and south of .orea.
Similarity to China  Through its tributary relationship, Korea and China 
were in close contact. Thus, .orea emulated many aspects of China’s politics 
and culture. It centralized its government in the style of the Chinese. Culturally, 
.oreans adopted both Confucian and Buddhist beliefs. The educated elite 
studied Confucian classics, while Buddhist doctrine attracted the peasant 
masses. Koreans adopted the Chinese writing system, which proved to be 
very awkward. The Chinese and Korean languages remained structurally very 
different. In the 15th century, .orea developed its own writing system. 
Powerful Aristocracy  One important difference between .orea and 
China was that the landed aristocracy were more powerful in .orea than in 
11 DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIAChina. As a result, the .orean elite were able to prevent certain Chinese reforms 
from ever being implemented. For example, though there was a .orean civil 
service examination, it was not open to peasants. Thus, there was no truly 
merit-based system for entering the bureaucracy.
Vietnam
Like Japan and .orea, 9ietnam traded with and learned from China. For 
example, 9ietnam adapted the Chinese writing system and architectural styles. 
However, 9ietnam had a more adversarial relationship with China. At times, 
the 9ietnamese launched violent rebellions against Chinese influence.
Gender and Social Structure  9ietnamese culture differed from Chinese 
culture in several ways, which explains the strong resistance to Chinese power. 
For example, 9ietnamese women enjoyed greater independence in their married 
lives than did Chinese women in the Confucian tradition. While the Chinese 
lived in extended families, the 9ietnamese preferred nuclear families  (just a 
wife, husband, and their children. 9ietnamese villages operated independently 
of a national government political centralization was nonexistent.
Although 9ietnam adopted a merit-based bureaucracy of educated men, 
the 9ietnamese system did not function like the Chinese scholar-bureaucracy. 
Instead of loyalty to the emperor, scholar-officials in 9ietnam owed more 
allegiance to the village peasants. In fact, 9ietnamese scholar-officials often led 
revolts against the government if they deemed it too oppressive. 9ietnamese 
women resented their inferior status under the Chinese. In particularly, they 
rejected the customs of foot binding and polygyny , the practice of having more 
than one wife at the same time. In spite of 9ietnamese efforts to maintain the 
purity of their own culture, sinification did occur.
Military Conflict with China  As the Tang Dynasty began to crumble in 
the 8th century, 9ietnamese rebels pushed out China’s occupying army. In their 
battles against the Chinese, they showed a strong capacity for guerilla warfare, 
perhaps due to their deep knowledge of their own land.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“The Moral Nature
Being upright and modest, reserved and quiet, correct and dignified, sincere 
and honest: these constitute the moral nature of a woman. Being filial and 
respectful, humane and perspicacious >shrewd, wise@, loving and warm, meek

Cultivation of the Self
. . . Now if the self is not cultivated, then virtue will not be established. If 
one’s virtue is not established, rarely can one be an influence for good in 
the family±how much less in the wider world. Therefore, the wife is one 
who follows her husband. The way of husband and wife is the principle of 
the strong and the weak. In the past, the reason why enlightened monarchs 
were careful about establishing marriage was that they valued the way of 
procreation and perpetuation. >The rise and fall of the state is intimately 
linked to the prosperity or decline of the family.@”

14 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   C O N T E XTUALIZE HISTORICAL  
DEVELOPMENTS
To contextualize is to look at an event, development, or process in 
history within the situation, or context, in which it occurs. After you 
place events in context, you begin to see themes and patterns emerge 
in history. Historians use these themes and patterns to understand the 
interactions of laws, institutions, culture, events, and people. 
For example, one way to understand the Song Dynasty’s success from 
960 to 1279 is to place its political, social, and economic development 
in the context of what came before and after it. In the context of what 
came before, the imperial bureaucracy represents a political continuity, 
since the bureaucratic system had been in place in earlier dynasties as 
well. However, its modification under the Song to allow more upward 
mobility represents a change. Similarly, considering the Song imperial 
bureaucracy in the economic context of what came after, you might gain 
insights into causation. That is, the cost of supporting the bureaucracy 
drained China of its wealth, which in turn helped create problems that 
led to the decline of the Song Dynasty. Contextualizing also promotes 
understanding of comparisons among different cultures and time 
periods. 
Explain how the passage below provides context for the spread of 
Buddhism in China in light of other developments of the time. 
In 62, a Chinese Buddhist monk named ;uanzang left China to go 
on a pilgrimage to India, the birthplace of Buddhism. He traveled west 
on the Silk Roads to Central Asia, then south and east to India, which 
he reached in 60. Along the way and in India he met many Buddhist 
monks and visited Buddhist shrines. In order to gain more insight into 
Buddhism, he studied for years in Buddhist monasteries and at Nalanda 
University in Bilar, India²a famous center of Buddhist knowledge. 
After 1 years away, ;uanzang finally returned to China, where people 
greeted him as a celebrity. He brought back many Buddhist texts, which 
he spent the rest of his life translating into Chinese. These writings were 
highly instrumental in the growth of Buddhist scholarship in China.

DEVELOPMENTS IN DAR AL-ISLAM 15
1.2
Developments in Dar al-Islam
Allah will admit those who embrace the true faith and do good works  
to gardens watered by running streams.
—The Quran, Chapter 47
Essential Question:   In the period from c. 1200 to c. 1450, how did Islamic 
states arise, and how did major religious systems 
shape society?
After the death of Muhammad  in 62, Islam spread rapidly outward 
from Arabia. Through military actions and the activities of merchants and 
missionaries, Islam’s reach extended from India to Spain. As the quotation 
suggests, many Islamic leaders showed tolerance to Christians, Jews, and 
others who believed in a single god and did good works. Under the Abbasid 
Empire, scholars traveled from far away to Baghdad to study at a renowned 
center of learning known as the House of Wisdom . The Islamic community 
helped transfer knowledge throughout Afro-Eurasia. When the Abbasids 
declined, they were replaced by other Islamic states. 
Invasions and Shifts in Trade Routes
In the 1100s and 1200s, the  Abbasid Empire confronted many challenges. Like 
the Chinese, they had conflicts with nomadic groups in Central Asia. Unlike 
the Chinese, they also confronted European invaders. 
Egyptian Mamluks  Arabs often purchased enslaved people, or Mamluks , 
who were frequently ethnic Turks from Central Asia, to serve as soldiers and 
later as bureaucrats. Because of their roles, Mamluks had more opportunities 
for advancement than did most enslaved people. In Egypt, Mamluks seized 
control of the government, establishing the Mamluk Sultanate (1250–1517). 
They prospered by facilitating trade in cotton and sugar between the Islamic 
world and Europe. However, when the Portuguese and other Europeans 
developed new sea routes for trade, the Mamluks declined in power . 
Seljuk Turks  Another challenge to the Abbasids came from the Central 
Asian Seljuk Turks , who were also Muslims. Starting in the 11th century, they 
began conquering parts of the Middle East, eventually extending their power 
almost as far east as Western China. The Seljuk leader called himself sultan , 
thereby reducing the role of the highest-ranking Abbasid from caliph to chief 
Sunni religious authority.
16 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONCrusaders  The Abbasids allowed Christians to travel easily to and 
from their holy sites in and around Jerusalem. However, the Seljuk Turks 
limited this travel. European Christians organized groups of soldiers, called 
Crusaders , to reopen access. (See Topic 1.6.) 
Mongols  The fourth group to attack the Abbasid Empire were among the 
most famous conquerors in history: the Mongols . (See Topic 2.2.) Like many 
Mamluks and the Seljuk Turks, they came from Central Asia. The Mongols 
conquered the remaining Abbasid Empire in 1258 and ended the Seljuk rule. 
They continued to push westward but were stopped in Egypt by the Mamluks.
Economic Competition  Since the 8th century, the Abbasids had been an 
important link connecting Asia, Europe, and North Africa. Goods and ideas 
flowed from one region to another on trade routes controlled by the Abbasids. 
Many went through Baghdad . However, trade patterns slowly shifted to 
routes farther north. As Baghdad lost its traditional place at the center of trade, 
it lost wealth and population. It could not afford to keep its canals repaired. 
Farmers could not provide enough food for the urban population. Slowly, the 
infrastructure that had made Baghdad a great city fell into decay .
Cultural and Social Life
Over time, the Islamic world fragmented politically. Many of these new states 
adopted Abbasid practices, but they were distinct ethnically. The Abbasid 
Caliphate  was led by Arabs and Persians, but the later Islamic states were 
shaped by Turkic peoples who descended from people in Central Asia. For 
example, the Mamluks in North Africa, the Seljuks in the Middle East, and 
the Delhi Sultanate in South Asia were all at least partially Turkic. By the 
16th century, three large Islamic states had their roots in Turkic cultures: the 
Ottoman Empire in Turkey, the Safavid Empire in Persia, and the Mughal 
Empire in India. See Topic .1. 
However, these Islamic states continued to form a cultural region. Trade 
spread new goods and fresh ideas. The common use of shariah created similar 
legal systems. Great universities in Baghdad, Iraq Cyrdoba, Spain Cairo, 
Egypt and Bukhara in Central Asia created centers for sharing intellectual 
innovations.
Cultural Continuities  Islamic scholars followed the advice of the 
prophet Muhammad: “Go in quest of knowledge even unto China.” By 
learning from many cultures, they carried on the work of earlier thinkers:
• They translated Greek literary classics into Arabic, saving the works 
of Aristotle and other Greek thinkers from oblivion. 
• They studied mathematics texts from India and transferred the 
knowledge to Europeans.
• They adopted techniques for paper-making from China. Through 
them, Europeans learned to make paper. 
17 DEVELOPMENTS IN DAR AL-ISLAM 17Cultural Innovations  In addition to building on the intellectual 
achievements of other cultures, scholars during the “golden age” in Baghdad 
made their own achievements. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi  (1201–1274) was one 
of the most celebrated Islamic scholars. He contributed to astronomy, law, 
logic, ethics, mathematics, philosophy, and medicine. An observatory built 
under his direction was the most advanced in the world and produced the most 
accurate astronomical charts. He studied the relationship between the lengths 
of the sides of a triangle and the angles. This laid the groundwork for making 
trigonometry a separate subject. Medical advances and hospital care improved 
in cities such as Cairo, while doctors and pharmacists studied for examinations 
for licenses that would allow them to practice.
Ibn .haldun 12±106 was well known for his historical accounts and 
is widely acknowledged as a founder of the fields of historiography the study 
of the methods of historians and sociology. 
Sufi poet and mystic ‘A’ishah al-Ba’uniyyah  (1460–1507) may be the 
most prolific female Muslim writer before the 20th century. Her best-known 
work, a long poem honoring Muhammad called “Clear Inspiration, on Praise of 
the Trusted One,” refers to many previous poets, reflecting her broad learning. 
Many of her works describe her journey toward mystical illumination. 
µA’ishah’s poetry reflects a contrast between most Muslims and Sufis. 
Unlike Muslims who focused on intellectual pursuits, such as the study of the 
Quran, Sufis emphasized introspection to grasp truths that they believed could 
not be understood through learning. Sufism may have begun as a mystical 
response to the perceived love of luxury by the early Umayyad Caliphate.
Sufi missionaries played an important role in the spread of Islam. They 
tended to adapt to local cultures and traditions, sometimes interweaving local 
religious elements into Islam, and in this way they won many converts.  
Commerce, Class, and Diversity  Helping to power the golden age of 
natural and moral philosophy and the arts was commerce. Islamic society 
viewed merchants as more prestigious than did other societies in Europe and 
Asia at the time. Muhammad himself had been a merchant, as had his first 
wife. With the revival of trade on Silk Roads, merchants could grow rich from 
their dealings across the Indian Ocean and Central Asia. They were esteemed 
as long as they maintained fair dealings and gave to charity in accord with the 
pillars of the Islamic faith. Some merchants were even sent out as missionaries.  
In the non-Arab areas of Islamic expansion, control by Islamic caliphs led 
to discrimination against non-Arabs, though rarely to open persecution. This 
discrimination gradually faded in the th century. The caliph’s soldiers were 
forbidden to own territory they had conquered. The presence of a permanent 
military force that kept order but did not own property allowed life for most 
of the inhabitants of the countryside to remain virtually unchanged. However, 
people paid tribute to Islamic caliphs rather than to Byzantine rulers.
Slavery  Islam prohibited Muslims from enslaving other Muslims or 
monotheists such as Jews, Christians, and =oroastrians. See Prologue. 
However, it permitted enslaving others. Muslims often imported enslaved 
18 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONpeople from Africa, .ievan Rus present-day Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, 
and Central Asia, but the institution of hereditary slavery had not developed. 
Many enslaved people converted to Islam, after which their owners freed them. 
Enslaved women might find themselves serving as concubines to Islamic 
men who already had wed their allotment of four wives. They were allowed 
more independence²for example, to go to markets and to run errands²than 
the legal wives. Only enslaved women were permitted to dance or perform 
musically before unrelated men. This opportunity to earn money sometimes 
enabled females in slavery to accumulate enough to buy their freedom. 
Free Women in Islam
Some practices now associated with Islam were common cultural customs in 
Central Asia and the Byzantine Empire before the time of Muhammad. For 
example, women often covered their heads and faces. This practice solidified 
under Islam, with most women observing  hijab,  a term that can refer either to 
the practice of dressing modestly or to a specific type of covering. Men often 
wore head coverings, from turbans to skull caps. While women could study 
and read, they were not to do so in the company of men not related to them.
Muhammad’s Policies  Muhammad raised the status of women in several 
ways. He treated his wives with love and devotion. He insisted that dowries, 
the payments prospective husbands made to secure brides, be paid to the 
future wife rather than to her father. He forbade female infanticide, the killing 
of newborn girls. Muhammad’s first wife was educated and owned her own 
business, which set a pattern for the recognition of women’s abilities. 
The Status of Women  Overall, Islamic women enjoyed a higher status 
than Christian or Jewish women. Islamic women were allowed to inherit 
property and retain ownership after marriage. They could remarry if widowed, 
and they could receive a cash settlement if divorced. Under some conditions, 
a wife could initiate divorce. Moreover, women could practice birth control. 
Islamic women who testified in a court under shariah see Topic . were to 
be protected from retaliation, but their testimony was worth only half that of 
a man. One gap in the historical record is written evidence of how women 
viewed their position in society: most of the records created before 150 were 
written by men.
The rise of towns and cities in Islamic-ruled areas resulted in new 
limitations on women’s rights, just as it did in other cultures. The new status 
of women might best be symbolized by the veil and the harem, a  dwelling set 
aside for wives, concubines, and the children of these women.
Islamic Rule in Spain
While the Umayyads ruled only briefly in the Middle East, they kept power 
longer in Spain. In 11, after Muslim forces had defeated Byzantine armies 
across North Africa, they successfully invaded Spain from the south. They 
designated Cyrdoba as their capital for Spain. 
19 DEVELOPMENTS IN DAR AL-ISLAMBattle of Tours  The Islamic military was turned back in 2 when it lost 
the Battle of Tours against Frankish forces. This defeat, rare for Islamic armies 
during the 00s, marked the limit of rapid Islamic expansion into Western 
Europe. Most of the continent remained Christian, but Muslims ruled Spain 
for the next seven centuries. (Connect:  In a paragraph, compare the status of 
women in Chinese society to the status of women in Islamic society in the 
period c. 1200 to c. 1450.)
Prosperity Under Islam  Like the Abbasids in Baghdad, the Umayyad 
rulers in Cyrdoba created a climate of toleration, with Muslims, Christians, 
and Jews coexisting peacefully. They also promoted trade, allowing Chinese 
and Southeast Asian products to enter into Spain and thus into the rest of 
Europe. Many of the goods in this trade traveled aboard ships called dhows. 
These ships, first developed in India or China, had long, thin hulls that made 
them excellent for carrying goods, though less useful for conducting warfare. 
Cultural and Scholarly Transfers  The Islamic state in Spain, known 
as al-Andalus, became a center of learning. Cyrdoba had the largest library in 
the world at the time. Among the famous scholars from Spain was Ibn Rushd , 
known in Europe as Averroes 12th century. He wrote influential works on 
law, secular philosophy, and the natural sciences. 
The Muslims, Christians, and Jews living in al-Andalus²all “people of 
the book” as Muslims regarded them²not only tolerated one another but also 
influenced one another. For example, Ibn Rushd’s commentaries on Aristotle 
influenced the Jewish philosopher Maimonides c. 115±c. 120. Maimonides 
developed a synthesis of Aristotle’s reasoning and biblical interpretation. He, 
in turn, influenced Christian philosophers, including St. Thomas Aquinas 
1225±12. Islamic scholarship and scientific innovations, along with the 
knowledge transferred from India and China, laid the groundwork for the 
Renaissance and Scientific Revolution in Europe. For example, making paper, 
a technology developed in China and taught to Europeans by Muslims, was 
vital to spreading ideas in Europe.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“I paid a visit to the tomb of John the son of =echariah >a figure in the Christian 
Bible@²God’s blessing on both of them²in the village of Sebastea in the 
province of Nablus >a region in the Middle East near the Jordan River@. After 
saying my prayers, I came out into the square that was bounded on one side 
by the Holy Precinct >a place of worship@. I found a half-closed gate, opened it 
and entered a church. Inside were about ten old men, their bare heads as white 
as combed cotton. They were facing east, and wore on their chests >wooden 
sticks@ ending in crossbars turned up like the rear of a saddle. They took their 
oath on this sign and gave hospitality to those who needed it. The sight of 
their piety touched my heart, but at the same time it displeased and saddened 
me, for I had never seen such zeal and devotion among the Muslims. 
For some time I brooded on this experience, until one day, as Mu’in ad-Din 
and I were passing . . . he said to me: ‘I want to dismount here and visit the 
Old Men >people who practice severe self-discipline@.’
‘Certainly,’ I replied, and we dismounted and went into a long building set at 
an angle to the road. For the moment I thought there was no one there. Then 
I saw about a hundred prayer mats, and on each a sufi, his face expressing 
peaceful serenity, and his body humble devotion. This was a reassuring sight, 
and I gave thanks to Almighty God that there were among the Muslims men 
of even more zealous devotion than those Christian priests. Before this I had 
never seen sufis in their monastery, and was ignorant of the way they lived.”

Unit 1 is called “The Global Tapestry” to suggest that world history 
is a complex interweaving of different threads from different parts of 
the world at different times. However, to fully appreciate the whole, 
historians try to unravel the tapestry thread by thread to see just how each 
fits in. As they do, they use such historical concepts  as change, continuity, 
perspective, cause and effect, significance, and empathy. Applying 
these concepts, they come to understand historical developments ²
patterns of changes or growth over time. To see these patterns, they look 
at subjects in historical context²how did they start out, and what did 
they become over time" Historians also try to understand the historical 
processes  that made certain developments possible, such as migration, 
industrialization, conquest, and state building.

Developments in South and 
Southeast Asia
What the books taught me, I’ve practised.  
What they didn’t teach me, I’ve taught myself.  
I’ve gone into the forest and wrestled with the lion.  
I didn’t get this far by teaching one thing and doing another.
—Lal Ded (1320–1392)
Essential Question:   How did various beliefs and practices in South and 
Southeast Asia affect society and the development  
of states?
The poetry of Lal Ded, known as Mother Lalla, illustrates a major cross-
interaction between religious traditions that shaped the history of South and 
Southern Asia. She was born in .ashmir, a region of northern India. While a 
Hindu, her emphasis on experience appealed to many Muslims, particularly 
Sufis. The interaction of Hindus and Muslims, though sometimes violent,  
created dynamic developments in religious thought, politics, economics, art, 
and architecture. Despite the strong Islamic presence in the region, local Hindu 
kingdoms continued to play a major role in India’s decentralized political 
landscape. A third religion, Buddhism, also had a strong presence in the area, 
particularly in the Sinhala dynasties in present-day Sri Lanka and the great 
kingdoms of Southeast Asia. 
Political Structures in South Asia
South Asia was only occasionally united as a single state in its history. After 
the Gupta Dynasty that had dominated South Asia collapsed in 550, ending 
the so-called Golden Age or Classical Era of Indian history, disunity returned 
to the region for most of the next 1,000 years. Northern and southern India 
developed separate political structures. However, Hinduism provided some 
cultural unity throughout the region. Many people combined their own local 
faith tradition with adherence to the same scriptures and core beliefs respected 
throughout the region. 
Political Structures in Southern India  Southern India was more stable 
than northern India. The first kingdom, the Chola Dynasty, reigned over 
southern India for more than 00 years 850±126. During the 11th century, 
24 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONthe dynasty extended its rule to Ceylon, the large island just south of India. 
(Today it is known as Sri Lanka.) 
The second kingdom, the Vijayanagara Empire 16 –1646)  took its 
name from the word for “the victorious city.” It began with the arrival of two 
brothers, Harihara and Bukka, from the Delhi Sultanate in north-central India. 
They were sent to the area because the Delhi Sultanate wished to extend its 
rule to southern India. These brothers had been born as Hindus and converted 
to Islam for the sake of upward mobility. When they left the region controlled 
by the Delhi Sultanate, they once again embraced the religion of their birth 
and established their own Hindu kingdom. The 9ijayanagar Empire existed 
from the mid-100s until the mid-1500s, when a group of Muslim kingdoms 
overthrew it.
Political Structures in Northern India  Northern India experienced a 
great deal more upheaval than did southern India. After the fall of the Gupta 
Empire (see Prologue ), the Rajput kingdoms gradually formed in northern 
India and present-day Pakistan. These were Hindu kingdoms led by leaders 
of numerous clans who were often at war with one another. Because of the 
competition among clans, no centralized government arose, once again 
demonstrating the diversity and the regionalism of South Asia. The lack of a 
centralized power left the kingdoms vulnerable to Muslim attacks.
While the Himalayas protected India from invasions from the north and 
east, mountain passes in the northwest allowed invasions by Muslim armies. 
Each attack disrupted a region that had been mostly Hindu and Buddhist. Over 
time, the Islamic presence in the region grew:
• In the 8th century, Islamic armies invaded what is today Pakistan. 
However, they brought little change to everyday life. Located on the 
eastern fringes of the Dar al-Islam, the region was isolated from the 
center of the culture. In addition, the Rajput princes skillfully wielded 
their power to limit the Muslim conquerors’ influence.
• In the 11th century, Islamic forces plundered northern India’s Hindu 
temples and Buddhist shrines for their riches. In addition, they erected 
mosques on Hindu and Buddhist holy sites²much to the anger of 
followers of those faiths. 
In the early 1th century, Islamic forces managed to conquer the city of 
Delhi and much of the northern portion of South Asia. Bringing Islam into 
India, the Delhi Sultanate  reigned for 00 years, from the 1th through the 16th 
centuries. The interaction of Islam and Hinduism in northern India dominated 
the political history of the era. While some Hindus converted to Islam, others 
resented  Muslims and considered them foreigners. One factor contributing to 
this resentment was that the Delhi Sultanate imposed a tax, called the jizya, on 
all non-Muslim subjects of the empire. 
Throughout its reign, the Delhi Sultanate never organized an efficient 
bureaucracy in the style of the Chinese. For this reason, sultans had difficulty 
imposing their policies in a land as vast and diverse as India. Despite the strong 
25 DEVELOPMENTS IN SO UTH AN D SOUTHEAST ASIA 25Islamic presence in the region, local kingdoms continued to play a major role 
in India’s decentralized political landscape.
The sultans wanted to extend their rule southward. Before they succeeded, 
though, they became focused on defending themselves from an onslaught 
by the Mongol army from the northwest. The Delhi Sultanate prevented the 
Mongols themselves from conquering South Asia. However, in 1526, the 
sultans lost power to a new empire, the Mughals, whose leaders did trace their 
ancestry to the Mongols. 
Religion in South Asia
Religion always held a dominant place in South Asian history. Before the 
arrival of Islam, most South Asians practiced Hinduism, while a smaller 
number identified themselves as Buddhists. South Asians encountered a 
starkly different religion when Islam arrived. 
• Hindus pray to many gods, while Islam is strictly monotheistic. 
• Hindu temples and artwork are replete with pictures of deities, while 
Muslims disapprove of any visual representation of Allah. 
• Hinduism was associated with a hierarchical caste system, while Islam 
has always called for the equality of all believers. 
• Hindus recognize several sacred texts, while Muslims look to only the 
Quran for spiritual guidance.
The Arrival of Islam  The relationship between Hindus and Muslims 
shaped the history of South Asia beginning in the th century, and it continues 
to shape regional culture and politics today. Islam initially entered India 
forcefully yet eventually took on a more peaceful approach. But while Islam 
was a universalizing religion, one that wanted to proselytize , or actively seek 
converts, Muslim rulers found early in their reign that forcing their Hindu and 
Buddhist subjects to convert was not successful. Thus, most converts came to 
Islam voluntarily. Many Muslim merchants in the Indian Ocean trade moved 
to Indian port cities and married. Their wives often ended up converting to 
their husband’s religion. 
With its emphasis on the equality of all believers, Islam also attracted 
low-caste Hindus who hoped that conversion would improve their social 
status. In this sense, Islam in India was like Christianity in the Roman Empire. 
Both appealed to the people who suffered the most under the existing social 
structure. 
The largest numbers of converts to Islam, however, were Buddhists. 
Corruption among the monks and raids on monasteries by early Muslim 
conquerors left the Buddhist religion disorganized. The spread of Islam helped 
make Buddhism a minority religion in its place of birth. (Connect: Make an 
outline comparing the spread of Islam in South Asia to the spread of Buddhism 
in China. See Topic 1.1.)
26 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONSocial Structures in South Asia
The arrival of Islam did little to alter the basic structure of society in South 
Asia. India’s caste system is its strongest historical continuity. While obviously 
inequitable, it lent stability to a politically decentralized land. The caste system 
was flexible and able to accommodate newcomers. Muslim merchants and 
migrants, even though they were not Hindu, found a place for themselves 
within the caste hierarchy based on their occupation. These subcastes based 
on occupation operated like workers’ guilds, soon becoming absorbed into the 
social fabric of Indian society. Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the caste 
system in South Asia to the social structures in China in the period from 1200 
to 1450. See Topic 1.1.)
At the same time, most of those who tried to escape the grip of the caste 
system failed. The low-caste Hindus who converted to Islam as a way to improve 
their social status usually did not achieve that goal. Individuals required more 
education and opportunities for better jobs, not just a new religion, to help 
them escape their low status in life. 
As Islam spread, Muslims varied how they applied its core teachings, 
depending on their culture before converting. For example, Islam did not alter 
gender relations greatly. In South Asia, women in the Hindu tradition were 
confined to a separate social sphere, and Islamic women received similar 
treatment. In Southeast Asia, women enjoyed more independence before the 
arrival of Islam. This pattern continued as people became Muslims. Thus, 
converts in South and Southeast Asia found ways to accommodate a new faith, 
but most people did not reject their traditions in the process.
Cultural Interactions in South Asia
People in South Asia and the Middle East shared their intellectual and 
cultural achievements with each other. For example, Arab astronomers 
and mathematicians added to the body of knowledge begun by their Indian 
counterparts. Indian developments in algebra and geometry were translated 
into Arabic, and spread throughout Dar al-Islam. One result of this movement 
of ideas was that the numeral system referred to in the West as “Arabic 
numerals,” actually originated in India.
In India itself, sultans erected buildings melding the intricate artistic details 
of Hindu art with the geometric patterns preferred by Islamic architecture. The 
city of Delhi is filled with examples of Islamic architecture built during the Delhi 
Sultanate. One famous example, the Qutub Minar , stands in the southern part 
of the city. Rulers from the Delhi Sultanate built an elaborate mosque on top 
of a Hindu temple and used materials for the mosque from nearby Hindu and 
other religious shrines. Towering over the mosque is the Qutub Minar itself, a 
gigantic leaning tower, the tallest structure in India today. Historians debate the 
reason for its construction one obvious function is its presence as a symbol of 
Islamic influence and, at one time, dominance of northern India. 
27 DEVELOPMENTS IN SO UTH AN D SOUTHEAST ASIAAn entirely new language developed among Muslims of South Asia: 
Urdu . Urdu melded the grammatical pattern of Hindi the language of 
Northern Indians, and with the vocabulary of Arabic and some elements 
of Farsi the language of Persians. Today, Urdu is the official language of 
Pakistan. 
The Bhakti Movement  Beginning in the 12th century, some Hindus 
began to draw upon traditional teachings about the importance of emotion in 
their spiritual life. Rather than emphasize studying texts or performing rituals, 
they focused on developing a strong attachment to a particular deity. This 
development, known as the Bhakti Movement , started in southern India. It  
was especially appealing to many believers because it did not discriminate 
against women or people of low social status. For example, one of the most 
famous figures of the Bhakti Movement would be a female, the poet  Mira Bai, 
who lived in the 16th century.
Though the bhaktis were Hindus, they were similar in some ways to 
Sufi Muslims. Both groups were mystical movements, ones that emphasized 
inner reflection in order to achieve a direct personal relationship with a deity. 
Because they placed less emphasis on strict adherence to traditional rituals 
and beliefs, bhaktis and Sufis each appealed to people outside their traditions. 
Just as the Sufis helped spread Islam, the Bhaktis helped spread Hinduism.

28 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONSoutheast Asia
Like China, South Asia strongly influenced its neighbors, particularly the 
lands of Southeast Asia²today’s Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, 
Laos, and 9ietnam. Indian merchants had contact with these Southeast Asian 
lands as early as 500 B.C.E. The merchants sold gold, silver, metal goods, 
and textiles in the region and brought back its fine spices. Trade voyages 
introduced the Indian religions of Hinduism and Buddhism to Southeast Asia.  
Much of the region became and remains today mostly Buddhist. The region, 
like Southwest Asia, was strategically significant. Whoever controlled this 
region could influence the valuable trade between South Asia and East Asia. 
Sea-Based Kingdoms  Because Southeast Asia was so important, several 
kingdoms emerged there. Two were particularly long-lasting:  
• The Srivijaya Empire  (670–1025) was a Hindu kingdom based on 
Sumatra. It built up its navy and prospered by charging fees for ships 
traveling between India and China. 
• The Majapahit Kingdom  12±1520 based on Java had 8 
tributaries at its height. Like Srivijaya, Majapahit sustained its power 
by controlling sea routes. Unlike Srivijaya, Majapahit was Buddhist. 
Land-Based Kingdoms  Other kingdoms in Southeast Asia drew power 
from their control over land. The Sinhala dynasties in Sri Lanka had their 
roots in the arrival of early immigrants, most likely merchants, from north 
India. Buddhists arrived in the rd century B.C.E. and the island became a 
center of Buddhist study. Monasteries and nunneries flourished. Both men and 
women found a life of contemplation and simple living attractive. 
Buddhism was so deeply embedded that Buddhist priests often served as 
advisors to the monarchs. The government of one of the kingdoms oversaw 
the construction of a network of reservoirs and canals to create an excellent 
irrigation system, which contributed to economic growth. However, attacks 
by invaders from India and conflicts between the monarchy and the priests 
ultimately weakened the kingdoms.
The Khmer Empire , also known as the Angkor .ingdom 802±11, was 
situated near the Mekong River and also did not depend on maritime prowess 
for its power. The kingdom’s complex irrigation and drainage systems led 
to economic prosperity, making it one of the most prosperous kingdoms in 
Southeast Asia. Irrigation allowed farmers to harvest rice crops several times 
a year, and drainage systems reduced the impact of the heavy monsoon rains. 
The Khmer capital was at Angkor Thom. The temples there showed the 
variety of Indian cultural influences on Southeast Asia. Hindu artwork and 
sculptures of deities abounded. But at some point the .hmer rulers became 
Buddhist. Starting in the 12th and 1th centuries, they added Buddhist 
sculptures and artwork to the temples without destroying any of the Hindu 
artwork. 
29 DEVELOPMENTS IN SO UTH AN D SOUTHEAST ASIADuring the same period and only one-half mile from Angkor Thom, rulers 
constructed the ornate and majestic Buddhist temple complex of Angkor Wat. 
In 11, the Thais of the Sukhothai Kingdom  invaded the area, forcing the 
.hmers out. Nevertheless, ruins of the magnificent structures in Angkor Thom 
and Angkor Wat still stand, testifying not only to the sophistication of Southeast 
Asian culture but also to the powerful influence of Indian culture on the region.  
Islam  Islam’s movement into the Indian Ocean region paralleled its 
expansion elsewhere. The first Southeast Asian Muslims were local merchants, 
who converted in the 700s, hoping to have better trading relations with the 
Islamic merchants who arrived on their shores. Islam was most popular in 
urban areas at the time. Islam spread to Sumatra, Java, and the Malay Peninsula. 
Today, Indonesia includes more Muslims than any other country. 
Sufis Sufis  also did missionary work in Southeast Asia. (See Topic 1.2.) 
Because of their tolerance for local faiths, people felt comfortable converting 
to Islam. They could be Muslims and still honor local deities.

Instead, in modern scholarship, a claim expresses a viewpoint with 
which thoughtful people can reasonably disagree. It forms the basis of 
an argument ²reasoning backed up with evidence. 
A claim is often a somewhat general statement that reflects a 
judgment shaped by the point of view of the writer. In some historical 
texts with a clear bias, the claim may simply be the author’s main 
idea, and it may be based more on opinion or overgeneralization than 
rigorous reasoning. In modern scholarship, however, claims should be 
grounded in facts and informed opinions. While claims are general, the 
evidence used to support them should be specific.

Developments in the Americas 
I love the song of the mockingbird,  
Bird of four hundred voices,  
I love the color of jade  
And the intoxicating scent of flowers,  
But more than all I love my brother, man!
—Nezahualcoyotl (1402–1472), Aztec poet 
Essential Question:   What states developed in the Americas, and how did 
they change over time?
Following the decline of the Olmecs in Mesoamerica and the Chavin in the 
Andes,  new civilizations, such as the Mayans, the Aztecs, and the Incas rose in 
the same regions. In addition, the first large-scale civilization in North America 
developed. As in Afro-Eurasia, several of these civilizations developed strong 
states, large urban centers, and complex belief systems. Current knowledge 
about these civilizations combines archaeological evidence, oral traditions, 
and writings by Europeans who came to the Americas after 12. One poem 
recorded by the Spanish was the one above from an Aztec writer. 
The Mississippian Culture
The first large-scale civilization in North America emerged in the 00s or 800s 
in what is now the eastern United States. Since it started in the Mississippi 
River 9alley, it is known as the Mississippian culture. While other cultures 
built monumental buildings, Mississippians built enormous earthen mounds, 
some of which were as tall as 100 feet and covered an area the size of 12 
football fields. The largest of these mounds is Cahokia , located in southern 
Illinois.
Government and Society  The Mississippian society had a rigid class 
structure. A chief called the Great Sun ruled each large town. Below the Great 
Sun was an upper class of priests and nobles and a lower class of farmers, 
hunters, merchants, and artisans. At the bottom were enslaved people, who 
usually were prisoners of war. In general, women farmed and men hunted. The 
Mississippians had a matrilineal society , which means that social standing 
was determined by the woman’s side of the family. For example, when the 
Great Sun died, the title passed not to his own son, but to a sister’s son.
34 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe Decline of Mississippian Civilization  People abandoned Cahokia 
around 1450, and other large Mississippian cities by 1600. Historians disagree 
on why the Mississippian people moved. One theory posits that flooding or 
other weather extremes caused crop failures and the collapse of the agricultural 
economy needed to sustain the populations of the large cities. Another theory 
suggests that diseases introduced by the Europeans decimated the population.
Chaco and Mesa Verde
Soon after the rise of the Mississippian Civilization, various cultures emerged 
in what is now the southwestern United States. Living in a dry region, people  
developed ways to collect, transport, and store water efficiently. In addition, 
because of the climate, trees were small and scarce, so people had little wood 
to use to build homes. Two cultures became well-known for their innovations:
• The Chaco built large housing structures using stones and clay, some of 
which included hundreds of rooms.
• The people of Mesa 9erde built multi-story homes into the sides of 
cliffs using bricks made of sandstone. 
Both groups declined in the late 1th century as the climate became drier .
The Maya City-States
Mayan civilization reached its height between 250 and 00 C.E. Mayans 
stretched over the southern part of Mexico and much of what is now Belize, 
Honduras, and Guatemala. Most lived in or near one of the approximately 0 
cities that ranged in size from 5,000 to 50,000 people. At its peak, as many as 
2 million Mayans populated the region.  
Mayan Government  The main form of Mayan government was the 
city-state , each ruled by a king and consisting of a city and its surrounding 
territory. Most rulers were men. However, when no male heir was available 
or old enough to govern, Mayan women ruled. Wars between city-states were 
common. At times, city-states were overthrown. However, Mayans rarely 
fought to control territory. More often they fought to gain tribute²payments 
from the conquered to the conqueror²and captives to be used as human 
sacrifices  during religious ceremonies. 
Each Mayan king claimed to be descended from a god. The Mayans 
believed that when the king died, he would become one with his ancestor-
god. The king directed the activities of the elite scribes and priests who 
administered the affairs of the state. Royal rule usually passed from father to 
son, but kings who lost the support of the people were sometimes overthrown. 
The common people were required to pay taxes, usually in the form of crops, 
and to provide labor to the government. City-states had no standing armies, so 
when war erupted, governments required citizens to provide military service. 
No central government ruled all Mayan lands, although often one city-state 
was the strongest in a region and would dominate its neighbors.
35 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS 35Mayan Religion, Science, and Technology  The Mayans were innovative 
thinkers and inventors. For example, they incorporated the concept of zero into 
their number system, developed a complex writing system, and learned to make 
rubber out of liquid collected from rubber plants. 
Mayan science and religion were linked through astronomy. Based on the 
calendar, priests decided when to celebrate religious ceremonies and whether 
to go to war. As a result, keeping an accurate calendar was very important. 
Although the Mayans had no telescopes, they made very precise observatories 
atop pyramids such as the one at Chichen Itza. Their observations enabled 
priests to design a calendar more accurate than any used in Europe at the time.
One task of priests, who could be either male or female, was to conduct 
ceremonies honoring many deities. Among the most important deities were 
those of the sun, rain, and corn. Mayans made offerings to the gods so prayers 
might be answered. War captives were sometimes killed as offerings. (Connect:

South Asia. See Topic 1..

Mayan pyramids, with steps going up the side, were similar to Mesopotamian ziggurats. Similarly 
shaped architecture can be found from Spain and Algeria to China and Indonesia.  
The Aztecs
The Aztecs, also known as the Mexicas , were originally hunter-gatherers who 
migrated to central Mexico from the north in the 1200s. In 125, they founded 
their capital Tenochtitlin on the site of what is now Mexico City. Over the next 
100 years, they conquered the surrounding peoples and created an empire that 
stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. 
Capital City  The Aztecs located Tenochtitlin on an island in the middle of 
a swampy lake in order to protect it from attacks. Tenochtitlin grew to almost 
200,000 people, making it one of the largest cities in the world. To provide 
water for the city, they built a network of aqueducts. At the center of the city, 
the Aztecs built a pyramid that rose 150 feet into the air. This Great Pyramid and 
other pyramids, temples, and palaces were made of stone. On Lake Texcoco, the 
Aztecs built floating gardens called chinampas  to increase the amount of space 
for food production. The Aztecs dug ditches to use lake water to irrigate their 
fields and to drain parts of the lake for more land.  
36 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONGovernment, Economy, and Society  As the Aztecs conquered much of 
Mesoamerica, they developed a tribute system that insured their dominance. 
Conquered people were forced to pay tribute, surrender lands, and perform 
military service. Tribute included practical goods such as food, cloth, and 
firewood, as well as luxury items such as feathers, beads, and jewelry. The 
Aztecs allowed local rulers to stay in their positions to serve as tribute collectors. 
This allowed Aztec political dominance without direct administrative control. 
In exchange, the conquered people were extended Aztec protection. 
To administer the empire, the Aztecs grouped city-states into provinces. 
They moved warriors and their families to each province’s capital to make 
sure the province remained under Aztec control. In addition, an Aztec official 
was stationed in each capital to collect tribute from local officials. 
Aztec government was a theocracy , which is rule by religious leaders. At 
the top was the emperor, known as the Great Speaker, who was the political 
ruler as well as a divine representative of the gods. Next in the social hierarchy 
were land-owning nobles, who also formed the majority of Aztec military 
leadership. Next in rank were scribes and healers, followed by craftspeople 
and traders. A special merchant class called pochteca traded in luxury goods. 
Below the traders were the peasants and soldiers. Aztec people could be 
enslaved as well, usually because they did not pay their debts or were being 
punished for crimes. Besides being used for labor, enslaved people were also 
offered up as sacrifices in religious ceremonies. 
Religion  The intricate and complex religion of the Aztecs was central 
to their society. They worshipped an ever-evolving pantheon of hundreds of 
deities, many of whom were considered to have both male and female aspects. Source:  DEQG DAGLIORTI Granger, NYC 
The construction of chinampas in Mesoamerica was one way people expanded the land on which 
to grow crops.

37 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS Worship among the Aztecs involved a great many rituals and feast days as 
well as human sacrifices. The Aztecs believed that the gods had sacrificed 
themselves in order to create the world²thus human sacrifice and blood-
letting was a sort of repayment and atonement for human sin. Human sacrifice 
probably had a political component, in the sense that it demonstrated the 
great might of the Aztec Empire in dramatic fashion. The number of human 
sacrifices may never be known. Much of the information about Aztec society 
comes from Spanish invaders, who may have exaggerated the extent of human 
sacrifice in order to make the Aztecs seem more deserving of conquest. 
Role of Women  Women played an important role in the Aztec tribute 
system since they wove the valuable cloth that local rulers demanded as part 
of the regular tribute. As the demand for cloth tribute increased, an Aztec 
husband might obtain more than one wife in order to be able to pay the tribute. 
While most Aztec women worked in their homes, some became priestesses, 
midwives, healers, or merchants. A few noblewomen worked as scribes to 
female members of royal families. Therefore, at least these few women knew 
how to read and write.
The Decline of the Aztecs  By the late 15th century, the Aztec Empire 
was in decline. The Aztecs’ comparatively low level of technology²such as 
the lack of wheeled vehicles and pack animals²meant that agriculture was 
arduous and inefficient. The Aztecs’ commitment to military victory and the 
constant desire for more human sacrifices induced the leadership to expand the 
empire beyond what it could reasonably govern. Finally, the extraction from 
conquered people of tribute and sacrifice victims inspired more resentment 
than loyalty. Because of this resentment, many tribes ruled by the Aztecs 
were ready to rebel if they thought they had an opportunity to succeed. This 
opportunity would come later, when Spaniards arrived in 1519.
The Inca
In 18, a tribal leader who called himself Pachacuti , which means 
“transformer” or “shaker” of the earth, began conquering the tribes living 
near what is now Cuzco, Peru. His military victories, followed by those of 
his son, combined the small tribes into a full-fledged state, the Incan Empire . 
It extended from present-day Ecuador in the north to Chile in the south. By 
1, Pachacuti’s grandson, Huayna Capac, ruled the empire. He  focused on 
consolidating and managing the many lands conquered by his predecessors. 
Government, Economy, and Society  In order to rule the extensive 
territory efficiently, the Incan Empire was split into four provinces, each with 
its own governor and bureaucracy. Conquered leaders who demonstrated 
loyalty to the empire were rewarded. In contrast to the people living under the 
Aztecs, conquered people under the Inca did not have to pay tribute. Rather, 
they were subject to the mit’a system , mandatory public service. Men between 
the ages of 15 and 50 provided agricultural and other forms of labor, including 
the construction of roads. 
38 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONReligion  The name Inca means “people of the sun,” and Inti, the sun 
god, was the most important of the Incan gods. Inca rulers were considered 
to be Inti’s representative on the earth. As the center of two critical elements 
in Incan religion²honoring of the sun and royal ancestor veneration²the 
Temple of the Sun  in Cuzco formed the core of Incan religion. 
Royal ancestor veneration was a practice intended to extend the rule of 
a leader. Dead rulers were mummified and continued to “rule” as they had 
in life and were thought to retain ownership of their servants, possessions, 
and property. Thus, Incan rulers could not expect to inherit land or property 
upon assuming power. This practice was a partial motivator for the constant 
expansion of the empire. 
Priests were consulted before important actions. To the Inca, the gods 
controlled all things, and priests could determine the gods’ will by studying the 
arrangement of coca leaves in a dish or by watching the movement of a spider. 
Priests diagnosed illnesses, predicted the outcome of battles, solved crimes, 
and determined what sacrifices should be made to which god. Serious events 
such as famines, plagues, and defeat in war called for human sacrifices²
although scholars do not believe that human sacrifice was practiced with the 
same frequency as it probably was with the Aztecs. 
Inca religion included some animism ²the belief that elements of the 
physical world could have supernatural powers. Called huaca, they could be 
large geographical features such as a river or a mountain peak. Or, they could 
be very small objects such as a stone, a plant, or a built object , such as a bridge. 
Achievements  In mathematics, the Inca developed the quipu,  a system of 
knotted strings used to record numerical information for trade and engineering 
and for recording messages to be carried throughout the empire. In agriculture, 
the Inca developed sophisticated terrace systems for the cultivation of crops 
such as potatoes and maize. The terraces utilized a technique called waru 
waru , raised beds with channels that captured and redirected rain to avoid 
erosion during floods and that stored water to be used during dry periods. 
The Inca were especially good builders of bridges and roads. Using captive 
labor, they constructed a massive roadway system called the Carpa Nan , with 
some 25,000 miles of roads used mainly by the government and military. In a 
mountainous region, bridges were particularly important.
Decline  Upon the arrival of Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro in 
152, the Incan Empire was in the midst of a civil war of succession after 
the death of emperor Huayna Capac. Some scholars believe that the civil war 
weakened the Incan army, making it easier for Pizarro’s forces to prevail. 
Others believe that other factors such as diseases introduced by the Europeans 
led to the decline. In 15, the Spanish conquered the core of the empire, 
although outposts held out until 152. Today, the Inca ruins at Machu Picchu 
are one of the most-visited sites in the world. 
39 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS Continuities and Diversity
Historians have debated how closely Mesoamerican cultures are related to 
one another. Many argue that most are based on the Olmec civilization, since 
many later cultures adopted some of its features. For example, the Olmecs’ 
feathered snake-god became fundamental in both the Mayan and Aztec 
religion. The subjects depicted on Olmec pottery have been found in pottery 
in other civilizations. The Olmecs’ ritual sacrifices, pyramids, and ball courts 
were also continued in other cultures. Other historians argue that different 
cultures developed complex civilizations more or less independently .

41 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“Unluckily, the accounts of Spanish authors concerning Maya mythology do 
not agree with the representations of the gods delineated >described precisely@ 
in the codices. That the three codices have a mythology in common is certain. 
Again, great difficulty is found in comparing the deities of the codices with 
those represented by the carved and stucco bas-reliefs of the Maya region. 
It will thus be seen that very considerable difficulties beset the student in 
this mythological sphere. So few data have yet been collected regarding 
the Maya mythology that to dogmatize >represent as absolute truth@ upon 
any subject connected with it would indeed be rash >impulsive@. But much 
has been accomplished in the past few decades, and evidence is slowly but 
surely accumulating from which sound conclusions can be drawn.”

Developments In Africa
After that the chief of the poets mounts the steps of the pempi [a raised 
platform on which the ruler sits] and lays his head on the sultan’s lap, then 
climbs to the top of the pempi and lays his head first on the sultan’ s right 
shoulder and then on his left, speaking all the while in their tongue, and finally 
he comes down again. I was told that this practice is a very old custom 
amongst them, prior to the introduction of Islam, and that they have kept it up.
—Ibn Battuta, c. 1352
Essential Question:   How and why did states develop in Africa and  
change over time? 
Ibn Battuta’s commentary on Mali society sheds light on the cultural forces at 
work in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1th century. A scholar from Morocco 
on the northwest coast of Africa, he was well versed in Islamic law, also known 
as shariah. Islamic governments in Mogadishu east Africa and Delhi India 
sought his advice and welcomed him to their lands. Ibn Battuta’s travelogue 
demonstrated how Islam’s phenomenal growth increased connections among 
cultures of Asia, Africa, and southern Europe. As Ibn Battuta’s account makes 
clear, African societies that had adopted Islam kept many of their traditions. 
Some parts of Africa resisted Islam. To better defend themselves against 
attacks by Islamic forces, they built churches with labyrinths, reservoirs, and 
tunnels. Other parts of the continent, especially in the south, had little contact 
with Islam until later in history.
Political Structures in Inland Africa
The development of Sub-Saharan Africa was heavily shaped by the migrations 
of Bantu-speaking people outward from west-central Africa. By the year 
1000, most of the region had adopted agriculture. With the sedentary nature 
of agriculture, people needed more complex political relationships to govern 
themselves. In contrast to most Asian or European societies, those in Sub-
Saharan Africa did not centralize power under one leader or central government. 
Instead, communities formed kin-based networks , where families governed 
themselves. A male head of the network, a chief , mediated conflicts and dealt 
with neighboring groups. Groups of villages became districts, and a group of 
chiefs decided among themselves how to solve the district’s problems.
44 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONAs populations grew, kin-based networks became more difficult to govern. 
Competition among neighbors increased, which in turn increased fighting 
among villages and districts. Survival for small kin-based communities 
became more challenging. Though many such communities continued to 
exist in Sub-Saharan Africa until the 1th century, larger kingdoms grew in 
prominence, particularly after 1000. 
The Hausa Kingdoms  Sometime before 1000, in what is now Nigeria, 
people of the Hausa ethnic group formed seven states, the Hausa Kingdoms . 
The states were loosely connected through kinship ties, though they too had 
no central authority. People established prospering city-states, each with a 
speciality. For example, several were situated in plains where cotton grew 
well. 
Though the region lacked access to the sea, contact with people from 
outside the region was important. Many Hausa benefited from the thriving 
trans-Saharan  trade , a network of trading routes across the great desert. 
A state on the western edge of the region specialized in military matters 
and defended the states against attack. Because the states lacked a central 
authority, however, they were frequently subject to domination from outside. 
In the 14th century, missionaries introduced Islam to the region. (Connect:

Political Structures of West and East Africa
.ingdoms on both the western and eastern sides of Africa benefited from 
increased trade. The exchange of goods brought them wealth, political power, 
and cultural diversity. The spread of Islam added to the religious diversity of 
the continent, where animism and Christianity were already practiced. Four of 
these kingdoms were Ghana, Mali, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia.
Ghana  Nestled between the Sahara and the tropical rain forests of the 
West African coast, the kingdom of Ghana  was not in the same location as 
the modern nation of Ghana. Historians believe that the kingdom had been 
founded during the 5th century, at least two centuries before the time of 
Muhammad, but Ghana reached its peak of influence from the 8th to the 11th 
centuries. Ghana’s rulers sold gold and ivory to Muslim traders in exchange 
for salt, copper, cloth, and tools. From Ghana’s capital city, .oumbi Saleh, the 
king ruled a centralized government aided by nobles and an army equipped 
with iron weapons.

most powerful of which was Mali . You will read more about Mali in Topic 2.. 
Most scholars believe that Mali’s founding ruler, Sundiata, was a Muslim and 
used his connections with others of his faith to establish trade relationships with 
North African and Arab merchants. Sundiata cultivated a thriving gold trade 
in Mali. Under his steady leadership, Mali’s wealth grew tremendously. His 
nephew, Mansa Musa, made a pilgrimage to Mecca where his lavish displays of 
gold left a lasting impression. See Topic 2. for the later developments in West 
Africa, such as the growth of the city of Timbuktu and the Songhai Empire.
Zimbabwe  In East Africa, the architecture demonstrated the growing 
wealth of one kingdom. Though most houses had traditionally been constructed 
from wood, by the th century chiefs had begun to construct their “zimbabwes,” 
the Bantu word for “dwellings,” with stone. This word became the name of 
one of the most powerful of all the East African kingdoms between the 12th 
and 15th centuries² Zimbabwe . It was situated between the =ambezi and 
Limpopo rivers in modern-day =imbabwe and Mozambique. 
=imbabwe built its prosperity on a mixture of agriculture, grazing, trade, 
and, above all, gold. Like Ghana and Mali on the other side of the continent, 
=imbabwe had rich gold fields, and taxes on the transport of gold made the 
kingdom wealthy. While Ghana and Mali relied on land-based trade across the 
Sahara, =imbabwe traded with the coastal city-states such as Mombasa, .ilwa, 
and Mogadishu. Through these ports, Zimbabwe was tied into the Indian 
Ocean trade , which connected East Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and 
East Asia. In East Africa, traders blended Bantu and Arabic to develop a new 
language, Swahili . Today, Swahili is spoken by various groups in the African 
Great Lakes region as well as other parts of Southeast Africa. 
The rise and decline of =imbabwe was reflected in the defensive walls 
used to protect cities. By the end of the 1th century, a massive wall of stone, 
0 feet tall by 15 feet thick, surrounded the capital city, which became known 
as the Great Zimbabwe . The stone wall was the first large one on the continent 
that people built without mortar. Inside the wall, most of the royal city’s 
buildings were made of stone. In the late 15th century, nearly 20,000 people 
resided within the Great =imbabwe. However, overgrazing so damaged the 
surrounding environment that residents of the bustling capital city abandoned 
it by the end of the 100s. The wall still stands in the modern country of 
Zimbabwe.
Ethiopia  Christianity had spread from its origins along the east coast of 
the Mediterranean Sea south into Egypt and beyond. In what is today Ethiopia , 
the kingdom of Axum developed. It prospered by trading goods obtained from 
India, Arabia, the Roman Empire, and the interior of Africa. Beginning in the 
th century, the spread of Islam made the region more diverse religiously. 
In the 12th century, a new Christian-led kingdom in Ethiopia emerged. Its 
rulers, like those of other countries, expressed their power through architecture. 
They ordered the creation of 11 massive churches made entirely of rock. 
47 DEVELOPMENTS IN AFRICACarved rock structures had been a feature of Ethiopian religious architecture 
since the 2nd millennium B.C.E.
From the 12th through the 16th centuries, Ethiopia was an island of 
Christianity on the continent of Africa. Separated from both the Roman 
Catholic Church of western Europe and the Orthodox Church of eastern 
Europe, Ethiopian Christianity developed independently. People combined 
their traditional faith traditions, such as ancestor veneration and beliefs in 
spirits, with Christianity to create a distinct form of faith. 
Social Structures of Sub-Saharan Africa
In Sub-Saharan Africa, strong central governments ruling over large territories  
were uncommon. Instead, Sub-Saharan Africa’s small communities were 
organized around several structures: kinship, age, and gender. .inship 
connections allowed people to identify first as members of a clan or family. 
Age was another significant social marker. An 18-year-old could do more hard 
labor than a 60-year-old, but younger people often relied on the advice of their 
elders. Thus, communities divided work according to age, creating age grades 
or age sets. Finally, gender had an influential role in social organization. 
• Men dominated most activities that required a specialized skill. For 
example, leather tanners and blacksmiths were typically men.

48 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITION• Women generally engaged in agriculture and food gathering. They also 
took the primary responsibilities for carrying out domestic chores and 
raising their family’s children.
Slavery in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southwest Asia  Slavery had a long 
history in Africa. Prisoners of war, debtors, and criminals were often enslaved. 
Most men and some women did agricultural work. Most women and some 
men served in households. In many kin-based societies, people could not own 
land privately, but they could own other people. Owning a large number of 
enslaved people increased one’s social status. Slavery existed in many forms.

A strong demand in the Middle East for enslaved workers resulted in an 
Indian Ocean slave trade  between East Africa and the Middle East. This 
trade started several centuries before the Atlantic Ocean slave trade between 
West Africa and the Americas. In some places, it lasted into the 20th century. 
The enslaved East Africans, known in Arabic as zanj,  provided valuable 
labor on sugar plantations in Mesopotamia. However, between 86 and 88, 
they and many Arab workers mounted a series of revolts known as the Zanj 
Rebellion . About 15,000 enslaved people successfully captured the city of 
Basra and held it for ten years before being defeated. The large size and long 
length of time before it was defeated make the =anj Rebellion one of the most 
successful slave revolts in history. 
49 DEVELOPMENTS IN AFRICACultural Life in Sub-Saharan Africa
Playing music, creating visual arts, and telling stories were and continue to be 
important aspects of cultures everywhere because they provided enjoyment 
and mark rituals such as weddings and funerals. In Africa, these activities 
carried additional significance. Because traditional African religions included 
ancestor veneration, song lyrics provided a means of communicating with the 
spirit world. African music usually had a distinctive rhythmic pattern, and 
vocals were interspersed with percussive elements such as handclaps, bells, 
pots, or gourds.
9isual arts also commonly served a religious purpose. For example, 
metalworkers created busts of past rulers so that ruling royalty could look to 
them for guidance. Artists in Benin, West Africa, were famous for their intricate 
sculptures in iron and bronze. In the late 1th century, the sophistication of 
these pieces of art would cause some Europeans to increase their respect for  
West African cultures.
Griots and Griottes  Literature, as it existed in Sub-Saharan Africa, was 
oral. Griots, or storytellers,  were the conduits of history for a community. 
Griots possessed encyclopedic knowledge of family lineages and the lives and 
deeds of great leaders. In general, griots were also adept at music, singing their 
stories and accompanying themselves on instruments, such as the drums and a 
12-string harp called the kora. 
The griots were both venerated and feared as they held both the power of 
language and of story. People said that a griot could sing your success or sing 
your downfall. By telling and retelling their stories and histories, the griots 
preserved a people’s history and passed that history on from generation to 
generation. .ings often sought their counsel regarding political matters. When 
a griot died, it was as though a library had burned. 
Just as men served as griots, women served as griottes. They would sing 
at special occasions, such as before a wedding. For example, the griotte would 
counsel the bride to not talk back if her mother-in-law abused her or reassure 
the bride that if things got too bad, she could return home. Griottes provided 
women with a sense of empowerment in a patriarchal society.

Developments in Europe 
I should not wish to be Aristotle if this were to separate me from Christ.
—Peter Abelard, Letter 17 to Heloise (1141)
Essential Question   How did the beliefs and practices of the predominant 
religions, agricultural practices, and political 
decentralization affect European society from  
c. 1200 to c. 1450?
As the Roman Empire declined in power in the 5th and 6th centuries, 
Western Europe entered the Middle Ages, sometimes called the medieval 
period. Throughout Europe, trade declined, intellectual life receded, and the 
united Roman state was replaced by smaller kingdoms that frequently fought 
one another for control of territory. In response, European kings, lords, and 
peasants worked out agreements to provide for common defense. Only the 
Roman Catholic Church remained powerful in most of Europe from Roman 
times to the 16th century.
However, between 1000 to 1450, learning and trade began to revive in 
Europe. This era is called the High Middle Ages. Like many scholars of this 
period, Peter Abelard studied classical thinkers such as Aristotle and sometimes 
criticized the Church, but he remained a faithful throughout his life. 
Feudalism: Political and Social Systems
European civilization in the Middle Ages was characterized by a decentralized 
political organization based on a system of exchanges of land for loyalty 
known as feudalism . Lacking a strong government, people needed some 
protection from bandits, rival lords, and invaders such as the 9ikings from 
northern Europe. The core of feudalism was a system of mutual obligations:
• A monarch, usually a king, granted tracts of land, called fiefs, to lords. 
In return, a lord became a king’s vassal , a person who owed service to 
another person of higher status. 
• Lords then provided land to knights. In return, knights became vassals 
of the lord, and pledged to fight for the lord or king.
• Lords also provided land and protection to peasants. In return, peasants 
were obligated to farm the lord’s land and provide the lord with crops 
and livestock, and to obey the lord’s orders. 
54 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONFeudalism provided some security for peasants, equipment for warriors, 
and land to those who served a lord. Since the entire system was based on 
agriculture, wealth was measured in land rather than in cash.
The feudal system incorporated a code of chivalry ²an unwritten set 
of rules for conduct focusing on honor, courtesy, and bravery²as a way to 
resolve disputes. Since women were to be protected, the code put them on a 
pedestal while not investing them with any significant additional importance. 
In practice, women did not have many rights. (Connect: Compare European 
feudalism and Japanese feudalism. See Topic 1.1.
Manorial System  Large fiefs or estates were also referred to as 
manors . The manorial system  provided economic self-sufficiency and 
defense. The manor produced everything that people living on it required, 
limiting the need for trade or contact with outsiders. Many serfs spent their 
entire lives on a single manor, little aware of events in the rest of Europe.
Manor grounds were small villages that often included a church, a 
blacksmith shop, a mill, and wine presses. They included the homes of 
peasants known as serfs . Serfs, while not enslaved, were tied to the land. 
This meant they could not travel without permission from their lords. Nor 
could they marry without their lord’s approval. In exchange for protection 
provided by the lord of the manor, they paid tribute in the form of crops, 
labor, or, in rare cases, coins. Children born to serfs also became serfs.
As both climate and technology slowly improved, the amount of arable 
or farmable land gradually increased. Agriculture became more efficient 
near the end of the Middle Ages. The three-field system , in which crops 
were rotated through three fields, came into use. 
• One field was planted with wheat or rye, crops that provided food.
• A second field was planted with legumes such as peas, lentils, or 
beans. These made the soil more fertile by adding nitrogen to it.
• A third field was allowed to remain fallow, or unused, each year. 
Technological developments included windmills and new types of plows. 
Heavier plows with wheels worked well in the dense soil north of the Alps, 
while lighter plows worked better in southern Europe. These changes 
promoted population growth.
Political Trends in the Later Middle Ages
In the later Middle Ages, monarchies grew more powerful at the expense 
of feudal lords by employing their own bureaucracy and a military. These 
employees worked directly for the king or queen. In contrast, in modern  
countries such as the United States, bureaucrats and soldiers work for the 
country, not the chief executive. The lands these monarchs collected under 
their control, particularly in England and France, were beginning to look 
like the modern countries of Europe.

bureaucracy. Yet it was not until Philip I9 ruled 1285±11 that the first 
Estates-General   met. The Estates-General was a body to advise the king 
that included representatives from each of the three legal classes, or estates , 
in France: the clergy, nobility, and commoners. Although the French kings 
consulted this Estates-General when necessary, they did not exact regular taxes 
from the upper two estates, the clergy and nobility. Consequently, the Estates-
General had little power. The clergy and nobility felt little responsibility 
to protect a government that they were not financing, a problem that only 
continued to increase in France up to the eve of the French Revolution of 18.
Holy Roman Empire  The German king Otto I  was crowned Holy  Roman 
Emperor in 962, hearkening back to Charlemagne’s designation as Emperor 
of the Romans. Otto’s successors survived the power struggle with the papacy 
over the lay investiture controversy  of the 11th and 12th centuries. This 
dispute was over whether a secular non-religious leader, rather than the 
pope, could invest bishops with the symbols of office. It was finally resolved 
in the Concordat of Worms of 1122, when the Church achieved autonomy 
from secular authorities. The Holy Roman Empire remained vibrant until it 
was virtually destroyed during the Thirty Years’ War 1618±168. It lingered 
on, but with little power. The Empire came to a formal end when the French 
leader Napoleon Bonaparte invaded central Europe in 1806.
56 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONNorman England  The Normans  were descendents of 9ikings who settled 
in northwestern France, a region known as Normandy. In 1066, a Norman 
king, William the Conqueror, successfully invaded England. This gave him 
kingdoms on both sides of the English Channel. He presided over a tightly 
organized feudal system, using royal sheriffs as his administrative officials. 
The fusion of Normans and Anglo-Saxons created the modern English people.
Many English nobles objected to the power of William and the succeeding 
Norman monarchs. These nobles forced limits on that power. In 1215, they 
forced .ing John to sign the Magna Carta , which required the king to respect 
certain rights, such as the right to a jury trial before a noble could be sentenced 
to prison. They also won the right to be consulted on the issue of scutage a tax 
paid on a knight who wanted to pay money instead of provide military service. 
Finally, the first English Parliament  was formed in 1265. These developments 
increased the rights of the English nobility, but not of the general population.
In the first full parliamentary meeting in 1265, the House of Lords 
represented the nobles and Church hierarchy, while the House of Commons 
was made up of elected representatives of wealthy townspeople. Eventually, 
the power of these two legislative bodies in England became stronger than that 
of similar bodies on the European continent. 
The Hundred Years’ War  Between 1 and 15, the rival monarchies 
of England and France fought a series of battles known as the Hundred Years’ 
War. English archers armed with longbows about six feet long helped win 
several early victories. However, by the end of the conflict, the English retained 
only the port of Calais in France. Two other important results of the war were 
on how people saw themselves and how they fought. 
• On each side, serving under a monarch fostered a sense of unity 
among soldiers who often spoke distinct languages or dialects. The 
war marked another step towards people identifying themselves as 
“English” or “French” rather than from a particular region. 
• The war also demonstrated the spreading use of gunpowder weapons. 
Gunpowder had been invented by the Chinese and spread west by 
Mongols. 
Christians versus Muslims  In addition to conquering England, the 
Normans also conquered Sicily, taking control of that Mediterranean island 
from Muslims. Muslims had conquered Spain in the 8th century. From that 
time, Christians had wanted to reconquer it. This effort, called the reconquista , 
occurred over many centuries. It was finally completed in 12.
Roman Catholic Church during the Middle Ages 
In 1054, the Christian Church in Europe divided into two branches, a split 
called the Great Schism . The Roman Catholic Church continued to dominate 
most of Europe for another five centuries, while the Orthodox Church was 
powerful farther east, from Greece to Russia. 
57 DEVELOPMENTS IN E UROPE The Roman Catholic Church was the most powerful institution in a Europe 
divided into hundreds of small political states. Often Church staff were the 
only people in a community who knew how to read and write. If common 
people needed something written or read, they asked a Church official to do 
it. Most manors had a small church and a priest on the grounds. Christianity 
provided people a shared identity even as vernacular languages, ones spoken 
by the people in a region, emerged to replace Latin.
Education and Art  The Church established the first universities in 
Europe. Because the Church led in the area of education, most philosophers, 
writers, and other thinkers of the Middle Ages were religious leaders. All 
artists worked for the Church. Most artwork focused on religious themes, 
which provided images to help illiterate serfs understand the Bible.
Church and State  The Church held great power in the feudal system. 
If a lord displeased the Church, it could pressure the lord in various ways. 
For example, a local bishop might cancel religious services for his serfs. This 
angered the serfs, who would demand that the lord give in to the bishop.
Like the Roman Empire, the Roman Catholic Church had an extensive 
hierarchy of regional leaders. The regional religious leaders, called bishops, 
owed allegiance to the pope, the supreme bishop in Rome. The bishops also 
selected and supervised local priests. 
Monasticism  Although some Christian clergy withdrew to monasteries 
to meditate and pray, they remained part of the economies of Western 
Europe. The monasteries had the same economic functions of agriculture 
and protection as other manors. Women were permitted to become nuns and 
exerted their influence in the monasteries of the Catholic Church. 
Reform  Although clergy took vows of poverty and supported charities 
in their communities, the clergy also wielded considerable political influence, 
and some monasteries became quite wealthy. Wealth and political power led 
to corruption during the 1th and 1th centuries. Eventually, corruption, as 
well as theological disagreements, drove reformers such as Martin Luther to 
take stands that would shatter the unity of the Roman Catholic Church in the 
16th century.
Christian Crusades 
Just as Europeans fought to drive Muslims out of Sicily and Spain, they also 
sought to reclaim control of the Holy Land, the region of Palestine in the 
Middle East that contains sites of spiritual significance to Jews, Christians, 
and Muslims. European Christians had enjoyed access to these lands for 
centuries, even after they came under the control of Muslims. 
Social and economic trends of the 11th century added to the pressure 
among Europeans to invade the Middle East. Rules of primogeniture , under 
which the eldest son in a family inherited the entire estate, left a generation 
of younger sons with little access to wealth and land. The landed nobles saw 
58 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONa military campaign as a way to divert the ambitions of these restless nobles 
as well as unemployed peasants, who often pillaged the lands of neighboring 
lords. Furthermore, merchants desired unfettered access to trade routes through 
the Middle East. The combination of these religious, social, and economic 
pressures resulted in the Crusades— a series of European military campaigns 
in the Middle East between 1095 and the 1200s.
Politics shaped the conduct of Crusades. Tensions between popes and 
kings strengthened the intention of the Roman Catholic Church to take control. 
The Church also used its spiritual authority to recruit believers. It granted 
relief from required acts of atonement and penance and even promised people 
they would reach heaven sooner if they joined a Crusade. Support came for the 
Orthodox branch of Christianity as well. Alarmed by news of the persecution of 
Christian pilgrims by Seljuk Turks, the Orthodox patriarch at Constantinople 
appealed to Pope Urban II to help retake the Holy Land from Islamic control. 
The First Crusade  Of the four major Crusades, only the first was a clear 
victory for Christendom. The European army conquered Jerusalem in July 
10. However, Muslim forces under Saladin regained control of Jerusalem 
in 118. The Crusades did promote cultural exchange between Europe and the 
Middle East. The Middle East had a higher standard of living, and European 
Crusaders increased the demand for Middle Eastern goods.  (Connect: Create 
a timeline tracing the spread of Islam up through the Crusades. See Topic 1.2.
The Fourth Crusade  During the fourth and last major Crusade 1202±
120, 9enice, a wealthy city-state in northern Italy, had a contract to transport 
Crusaders to the Middle East, an area known as the Levant. However, 9enice 
was not paid all of what was due, so the 9enetians persuaded the Crusader 
debtors first to sack =ara, an Italian city, and then Constantinople, a major 
trade competitor of 9enice. The Fourth Crusade never made it to the Holy 
Land. Eventually, Islamic forces prevailed in the Levant. 
Economic and Social Change
The Crusades were just part of the changes occurring in Europe in the late 
Middle Ages. Local economic self-sufficiency in Europe gradually gave way 
to an interest in goods from other European areas and from far-flung ports. 
Marco Polo  In the late 1th century Marco Polo , an Italian native 
from 9enice, visited the court of .ublai .han in Dadu, modern-day Beijing. 
Polo’s captivating descriptions of the customs of the people he met intrigued 
Europeans. For example, he described how Mongols had multiple marriages, 
drank mare’s milk, burned black stones (coal) to heat their homes, and bathed 
frequently  ²often three times per week. Curiosity about Asia skyrocketed, 
stimulating interest in cartography, or mapmaking.
Social Change  Growth in long-distance commerce changed the social 
pyramid of Western Europe. Economic success started to rival religious 
vocation or military service in winning status. This middle class, between the 
59 DEVELOPMENTS IN E UROPE elite nobles and clergy and the mass of peasants, began to grow. .nown as the 
bourgeoisie , or burghers , it included shopkeepers, merchants, craftspeople, 
and small landholders. 
Urban Growth  With renewed commerce came larger cities. The change 
to the three-field system and other advances in agriculture led to population 
growth in the late Middle Ages. This agricultural surplus encouraged the 
growth of towns and of markets that could operate more frequently than 
just on holidays. As the demand for more labor on the manors increased, the 
supply decreased. A series of severe plagues swept through Eurasia in the 1th 
century. In Europe, an outbreak of bubonic plague known as the Black Death 
killed as many as one-third of the population. The growing demand for labor 
and the deaths of so many people gave serfs more bargaining power with lords. 
Urban growth was hampered after about 100 by a five-century cooling 
of the climate known as the Little Ice Age . Lower temperatures reduced 
agricultural productivity, so people had less to trade and cities grew more 
slowly. The Little Ice Age led to an increase in disease and an increase in 
unemployment. These, in turn, created social unrest. The crime rate increased, 
and Jews, and other groups that already faced discrimination, were the victims 
of scapegoating²being blamed for something over which they had no control.
Jews  During the Middle Ages, the small Jewish population in Christian 
Europe began to grow. Many Jews lived in Muslim areas in the Iberian 
Peninsula present-day Spain and Portugal and around the Mediterranean 
Sea when these areas were overtaken by European Christians. In time, Jews 
who could afford to moved northward in Europe. Some political leaders, 
particularly in Amsterdam and other commercial cities, welcomed them, since 
they brought valuable experience in business and trade.
The Roman Catholic Church also had a policy that Christians could not 
charge interest on loans to other Christians. However, Jews were not bound 
by this restriction. With few other economic opportunities, many northern 
European Jews became moneylenders. The resulting increase in the flow of 
money contributed to the economic growth of Europe. 
However, anti-Jewish sentiment, or antisemitism , was widespread among 
Christians. They thought of Jews as outsiders and untrustworthy. Jews were 
expelled from England in 120, France in 1, Spain in 12, and Portugal in 
1, as well as from various independent kingdoms and cities in northern and 
central Europe. Jews expelled from western and central Europe often moved to 
eastern Europe. While Jews had lived in this region since the 1st century, their 
numbers increased greatly because of the expulsions.
Muslims  Like Jews, Muslims faced discrimination in Europe. In 12, 
the Spanish king expelled the remaining Muslims in the kingdom who would 
not convert to Christianity. Many Muslims moved to southeastern Europe. In 
the 1th century, the Muslim Ottoman Empire expanded its reach from Turkey 
into the Balkan countries of present-day Albania, .osovo, and Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. These countries developed large Muslim populations. 
60 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONWhile Europe was predominantly Christian, and despite their persecution, 
both Jews and Muslims helped shape society. Unlike most people in Europe in 
the Middle Ages, Jews lived in urban areas, and they served as a bridge between 
Christians and the Muslims whose goods they desired in trade. Contacts with 
traders in Muslim caliphates opened up a world of trade and a world of ideas 
for Europeans who had long been self-sufficient and isolated under feudalism.
Gender Roles  Women found their rights eroding as a wave of patriarchal 
thinking and writing accompanied the movement from an agricultural society 
to a more urban one. Even fewer women than men received an education, 
although women often managed manor accounts. One place where women had 
greater opportunities to display their skills in administration and leadership was 
in religious orders. Some women became artisans and members of guilds²
associations of craftspeople and merchants²although not all had property 
rights. Women in Islamic societies tended to enjoy higher levels of equality, 
particularly in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. 
Renaissance
The expansion of trade, the growth of an agricultural surplus, and the rise of 
a middle class able to patronize artists sparked great creativity in Europe. The 
Renaissance  was a period characterized by a revival of interest in classical 
Greek and Roman literature, art, culture, and civic virtue. Scholars recovered 
and studied decaying manuscripts that had been written many centuries earlier. 
Developed in 1, Johannes Gutenberg’s movable-type printing press initiated 
a revolution in print technology. The printing press allowed manuscripts to be 
mass-produced at relatively affordable costs. It fostered a growth in literacy 
and the rapid spread of ideas.
One characteristic of the Renaissance was the interest in humanism , the 
focus on individuals rather than God. Humanists sought education and reform. 
They began to write secular literature. Cultural changes in the Renaissance, 
such as the increased use of the vernacular language, propelled the rise of 
powerful monarchies, the centralization of governments, and the birth of 
nationalism. Connect: List three elements of classical Greece and Rome 
revived by the Renaissance. See Prologue. 
Southern Renaissance  In the regions of Italy and Spain, church patronage 
supported the Renaissance. For example, the writer Dante Alighieri 1265±
121 used a religious framework for The Divine Comedy, which features hell, 
purgatory, and heaven. Nevertheless, his fearlessness in criticizing corrupt 
religious officials and his willingness to use Italian vernacular instead of 
Latin reflected his independence from the Roman Catholic Church. Wealthy 
families, such as the Medicis of Florence, used their money to support painters, 
sculptors, and architects. 
Northern Renaissance  By 100, the Renaissance spirit spread to northern 
Europe. While many Renaissance artists emphasized piety in their work, others 
61 DEVELOPMENTS IN E UROPE emphasized human concerns. Geoffrey Chaucer, writing in The Canterbury 
Tales in the late 100s, portrayed a microcosm of middle-class occupations in 
England, including several Church positions. His satirical writings portrayed 
monks who loved hunting and overly sentimental nuns. Like Dante a century 
earlier, Chaucer chose a vernacular, Middle English, for this work, although 
many of his other writings were in Latin.

The Origins of Russia 
During the late Middle Ages in Eastern Europe, extensive trade in furs, fish, 
and grain connected people from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean to Central 
Asia. The city-state at the center of this trade was .ievan Rus, based in 
what is today .iev, Ukraine. Because it adopted the Orthodox Christianity, 
it maintained closer cultural relationships with Byzantium than with Roman 
Catholic Europe. In the 1th century, the Mongols overtook this region, so it 
developed even more separately from of the rest of Europe. See Topic 2.2.
The Mongols required local nobles to collect taxes for them. As these 
nobles grew wealthy in their role, they began to resist Mongol rule. In the late 
15th century, under the leadership of a Moscow-based ruler known as Ivan 
the Great, the region became independent of the Mongols. This marked the 
beginning of the modern state of Russia.

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:  IDENTIFY  HISTORICAL  DEVELOPMENTS
Europe in c. 1200 was an area of decentralized feudal kingdoms with 
little contact with the world beyond the manor. Europe in c. 1450, in 
contrast, was a region of agricultural abundance, growing towns and 
cities, increasing trade with other parts of the world, growing commerce, 
and centralizing states. 
For each of the following aspects of life in Europe, write a sentence 
identifying a development—an event or series of events that fit into 
a broader pattern—that contributed to the changes between c. 1200 
and c. 1450. Review the chapter as needed.

Essential Question:   In what ways was the process of state-building  
in various parts of the world between c. 1200  
and c. 1450 similar and different? 
Between c. 1200 and c. 150, states in core areas of civilization grew larger 
while smaller states declined. In this way, much of the world followed the 
same trend of building more centralized, more powerful states. However, the 
process varied from place to place. In most of Asia, the military strength of 
the Mongols created the largest land-based empire in world history. In West 
Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, the religion of Islam was a key part 
of state-building. In Europe, trade, both internal and with the more advanced 
civilizations of the Middle East, had greater impact. 
State-Building and New Empires
As stronger, more centralized states rose, the influence of nomadic societies 
began to wane by the 15th century. During this period, new empires emerged 
and states around the world expanded. 
• The Song Dynasty in China continued a long period of technological 
and cultural progress.
• The Abbasid Caliphate in the Middle East was fragmented by invaders 
and shifts in trade. Following it, new Muslim states arose in Africa, the 
Middle East, and Spain.
• In South and Southeast Asia, the Chola .ingdom and 9ijayanagar 
Empire used trade to build strong states, while the Delhi Sultanate in 
northern India was more land-based.
• In Africa, the rulers of Mali created an empire that was bigger and 
more centrally administered than the Empire of Ghana that preceded it.
66 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITION• In the Americas, the Aztecs formed a tributary empire in Mesoamerica 
that relied on a strong military. The Inca Empire in the Andean region 
used the elaborate mit’a system as a way to support state-building. In 
contrast, most of the Americas lacked centralized states.
• In Europe, feudal ties declined in importance as centralized states 
developed. This development was clearer in the Western European 
kingdoms of England and France than in Eastern Europe. 
• Japan, unlike most states, became more decentralized and feudal.
The Role of Religion in State-Building
One similarity in much of the world was that religion was a vital part of state-
building. To help unite a diverse population, empires and states often turned 
to religion to strengthen political control over their territory. One excellent 
example of how religion worked with state-building was in the Islamic world. 
Through the unifying power of shared beliefs and a use of the common 
language of Arabic, Islam provided the basis for the legitimacy of rulers from 
West Africa to Southeast Asia.
China and East Asia  Other states also were strengthened by religion. In 
China, the Confucian belief system was closely tied to civil service. The Song 
Dynasty relied on Confucian scholars to run a powerful, enduring bureaucracy. 
No other state had such a well-established and extensive system for conducting 
government affairs across such a large territory. The ability to implement laws 
and carry out imperial edicts was a key part of state-building in China.
Neo-Confucianism see Topic 1.1 spread to .orea and Japan, allowing 
rulers in these East Asian regions to justify and consolidate their political power 
as well. Similarly, rulers in South and Southeast Asia relied on Hinduism and 
Buddhism to aid them in strengthening their states.
Europe  In Europe, the relationship between Roman Catholic Church and 
state-building was somewhat different than in most of Eurasia. At times, the 
Church was part of the state-building process. However, because European 
states were so weak for most of the Middle Ages, the Church had provided 
an alternative structure for organizing society. Then, between 1200 and 150, 
as more powerful states emerged in France and the Holy Roman Empire, the 
Church sometimes became a rival power. 
Diffusion of Religion  The spread of major religions during this time 
period resulted in the influence of religion over wide areas. Islam, Buddhism, 
and Christianity all encouraged their followers to convert non-believers. 
Therefore, missionary activity was an important factor in the decline in the 
practice of local religions in places such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast 
Asia, and East Asia. In South Asia, converts to Islam increased partly as a 
result of military invasions by Islamic armies from Central Asia. However, 
Hinduism remained the predominant religion in South Asia, setting the stage 
for intermittent periods of conflict and tolerance between followers of Islam 
67 COMPARISON IN THE PERIO D FROM C. 1200 TO C. 1450 COMPARISON IN THE PERIO D FROM C. 1200 TO C. 1450 67and Hinduism on the sub-continent. Trade networks in the Indian Ocean, 
South China Sea, East and Central Asia, and across the Sahara Desert helped 
to spread religions as commercial activity increased. 
State-Building Through Trade
Fueled by increased trade, cross-cultural exchanges of technology and 
innovation increased. Innovations in crop production, such as Champa rice 
that spread from 9ietnam to China, helped the Song Dynasty feed and sustain 
a growing population. The resulting effect, a larger and more urban citizenry, 
supported the development of China’s manufacturing capability²the largest 
in the world at the time. Porcelain, silk, steel, and iron production all increased 
during this time. Together, these changes built the Song into the strongest state 
in China since the time of the Han a millennium earlier.
Paper manufacturing, invented in China in the 2nd century B.C.E., made 
its way across Eurasia, reaching Europe around the 1th century. The resulting 
printed material led to increased literacy rates across Europe, the Middle East, 
and North Africa. The focus on intellectual thought and learning led to advances 
in mathematics and medicine, especially in Islamic centers of learning such as 
the House of Wisdom in Bagdad. 
Europe benefited from exchanges with the Middle East, and through it 
with the rest of Asia. Not all contact between Europe and Asia was peaceful. 
Muslims had conquered Spain by force in the 8th century and Christian 
crusaders attempted to seize lands they considered holy in the Middle East 
beginning around 1100. The Mongols fostered the transfer of knowledge, but 
only after they carried out brutal conquests. All of these contacts with Asia 
contributed to state-building in Europe. Between 1200 and 150, the process 
was small and slow, held back by the manorial system and serfdom, but it was 
noticeable. After 150, state-building would increase in speed and significance 
in Europe.
The Impact of Nomadic Peoples
Nomadic peoples played a key role in the process of state building between 
1200 and 150. The Mongols, a pastoral people from the steppes of Central 
Asia, ruled over significant areas of Asia and Eastern Europe during the 1th 
century. (For more on the Mongols, see Topic 2.2.) The political stability 
resulting from Mongol dominance allowed trade across Eurasia to greatly 
expand. Cross-cultural interactions and transfers intensified and some of 
the first direct contacts between Europe and China since the classical period 
occurred, also facilitated by Mongol rule.  
Similar to the Mongols, Turkish peoples, also from the Central Asian 
steppes, increased their dominance over large land-based empires in the eastern 
Mediterranean, Persia, and South Asia that lasted well past 150. However, 
unlike the Mongols, who built their empire initially as a coordinated campaign 
by unified Mongol clans, different Turkish groups built separate empires. 
68 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe Seljuk and Ottoman Turks became dominant forces in the Mediterranean 
region while another Turkish group established an empire located in Persia and 
the surrounding territories. 
The creation of these empires would be among the last major impacts of 
the interaction between settled and nomadic peoples. The role of nomads in 
commerce and cross-cultural exchange diminished as they were replaced by 
organized groups of merchants and trading companies.
Patriarchy and Religion
Social organization in most cultures remained patriarchal. However, cultures 
varied. While religion often reinforced the power of men, its record was mixed.  
For example, convent life for Christians in Europe and in Jainist and Buddhist 
religious communities in South Asia provided women with opportunities for 
learning and leadership. In contrast, in China, women lost some independence 
as the custom of foot binding became more common.

UNIT 1 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   WHO DEVELOPE D GUNS?
The development of gunpowder and its use in guns revolutionized 
world history. However, historians presented various arguments to 
explain who was responsible for starting this revolution.
Chinese Claims and European Doubts  While the Chinese 
long took credit for developing both gunpowder and guns, European 
historians were traditionally skeptical because they doubted the 
Chinese had the technological ability to make such advances. For 
example, Henry Hime, a British military officer, argued in his 10 
book, Gunpowder and Ammunition: Their Origin and Progress,  
that the Chinese “possessed little genius for mechanical or chemical 
inventions” so they had probably “obtained their first gunpowder and 
firearms from the West.” 
Fireworks  European scholars gradually recognized Chinese 
contributions to the technologies that led to the development of guns. 
They first recognized that the Chinese had invented gunpowder and 
that knowledge of the explosive substance had been carried by traders 
and the Mongols to Europe in the 1th century. However, European 
historians continued to argue that the Chinese had used gunpowder only 
for fireworks, not for weaponry. Historian Jack .elly, in a recent book 
about the history of gunpowder, noted that historians had not moved 
much beyond Hime’s argument in their views of Chinese abilities. “The 
notion of China’s benign relationship with gunpowder sprang in part 
from Western prejudices about the Chinese character. Some viewed the 
Chinese as amateurs who stumbled onto the secret of gunpowder but 
couldn’t see its potential. Others saw them as pacifist sages who wisely 
turned away from its destructive possibilities.” 
Agreement  The next step was for Europeans to acknowledge that 
the Chinese historians were correct, and that the Chinese had begun 
using gunpowder to make early forms of guns since the 10th century. 
British scholar Joseph Needham revolutionized Western attitudes 
toward China with his multivolume work Science and Civilization in 
China . Begun in 15, it continued after Needham’s death under other 
scholars and now includes more than 25 volumes. Needham called 
the development of gunpowder “no doubt the greatest of all Chinese 
military inventions.” And he concluded that the Chinese had developed 
the first gun “before other peoples knew of the invention at all.” 
Develop an Argument:  Evaluate the extent to which historical 
evidence supports one of the perspectives on the historical development 
and use of gunpowder. Review outside sources as necessary.

Understand the Context
Between 1200 and 1450, economic activity along existing trade routes 
increased in volume and scope. Technological and commercial innovations, 
imperial expansion, and demand for luxury goods were key factors in the 
ongoing expansion of trade. Growing trade networks accelerated cultural, 
biological, and technological diffusion across Afro-Eurasia. 
Factors that Expanded Trade  Between 1200 and 1450, the rise of 
powerful states and empires played a critical role in increasing the volume and 
geographical reach of existing trade networks. The Mongol Empire promoted 
trade along the Silk Roads, creating a vast commercial network across Eurasia. 
Trade routes across the Sahara and in the Indian Ocean added both West 
Africa and East Africa to this network. Improvements to previously existing 
commercial practices, including forms of credit, facilitated larger networks 
of exchange. Driving this growth in trade was a growing demand for luxury 
goods, such as silk and porcelain from China and gold from Africa. 
Consequences of Trade  In the context of this growing trade, powerful 
new trading cities emerged scattered across Africa and Eurasia. Trade provided 
the setting for significant cross-cultural exchanges. As merchants and other 
travelers moved from place to place, they introduced religious beliefs such as 
Islam and developments in technology such as paper making and gunpowder 
to new communities. Against the backdrop of this transfer of ideas and things, 
came also the rapid spread of deadly diseases, most notably the bubonic plague.

The Silk Roads
And don’t forget that if you treat the customhouse oѝcers with respect,

—Italian merchant Francesco Balducci Peglotti (1471)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the growth  
of networRs  of e_change  after 1200?
More than 1,00 years after the first accounts of travel on the Silk Roads, 
these fabled routes that had fallen into disuse had revived by the 8th and 9th 
centuries. As described by merchant Peglotti, the land route of the Silk Roads 
was vibrant and essential to interregional trade in the 14th and 15th centuries. 
Demand for luxury goods increased in Europe and Africa. Chinese, Persian, 
and Indian artisans and merchants expanded their production of textiles and 
porcelains for export. Caravans made travel safer and more practical, and the 
Chinese developed a system using paper money to manage increasing trade. 
Interregional trade on the Silk Roads flourished.
Causes of the Growth of Exchange Networks
The Crusades helped pave the way to expanding networks of exchange, as 
lords and their armies of knights brought back fabrics and spices from the 
East. Despite the inroads on the Byzantine Empire by the Ottoman Turks, the 
Silk Roads trade routes remained in operation, as did sea routes across the 
Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. China was still eager for Europe’s 
gold and silver, and Europe was growing more eager than ever for silk, tea, 
and rhubarb. Global trade increased. Although Europeans had not yet found 
a route around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, they had 
been making overland trips across Europe for many centuries. 
Rise of New Empires  After the collapse of classical civilizations such 
as the Roman and Han empires, the first golden age of the Silk Roads came 
to an end, and activity declined dramatically. However, by the 8th and 9th 
centuries, Arab merchants from the Abbasid Empire revived the land route 
of the Silk Roads as well as sea routes in the Indian Ocean. Tang China had 
much to offer the newly revived global trade network, including the compass, 
78 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONpaper, and gunpowder. China exported porcelain, tea, and silk. From other 
parts of Asia, China imported cotton, precious stones, pomegranates, dates, 
horses, and grapes. These luxury goods appealed to the upper class of Chinese 
society, whose members reveled in their country’s newfound affluence. This 
period marked the second golden age of the Silk Roads.
No other cause, however, had as significant an impact on the expansion of 
trade as did the rise of the Mongol Empire . Mongols conquered the Abbasid 
Caliphate in 1258, and in the 14th century China came under their control as 
well. Parts of the Silk Roads that were under the authority of different rulers 
were, for the first time, unified in a system under the control of an authority 
that respected merchants and enforced laws. The Mongols improved roads 
and punished bandits, both of which increased the safety of travel on the Silk 
Roads. New trade channels were also established between Asia, the Middle 
East, Africa, and Europe. Those who survived the conquests by the Mongols 
and their descendants benefited from the reinvigoration of trade routes that had 
not been heavily used since the days of the Roman and Han Empires. (You will 
read more about the Mongols in Topic 2.2.)
Improvements in Transportation Technologies  Another cause for the 
expansion of exchange networks was the improvement of transportation. 
Travelers on the overland Silk Roads learned that traveling with others in 
caravans was safer than traveling alone. They also learned how to design 
saddles for camels that greatly increased the weight of the load the animals 
could carry. 
Centuries earlier, China had made advances in naval technology that 
allowed it to control sea-based trade routes in the South China Sea. During 
the Han Dynasty, Chinese scientists developed the magnetic compass  and 
improved the rudder , both of which helped aid navigation and ship control 
along the seas. The Chinese junk , also developed in the Han Dynasty, was 
a boat similar to the Southwest Asian dhow. It had multiple sails and was 
as long as 400 feet—at least triple the size of the typical Western European 
ship of its time. The hull of a junk was divided into compartments. The walls 
making these divisions strengthened the ship for rough voyages at sea and 
made sinking less likely.

Two significant effects of the expansion and stability of the Silk Roads were 
the series of oases that developed along the routes, including thriving cities, 
and commercial innovations that greatly helped to manage the increasing 
trade. 
Cities and Oases  Long stretches of the overland Silk Roads passed 
through inhospitable terrain—hot arid lands where water was scarce. Cities 
along the routes that were watered by rivers became thriving centers of trade. 
For example, the city of Kashgar  is located at the western edge of China where 
northern and southern routes of the Silk Roads crossed, leading to destinations 
79 THE SI LK ROA DS79in Central Asia, India, Pakistan, and Persia. It sits where the Taklamakan Desert 
meets the Tian Shan Mountains and is watered by the Kashgar River, which 
has made the lands along it fertile for crops such as wheat, rice, fruits, and 
cotton. Travelers on the Silk Roads depended on Kashgar for its abundance 
of water and food. Artisans in Kashgar produced textiles, rugs, leather goods, 
and pottery. Its food and handicrafts were sold in a bustling market. At the 
crossroads of both ideas and goods, the once primarily Buddhist city also 
became a center of Islamic scholarship. 
Similarly, Samarkand,  in present-day Uzbekistan in the Zeravshan River 
valley, was a stopping point on the Silk Roads between China and the 
Mediterranean. Samarkand was a center of cultural exchange as much as it was 
a center for trading goods. Archaeological remains show the presence of 
diverse religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and 
Islam. Like Kashgar, Samarkand was known for its artisans as well as its 
centers of Islamic learning and magnificently decorated mosques.

Caravanserai  Large flourishing trading cities such as .ashgar and 
Samarkand, however, were not the only oases along the arid Silk Roads. Once 
the routes of the Silk Roads became stabilized, inns known as caravanserai 
sprang up, often about 100 miles apart. That distance is how far camels could 
travel before they needed water. At the caravanserai, travelers could rest both 
themselves and their animals and sometimes trade their animals for fresh ones. 
The word caravanserai  derives from the Persian words for caravan and palace.
Commercial Innovations   To manage the increasing trade, China 
developed new financial systems. China had long been a money economy—
using money rather than bartering with such commodities as cowrie shells or 
80 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONsalt. However, the  copper coins they used became too unwieldy to transport 
for everyday transactions, so the government developed a system of credit 
known as flyinJ cash . This allowed a merchant to deposit paper money  under 
his name in one location and withdraw the same amount at another location. 
Locations for exchanging flying cash became the model for the banks of the 
modern era, including the banking houses  established in European cities in 
the 1300s. At a banking house, a person could present a bill of exchange— a 
document stating the holder was legally promised payment of a set amount 
on a set date—and receive that amount of money in exchange. Each of these 
innovations encouraged and supported trade by providing convenience and the 
stability of institutions.
The Crusades awakened Europeans’ interest in luxury goods from Asia. 
To acquire them, they organized the trade of European resources. In the 13th 
century, cities in northern Germany and Scandinavia formed a commercial 
alliance called the Hanseatic League . Controlling trade in the North Sea and 
the Baltic Sea, member cities of the league, such as Lubeck, Hamburg, and Riga, 
were able to drive out pirates and monopolize trade in goods such as timber, 
grain, leather, and salted fish. League ships would leave the Baltic and North 
Seas. They would round the Atlantic Coast of Western Europe, proceeding to 
the ports of the Mediterranean. There, they might pick up valuable goods from 
Arab caravans. The league lasted until the mid-17th century, when national 
governments became strong enough to protect their merchants.( Connect:

Increase in Demand  The growing demand for luxury goods from 
Afro-Eurasia, China, Persia, and India led to a corresponding increase 
in the supply of those goods through expanded production. Craftworkers 
expanded their production of such goods as silk and other textiles and 
porcelains for export. Increased demand also led to the expansion of iron 
and steel manufactured in China, motivating its proto-industrialization.

When you contextualize a historical development or process, you place it 
within a larger historical perspective—a “bigger picture.” Sometimes to 
get this perspective you look at the causes of a development or process. 
For example, the historical development of intercultural connections 
was possible in the Classical Era because of the interregional trade along 
the Silk Roads. In the “bigger picture,” these intercultural connections 
bridged the East and the West and began the foundations of a global 
community. 
Identify and describe a context, or “bigger picture,” by looking 
for a cause of each of the following developments during the Song

1. China developed new financial systems in response to increasing 
trade with Arab merchants from the Abbasid Empire.
2. Russia was able to exchange goods and services with other 
cultures farther west.

Essential Question:   How did Eurasian empires grow over time, and how did 
their e_pansion  influence  trade and communication?
The Mongols of Central Asia marched across much of Eurasia throughout the 
13th century, leaving destruction and chaos in their wake. The reputation of the 
Mongols for slaughter spread even farther than their actual conquest. Matthew 
Paris had no firsthand knowledge of the Mongols as he wrote from the safe 
vantage point of a Benedictine abbey in England. Like Paris, most writers of 
the time focused on Mongol atrocities. However, in their quest for blood and 
treasure, the Mongols also sparked a period of interregional connection and 
exchange at a level that the world had not experienced in a thousand years. 
The Mongols and Their Surroundings
In the 12th century, the Mongols were multiple clans of pastoral nomads who 
herded goats and sheep and who were also hunter-foragers, north of the Gobi 
Desert  in East Asia. Life on the arid Asian steppes was harsh, and it shaped 
the Mongol culture. 
The Mongols expected everyone, male and female, to become skilled 
horse riders, and they highly valued courage in hunting and warfare. They 
were surrounded by other tribes—the Tatars, the Naimans, the Merkits, and the 
powerful Jurchen in northern China. The Mongols coveted the relative wealth 
of tribes and kingdoms that were located closer to the Silk Roads and had 
easier access to luxury goods such as silk clothing and gold jewelry. 
86 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONGenghis Khan 
The Mongol leader Temujin, 
born in 1162, spent the early 
decades of his life creating a 
series of tribal alliances and 
defeating neighboring groups 
one by one. He formed key 
friendships and married his 
oldest son to the daughter of 
a neighboring khan , or king. 
Temujin was intensely focused 
on building power. With this 
focus, he sometimes appointed 
talented nonfamily members to 
positions over family members. 
He was often also ruthless. 
For example, he killed his own 
stepbrother. He considered 
personal loyalty the best way 
to run his growing kingdom. In 
1206, Temujin gathered the Mongol chieftains at a meeting called a kuriltai  
where he was  elected khan of the Mongolian Kingdom. He took the name 
Genghis Khan , or “ruler of all.”
The Beginning of Conquest  In 1210, Genghis Khan and his troops 
headed east and attacked the powerful Jin Empire, which had been established 
by the Jurchens a century earlier and now ruled Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, 
and northern China. Its capital was the city of Zhongdu, present-day 
Beijing. Genghis Khan earned his reputation as a terrifying warrior during 
this campaign; anyone who resisted him was brutally killed in retribution. 
Sometimes the Mongols wiped out the civilian populations of entire towns 
after defeating their armies. Stories of Khan’s brutality spread in advance of 
his new westward campaigns, inducing some leaders to surrender before an 
attack. In 1219, Khan conquered both the Central Asian Kara Khitai Empire  
and the Islamic Khwarazm Empire  farther west. By 1227, Genghis Khan’s 
khanate , or kingdom, reached from the North China Sea to eastern Persia. 
(Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the reign of Genghis Khan to the reign 
of Sundiata. See Topic 1.5.)
Genghis Khan at War  Khan’s empire would not have been possible 
without the skilled and fearsome soldiers under his command. Mongolian 
soldiers were strong riders and proficient with the short bow. They were also 
highly disciplined, and .han developed an efficient command structure. To 
help with communication between units, a messenger force was created whose 
members rode for days without stopping, even sleeping on their horses while 
continuing to ride. With the help of Genghis Khan, the Mongolian armies

87 THE MONGO L EMPIRE AN D THE MO DERN WOR LD 87developed special units that mapped the terrain so that they were prepared 
against attacks and knew which way to go to attack their enemies. Their military 
strategies extended to surprise and craft. For instance, Mongol forces frequently 
deployed a band of warriors smaller than that of their enemy, retreating in 
feigned defeat; usually, enemy forces pursued the retreating Mongols, who then 
amassed larger forces to confuse and outflank the enemy.
When coming upon an enemy settlement, Genghis Khan sent a small group 
ahead to ask for surrender. If the enemy refused, he killed all the aristocrats. 
Craftworkers, miners, and others with skills, such as the ability to read and 
write, were recruited for the Mongol Empire. Others were used as laborers for 
tasks such as carrying looted goods back to the Mongol capital or as fodder in 
the front lines of battles.
Mongols quickly incorporated into their military the weapons and 
technology of the peoples they conquered. For example, when they conquered 
parts of China and Persia, they exploited the expertise of captured engineers 
who knew how to produce improved siege weapons , such as portable towers 
used to attack walled fortifications and catapults that hurled stones or other 
objects. To keep contact with the far reaches of the empire, Genghis Khan 
created a type of pony express, except instead of carrying written letters riders 
carried oral messages.
Genghis Khan at Peace  Those who expected Genghis Khan to govern 
the way he made war were surprised. The period of Eurasian history between 
the 13th and 14th centuries is often called the Pax Mongolica , or Mongolian 
peace. Genghis Khan established the capital of his empire at Karakorum, near 
the center of what is now the modern country of Mongolia. In constructing the 
city and establishing his government, he consulted with scholars and engineers 
of Chinese and Islamic traditions. Genghis Khan may have been responsible for 
more new bridges than any other ruler in history. The social policies of Genghis 
Khan were liberal for the day. For example, he instituted a policy of religious 
tolerance throughout the empire, which was unusual in the 13th century. Freed 
from years of warfare, Genghis Khan’s soldiers took charge of protecting the 
Silk Roads, making them safe for trade and ushering in the third golden age 
of the Silk Roads. New trade channels were also established between Asia, 
the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. Those who survived the conquests by 
the Mongols and their descendants benefited from the reinvigoration of trade 
routes that had not been heavily used since the days of the Roman and Han 
Empires. (Connect: List the similarities and differences in religious policies 
between the Pax Mongolica and the Romans. See Prologue.)
Genghis Khan’s effort to unify his empire included directing a scribe 
captured in 1204 to adapt the Uyghur alphabet  to represent Mongol. Although 
the effort to establish one system throughout the empire failed, the alphabet is 
still used in Mongolia today.
88 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMongolian Empire Expands
Three of Genghis Khan’s grandsons set up their own khanates, further expanding 
the empire into Asia and Europe. With each conquest, the empire expanded, 
with new people absorbed into its economy and networks of exchange. 
Batu and the Golden Horde  In 1236, Batu , the son of Khan’s oldest son, 
led a Mongolian army of 100,000 soldiers into Russia, which at the time was a 
loose network of city-states and principalities. Batu’s army, which came to be 
known as the Golden Horde , marched westward, conquering the small Russian 
kingdoms and forcing them to pay tributes. In 1240, the capital city of Kiev 
was looted and destroyed. 
The Golden Horde continued pushing westward. An initial period of sympathy 
for the Mongols, based on religious toleration and promotion of trade, evaporated 
when Western Europe saw the Golden Horde conquer a Christian region, Russia. 
In 1241, Batu led the Golden Horde into a successful military encounter with 
Polish, German, and French knights under the leadership of King Henry of Silesia. 
Soon afterward, Batu defeated a force of Hungarian knights. He next set his sights 
on Italy and Austria, but fate intervened. Back in Karakorum, Ogodei Khan, the 
Great Khan’s successor, had died. Batu called off the attacks and returned home to 
attend the funeral and to see to issues of succession. By the time Batu returned to 
Europe, he had apparently lost interest in conquering Western Europe. 
The Mongols ruled northern Russia by working through existing Russian rulers, 
who sent regular tributes. The Mongols chose this form of indirect rule because they East

began to decline.  By the mid-16th century, Russia had defeated all of the descendant 
khans of the Mongols except the Crimean Tatars, who were not defeated until the 
late 18th century. Connect: Create a five-event timeline tracing the history of  Russia 
from the Mongols to the development of the modern state. See Topics 1.6 and 2.1.)
The Mongols had long-lasting impact on Russia. As elsewhere, Russia 
suffered widespread devastation and death from the Mongol attacks. But once 
the destruction by the Golden Horde was over, Russia began to recover. The 
invasions prompted Russian princes to improve their military organization and 
to accept the value of more centralized leadership of the region. In addition, three 
centuries of Mongol rule severed Russia’s ties with much of Western Europe. As a 
result, Russia developed a more distinctly Russian culture than it had before, and 
resistance to the Mongols created the foundation for the modern Russian state.
Hulegu and the Islamic Heartlands  While Batu led the western armies, 
Hulegu , another grandson of Genghis Khan, took charge of the southwest 
region. In 1258, Hulegu led the Mongols into the Abbasid territories, where 
they destroyed the city of Baghdad and killed the caliph, along with perhaps 
200,000 residents of the city. Hulegu’s Mongolian armies continued to push 
west, threatening more of the Middle East. In 1260, however, they were 
defeated as a result of a temporary alliance between the Muslim Mamluks, 
under their military leader Baibars, and Christian Crusaders in Palestine. Both 
religious groups viewed the Mongols as a serious threat.
At the time of this defeat, Hulegu’s kingdom, called the Il-khanate , in 
Central Asia stretched from Byzantium to the Oxus River, which is now called 
the Amu Darya. Mongols ruled this kingdom, but Persians served as ministers 
and provincial and local officials. The Mongols found that this arrangement 
resulted in maximum tax collection.
Eventually, Hulegu and most of the other Mongols living in the Il-khanate 
converted to Islam. Before this conversion, the Mongols had tolerated all 
religions in Persia. After the conversion, however, Mongols supported 
massacres of Jews and Christians.
Kublai Khan and the Yuan Dynasty  Meanwhile, in the eastern part of 
the Mongolian Empire, a grandson of Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan , set his 
sights on China, which was then ruled by the Song Dynasty. China was a more 
formidable opponent than those faced by the other khans, and Kublai’s armies 
spent the years from 1235 to 1271 attempting to conquer China. In 1260, 
.ublai assumed the title of Great .han, and eleven years later finally defeated 
the Chinese. Adhering closer to Chinese tradition, rather than enforcing 
Mongolian practices of leadership and control, Kublai Khan established the 
Yuan Dynasty . He rebuilt the capital at Zhongdu, which had been destroyed 
by the Mongols in 1215, calling it Dadu. Kublai Khan proved to be skilled at 
90 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONgoverning a large, diverse territory. Like his grandfather, he instituted a policy 
of religious tolerance, which inspired loyalty in formerly oppressed groups 
such as Buddhists and Daoists, who were out of favor in China at the time. 
His policies were also tolerant toward Muslims, Jews, and Christians. With 
these and other reforms and the protection of the Mongolian armies, most 
Chinese initially enjoyed the rule of the Great Khan; he brought prosperity to 
China because of cultural exchanges and improved trade with other countries, 
including European ones. 
Mongol women led more independent lives than women in other societies 
of the time. In their nomadic culture, women tended flocks of sheep and goats 
in addition to raising children and providing meals for the family. Since they 
rode horses as Mongol men did, the women wore the same kind of leather 
trousers. Mongol women could remarry after being widowed and could initiate 
divorces.
Mongols Lose Power  Despite Kublai Khan’s adoption of many Chinese 
customs, Mongolian leaders eventually alienated many Chinese. They hired 
foreigners for the government rather than native-born Chinese. By promoting 
Buddhists and Daoists and dismantling the civil service exam system, 
the Mongols distressed the Chinese scholar-gentry class who were often 
Confucians. Although the official policy was one of tolerance, the Mongolians 
tended to remain separate from the Chinese and prohibited non-Mongols from 
speaking Mongolian.
Just as Batu had reached the limit of Mongol expansion to the west, the 
Mongolian rulers of China failed to expand beyond China. Starting in 1274, 
the Yuan Dynasty tried and failed to conquer Japan, Indochina, Burma, and the 
island of Java. These defeats suggested to the already disenchanted Chinese 
population that the Mongols were not as fearsome as they once had been. In 
the 1350s, the secret White Lotus Society  began quietly organizing to put an 
end to the Yuan Dynasty. In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang , a Buddhist monk from a 
poor peasant family, led a revolt that overthrew the Yuan Dynasty and founded 
the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). 
The Mongols’ defeat in China paralleled a general decline in their power 
elsewhere, and the empire began to shrink. The Golden Horde had lost its 
territory by about 1369, while Central Asian territories were conquered by 
Tamerlane, also known as Timur the Lame, at around the same time. 
(Connect: Describe what the Mongols desired in each of their conquests. See 
Topic 2.1.)
The Long-Term Impact of the Mongolian Invasions
The Mongolian invasions played a key role in history in many ways, positive 
and negative. 
• Mongols conquered a larger area than the Romans, and their bloody 
reputation was usually well-earned.Their empire was the largest 
continuous land empire in history.
91 THE MONGO L EMPIRE AN D THE MO DERN WOR LD • During the period known as the Pax Mongolica (c. 1250–c. 1350), 
Mongols revitalized interregional trade between Asia, the Middle East, 
Africa, and Europe. The Mongols built a system of roads and continued 
to maintain and guard the trade routes. 
• Interregional cultural exchange occurred as well. Islamic scientific 
knowledge made its way to China, and paper from China made 
possible the revolution in communication powered by the Gutenberg 
printing press (see Topic 1.6). The Mongols transferred Greco-Islamic 
medical knowledge and the Arabic numbering system to Western 
Europe.
• The Mongol conquests helped to transmit the fleas that carried the 
bubonic plague , termed the Black Death, from southern China to 
Central Asia, and from there to Southeast Asia and Europe. It followed 
familiar paths of trade and military conquest.
• The Mongols ruled successfully due to their understanding of 
centralized power, a capacity that would transfer in many cases to 
the occupied civilizations. The Mongols devised and used a single 
international law for all their conquered territories. Thus, after the 
Mongols declined in power, the kingdoms and states of Europe, Asia, 
and Southeast Asia continued or copied the process of centralizing 
power.
• Mongol fighting techniques led to the end of Western Europe’s use of 
knights in armor. The heavily clad knights could not react in time to the 
Mongols’ use of speed and surprise.
• The era of the walled city in Europe also came to an end, as walls 
proved useless against the Mongols’ siege technology. Some consider 
the cannon  a Mongol invention, cobbled together using Chinese 
gunpowder, Muslim flamethrowers, and European bell-casting 
techniques.

tale.
‘Lord King!’ he began, ‘these Mongols don’t carry on warfare in an 
honorable, chivalrous way. They fight only to destroy, they are bloodthirsty, 
merciless; their only object is to plunder, slay, murder, and burn, not even to 
make any use of what lands they conquer. They are like a swarm of locusts. 
They stay till everything is eaten up, till all are plundered, and what they 
can’t carry off, that they kill, or reduce to ashes. They are utterly faithless; 
their words and promises are not in the least to be trusted, and those who do 
make friends with them are the first upon whom they wreak their vengeance if

“And the Monarch of the World, the Hatim of the Age, [Mengü] Qa’an [Khan]

against the Qifchaq, and therefore in accordance with precedent the dispatch 
of orders and the assembling of the people took place at the door of the . . . 
palace of his wife, Möge Khatun. . . . But since Törengene Khatun was the 
mother of his eldest sons and was moreover shrewder and more sagacious 
than Möge Khatun, she [Törengene Khatun] sent messages to the princes, 
i.e. the brothers and nephews of the Qa’an . . . and said that until a Khan was

that the business of the state might not be neglected nor the affairs of the 
commonwealth thrown into confusion; in order, too, that the army and the

. . . therefore, until a quriltai [an assembly of Mongol nobles] was held, it was

Making connections helps historians see developments not as isolated 
happenings but rather as pieces of a larger pattern. For example, examining 
the exchange of goods between c. 1200 and c. 1450 takes on much more 
meaning when it is connected with the exchange of ideas, knowledge, 
technology, and religion. The impact of trade on states that participated 
in the Silk Roads exchanges from c. 1200 to c. 1450 went far beyond just 
the goods that changed hands.

EXCHANGE IN THE IN DIAN OCEAN 95
2.3
Exchange in the Indian Ocean
:eek ye knowledge, e]en to *hina 
—Hadith (9th century)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the growth 
of networRs  of e_change  after 1200, and how did 
environmental  Rnowledge  support that e_pansion?
The saying from the Hadith, traditionally attributed to the prophet 
Muhammad, provides guidance to Muslims, encouraging them to travel and 
learn. Following this advice, it is understandable that Dar al–Islam—literally 
the House of Islam, or Muslim world²might be called the world’s first global 
empire. It connected societies from North Africa to South Asia. 
Even before missionaries and imperial armies spread Islam around the 
world, Muslim merchants traveling to non-Muslim lands in search of trading 
partners were paving the way. In fact, Arab merchants had been traveling to 
South Asia for centuries before Islam began expanding. Muslim merchants’ 
connections to Dar al-Islam interacted with developments in sailing technology 
and environmental knowledge to transform the Indian Ocean into an economic 
hot spot during the Postclassical Era .
Causes of Expanded Exchange in the Indian Ocean 
South Asia, with its location in the center of the Indian Ocean, benefited 
enormously from the trade in the Indian Ocean Basin . (Connect: Write a 
paragraph comparing the Islamic global empire with the Mongolian Empire. 
See Topic 2.2.)  Although some of the causes of expanded trade in the Indian 
Ocean Basin were the same as those of expanded overland routes, some related 
specifically to ocean travel and knowledge.
Spread of Islam  Although the Indian Ocean trade had existed as early 
as 200 B.C.E., the expansion of Islam connected more cities than ever before. 
Trading partners existed in East Africa, East and Southeast Asia, and South Asia. 
Muslim Persians and Arabs were the dominant seafarers and were instrumental 
in transporting goods to port cities across the Indian Ocean. Cities on the west 
coast of India, such as Calicut  and Cambay, became thriving centers of trade 
due to interactions with merchants from East Africa and Southwest Asia. 
Calicut, especially, became a bustling port city for merchants in search 
of spices from southern India. Foreign merchants from Arabia and China met 
96 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONin Calicut to exchange goods from the West and the East, respectively. Local 
rulers welcomed the presence of Muslim and Chinese merchants, as it brought 
the city wealth and prominence in the Indian Ocean Basin. 
Increased Demand for Specialized Products  As the Indian Ocean trade 
grew, so did the demand for specialized products. Every region involved in 
trade had something special to offer its trading partners.
• India became known for the high quality of its fabrics, particularly 
cotton. In addition, merchants traveled to India in search of 
meticulously woven carpets as well as high-carbon steel (used for 
knives and swords), tanned leather, and artisan-crafted stonework. 
Merchants also sought pepper from India’s southern coastal cities. 
• Modern-day Malaysia and Indonesia became known as the Spice 
Islands  because of the fragrant nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and 
cardamom they exported. 
• Enslaved people, ivory, and gold came from the Swahili coastal cities 
of Mombasa, Mogadishu, and Sofala. 
• China exported silks, and Chinese porcelain became coveted 
worldwide, which is why people in the West still refer to their fancier 
dishes as “fine china.”
• From Southwest Asia came horses, figs, and dates.
Trade in enslaved people also played a role in exchanges in the Indian 
Ocean. While most Africans who were enslaved and transported to the 
Americas after 1500 came from west and central Africa, there had been a long-
running slave trade in the eastern part of the continent. By routes over land or 
in the Indian Ocean, enslaved people from eastern Africa were sold to buyers 
in northern Africa, the Middle East, and India. Many were transported to the 
islands off the southeast coast of Africa, such as Madagascar. The trade reached 
its peak in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Enslaved people taken in the Indian Ocean trade suffered fates different 
from those who were taken across the Atlantic. Those in the Indian Ocean trade 
were more likely to provide forced labor in seaports in the shipping industry 
and as household servants. Some worked as sailors or even soldiers. Living 
in towns or cities, they had more opportunity to develop communities and to 
work alongside free laborers than did enslaved people taken to the Americas. 
Enslaved people who ended up in Islamic communities had certain rights, such 
as the right to marry. As a result of the Indian Ocean slave trade , African 
words, musical styles, and customs can be found in Oman, India, and elsewhere.
Environmental Knowledge  Knowledge of monsoon winds  was essential 
for trading in the Indian Ocean. In the winter months, winds originated from 
the northeast, while in the spring and summer, they blew from the southwest. 
Thus, merchants had to time their voyages carefully, often remaining in port 
cities for months at a time, depending on when favorable winds would come 
their way. 
97 EXCHANGE IN THE IN DIAN OCEAN 97Advances in Maritime Technology  Travelers needed ships capable of 
navigating the Indian Ocean’s winds. Arab sailors used sailing technology to 
aid their travel. It is debatable whether Arab sailors invented the triangular 
lateen sails  that they used, but the sails were popular because sailors found 
that the triangular shape could easily catch winds coming from many different 
directions. Chinese sailors during the classical period had invented the 
stern rudder , which gave their ships more stability and made them easier 
to maneuver. The small wooden dhows used by Arab and Indian sailors 
dominated the seas during the Postclassical Era. Trade facilitated the rapid 
spread of sailing technology across the many lands bordering the Indian Ocean 
in this period. (See Topic 4.1 for later Chinese maritime technology, such 
as the magnetic compass and improved rudder.) The astrolabe , improved by 
Muslim navigators in the 12th century, allowed sailors to determine how far 
north or south they were from the equator.
Growth of States The trading networks in the Indian Ocean fostered the 
growth of states to help institutionalize the revenue from trade. One Muslim 
city-state, Malacca , also spelled Melaka , became wealthy by building a navy 
and by imposing fees on ships that passed through the Strait of Malacca, a 
narrow inlet that many ship captains used to travel between ports in India and 
ports in China. The Sultan of Malacca became so powerful in the 1400s that 
he expanded the state into Sumatra and the southern Malay Peninsula. As in 
city-states in East Africa, Italy, and the Americas, Malacca’s prosperity was 
based on trade rather than agriculture or mining or manufacturing. 
The sultanate ended when the Portuguese invaded the city in 1511. The 
Portuguese hoped that by conquering the key city on the Strait of Malacca, 
they could control the trade that flowed through it between Europe, India, and 
China. They were successful enough to generate great wealth for their empire. 
However, they were less successful than they had hoped. Their conquest 
touched off conflicts among the other states in the region and caused traders to 
diversify their routes and the ports they used. 
(σecWsRf([SDnGeG([cKDnJeinWKe,nGiDn2ceDn
Some of the very factors that caused expansion of exchange networks in the 
Indian Ocean also, in time, became effects. 
Diasporic Communities  Without the arrival of merchants in distant lands, 
trade could not have expanded. As a natural result of waiting for favorable 
winds for travel, these merchants interacted with the surrounding cultures 
and peoples of the region. In fact, many Arab and East African merchants 
stayed in western Indian port cities permanently because they married women 
they met there. Arab and Persian merchants settled in East Africa. Thus, these 
merchants from Dar al-Islam were the first to bring Islam to southern Asia, 
not through missionary work or conquest, but through intermarriage. Their 
children would generally be raised within Muslim traditions. 
98 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONSettlements of people away from their homeland are known as a diaspora . 
In these communities, settlers introduced their own cultural traditions into 
the indigenous cultures. Those cultures, in turn, influenced the culture of the 
merchants. Diasporas arose through trade in many parts of the world.

Response to Increased Demand  In a similar way, increased demand 
for products caused trade to expand. At the same time, however, it resulted in 
several effects with long-lasting impact. For example, to meet rising demand, 
producers needed to find ways to become more efficient²to grow more crops, 
to make more textiles, to manufacture more iron. In some places, the role of 
the state increased even more to oversee these efforts at efficiency and to raise 
money through customs—taxes on imported goods—and fees for the use of 
seaports. The western Indian Rajput kingdom of Gujarat,  for example, became 
the go-between for trade between the East and West. The revenue from customs 
in Gujarat was many times more than the entire worth of some European states.
Swahili City-States The Indian Ocean trade also created thriving city-states 
along the east coast of Africa, sometimes known as the Swahili city-states . 
“Swahili,” which literally means “coasters,” referred to the inhabitants of 
bustling commercial centers, such as Kilwa, Mombasa (in modern Kenya), and 
Zanzibar (in modern Tanzania). The traders of the Zanj Coast, as it was known 
in Arabic, sold ivory, gold, and enslaved people to their Arab trading partners, 
as well as more exotic goods such as tortoise shells, peacock feathers, and 
rhinoceros horns. In exchange, the “Zanj” cities acquired Chinese porcelain, 
Indian cotton, and manufactured ironwork. Trade was so vigorous with East 
Asia that Chinese porcelain remains a common find among the ruins of Swahili 
cities.
Trade brought considerable wealth to the cities on the East African coast. 
Architectural ruins in Kilwa suggest the wealth and grandeur that once existed 
there. For example, most buildings had traditionally been constructed of mud 
and clay. However, at the Indian Ocean trade’s height, many mosques and 
wealthy merchants’ homes were made of stone or coral.
99 EXCHANGE IN THE IN DIAN OCEANSiJnificant Cultural 7ransIers  The transfer of knowledge, culture, 
technology, commerce, and religion intensified as a result of thriving trade in 
the Indian Ocean Basin. The voyages of the Muslim admiral Zheng He  (1371–
1 reflect this transfer, as well as the conflicts it sometimes generated.  In 
105, the Ming emperor Yongle sent =heng He on the first of seven great 
voyages. Zheng traveled to Indonesia, Ceylon, and other coastal areas on the 
Indian Ocean, to Arabia, and to the east coast of Africa as well as to the Cape 
of Good Hope. The main purposes of the voyages were to display the might of 
the Ming Dynasty to the rest of the world and to receive tribute from the people 
he encountered. =heng’s fleet was impressive: At its height, his fleet included 
more than 300 ships that carried 28,000 people. 
The expeditions won prestige for the Chinese government and opened up 
new markets for Chinese goods. Zheng He and his crew returned to China with 
exotic treasures, such as the first giraffe the Chinese had ever seen. They also 
brought back a new understanding of the world beyond China’s borders. The 
voyages inspired some to immigrate to ports in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.
Zheng He’s voyages stirred controversy, though. Confucianism promoted 
a stable, agrarian lifestyle, and scholars worried that greater interaction and 
trade with foreign cultures threatened China’s social order. Some critics simply 
looked down upon other cultures, deeming them barbaric and vastly inferior to 
Chinese culture. Some thought the voyages were too expensive.
Emperor Yongle’s successor, his son Zhu Gaozhi, ended Zheng He’s 
travels, and he also discouraged all Chinese from sailing away from China. 
To emphasize his point, he made building a ship with more than two masts a 
punishable offense. Zheng’s voyages did have one positive short-term result: Arabian

topic, idea, or event? How is one topic, idea, or event like and/or 
unlike another? Possible answer and connection:  The expansion 
of sea routes for trade is like the expansion of the land-based Silk 
Roads for trade. They are alike in that they both extended global 
interconnections and depended on new technologies.
• Causation: What caused something to happen? Possible answer 
and connection:  China’s withdrawal from sailing to distant lands 
caused a return of piracy in the China Sea.
• Continuity and change: In what ways is something a continuation 
of what came before it? In what ways did something differ from 
what preceded it? Possible answer and connection:  Trade in the 
Indian Ocean had periods in which it flourished before the spread 
of Islam, and flourishing trade continued after the spread of Islam. 
Some changes after the spread of Islam were the high regard 
afforded Muslim merchants and the expansion of trade routes.

Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of Trans-Saharan  
trade, and how did the growth of empires influence  
trade and communication?
While the East African Coast had been fairly well populated for many 
centuries before the arrival of Islam, few societies had inhabited the Sahara 
Desert  because its arid climate made it nearly impossible to farm. Though 
nomadic communities did conduct some trade across the Sahara, the volume 
of trade increased with the arrival of Muslim merchants in the 7th and 8th 
centuries. When empires such as Mali took over the area in the early 1200s, 
commerce expanded dramatically. As illustrated in the commentaries of Ibn 
Battuta, a Muslim scholar and explorer of the 14th century, merchants and 
traders used caravans to facilitate commerce. Africans traded gold, ivory, 
hides, and enslaved people for Arab and Berber salt, cloth, paper, and horses.
Trans-Saharan Trade
The Sahara Desert is immense, occupying 3.6 million square miles—about 
the same size as China. Of that vast expanse of sand and rock, only about 800 
square miles are oases —places where human settlement is possible because 
water from deep underground is brought to the surface, making land fertile. In 
some oases, the water comes from underground naturally. In others, humans 
have dug wells to access the water. 
Camels, Saddles, and Trade  Muslim merchants from Southwest Asia 
traveled across the Sahara on camels. Native to the Islamic heartland (Arabia), 
camels began to appear in North Africa in the 3rd century B.C.E. Accustomed 
to the harsh, dry climate of the Arabian Desert , camels adapted well to living 
104 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONin the Sahara. Compared to horses, camels can consume a large quantity of 
water at one time (over 50 gallons in three minutes) and not need more water 
for a long time. They began to replace horses and donkeys after 300 C.E.
As use of the camel spread, people developed as many as 15 types of 
camel saddles for different purposes. South Arabians developed a saddle in 
which the rider sits in back of the hump, which makes riding easier because 
the rider can hold onto the hair of the hump. Northern Arabians developed a 
saddle for sitting on top of the hump, putting them high in the air, which gave 
them greater visibility in battles. Being near the head gave the rider the best 
possible control over the camel.
However, the saddle that had the greatest impact on trade was one the 
Somalis in Eastern Africa developed. They were semi-nomadic and needed to 
carry their possessions with them, so they designed a saddle for carrying loads 
up to 600 pounds. Without the development of this type of saddle, camels 
could not have been used to carry heavy loads of goods in trade.

105 TRANS-SAHARAN TRA DE RO UTES 105The caravans that crossed the Sahara often had thousands of camels laden 
not only with goods to trade but also with enough provisions, including fresh 
water, to last until the travelers could reach the next oasis. The people leading 
the caravans generally walked the entire way. The map on page 44 shows some 
of the main trade routes across the Sahara. There were seven north-south trade 
routes and two east-west routes. These put the people in Sub-Saharan Africa in 
touch with an expanding number of cultures and trading partners.
By the end of the 8th century C.E., the trans-Saharan trade  had become 
famous throughout Europe and Asia. Gold was the most precious commodity 
traded. West African merchants acquired the metal from the waters of the 
Senegal River, near modern-day Senegal and Mauritania. Foreign traders 
came to West Africa seeking not only gold but also ivory and enslaved people. 
In exchange, they brought salt, textiles, and horses. For more than 700 years, 
trans-Saharan trade brought considerable wealth to the societies of West Africa, 
particularly the kingdoms of Ghana and Mali. They also brought Islam, which 
spread into Sub-Saharan Africa as a result. ( Connect: Compare the impact of 
trade across the Sahara and throughout the Andes. See Topic 1.4. )

West African Empire Expansion
By the 12th century, wars with neighboring societies had permanently 
weakened the Ghanaian state. (See Topic 1.5.) In its place arose several new 
trading societies, the most powerful of which was Mali . North African traders 
had introduced Islam to Mali in the 9th century.
Mali’s Riches  The government of Mali profited from the gold trade, 
but it also taxed nearly all other trade entering West Africa. In that way, it 
became even more prosperous than Ghana had been. Most of Mali’s residents 
were farmers who cultivated sorghum and rice. However, the great cities of 
Timbuktu and Gao accumulated the most wealth and developed into centers 
of Muslim life in the region. Timbuktu in particular became a world-renowned 
center of Islamic learning. By the 1500s, books created and sold in Timbuktu 
brought prices higher than most other goods.
106 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONExpanding Role of States  The growth in trade and wealth gave rise to 
the need to administer and maintain it. For example, rulers needed to establish 
a currency whose value was widely understood. In Mali, the currency was 
cowrie shells, cotton cloth, gold, glass beads, and salt. Rulers also needed 
to protect both the trade routes and the areas where their currencies were 
made or harvested or their other trade resources were produced. Sometimes 
empires expanded their reach to take over resource-rich areas. They did so 
with military forces well provisioned with horses and iron weapons bought 
with the tax revenue. With each expansion, more people were drawn into the 
empire’s economy and trade networks, bringing more people in touch with 
distant cultures.
Mali’s founding ruler, Sundiata , became the subject of legend. His father 
had ruled over a small society in West Africa in what today is Guinea. When 
his father died, rival groups invaded, killing most of the royal family and 
capturing the throne. They did not bother to kill Sundiata because the young 
prince was crippled and was not considered a threat. In spite of his injury, he 
learned to fight and became so feared as a warrior that his enemies forced him 
into exile. His time in exile only strengthened him and his allies. In 1235, 
Sundiata, “the Lion Prince,” returned to the kingdom of his birth, defeated his 
enemies, and reclaimed the throne for himself.
Sundiata’s story made him beloved within his kingdom, but he was also an 
astute and capable ruler. Most scholars believe he was a Muslim and used his 
connections with others of his faith to establish trade relationships with North 
African and Arab merchants. Sundiata cultivated a thriving gold trade in Mali. 
Under his steady leadership, Mali’s wealth grew tremendously.
Mansa Musa  In the 14th century, Sundiata’s grand-nephew, Mansa 
Musa , brought more fame to the region. However, Mansa Musa was better 
known for his religious leadership than for his political or economic acumen. 
A devout Muslim, Mansa Musa began a pilgrimage in 1324 to Mecca , Islam’s 
holiest city. His journey, however, was unlike that of any ordinary pilgrim. 
Mali’s prosperity allowed him to take an extraordinarily extravagant caravan 
to Arabia, consisting of 100 camels, thousands of enslaved people and soldiers, 
and gold to distribute to all of the people who hosted him along his journey. His 
pilgrimage displayed Mali’s wealth to the outside world.
Mansa Musa’s visit to Mecca deepened his devotion to Islam. Upon his 
return, he established religious schools in Timbuktu, built mosques in Muslim 
trading cities, and sponsored those who wanted to continue their religious 
studies elsewhere. Though most West Africans continued to hold onto their 
traditional beliefs, Mansa Musa’s reign deepened the support for Islam in Mali.
However, in fewer than 100 years after Mansa Musa’s death, the Mali 
kingdom was declining. By the late 1400s, the Songhai Kingdom  had taken 
its place as the powerhouse in West Africa. Following processes like those 
Mali had gone through, Songhai became larger and richer than Mali. In 
spite of Mali’s fall, Mansa Musa’s efforts to strengthen Islam in West Africa 
succeeded: The religion has a prominent place in the region today.

the trade networRs  from c. 1200 to c. 1450?
whether by caravan through the Sahara or Gobi deserts or by junk 
or dhow on the China Sea or Indian Ocean, goods, people, and ideas 
traveled with relative freedom through the networks of exchange in Afro-
Eurasia in the years between c. 1200 and c. 1450. One reason for this 
free exchange was the stability of the Mongol Empire and the protection 
it offered merchants and travelers. The empire reached well past former 
boundaries, incorporating new people, goods, and ideas within its 
authority. Technological developments, such as gunpowder and paper 
from China, were diffused by trade. Literary and artistic interactions and 
cultural exchanges were documented by travelers such as Marco Polo 
and Ibn Battuta, who told of the wonders they saw and the extraordinary 
people they met. The known world became a larger place.
Religious, Cultural, and Technological  
(σecWsRf,nWeUDcWiRn
The diffusion of different religions between c. 1200 and c. 1450 had 
varying effects. In some cases, the arrival of a new religion served to 
unify people and provide justification for a kingdom’s leadership. It often 
also influenced the literary and artistic culture of areas to which it spread, 
where themes, subjects, and styles were inspired by the spreading religion. 
In other places, it either fused or coexisted with the native religions. 
The interactions resulting from increased trade also led to technological 
innovations that helped shape the era.
112 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITION,nfluence oI %uGGhisP on (ast $sian Culture  Buddhism came to China 
from its birthplace in India via the Silk Roads, and the 7th-century Buddhist 
monk Xuanzang helped make it popular. Monks related Buddhism to familiar 
Daoist principles, and in time Buddhist doctrines fused with elements of 
Daoist traditions to create the syncretic faith Chan Buddhism, also known as 
Zen Buddhism. Although some leaders in China did not want China’s native 
religions diminished as a result of the spread of Buddhism, Chan Buddhism 
remained popular among ordinary Chinese citizens. Under the Song Dynasty 
(960–1279), many Confucians among the scholar gentry began to adopt its 
ideals into their daily lives. The development of printing had made Buddhist 
scriptures widely available to the Confucian scholar gentry. Buddhist writers 
also influenced Chinese literature by writing in the vernacular rather than the 
formal language of Confucian scholars, a practice that became widespread. 
Japan and Korea, countries in China’s orbit, also adopted Buddhism, 
along with Confucianism. In Korea, the educated elite studied Confucian 
classics, while Buddhist doctrine attracted the peasants. Neo-Confucianism 
was another syncretic faith that originated in China, first appearing in the 
Tang Dynasty but developing further in the Song Dynasty. Neo-Confucianism 
fused rational thought with the abstract ideas of Daoism and Buddhism and 
became widespread in Japan and 9ietnam. It also became .orea’s official state 
ideology.

113 CULTURAL CONSEQ UENCES OF CONNECTI VITY 113Spread of Hinduism and Buddhism  Through trade, the Indian religions 
of Hinduism and Buddhism made their way to Southeast Asia as well. The 
sea-based Srivijaya Empire on Sumatra was a Hindu kingdom, while the 
later Majapahit Kingdom on Java was Buddhist. The South Asian land-based 
Sinhala dynasties in Sri Lanka became centers of Buddhist study with many 
monasteries. Buddhism’s influence was so strong under the Sinhala dynasties 
that Buddhist priests often advised monarchs on matters of government. (See 
Topic 1.3.) 
The Khmer Empire in present-day Cambodia, also known as the Angkor 
Kingdom, was the most successful kingdom in Southeast Asia. The royal 
monuments at Angkor Thom are evidence of both Hindu and Buddhist cultural 
influences on Southeast Asia. Hindu artwork and sculptures of Hindu gods 
adorned the city. Later, when Khmer rulers had become Buddhist, they added 
Buddhist sculptures and artwork onto buildings while keeping the Hindu 
artwork. 
Spread of Islam  Through merchants, missionaries, and conquests, Islam 
spread over a wide swath of Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The chart 
below summarizes some of the cultural influences of that expansion.
Cultural Inﬂuences of Islam in Afro-Eurasia
Region 0nÅ\enJeZ
Africa • Swahili  language is a blend of Bantu and Arabic and is still 
widely spoken today.
• Timbuktu became a center of Islamic learning.
• Leaders of African states deepened Islamic ties through 
pilgrimages to Mecca.
South Asia • Before Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism were popular.
• After Islam arrived, Buddhists converted more readily than 
Hindus because they were disillusioned by the corruption 
among Buddhist priests.
• With its emphasis on equality, Islam also attracted lower-caste 
Hindus.
• Architecture blended Hindu designs with Islamic patterns.
• Urdu language had influences from Sanskrit-based Hindi, as 
well as from Arabic and Farsi, a Persian language.
• Bhakti poets and missionaries sought links between Hinduism 
and Islam. 
Southeast Asia • Muslim rulers on Java combined Mughal Indian features, local 
traditions, and Chinese-Buddhist and Confucian traits.
• Traditional Javanese stories, puppetry, and poetry absorbed 
Muslim characters and techniques.
Scientific anG 7echnoloJical ,nnoYations  Along with religion, science 
and technology traveled the trade routes. Islamic scholars translated Greek 
literary classics into Arabic, saving the works of Aristotle and other Greek 
thinkers from oblivion. Scholars also brought back mathematics texts from 
114 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIndia and techniques for papermaking from China. They studied medicine 
from ancient Greeks, Mesopotamians, and Egyptians, making advances in 
hospital care, including surgery. (See Topic 1.2.)
Improvements in agricultural efficiency, such as the use of Champa 
rice, spread from India to Vietnam and China. With a reliable food supply, 
the population grew, as did cities and industries, such as the production of 
porcelain, silk, steel, and iron. Papermaking reached Europe from China in 
the 13th century and along with printing technology helped lead to a rise in 
literacy.
Seafaring technology improved with lateen sails , the stern rudder , the 
astrolabe , and the magnetic compass  as Chinese, Indian, and Southwest 
Asians expanded their knowledge of astronomy and other aspects of the natural 
world. Production of gunpowder  and guns spread from China and influenced 
warfare as well.
Thanks, in part, to the writing of Marco Polo, historians have a good picture 
of the city of Hangzhou  in China. It shows how trade supported urbanization. 
Hangzhou was large—it was home to about one million people—but other 
Chinese cities were larger. Chang’an had about two million people. However, 
Hangzhou was the center of culture in southern China, the home of poets such 
as Lu Yu and Xin Qiji, and other writers and artists. Located at the southern 
end of the Grand Canal, it was also a center of trade. Like other important 
cities of the era, such as Novgorod in Russia, Timbuktu in Africa, and Calicut 
in India, the city grew and prospered as its merchants exchanged goods. This 
trade brought diversity to Hangzhou, including a thriving community of Arabs.
Other cities on the trade routes that grew and thrived included Samarkand  
and Kashgar.  (See Topic 2.1.) They were both known as centers of Islamic 
scholarship, bustling markets, and sources for fresh water and plentiful food 
for merchants traveling the Silk Roads. 
Factors Contributing to Growth of Cities
• Political stability and decline of invasions
• Safe and reliable transportation
• Rise of commerce
• Plentiful labor supply
• Increased agricultural output
Declining Cities  Kashgar, however, declined after a series of conquests 
by nomadic invaders and in 1389–90 was ravaged by Tamerlane. (See Topic 
2.2.) Another once-thriving city, the heavily walled Constantinople  in present-
day Turkey, also suffered a series of traumatic setbacks. Mutinous Crusader 
armies weakened Constantinople after an attack in the Fourth Crusade in 1204 
(see Topic 1.6), and in 1346 and 1349, the bubonic plague killed about half of 
the people in Constantinople. After a 5-day seige, the city finally fell to the 
Ottomans in 1453, an event some historians believe marks the end of the High 
Middle Ages. (Connect: Describe the relationship between urban growth in

115 CULTURAL CONSEQ UENCES OF CONNECTI VITY Factors Contributing to Decline of Cities
• Political instability and invasions
• Disease
• Decline of agricultural productivity
Effects of the Crusades  Knowledge of the world beyond Western Europe 
increased as Crusaders encountered both the Byzantine and Islamic cultures. The 
encounters also increased demand in Europe for newfound wares from the East. In 
opening up to global trade, however, Western Europeans also opened themselves 
to disease. The plague, referred to as the Black Death , was introduced to Europe 
by way of trading routes. A major epidemic broke out between 1347 and 1351. 
Additional outbreaks occurred over the succeeding decades. As many as 25 
million people in Europe may have died from the plague. With drastically reduced 
populations, economic activity declined in Europe. In particular, a shortage of 
people to work on the land had lasting effects on the feudal system. Also, exposure 
to new ideas from Byzantium and the Muslim world would contribute to the 
Renaissance and the subsequent rise of secularism.
Travelers’ Tales
As exchange networks intensified and literacy spread as a result of paper and 
printing technology, an increasing number of travelers within Afro-Eurasia 
wrote about their journeys for eager readers.

116 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMarco Polo  In the late 13th century, Marco Polo , an Italian native from 
Venice, visited the court of Kublai Khan. (See Topic 2.2.) Chinese cities 
impressed Polo. After Polo returned to Italy in 1295, he wrote a book about 
his travels. However, many Europeans refused to believe his descriptions 
of China’s size, wealth, and wonders. Only when other Europeans followed 
Polo’s route to China did people widely accept that China was prosperous 
and innovative. Polo’s captivating descriptions of the customs of the people 
he met intrigued Europeans. Polo wrote extensively about the high levels of 
urbanization he saw in the 13th century. Polo’s point of view as a merchant 
kept him focused on trade-related matters.
They use paper money as currency. The men as well as the women are fair-
skinned and handsome. Most of them always dress themselves in silk, as a 
result of the vast quantities of that material produced in Hangzhou, exclusive 
of what the merchants import from other provinces.
Ibn Battuta  He was just 21 years old, Ibn Battuta  (1304–1353), a 
Muslim scholar from Morocco, set out to see the world he read about. 
I set out alone, having neither fellow-traveller in whose companionship I 
might find cheer, nor caravan whose part I might join, but swayed by an 
overmastering impulse within me and a desire long-cherished in my bosom 
to visit these illustrious sanctuaries.
Over 30 years, Ibn Battuta traveled through Central Asia, Southeast Asia, 
South Asia, China, Spain, North Africa, and Mali, mainly to Muslim lands. 
After telling his tales to the Sultan of Morocco, Battuta was told to “dictate 
an account of the cities which he had seen in his travel, and of the interesting 
events which had clung to his memory, and that he should speak of those 
whom he had met of the rulers of countries, of their distinguished men of 
learning, and of their pious saints.” His book A Gift to Those Who Contemplate 
the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Traveling  provides a wealth of detail 
about the places he visited and their cultures. Unlike Polo, Battuta had the 
point of view of a Muslim devoted to his faith. His journey was in large part 
to learn as much as he could about Islam and its people and accomplishments.

Rome, Germany, and Spain. She does relate details of her travel experiences, 
such as being so overcome by the sight of Jerusalem as she approached it that 
she nearly fell off her donkey. However, her book is also significant because it 
is a firsthand account of a middle-class medieval woman’s life. .empe conveys 
both the intense spiritual visions and feelings of her mystical experiences and 
the trials of everyday life for a woman with 14 children.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“Ibn Battuta traveled primarily in Muslim-ruled lands, the Dar al-Islam [House 
or Abode of Islam], while the Christian Polo, son of a European merchant, 
lived and worked in countries whose cultures and religions were foreign to 
him. This difference makes a comparison of their works most interesting. 
Marco Polo’s knowledge of four Asian languages as well as Italian allowed 
him to communicate with foreigners and even work as an administrator for the 
Chinese emperor. Yet, in all his travels, he remained culturally an “outsider” 
to the peoples he met, and this fact enhanced his power of observation and 
stimulated his natural curiosity. By contrast, Ibn Battuta usually traveled as an 
“insider” and his hosts accepted him as a respected Muslim jurist [qadi] and 
student of Islamic mysticism >Sufism@. Traveling to more than sixty Muslim 
courts, where he met rulers and their officials, Ibn Battuta was able to judge 
the behavior of his hosts in light of the Muslim scripture, the Koran, and the 
precepts of Islamic law. For him, the difference between their native cultures 
and his own North Arabic culture was a secondary importance.”

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“The borrowing and lending necessary for most of the crusaders stimulated 
credit formation and the development of credit institutions and instruments. 
Indeed, the money economy as a whole must have been stimulated by these 
great enterprises which took so much money. The transformation of gold and 
silver altar ornaments into coin for crusaders may have helped to heighten 
the inflation that occurred during the Crusades, especially in the later 12th 
century. The sale of land to finance most assuredly helped to make the market 
in real estate which was bringing about a new social order in the age of the 
Crusades. The principal beneficiaries of all these financial transactions were 
the bourgeoisie, who loaned the money, bought the land, sold the provisions, 
furnished the transportation, and generally benefited from the financial 
activity of the crusaders.”

Historical evidence comes from many sources, including such primary 
sources as ruins and eyewitness accounts in diaries and letters as 
well as secondary sources created later based on information from 
primary sources and other secondary sources. While they all might be 
“truthful,” each has a perspective, or point of view, that might color 
the interpretation of events and experiences. To evaluate historical 
evidence, identify a source’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, 
and/or audience. Ask the following questions:
• Who created this evidence? 
• What might be unique about his or her point of view? 
• For what purpose was the source created?
• For whom and in what situation was it created? 
• How did people use it at the time? 
The answers to these questions will help you determine what strengths

Essential Question:   What were some of the environmental  effects of  
trade in Afro-Eurasia  from c. 1200 to c. 1450?
Although trade networks enabled the spread of novel agricultural products, 
such as the introduction of certain citrus fruits to the Mediterranean basin, the 
most dramatic environmental consequence of increased commerce was not 
food, but rather disease. Bubonic plague or “Black Death” swept from Central 
Asia; struck in China, India, Persia, and Egypt; and arrived in Europe in 1347. 
The epidemic is estimated to have killed from 75 to 200 million people in 
Eurasia and peaked in Europe from 1347 to 1351. Boccaccio, whose famous 
work The Decameron  was inspired by living through the plague, described the 
horrors he saw.

Along with luxury goods, spices, textiles, and religions, merchants in some 
places introduced crops where they had not grown before. The new crops often 
had an impact on land use and population growth and distribution. In some 
areas, people found ways to sustain abundant production; in others, overuse of 
the land led to environmental degradation.
Migration of Crops  Few crops had as significant an impact as the quick-
ripening Champa rice , which was introduced to the Champa states by Vietnam, 
a Hindu state, and then offered to the Chinese as tribute. Because of the Hindu 
influence on Champa in present-day central 9ietnam, some scholars believe 
Champa rice may have originated in India. It was drought-resistant, flood-
resistant, and capable of yielding two crops a year. It was widely distributed in 
China to meet the needs of the growing population and in turn contributed to 
the population growth.
It also had an impact on land use. Through terraced farming in the uplands 
and paddies in the lowlands, Champa rice was grown in many parts of China 
where once land was thought unusable for growing rice. Nonetheless, as the 
122 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONpopulation of China grew, people tended to migrate southward to the original 
rice growing region, contributing to the growth of cities.
Indonesian seafarers traveling across the Indian Ocean had introduced 
bananas  to Sub-Saharan Africa. The nutrition-rich food led to a spike in 
population. Many Indonesians settled on the island of Madagascar. Bananas 
allowed the Bantu-speaking peoples (see Prologue) with their metallurgy 
skills and farming techniques to migrate to places where yams—a traditional 
food source—did not easily grow. To grow bananas, farmers increased land for 
cultivation, which enriched diets and led to population growth.
As caliphs conquered lands beyond the Arabian Peninsula, they spread 
Islam, the Arabic language, and the cultivation of cotton, sugar , and citrus 
crops . New foods were also available at the markets along the trade routes. 
The markets of Samarkand, for example, introduced new fruits and vegetables, 
as well as rice and citrus products from Southwest Asia, to Europe. Europeans’ 
demand for sugar would become so high that it became a key factor in the 
massive use of enslaved people in the Americas in the 1500s and after. ( Connect:

This photo was taken in 1911 of a vendor in the central Asian city of Samarkand. In 
the valleys in this region, people have long grown melons, grapes, apples, citrus fruits, 
pomegranates, apricots, peaches, and other fruits. These products were then widely 
distributed by merchants who traveled on the Silk Roads.
123 ENVIRONMENTA L CONSEQ UENCES OF CONNECTI VITY 123Environmental Degradation  Increases in population put pressure on 
resources. For example, overgrazing  outside of Great Zimbabwe was so 
severe that people had to abandon the city in the late 1400s. (See Topic 1.5.) 
In feudal Europe, overuse of farm land and deforestation  led to soil erosion , 
reducing agricultural production. The Little Ice Age (c. 1300–c. 1800) also 
contributed to a decrease in agricultural products. Environmental degradation 
was a factor in the decline of the Mayans in the Americas as well.
Spread of Epidemics through Exchange Networks
While scholars in Dar al-Islam and India were developing advances in medical 
understanding and treatment, no knowledge at the time could have prevented 
the spread of deadly infectious diseases that accompanied trade. The Mongol 
conquests helped to transmit the fleas that carried the bubonic plague , termed 
the Black Death, from southern China to Central Asia, and from there to 
Southeast Asia and Europe. Some historians believe the caravanserai that 
housed people and animals together may have contributed to the spread of the 
disease, since the animals likely carried infected fleas. 
The Black Death had a tremendous impact on Europe, killing one-third 
of the population there in a few years. With fewer workers, agricultural 
production continued its decline. However, the reduced number of workers 
led to a new relationship between workers and those they worked for: each 
person’s labor became more valuable, so workers could demand higher wages. 
This shift helped lay the groundwork for the economic changes that developed 
as feudalism declined.
The Black Death led to similar loss of life in other areas, including North 
Africa, China, and Central Asia. About 25 million Chinese and other Asians 
died between 1332 and 1347. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa were spared 
because there were few trading ports in those regions.

• Moroccan historian Ibn Khaldun wrote about the black plague outbreak 
this way:  “Civilization both in the East and the West was visited by a 
destructive plague which devastated nations and caused populations to 
vanish. It swallowed up many of the good things of civilization and wiped 
them out. . . . Civilization decreased with the decrease of mankind. Cities 
and buildings were laid waste, roads and way signs were obliterated, 
settlements and mansions became empty, dynasties and tribes grew weak. 
The entire inhabited world changed.”
• In The Travels of Ibn Battuta , the great traveler noted that as of 1345, “the 
number that died daily in Damascus [Syria] had been two thousand,” but the 
people were able to defeat the plague through prayer.
• An Italian lawyer, Gabriele de Mussis, recorded: “The whole army was 
affected by a disease which overran the Tartars [Mongols] and killed 
thousands upon thousands every day.” He [charges] that the Mongol 
leader “ordered corpses to be placed in catapults and lobbed into the city 
in hopes that the intolerable stench would kill everyone inside.”
• A French churchman, Gilles li Muisis, notes that a “calamitous disease befell 
the Tartar army, and the mortality was so great and widespread that scarcely 
one in twenty of them remained alive.” However, he depicts the Mongol 
survivors as surprised when the Christians in Kaffa also came down with the 
disease.

126 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   M A K I N G  CONNECTIONS  BY ANALYZING 
CAUSATION
One way to make connections across cultures and eras is to analyze cycles 
of cause and effect. For example, improved agricultural production 
often leads to increased population. Increased population, in turn, 
requires even more agricultural production. Efforts to fulfill agricultural 
and other needs associated with increased population, in turn, may 
lead to pressure on resources, including environmental degradation, 
and the population may decline as a result or be vulnerable to disease 
or conquest. However, with the next improvement in agriculture or 
another economic advancement, the population may grow again, and 
so the cycle continues. Recognizing this somewhat predictable cycle of 
cause and effect can help you make connections by seeing it in action in 
different geographic areas at different times in history.
Describe a similar cycle of cause and effect related to increased 
demand for goods rather than for food. Then, analyze cause-
and-effect connections between cultures that were involved in 
transregional exchange networks from c. 1200 to c. 1450.

Essential Question:   What were the similarities  and differences  among the 
various networRs  of e_change  in the period from c. 
1200 to c. 1450?
Calicut was known as the “City of Spices,” a market city where merchants 
traded their goods for pepper and cinnamon from India and a variety of goods 
from other areas as well. In some ways, such as its ability to provide security 
and the diversity of people who patronized the markets, Calicut was like other 
big trading cities along the well-traveled trade routes. In other ways, such as 
the type of currency it used and how the polity, or governmental unit,  made 
money on trade, it differed from trading cities elsewhere. The similarities 
and differences among trading cities were also reflected in the larger trading 
networks. 
Similarities Among Networks of Exchange
Several major trading networks connected people in Africa, Europe, and Asia 
in the years between c. 1200 and c. 1450:
• the Silk Roads through the Gobi Desert and mountain passes in China 
and Central Asia to Southwest Asia and Europe, on which merchants 
tended to specialize in luxury goods 
• the monsoon-dependent trade routes in the Indian Ocean linking East 
Asia with Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Southwest Asia, on which 
merchants exchanged goods too heavy to transport by land
• the trans-Saharan trade routes from North Africa and the Mediterranean 
Basin across the desert to West and East Africa, on which merchants 
traded salt from North Africa with gold from the kingdoms south of  
the desert 
128 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONWhile each exchange network had its unique characteristics, all were similar 
in their origins, purpose, and effects. 
Origins   Interregional trade began well before the common era as agrarian 
cultures consolidated into stable settlements. The trade that flourished between 
c. 1200 and c. 1450 built on the routes these early traders—and conquerors—
first traced. As kingdoms and empires expanded, so did the trade routes they 
controlled and traveled. 
The Postclassical trading networks also needed the stability of established 
states to grow and expand. Stable kingdoms, caliphates, city-states, or empires 
assured merchants that the routes and the merchants themselves would 
be protected—which is why the wealthy merchants in Calicut could walk 
away from their cargoes knowing they would not be stolen. Stable polities 
also supported the technological upgrades that made trade more profitable²
nautical equipment such as the magnetic compass and lateen sail, high-yielding 
strains of crops, and saddles to allow for the carriage of heavy loads of goods. 
Purpose  The trading networks shared an overall economic purpose: to 
exchange what people were able to grow or produce for what they wanted, 
needed, or could use to trade for other items. In other words, their purpose 
was primarily economic. However, as you have read, people exchanged 
much more than just products. Diplomats and missionaries also traveled the 
trade routes, negotiating alliances and proselytizing for converts. Together, 
merchants, diplomats, and missionaries exchanged ways of life as well as 
economic goods. 
Effects   All the exchange networks also experienced similar effects. 
Because of the very nature of a network—which can be described as a fabric 
of cords crossing at regular distances, knotted for strength at the crossings—
the trade routes all gave rise to trading cities, the “knots” that held the network 
together.

129 COMPARISON OF ECONOMIC EXCHANGE 129The growth of trading cities gave rise to another effect of the trade 
networks: centralization. Malacca, for example, grew wealthy from the fees 
levied on ships and cargoes passing through the Strait of Malacca. To prevent 
piracy, Malacca used its wealth in part to develop a strong navy—an endeavor 
that required centralized planning. Trading cities along each of the trade routes 
underwent similar developments, using their wealth to keep the routes and the 
cities safe.  
Another aspect of trade in the cities that encouraged centralization was 
the desire for a standardized currency. Widely accepted currencies sped up 
transactions and enabled merchants to measure the value of products.

131 COMPARISON OF ECONOMIC EXCHANGE The trading networks also had unique currencies and commercial practices. 
For example, at one time silk was not only a commodity but also a currency. 
In places in Southeast Asia, tin ingots were used as a currency standard. West 
African states used cowrie shells as currency. 
In time, however, states shifted to a money economy based on gold and 
other metal coins. To make commerce less bulky, the Chinese invented “flying 
cash” (see Topic 2.1) and established the precursors of banks, including the 
practice of extending credit.
Social Implications of Networks of Exchange
The rising demand for luxury goods spurred efforts to make production more 
efficient than it had been. China went through a period of proto-industrialization 
as it sought to meet the demand for iron, steel, and porcelain. (See Topic 1.1.)  
New business practices, such as partnerships for sharing the risk of investment, 
began to emerge. 
The production of goods such as textiles and porcelain in China and 
spices in South and Southeast Asia increased to meet demands. As the amount 
of goods increased, the volume of trade on maritime trade routes began to 
supersede that of the overland trade routes. Larger ships were needed as well 
as improved navigational knowledge and technology.
Labor  The demand for labor rose along with the growing demand for 
products. The forms of labor from earlier periods continued—free peasant 
farmers, craft workers or artisans in cottage industries, people forced to work 
to pay off debts, and people forced into labor through enslavement. Trade 
in enslaved people was common along the Indian Ocean and trans-Saharan 
routes.
Large-scale projects—irrigation canals, military defenses, great 
buildings—called for the work of thousands of organized laborers. Kinship 
ties often played a role in coordinating these large-scale projects. An observer 
in the Vijayanagara Empire in South India in the 1300s describes the work of 
completing a giant reservoir:

amongst his captains, each of whom had the duty of seeing that the people 
placed under him did their work, and that the tank was finished and brought 
to completion.” 
Narrative of Domingo Paes (1520–22)
Social and Gender Structures The typical social structures during the 
period between 1200 and 150 were still defined by class or caste, and societies, 
with rare exceptions, remained patriarchies. There were, however, areas where 
women exercised more power and influence. For example, even though the 
vast Mongol Empire was a patriarchy, Mongol women had somewhat more 
freedom than women in most other parts of Afro-Eurasia. Mongol women 
moved about freely and refused the burka from the West and foot binding from 
the East. Women were also often top advisors to the great khan. 
In Europe, women worked as farmers and artisans, and they had their 
own guilds. In Southeast Asia, women were skilled in the practices of the 
marketplace, operating and controlling marketplaces as representatives of 
powerful families. Outside of these limited areas, however, women within 
other major regions still experienced far fewer opportunities and freedoms 
than men in virtually all aspects of life. 
Environmental Processes  The interconnections that spurred so much 
vibrant economic and cultural exchange also led to a steep population decline 
as merchants, diplomats, and missionaries transferred the bubonic plague and 
other infectious diseases along the trade routes. The plague, named the Black 
Death, contributed to the decline of once-great cities, such as Constantinople. 
Most believe that at least a third of Europe’s population died during this 
period. China experienced outbreaks in the 1330s and 1350s, causing tens of 
millions of deaths. 
Changes in trade networks led to cultural diffusion and the development  
of educational centers in cities such as Canton, Samarkand, Timbuktu, 
Cairo, and Venice. Political instability and increased agriculture strained the 
environment. For example, soil erosion from deforestation, or overgrazing, 
forced growing populations to migrate to other areas.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  H O W  BRUTAL WAS  GENGHIS  KHAN ?
Was Genghis Khan a brutal destroyer who murdered millions, or was he a 
great unifier who promoted prosperity by unifying most of Eurasi a" 
The Destroyer  Many historians emphasize that Khan was a 
bloodthirsty tyrant. Military historian Steven R. Ward writes that 
“Overall, the Mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-
fourths of the population of the Iranian Plateau.” Total deaths attributed 
to the Mongols during his rule and the rule of his descendants are in 
the tens of millions. Stories of his massacres of innocent people and of 
using unarmed civilians to protect his own soldiers show him to have 
had little regard for human life. 
The Empire Builder  Other historians focus on Khan’s role as a 
great leader. Mongolian scholars, proud of their countryman, argue that 
charges of brutality have been exaggerated. As historians from Europe 
and the United States focused more on trade and toleration, they saw 
benefits of the Mongol rule, often referring to Pax Mongolica . Genghis 
Khan forged a united China and established a system of Eurasian trade 
that renewed the links between China and Europe that had lapsed. Further, 
the Mongols were open to ideas and tolerant of different religions. Khan 
believed in a meritocracy, and he established one writing system across 
his empire. His rule opened the way for new systems of laws, for trade, 
and for cultural expansion.

UNIT 3: LAND-BASED EMPIRES 141
UNIT 3:   Land-Based Empires 
Understand the Context
Great land-based empires existed before 1450 and after 1750. However, 
between these years, several of history’s greatest land-based empires reached 
their peak of wealth and influence. Among these were the Songhai in West 
Africa the Safavids based in Persia the Mughals in northern India the 
Ottomans in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Northern Africa and the 
Manchus in eastern Asia. They were multiethnic states that had direct political 
control over large regions and overland trade routes.
Expansion  Since these empires measured their power in land, they 
frequently warred against neighbors over territory. The Manchus, who 
established the Qing Dynasty in China in 16, were very successful in this. 
By 111, they had tripled the amount of land they controlled. 
Centralization  Land-based empires in this period prospered by 
consolidating their power in a central government. They employed bureaucratic 
elites to enforce laws and military professionals to provide defense. To pay 
for the bureaucrats and soldiers, they collected tributes from weaker states 
and taxes from their citizens. To demonstrate their wealth and power, they 
constructed great palaces, religious buildings, and shrines. 
Belief Systems  Land-based empires were often closely tied with particular 
religious faiths. As a result, political and religious conflicts were intertwined. 
In Europe, Roman Catholics and Protestants fought wars in which millions of 
people died. In Asia, the Safavids, who were Shi’a Muslims, and the Mughals, 
who were Sunni Muslims, were often at war.  
After 1750  Many land-based empires began declining in power in the 18th 
century. The increasing importance of ethnic identities for individuals, ocean 
routes for trade, and economic relationships among businesses undermined 
the unity and influence that land-based empires initially developed.14501550 1650 1750

3.1
European, East Asian, and 
Gunpowder Empires Expand
What men call sovereignty is a worldly strife and constant war;  
Worship of God is the highest throne, the happiest of all estates.
—Suleiman the 4agniÄcent (1494–15)
Essential Question:   How did certain land-based empires develop and 
e_pand in the period from 1450–1750?
From its origins in China, gunpowder spread via the trade routes and became 
a powerful source of change between 150 and 150. The term Gunpowder 
Empires  refers to large, m ultiethnic  states in Southwest, Central, and South 
Asia that relied on firearms to conquer and control territories. In addition to 
Russia, the Gunpowder Empires included three in which Islam was strong: the 
Ottoman, the Safavid, and the Mughal Empires. Suleiman the Magnificent,  
quoted above, ruled the Ottoman Empire at its height. Although he declared 
religious worship the happiest of all practices, he also personally led Ottoman 
armies in conquering Christian strongholds in Belgrade, Rhodes, and 
Hungary in Southeastern Europe. The Gunpowder Empire societies tended 
to be militaristic, yet all three left splendid artistic and architectural legacies, 
created in part to reflect the legitimacy of their rulers.
The Qing Empire of China also expanded, and although it experienced 
several invasions, it also prospered during long periods of stability. Europe’s 
expansion involved an even wider exchange network than that which spread 
gunpowder: transoceanic connections with the Americas. You will read more 
about this path to empire expansion in Unit .
Armed trade was common in expanding empires during this period. The 
different empires traded with one another. However, they kept troops and 
armaments at the ready in case another empire questioned their right to trade. 
This type of exchange differed from the free markets of later eras.
Europe
The year 150 has traditionally signified the ending of the medieval period 
and the beginning of the early modern period. The mid-100s saw the end 
of a wave of plagues, the conclusion of the Hundred Years’ War between 
144 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONFrance and England see Topic 1.6, and the invention of the Gutenberg 
printing press  followed by an increase in literacy. After the slow political 
and economic development of the Middle Ages, several countries in Europe 
were becoming powerful, wealthy nations. New monarchies began to launch 
overseas explorations and establish colonies around the world. 
The nature of the new monarchies in Europe in the 1500s was the result 
of the desire of certain leaders to centralize power by controlling taxes, the 
army, and many aspects of religion. These new monarchs included the Tudors 
in England, the 9alois in France, and Queen Isabella and .ing Ferdinand 
in Spain. In each area, bureaucracies increased and the power of the middle 
class grew at the expense of lords and the churches. For example, the new 
monarchies moved to curb the private armies of the nobility.
Russia 
Western Europeans were long unsure what to think of Russia: Was Russia 
more European in its outlook and character, or was it more Asian" Russia was 
in a pivotal position for trade. It was able to exchange goods and services with 
other cultures farther east and west. However, Russia remained tightly linked 
to Europe. Its capital²whether .iev, St. Petersburg, or Moscow²was located 
in Europe. Although a product of Mongol influence from Central Asia to the 
east, Russia was also a product of Europe as a result of 9iking invasions and 
trading.
When Ivan IV  ruled 15±158, called Ivan the Terrible, was crowned 
tsar in 15, he immediately set about to expand the Russian border eastward, 
first by taking control of the khanates of .azan, Astrakhan, and Siberia held 
by the descendants of the Golden Horde, the Mongolian conquerors. This 
expansion came to rely more and more upon the use of gunpowder. 
Control of the Volga  Wanting to expand east to control the fur trade, Ivan 
I9 allowed the Stroganovs, major Russian landowners, to hire bands of fierce 
peasant warriors known as Cossacks to fight the local tribes and the Siberian 
khan. The Stroganovs’ forces were successful, gaining control of the 9 olga

7o the 3acific   Russia continued moving east into Siberia after the reign 
of Ivan I9 . Fur traders and militias defeated one indigenous tribe after another. 
Missionaries followed, converting many to the Eastern Orthodox faith, although 
the local shamans, or religious leaders, continued to have influence. By 16, 
the Russians had advanced east as far as the Pacific Ocean. Explorations and 
fur trading expeditions continued across the Pacific to Alaska 11 and down 
the coast of North America to California 181. 
East Asia 
China’s Yuan Dynasty, founded by Mongol invader .ublai .han in 121, was 
overthrown by the  Ming Dynasty  in 168 after less than a century in power. 
Ming rulers managed to stabilize the East Asian region for nearly 00 years. 
During the Ming era, the Portuguese and other Europeans arrived, aiming to 
encroach on the Asian trade network. Then, in 16, the powerful Manchu  
from neighboring Manchuria seized power and established the Qing Dynasty , 
which ruled until 111. During both of these dynasties, Japan and .orea 
experienced parallel developments but with unique aspects.
The Ming Dynasty also expanded the size of China, conquering lands in 
Mongolia and Central Asia. It did not hold them for long, however. In the 
10s, Mongol armies defeated Ming forces and even took the Ming emperor 
prisoner. In reaction to renewed Mongol power, China’s leaders looked to the 
Great Wall of China for protection. The Wall had not been maintained under 
Mongol rule, but under the Ming Dynasty it was restored and expanded to 
help keep out invaders from the north. Connect: Create a chart comparing the 
Ming and Yuan Dynasties. See Topic 2.2.
Emperor Kangxi  One of  China’s longest-reigning emperors, Kangxi 
ruled 1661±122 presided over a period of stability and expansion during 
the Qing Dynasty in China. .angxi sent forces into Taiwan, Mongolia, and 
Central Asia, incorporating those areas into the empire. China also imposed a 
protectorate over Tibet, the mountainous land north of India, a policy reflected 
in China’s control of the region today.
Emperor Qianlong  Another important Qing ruler was Emperor 
Qianlong ruled 16±16, a poet, who was also  knowledgeable in art and 
calligraphy. At the beginning of his reign, the country was well administered 
and government tax collections were at an all-time high. Qianlong initiated 
military campaigns in lands west of China, which led to the annexation of 
;injiang accompanied by the mass killings of the local population. Even 
today, parts of ;injiang remain troubled. The local Muslim population, called 
Uighurs, has never fully become incorporated into the rest of Chinese culture. 
146 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONQianlong also sent armies into Tibet to install the Dalai Lama on the throne 
there. A campaign against the Nepalese was successful, forcing them to submit 
to Chinese rule. However, campaigns against Burma and 9ietnam were 
unsuccessful and costly, resulting in the emptying of the empire’s treasury.
Conflicts with the :est  Needing funds, the Qing Dynasty sold limited 
trading privileges to the European powers but confined them to Guangzhou 
also known as Canton. The British were not satisfied with these limited 
privileges, so they asked for more trading rights in 1. Emperor Qianlong 
responded with a letter to .ing George III stating that the Chinese had no need 
for British manufactured goods. During the later part of Qianlong’s reign, 
the traditionally efficient Chinese bureaucracy became corrupt, levying high 
taxes on the people. In response to these high taxes and a desire to restore 
the Ming Dynasty, a group of peasants organized the White Lotus Rebellion 
16±180. The Qing government suppressed the uprising brutally, killing 
around 100,000 peasants.
Rise of the Islamic Gunpowder Empires
The warrior leaders of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal Empires shared 
many traits besides being Muslims: 
• They descended from Turkic nomads who once lived in Central Asia.
• They spoke a Turkic language.
• They took advantage of power vacuums left by the breakup of Mongol 
khanates.
• They relied on gunpowder weapons, such as artillery and cannons. 
The initial success of the Gunpowder Empires was a result of their own 
military might along with the weakness and corruption of the regimes that 
they replaced. As European nations fought among themselves rather than 
uniting to topple the new powers growing in the east, the Gunpowder Empires 
further expanded. 
The Rule of Tamerlane  The invasion of Central Asia and the Middle 
East by Tamerlane  Timur the Lame, a Mongol-Turkic ruler of the late 1th 
century set the stage for the rise of the Turkic empires. Leading an army partly 
composed of nomadic invaders from the broad steppes of Eurasia, Tamerlane 
moved out from the trading city of Samarkand in modern-day Uzbekistan to 
make ruthless conquests in Persia modern-day Iran and India. The Eurasian 
steppes were also the birthplace of the ghazi ideal ²a model for warrior life 
that blended the cooperative values of nomadic culture with the willingness to 
serve as a holy fighter for Islam. According to some historians, the ghazi ideal 
served as the model for warriors who participated in the rise of the Gunpowder 
Empires, and it was a model that fit Tamerlane well.
Some historians believe that Tamerlane’s violent takeover of areas of 
Central Asia included the massacre of some 100,000 Hindus before the gates 
147 EUROPEAN, EAST ASIAN, AND G UNPOWDER EMPIRES EXPANDof Delhi in India. The pattern of conquest was marked by violence that resulted 
in new dynasties: the Ottomans, the Safavids, and the Mughals. Nonetheless, 
Tamerlane’s rule in Samarkand encouraged learning and the arts²a trend also 
typical of these later empires. For example, Tamerlane championed literature, 
and he himself corresponded with European rulers and wrote his own memoirs. 
Buildings still standing in the city of Samarkand are lasting reminders of his 
interest in architecture and decorative arts. 
While the empire he created largely fell apart except for the area that 
his descendant Babur would take over to create India’s Mughal Dynasty, 
Tamerlane’s invasions were a testament to the significance of gunpowder. 
He used it to build a government dependent upon his military and the use 
of heavy artillery. He also used it to protect land routes on the Silk Roads. 
However, he failed to leave an effective political structure in many of the 
areas he conquered. Without effective government, the expenses of the wars 
eventually ravaged the empire’s economy. 
Tamerlane’s rule casts light on two major forces that had battled each 
other continually from the late 10th century to the 1th century²Mongols 
from the northeast versus Islamic forces from Arabia and the areas around the 
Mediterranean Sea. These forces would clash continuously with the rise and 
fall of the three Asian Gunpowder Empires that are the focus of the rest of this 
chapter.  
The Ottoman Empire
By the 15th century, the Ottoman Empire was already becoming a major 
power. Extending into modern-day Turkey as well as to the Balkan areas of 
Europe and parts of North Africa and Southeast Asia, the Ottoman Empire  was 
the largest and most enduring of the great Islamic empires of this period. Founded 
by the Osman Dynasty in the 100s, the empire lasted until its defeat in 118 by 
the Allies in World War I. Thus a single dynasty controlled the empire for more 
than 600 years.
Mehmed II  Called the Conqueror, Mehmed II ruled 151±181 firmly 
established the empire’s capital after his forces besieged Constantinople once 
the center of the Byzantine Empire in 15. Despite its triple fortifications, 
the city fell as its walls crumbled under the bombardment of Ottoman cannons. 
The Ottomans used a 26-foot bronze cannon and several other cannons from 
15 to 22 feet in length.  Under Mehmed II’s rule, the city²its name changed 
to Istanbul²prospered because of its location. A nexus for trade, the city 
controlled the Bosporus Strait, the only waterway linking the Aegean Sea with 
the Black Sea.
The armies of Mehmed II next seized lands around the western edge of 
the Black Sea. Then they moved into the Balkans in Southeast Europe. To 
counter the power of 9enice, an expanding state on the Adriatic Sea with a 
robust maritime trade, Mehmed strengthened the Ottoman navy and attacked 
various areas of Italy. Although he did not conquer 9enice, he forced the city 
148 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONto pay him a yearly tax. In the early 16th century, the Ottomans added to 
their empire lands in present-day Syria, Israel, Egypt, and Algeria. When the 
Mamluk Dynasty’s power declined, Istanbul became a center of Islam. For 
more on the Mamluk Empire, see Topic 1.2.
Suleiman I  The Ottoman Empire reached its peak under Suleiman I  
ruled 1520±1566. His armies overran Hungary in 1526 and, by 152, were 
hammering at the gates of 9ienna, the main city in Austria. Their attempt to 
take 9ienna failed twice, but the ability of the Ottomans to send troops so far 
into Christian Europe caused great fear there.
In 1522, Suleiman’s navy captured the island of Rhodes now part of 
Greece in the eastern Mediterranean, which had long been a stronghold of 
Christian knights. In the 1550s, the Ottoman navy took control of Tripoli in 
North Africa. The Ottoman Empire would experience a transformation as the 
state adapted to new internal and external pressures. A period of reform would 
follow by the 18th century. Challenges in defending Ottoman territory against 
foreign invasion and occupation led to the Ottoman defeat and dissolution by 
122.
The Safavids
The Safavid dynasty had its origin in the Safavid order of Sufism, established 
in the northern Azerbaijan region Iran. An early Safavid military hero named 
Ismail  conquered most of Persia and pushed into Iraq. Although only 1 or 15 
years old, he soon conquered all of Iran and was proclaimed shah  equivalent 
to king or emperor in 1501.  
The Safavid Empire  had two problems. First, despite being on the Arabian 
Sea part of the Indian Ocean, the empire did not have a real navy. Second, 
the Safavids lacked natural defenses. Nevertheless, the Safavids rose to power 
in the 1500s due to their land-based military might and strong leadership.
Called Abbas the Great, Shah Abbas I ruled 1588±162 presided over 
the Safavid Empire at its height. His troops included soldiers²often Christian 
boys pressed into service²from as far northwest as Georgia in Russia.  Abbas 
imported weaponry from Europe and also relied on Europeans to advise his 
troops about this newly acquired military technology. Slowly, the shahs came to 
control religion as well as politics. Using Shi’a Islam as a unifying force, Shah 
Ismail built a power base that supported his rule and denied legitimacy to any 
Sunni. This strict adherence to Shi’a Islam caused frequent hostilities with the 
Ottoman Empire, a stronghold of Sunni Islam. In 151, Safavid forces were 
stopped by the Ottomans at Tabriz, a city in Persia that became part of the border 
between Sunni and Shi’a societies. The hostility between the two groups lives 
on in present-day Iraq and Iran.
Conflicts between Ottomans and Safavids were not entirely religious, 
however. Another conflict arose over control of overland trade routes. The 
Ottomans used trade embargoes, official bans on trade, consistently against 
the Safavid silk traders as a way to assert dominance over their eastern rival.

Safavid histories however, Safavid women were permitted to participate in 
their societies. While Safavid women were still veiled and restricted in their 
movements, as was traditional in the region, they had access to rights provided 
by Islamic law for inheritance and, in extreme cases, divorce. 
Mughal India
In the 1520s, Babur, a descendant of Tamerlane see Topic 2.2, founded a  
00-year dynasty during a time when India was in disarray. He completed 
conquests in northern India and, under the new Mughal name, formed a 
central government similar to that of Suleiman in Turkey. Akbar , Babur’s 
grandson, achieved grand religious and political goals. 
The Mughal Empire  under Akbar was one of the richest and best-
governed states in the world. Overseas trade flourished during the relatively 
peaceful period Arab traders conducted most of the commerce. Traded goods 
included textiles, tropical foods, spices, and precious stones, all of which 
were often exchanged for gold and silver. Trade within the borders of the 
empire was carried on by merchant castes. Members of the merchant castes 
were allowed to participate in banking and the production of handicrafts. 
Castes, or jatis, are strict social groupings designated at birth. The caste 
system divides Hindu people into four categories: Brahmins, .shatriyas, 
9aishyas, and the Shudras. Outside of the system are the achhoots, or the 
Dalits, the untouchables. The Indian caste system is the basis of educational 
and vocational opportunities for Indian society. 
Mughal India flourished from Babur’s time through the early 18th century. 
Magnificent architectural accomplishments are remaining testaments to the 
wealth and sophistication of the Mughal empire.
Decline of the Gunpowder Empires
The Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal Empires declined as Western Europe grew 
in strength economically and militarily²particularly in terms of sea power. 
Unlike these three Islamic empires, Russia modernized and reorganized its 
army, modeling it after the armies of England, France, and the Netherlands. 
The Islamic empires did not modernize and, as a result, Russia remained 
powerful enough to survive as an independent nation-state, while the other 
Gunpowder Empires fell. 
Decline of the Ottoman Empire  In 151, after Suleiman’s death, a 
European force made up mostly of Spaniards and 9enetians defeated the 
Ottomans in a great naval conflict known as the Battle of Lepanto. After 
the reign of Suleiman, the Ottomans fell victim to weak sultans and strong 
European neighbors. In time, the empire became known as the Sick Man of 
Europe. Successors to Suleiman were often held hostage to “harem politics,” 
the efforts of wives and concubines of the sultan to promote their own children 
150 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONas likely heirs to the throne. In this way, some women became powerful 
behind the scenes. The failed Siege of 9ienna in 168 marked a turning point 
in Ottoman domination in Eastern Europe. British and French involvement 
in the Ottoman territories, Greece’s independence in 1821, and the Russian 
expansion in the 1th century further weakened the Ottoman Empire.
Safavid Decline  The ineffectual leaders who followed Shah Abbas 
combined lavish lifestyles and military spending with falling revenues, resulting 
in a weakened economy. In 122, Safavid forces were not able to quell a 
rebellion by the heavily oppressed Sunni Pashtuns in present-day Afghanistan. 
The Afghan forces went on to sack Isfahan, and their leader, Mahmud, declared 
himself Shah of Persia. While the Safavid Dynasty remained nominally 
in control, the resulting chaos was an impediment to centralization and tax 
collection. Taking advantage of the weakened Safavids, the Ottomans and the 
Russians were able to seize territories. The Safavid Dynasty declined rapidly 
until it was replaced by the =and Dynasty in 160.
Mughal Decline  Shah Jahan’s son and successor, Aurangzeb ruled 1658±
10, inherited an empire weakened by corruption and the failure to keep up 
with the military innovations of external enemies. Nevertheless, Aurangzeb 
hoped to increase the size of the empire and bring all of India under Muslim rule. 
Additionally, he wanted to rid the empire of its Hindu influences.  Nile R.Euphrates R.  Tigris R.   Indus R.

to frequent conflicts and rebellions. 
There were revolts as well among the Hindu and Islamic princes. The empire 
grew increasingly unstable after his death, which allowed the British and French 
to gain more and more economic power in India. The British would take political 
power away from the Mughals in the 1th century.

154 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   E X P L A I N  THE HISTORICAL CONCEPT  
OF EMPIRE
In this topic, you read about the expansion of empires between 150 
and 150, especially in Russia, China, and Southwest, Central, and 
South Asia. Although it may seem obvious what an empire is, historians 
have thought carefully about the concept  of an empire. A concept is a 
general, abstract idea often formed from specific instances.
For example, Paul James and Tom Nairn, editors of Globalization and 
Violence , conceptualize “empire” this way:
“As a general phenomenon, empires extend relations of power 
across territorial spaces over which they have no prior or given legal 
sovereignty, and where, in one or more of the domains of economics, 
politics, and culture, they gain some measure of extensive hegemony 
over those spaces for the purpose of extracting or accruing value.” 
Steven Howe, in his book Empire , argues that an empire typically also 
has diverse ethnic, national, cultural, and religious elements under its 
power. 
If you combine these conceptualizations and then break them down into 
their component parts, you would likely come up with these features of 
empires: 
• extension of power over spaces in which they have no previous or 
legal control
• exertion of major control of economic, political, or cultural a spects 
of subjects
• extraction or accumulation of value as a result of domination
• control of diverse ethnic, national, cultural, and religious elements

Empires: Administrations
The state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth:  
for kings are not  only God’s lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon  
 God’s throne, but even by God himself they are called gods.
—2ing 1ames I (15–125)
Essential Question:   How did rulers in land-based empires legitimize and 
consolidate their power from 1450 to 1750?
By the end of the 16th century, centralization of power by controlling taxes, 
the army, and some aspects of religion coalesced into a system of government 
that led to a powerful monarch in England and absolute monarchy in France. 
In other states, different methods were used to solidify authority: building 
temples, as with the Inca paying the military elite a salary, as with the samurai 
in Japan and forcibly establishing a captive governmental bureaucracy, as 
with the Ottoman devshirme system.
Rulers of empires in the years 150 to 150 developed methods for 
assuring they maintained control of all the regions of their empires. Some of 
the successful methods included using bureaucratic elites to oversee sections 
of the empire and developing a professional military.
Centralizing Control in Europe
England’s .ing James I believed in the divine right of kings , a common claim 
from the Middle Ages that the right to rule was given to a king by God. Under 
this belief, a king was a political and religious authority. As seen in the quote 
above, James believed himself outside of the law and any earthly authority and 
saw any challenge toward him as a challenge to God. 
(nJlanG¶s *entry 2Ificials   In England, the Tudors ruled 185±160 
relied on justices of the peace,  officials selected by the landed gentry to 
“swear that as Justices of the Peace . . . in all articles in the .ing’s Commission 
to you directed, ye shall do equal right to the poor and to the rich after your 
cunning wit, and power, and after the laws and customs of the realm and 
statutes thereof made,” according to their oath of office. In other words, their 
job was to maintain peace in the counties of England, even settling some legal 
matters, and to carry out the monarch’s laws. The number and responsibilities 
156 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONof the justices of the peace increased through the years of Tudor rule, and 
they became among the most important and powerful groups in the kingdom. 
Under Tudor rule, the power of feudal lords weakened. Many seats in the 
House of Commons in Parliament were occupied by justices of the peace. The 
justices of the peace as well as the Parliament, which had been established in 
1265, gave legitimacy to the monarch’s claim to authority. 
Parliament also checked the monarch’s powers. In 168, England’s rulers 
William and Mary signed the English Bill of Rights , which assured individual 
civil liberties. For example, legal process was required before someone could 
be arrested and detained. The Bill of Rights also guaranteed protection against 
tyranny of the monarchy by requiring the agreement of Parliament on matters 
of taxation and raising an army.
Absolutism in France  In contrast to developments in England, the 
French government became more absolute— directed by one source of power, 
the king, with complete authority²in the 1th and 18th centuries. Henry I9 
ruled 158±1610 of the House of 9alois listened to his advisor Jean Bodin, 
who advocated the divine right of the monarchy. Building on these ideas, 
Louis ;III ruled 1610±16 and his minister Cardinal Richelieu  moved to 
even greater centralization of the government and development of the system 
of intendants. These intendants  were royal officials  ²bureaucratic elites²
sent out to the provinces to execute the orders of the central government. 
The intendants themselves were sometimes called tax farmers  because they 
oversaw the collection of various taxes in support of the royal governments. 
The Sun .ing, Louis XIV  ruled 16±115, espoused a theory of 
divine right and was a virtual dictator. His aims were twofold, just as those 
of Richelieu had been: He wanted to hold absolute power and expand French 
borders. Louis declared that he was the state: “L’etat, c’est moi.” He combined 
the lawmaking and the justice system in his own person²he was absolute. 
He kept nobles close to him in his palace at Versailles , making it difficult 
for them to act independently or plot against him. Louis and his successors’ 
refusal to share power eventually weakened the French government.

157 EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATI ONSReigning in Control of the Russian Empire
Social hierarchy in Moscow was almost static²much as it had been in .ievan 
Russia earlier. The noble landowning class, the boyars , stood at the top of 
the social pyramid. Below them were the merchants. Last and most numerous 
were the peasants, who would gradually sink more and more deeply into debt 
and, as a result, into serfdom . Serfs were peasants who received a plot of 
land and protection from a noble. In return, the serfs were bound to that land 
and had little personal freedom. Transfers of land ownership to another noble 
included control over the serfs on that land.
The Efforts of Ivan IV  The boyar class experienced tensions with the 
rulers similar to the tensions between nobles and rulers in Western Europe. 
Boyars of Novgorod had opposed the expansionist policies of Ivan IV , so 
Ivan punished them after his forces defeated Novgorod. Ivan I9 confiscated 
the lands of his boyar opponents and forced them and their families to move to 
Moscow. Like Louis ;I9 , he wanted to keep an eye on the nobility. 
To further control the boyars, Ivan established a paramilitary force loyal 
to him called the oprichnina . Dressed in black and traveling quickly on 
horseback, the members showed fierce loyalty to Ivan. They were drawn from 
lower-level bureaucrats and merchants to assure their loyalty to Ivan rather 
than to the boyars. The oprichnina’s methods would be reflected later in the 
development of the Russian secret police. Connect: Create a table comparing

158 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONPeter the Great  The Romanov Dynasty  took control of Russia in 161 
after a period of turmoil following Ivan’s death in 158. Under the autocratic 
control of the Romanovs, three main groups in Russia had conflicting desires 
and agendas: the Church, bent on conserving traditional values and beliefs 
the boyars, desiring to gain and hold power and members of the tsar’s royal 
family. The rise to power of Peter I , also known as Peter the Great ruled 
1682±125, illustrates these conflicting ambitions. First, to gain full control 
of the throne, Peter had to defeat his half-sister Sophia and her supporters, a 
boyar-led elite military corps called the Streltsy. He consolidated power by 
forcing Sophia into a convent. Later, the Streltsy rebelled against Peter’s reign, 
so he temporarily disbanded them and then integrated them into Russia’s 
regular army.
Peter the Great was known as the Defender of Orthodoxy, participating 
closely in ecclesiastical >church@ affairs. However, Peter would eventually lose 
the support of the Russian clergy over his reforms. Later in his reign, Peter 
reorganized the Russian government by creating provinces first 8 and later 
50 administrative divisions. Provincial officials received a salary, replacing 
the old system of local officials “feeding off the land” getting money through 
bribes, fees, and taxes. Another government reform was the creation of a 
senate, a council to advise government officials when Peter was away . 
Centralizing Control in the Ottoman Empire
To ensure their control over large areas, the Ottoman sultans used a selection 
system called devshirme to staff their military and their government. This 
system began in the late 1th century and expanded in the 15th and 16th 
centuries. Through this system, Christian boys who were subjects of the empire 
were recruited by force to serve in the Ottoman government. Boys ages 8 to 20 
were taken each year from conquered Christian lands in Europe.
The system of devshirme developed from an earlier system of slavery 
in the Ottoman Empire. In both systems, enslaved people were considered 
tribute owed to the empire after conquest, which was typically one-fifth of the 
conquered land’s wealth. Since Islamic law prohibited enslavement of “people 
of the book”²Muslims and Jews²Christian boys were forcibly removed 
from their families, especially from Balkan territories. 
The Christian boys were taught various skills in politics, the arts, and the 
military and received a very high level of education. The most famous group, 
called Janissaries , formed elite forces in the Ottoman army. Other boys were 
groomed to become administrators of the newly conquered territories some 
were scribes, tax collectors, and even diplomats. They were indoctrinated to 
be fiercely loyal to the sultan  ²some served as bodyguards. In some ways, 
becoming a Janissary provided a path of upward mobility in the Ottoman 
Empire, even though the Janissaries continued to be called “slaves of the 
state.” Some parents even wanted their sons to be recruited into the service. 
159 EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATI ONSCentralizing Control in East and South Asia
Following the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty, the Ming ruled in 
China from 168±16. The Ming Dynasty in China wanted to erase the 
influence of Mongol rulers of the Yuan Dynasty. To help accomplish this goal, 
the Ming brought back the traditional civil service exam, improved education 
by establishing a national school system, and reestablished the bureaucracy, 
which had fallen into disuse under the Mongols. See Topic 2.2. During the 
Qing Dynasty, in the later part of Qianlong’s reign, the traditionally efficient 
Chinese bureaucracy became corrupt, levying high taxes on the people. The 
Qing government used harsh military control to put down a rebellion against 
these developments and maintain its authority. 
Consolidating Power in Japan  Military leaders called shoguns ruled 
Japan in the emperor’s name from the 12th to the 15th centuries. Yet conflict 
between landholding aristocrats called daimyo  left Japan in disarray. Each 
daimyo had an army of warriors known as samurai ambition to conquer 
more territory and power to rule his fiefdoms as he saw fit. The samurai 
were salaried, paid first in rice and later in gold, which gave them significant 
economic power. Finally, just as gunpowder weapons enabled the rise of new 
empires in Turkey, Persia, and India, gunpowder weapons helped a series of 
three powerful daimyo to gradually unify Japan. Connect : Write a paragraph 
connecting shogun rule with the rule of the daimyo. See Topic 1.1.
The first of these powerful daimyo was Oda Nobunaga. Armed with 
muskets purchased from Portuguese traders, Nobunaga and his samurai took 
over .yoto in 1568. He then began to extend his power, forcing daimyo in the 
lands around .yoto to submit. Nobunaga had unified about one-third of what 
is today Japan when he was assassinated in 1582. 
Nobunaga’s successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, continued expanding the 
territory until most of what we now know as Japan was under his control. 
After his death in 158, the center of power shifted to the city of Edo Tokyo, 
controlled by the daimyo Tokugawa Ieyasu  ruled 1600±1616, who was 
declared shogun in 160. His successors would continue to rule Japan into the 
mid-1th century, in an era known as the Period of Great Peace.
The Tokugawa shogunate  set about reorganizing the governance of Japan 
in order to centralize  control over what was essentially a feudal system. Japan 
was divided into 250 hans, or territories, each of which was controlled by 
a daimyo who had his own army and was fairly independent. However, the 
Tokugawa government required that daimyo maintain residences both in their 
home territory and also in the capital if the daimyo himself was visiting his 
home territory, his family had to stay in Tokyo, essentially as hostages. This 
kept the daimyo under the control of the shogunate, reducing them to landlords 
who managed the hans, rather than independent leaders.
Consolidating Mughal Power in South Asia   Ruling from 1556 to 
1605, Akbar  proved to be the most capable of the Mughal rulers. For the 
first 0 years of his rule, he defeated Hindu armies and extended his empire 
160 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONsouthward and westward. From his capital in Delhi , Akbar established an 
efficient government and a system of fairly administered laws. For example, 
all his people had the right to appeal to him for final judgment in any lawsuit. 
As Akbar’s fame spread, capable men from many parts of Central Asia came 
to serve him. They helped Akbar create a strong, centralized government and 
an effective civil service. Paid government officials called zamindars  were in 
charge of specific duties, such as taxation, construction, and the water supply.
Later, they were given grants of land rather than salaries but were permitted 
to keep a portion of the taxes paid by local peasants, who contributed one-
third of their produce to the government. The system worked well under 
Akbar. Under the rulers who came after him, though, the zamindars began 
to keep more of the taxes that they collected. With this money, they built 
personal armies of soldiers and civilians loyal to them.
Legitimizing Power through Religion and Art
European governments sought to legitimize the authority of the monarch 
through the idea of the divine right of monarchy. For more information 
about the divine right of monarchy, see Topic .. They also built impressive 
structures, such as the Palace of 9ersailles in France, to demonstrate their 
power and glory. Governments in other parts of the world followed similar 
patterns to consolidate and legitimize their authority. See Topic 1. for links 
among religion, grand temples and pyramids, human sacrifice, and political 
power in the Mexica and Incan cultures.
Peter and St. Petersburg  When Peter the Great seized lands on the 
Baltic Sea from Sweden, the conquest gave Russia its own warm-water port 
on the Baltic²St. Petersburg. Peter moved the Russian capital from Moscow 
to St. Petersburg so he could keep watch on the boyars there, who were doing 
their required state service by working in his government. 
The new city became a testament to Peter’s determination to have his own 
capital. Architects laid out streets in a rectangular grid, unlike the irregular 
pattern of Moscow and other cities. Peasants and Swedish prisoners of war 
were forced to work, draining marshes and building streets and government 
structures. In the mid-18th century, workers built the famous Winter Palace. 
It was designed in a European rather than a Byzantine style to show Peter’s 
admiration of Europe and its rulers.
Askia the Great of Songhai  Askia Mohammad I, or Askia the Great , 
came to power in 1. He claimed his predecessor, Sunni Ali, was not a 
faithful Muslim. Like Mansa Musa of Mali, Askia the Great promoted Islam 
throughout his kingdom and made an elaborate pilgrimage to Mecca. Under 
his leadership, Songhai became the largest kingdom in its day in West Africa. 
Askia made Islam Songhai’s official religion in an attempt to unite his empire. 
In addition to legitimizing his rule through promoting Islam, he also supported 
an efficient bureaucracy to bring the empire together.
161 EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATI ONSShah Jahan  Mughal India produced a number of magnificent architectural 
accomplishments, including the Taj Mahal , built by Shah Jahan  ruled 1628±
1658 as a tomb for his wife. Mughal rulers also beautified Delhi and had 
forts built. The craftspeople and builders of Mughal India combined the arts of 
Islam calligraphy, illumination of manuscripts, and ceramics with local arts 
to create magnificent, airy structures with decorative geometric designs. All 
these accomplishments showed the power of the rulers.
Ottoman Architectural and Artistic Achievements  Tremendous 
changes in government and religion took place in Ottoman territory. However, 
the arts, the culture, and the economy showed continuities, though they now 
legitimized the rule of the Ottomans. Constantinople, renamed Istanbul, 
remained the western end of the overland Silk Roads, and the Grand Bazaar 
there continued to be full of foreign imports. Coffeehouses, although banned 
by Islamic law, continued to do a thriving business throughout the towns of the 
empire.

162 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONIstanbul grew more beautiful and expanded across both sides of the Strait of 
Bosporus. One famous landmark is the royal residence of the sultans, Topkapi 
Palace . Mehmed II lived 12±181 began construction on this landmark. 
Suleiman I lived 1±1566 ordered many mosques, forts, and other great 
buildings constructed in the cities under his control. For example, he ordered 
the construction in Istanbul of the magnificent Suleymaniye Mosq ue. 
Istanbul remained a center of arts and learning. Poets and scholars 
from across Asia met in coffeehouses and gardens. They discussed works 
by Aristotle and other Greek writers, as well as the works of many Arabic 
scholars. Cultural contributions of the Ottomans included the restoration of 
some of the glorious buildings of Constantinople, most notably the cathedral 
of Saint Sophia which the Ottomans turned into a grand mosque. From the 
time of Mehmed II, who established a workshop for their production, Ottoman 
miniature paintings and illuminated manuscripts became famous. 
French Architecture  The spacious and elegant palace at 9ersailles 
became a political instrument. Louis ;I9 entertained the nobles there and kept 
them from conducting business elsewhere, such as fomenting rebellion in their 
home provinces. Louis ;I9’s grand buildings at 9ersailles helped legitimize 
his power. The palace at 9ersailles, for example, could accommodate hundreds 
of guests. During the rule of Louis ;I9 , some 1,000 employees worked in the 
palace or on the grounds. 
Financing Empires
As in other matters of building and maintaining empires, different methods 
of raising money worked²or fell short²in different empires. In all of the 
world’s empires, raising money to fund the goals of imperial expansion and 
extend state power was a key endeavor.
Taxation in Russia  Peter established new industries owned by the state, 
especially shipyards in St. Petersburg and iron mines in the Ural Mountains. 
He also encouraged private industries such as metallurgy >technology of metal 
products@, woodwork, gunpowder, leather, paper, and mining. He brought 
in Western European naval engineers to build ships according to Western 
models. 
When industrialization failed to bring in the revenue Peter needed for his 
military ventures, he raised taxes and began to compel workers to work in 
the shipyards²a sort of urban extension of serfdom. In 118, the tax on land 
in Russia was replaced by a tax on heads individuals, and peasants became 
more oppressed than ever.
Ottoman and Mughal Taxation  To finance an economy backed by 
a powerful military, the Ottomans levied taxes on the peasants and used 
tax farming  to collect it. The tax farmers²local officials and private tax 
collectors distant from the central government²grew wealthy and corrupt 
from skimming money from the taxes in their areas, as some of the zamindars 
did in the Mughal Empire. Agricultural villages continued to be burdened with 
163 EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATI ONSthe upkeep of officers and troops. This burden of taxes and the military would 
eventually contribute to the economic decline of the empire.
Tax Collection in the Ming Dynasty In Ming China as well as in the 
Ottoman Empire, tax collection was the responsibility of private citizens, in 
this case wealthy families, each seeing to the collection of land taxes in their 
area of the countryside. Land taxes made up the bulk of the taxes collected, 
and the rates tended to be low. Taxes were collected in the form of grains 
and, later, silver. Some grains were stored in local facilities. Others were sent 
on the Grand Canal to military locations. The state also collected taxes on 
salt, wine, and other goods. For many years, the vaults stored a surplus of 
grains. However, after about 1580, wars, extravagant imperial spending, and 
the repression of rebellions left the dynasty in bankruptcy.
Tributes  Empires, including China, also collected tributes from other 
states as a way to demand recognition of their power and authority. Typically 
as a form of wealth, tributes were given as a sign of respect, submission, or 
allegiance. For example, .orea was a tributary state for China. The Mexica had 
extensive tributary arrangements from the people they conquered, although 
most Aztec citizens, merchants, and artisans paid taxes. An Aztec official was 
stationed in each capital to collect tributes from local officials. 
The Songhai Empire also had tributary states. Askia the Great assigned 
governors and officials to preside over tributary states in the Niger 9alley. As 
long as local officials obeyed Songhai policies, they could rule their districts.

“Demonized as an enemy of the faith by the Muslim narrative sources, yet 
lionized as a warrior hero in the oral tradition, Sunni Ali, who reigned from

be held together by military conquests alone, but need>ed@ an effective and 
efficient administrative structure as well. Indeed, the organization of Songhay

One way historians contextualize is by examining what came before 
and what came after an event or development within a culture see page 
1. Contextualization is also useful across cultures. To contextualize a 
specific development across cultures, ask: In what other cultures were 
there similar developments" In what ways were those developments 
similar to the specific development in the culture under study" In what 
ways were those developments different from the specific development 
in the culture under study" As you answer these questions, think about 
origins, purposes, and outcomes.

Empires: Belief Systems
Paris is well worth a Mass.
–Henry of Navarre, 2ing of -rance (ruled 1589–110)
Essential Question:   How did different belief systems endure or change 
during the period from 1450–1750?
Religion, a key factor in the expansion of empires, was a divisive force 
as much as it was a unifying one. Christianity remained a dominant force in 
Europe, b ut its split into several factions during the 16th and 1th centuries led 
to significant historical changes.  French .ing Henry I9 , often known as Henry 
of Navarre, converted to Catholicism in 15 for the sake of solidifying his 
power and ensuring peace, as the quote above suggests. His action demonstrates 
the willingness of monarchs to approach ruling with practicality rather than 
theology. Henry I9 also sanctioned religious toleration of the Huguenots 
French Calvinists. 
Islam, too, experienced a split, and political rivalries between the Ottoman 
and Safavid empires deepened the breach between the Sunni and Shi’a branches 
of the religion. At the same time, Sikhism provided a way to combine Hindu 
and Sufi Muslim beliefs.
Protestant Reformation
The Roman Catholic Church faced many challenges in the European shift 
from feudalism to centralized governments. International in organization and 
influence and boasting a large bureaucracy of its own, the Church was subject 
to corruption. Efforts to curb corruption resulted in numerous Church councils 
and reform movements. However, efforts at reform were unsuccessful.
Theological disagreements began to surface as well. John Wycliffe and 
the Lollards in England in the late 1th century argued that priests were 
unnecessary for salvation. Wycliffe was vilified for translating parts of the 
Bible into the English vernacular to make it available to the mass of believers, 
who neither read nor understood Latin. In the early 1th century, Hussites, 
followers of Jan Hus in Bohemia, were declared heretics for beliefs similar 
to Wycliffe’s. Hus himself was burned at the stake. Huldrych =wingli 
campaigned in Geneva for a religion that would follow the exact teachings 
168 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONof the scriptures  and discard customs that had evolved later. For example, 
he opposed the requirement for celibacy of the clergy because he argued 
that the rule was imposed long after the scriptures were writte n. 
The power of the Church suffered during the so-called Babylonian 
Captivity 10±1, when the papacy was located in France rather 
than in Rome. The Captivity gave French rulers greater influence over the 
Church, even the ability to decide who should be pope. Newly centralizing 
rulers who coveted Church lands and authority began confiscating wealthy 
Catholic monasteries and sometimes established their own churches. In the 
eyes of believers, the Church suffered further when it failed to stop the 
Black Death. Connect: Write a paragraph connecting the Reformation 
with the problems of the medieval Church. See Topic 1.6.
Lutheranism  A monk named Martin Luther  in Wittenberg, a 
German city in the Holy Roman Empire 800±1806, concluded that 
several traditional Church practices violated biblical teachings. He objected 
to the sale of indulgences , which granted a person absolution from the 
punishments for sin, and to simony , the selling of church offices. As a 
result, Luther defiantly challenged the Church by nailing his charges, the  
95 Theses , to a church door. Luther advocated for the theological stance of 
“sola fide,” faith alone, for the basis of salvation for the Christian believer .
The Church reacted harshly. It, and the local political ruler, needed the 
money these practices generated. Luther persisted. In January 1521, Pope 
Leo ; excommunicated Luther. Several German political leaders saw an 
opportunity to free themselves from the power of the pope. They sided with 
Luther. Soon, what had begun as a minor academic debate became a major 
split in the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire. 
Luther was not a political or social revolutionary. When German 
peasants rebelled, he did not support them. But his theological ideas had 
social impact on the clergy as well as on women. Luther taught that women 
could have direct access to God just as men could. Luther’s emphasis 
promoted women’s literacy. He believed that women had significant roles in 
the family, particularly teaching their children to read the Bible. However, 
Protestants generally did not organize convents. As a result, Protestant 
women did not have the opportunity to become leaders in a vital institution 
the way Roman Catholic women did.
Calvinism  The French theologian John Calvin  broke with the Catholic 
Church around 150. In 156, he authored The Institutes of the Christian 
Religion  and helped reform the religious community in Geneva, Switzerland. 
The elect , those predestined  to go to heaven, ran the community, which 
was based on plain living, simple church buildings, and governance by the 
elders of the church. Calvin’s followers in France were called Huguenots. 
Other offshoots of Calvinism included the Reformed Church of Scotland, 
led by John .nox, and the Puritans  in England and later in Boston, who 
wanted to purify the Church of England of Catholic remnants. Historian and 
sociologist Max Weber pointed out that an important socioeconomic impact 
169 EMPIRES: BELIE F SYSTEMS 169of Calvinism is contained in the phrase “Protestant work ethic.” Calvinists 
were encouraged to work hard and reinvest their profits prosperity ostensibly 
showed that God favored their obedience and hard work. Prosperity also 
indicated their position among the elect. Calvinists viewed their work ethic as 
righteous living that elevated them to positions of secular leadership. Together, 
the various reform efforts are known as the Protestant Reformation .

Anglicanism  The last of the three major figures of the Reformation was 
England’s .ing Henry VIII  ruled 150±15. Henry wanted a male heir to 
succeed him. After his wife gave birth to several daughters, Henry asked the 
pope to annul his marriage so he could marry another woman, Anne Boleyn . 
But the pope refused out of worry over the reaction of Charles V , the powerful 
emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Henry, with the approval of the English 
Parliament, set himself up as head of the new Church of England, or  Anglican 
Church ²one that would be free of control by the pope in Rome.
The Orthodox Church and Reforms in Russia
Charles 9 had revitalized the concept of the universal monarchy and spent 
most of his reign defending the integrity of the Holy Roman Empire from the 
Protestant Reformation. Like Charles 9 , Peter the Great of Russia asserted 
his authority as he moved against the Orthodox Church. The Church had long 
been the force unifying the Russian people and the tsars, who claimed to rule 
170 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONby divine right. Peter confirmed his power over the Church by abolishing the 
position of patriarch, the head of the Church, and incorporating the Church 
into the government. In place of the patriarch, he established the Holy Synod , 
composed of clergymen overseen by a secular official who answered to the 
tsar. Peter raised the minimum age for men to become eligible to be monks to 
50, preferring that the young serve first as soldiers. Peter’s reforms were not 
welcomed by many peasants and Old Believers, a sect that opposed earlier 
reforms.
Counter-Reformation or Catholic Reformation
The Roman Catholic Church, all-powerful in Europe since the fall of Rome, 
did not sit quietly by and let the Reformation groups take over. Instead, it 
embarked on a vigorous Counter-Reformation  to fight against the Protestant 
attacks. A three-pronged strategy yielded such gains for the Church that it 
remains the largest Christian denomination in the world:
• The Church increased the use of the Inquisition , which had been 
established in the late 12th century to root out and punish nonbelievers. 
The Inquisition sometimes allowed the use of torture to achieve its 
ends.
• The Jesuits , or Society of Jesus, a religious order founded in 150 
by Ignatius of Loyola, also opposed the spread of Protestantism. The 
Jesuits undertook missionary activity throughout the Spanish Empire as 
well as in Japan and India. 
• The Council of Trent  155±156 corrected some of the worst of the 
Church’s abuses and concentrated on reaffirming the rituals such as 
marriage and other sacraments improving the education of priests. The 
Council also published the Index of Prohibited Books , a list of writings 
that the Church banned, including Protestant copies of the Bible and 
the writings of Copernicus. 
The Counter-Reformation was successful in that Catholicism remained 
predominant in the areas of Western Europe near the Mediterranean Sea. 
Moreover, later colonies of the European powers often followed the lead of 
the home country in religion. Therefore, most of the people in the Spanish, 
Portuguese, and French colonies became Catholic.
Charles 9 abdicated as ruler of the Holy Roman Empire in 1555, 
discouraged by his inability to stop the spread of Lutheranism. He left Spain 
to his son Philip II  and the Holy Roman Empire to his brother Ferdinand. 
Philip II took the Catholic crusade to the Netherlands and ruled its 1 
provinces from 1556 to 1581. He later tried to conquer and convert England. 
In 1588, his Spanish Armada  was defeated by English naval power.
171 EMPIRES: BELIE F SYSTEMSWars of Religion
Europe’s religious divisions led to frequent wars. In 156 and 15, the forces 
of Charles 9 fought the German Lutheran Schmalkaldic League. Conflict 
between Lutherans and the Holy Roman Empire resulted in the 1555 Peace 
of Augsburg , which allowed each German state to choose whether its ruler 
would be Catholic or Lutheran. As a result, churches and inhabitants were 
forced to practice the state religion. People who refused could move to another 
state where their preferred religion was practiced.
France  In France, Catholics and Huguenots fought for nearly half a 
century. Then, in 15, .ing Henry I9 , who had been raised as a Protestant, 
tried to unify the country by becoming a Catholic, reportedly saying that 
“Paris is well worth a Mass.” Five years later, in another step to bring peace, 
Henry issued the Edict of Nantes , which allowed the Huguenots to practice 
their faith. The edict provided religious toleration in France for the next 8 
years. In 1685, Louis ;I9 of France issued the Revocation of the Edict of 
Nantes. As a result, France experienced social and economic effects. For 
example, many skilled craftsmen left France, taking knowledge of important 
industry techniques and styles with them.
7hirty <ears¶ :ar  The final great religious conflict between Catholics 
and Protestants in Europe culminated in the 7hirty <ears¶ :ar 1618±
168, which led to economic catastrophe for most of the continent. The 
Thirty Years’ War was initially the result of religious conflict within the 
Holy Roman Empire it gradually developed into a more general conflict 
involving European powers. Much of the destruction was caused by troops 
who were allowed to loot as part of their compensation. The war resulted 
in widespread famine, starvation, and disease. 
The war culminated in the 3eace oI :estShalia , which allowed each area 
of the Holy Roman Empire to select one of three religious options: Roman 
Catholicism, Lutheranism, or Calvinism. After this settlement, France, Spain, 
and Italy were predominantly Catholic. Northern Europe was either Lutheran 
or Calvinist. England was Protestant with a state church. 
Allowing rulers of various areas of the Holy Roman Empire to choose 
a denomination had important political effects. It gave the countries and 
duchies much more autonomy than they previously had. Consequently, 
the states of Prussia now part of Germany and Austria began to assert 
themselves, although they still formally belonged to the Holy Roman Empire. 
Prussia, after suffering tremendous destruction during the Thirty Years’ War, 
developed a strong military to protect itself. The Prussian military tradition 
would become a key factor in European politics into the 20th century .

Islamic Religious Schisms
As in the Holy Roman Empire, religion and the state were closely tied in 
Islamic empires. Islam continued to be an enduring belief system, spreading 
its sphere of influence despite factions that developed within it.
Ottoman Empire  Until 15, much of the area had been controlled by the 
Byzantine Empire and followed the Eastern Orthodox religion. After the siege 
of Constantinople, the area became Ottoman and the dominant religion became 
Islam. A sultan replaced the emperor, and the Byzantine Empire’s Justinian Law 
was replaced by shariah . This is a strict Islamic legal system that deals with all 
aspects of life, such as criminal justice, marital laws, and is sues of inheritance. 
The Safavids  Using Shi’a Islam as a unifying force, Shah Ismail built a 
power base that supported his rule and denied legitimacy to any Sunni. This 
strict adherence to Shi’a Islam caused frequent hostilities within the Ottoman 
Empire.  
Mughal Toleration and Prosperity  Akbar tolerated all religions. He 
gave money or land to Hindus and Muslims. He also gave money for a Catholic 
church in Goa, on India’s southwest coast. He provided land grants for the 
relatively new religion of Sikhism , which developed from Hinduism and may 
have been influenced by the Islamic mysticism known as Sufism. See Topics  
1.2 and 1.. Sikhism, a monotheistic faith that recognized the rights of other 
faiths to exist, became the fifth most popular religion in the world by the 21st 
century. Akbar tried to ease tensions between Hindus and Muslims. He gave 
Hindus positions in his government²zamindars of high and low positions 
could be Hindu²and married Hindu wives. He exempted Hindus from poll 
taxes paid by non-Muslims in the empire. Because he enjoyed religious 
discussions, Akbar invited Catholic priests to Delhi to explain Christianity to 
him. 
Regarded as one of the world’s outstanding rulers, Akbar encouraged 
learning, art, architecture, and literature. He tried and failed to prohibit child 
marriages and sati, the ritual in which widows killed themselves by jumping 
on the funeral pyres of their husbands. He died in 1605 without successfully 
converting his Hindu and Islamic subjects to the religion c alled Din-i Ilahi , or 
“divine faith,” which he had promoted to reconcile Hinduism and Islam.

In the early 1600s, scientific thinking gained popularity in northern Europe as 
trends in Renaissance ideas, curiosity, investigation, and discovery spread. In a 
period of religious schisms, scientific thought represented a very different kind 
of thinking²one based on reason rather than on faith²that would set in motion 
a monumental historical change. In 1620, English scientist and philosopher 
Francis Bacon developed an early scientific method called empiricism , which 
insisted upon the collection of data to back up a hypothesis. Bacon challenged 
traditional ideas that had been accepted for centuries and replace them with 
ones that could be demonstrated with evidence.
Scientific thinking advanced through the correspondence of leading scholars 
with one another, even during the religious wars, and by the establishment 
of a Royal Academy of Science in France and England. Sir Isaac Newton, 
combining Galileo’s laws of terrestrial motion and Johannes .epler’s laws 
of planetary motion, published a work on gravitational force called Principia 
168. The ideas in Principia influenced science and mathematics and helped 
lead to a new vision of the world. Many intellectuals thought that science 
showed that the world was ordered and rational and that natural laws applied 
to the rational and orderly progress of governments and society. This thinking 
is a key to the Enlightenment see Topic 5.1.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“He is very valiant and has a great liking for warfare and weapons of war, 
which he has constantly in his hands: we have been eye-witnesses of this 
because, whenever we were with him, he was adjusting his >swords@, testing 
his >muskets@, etc . . . This is the great experience, which he has obtained of 
warfare over so many years, that he makes it in person and from the first has 
made him a fine soldier and very skilled, and his men so dexterous that they 
are little behind our men in Europe. He has introduced into his militia the 
use of and esteem for >muskets@, in which they are very practiced. Therefore 
it is that his realm has been so much extended on all sides. . . . All the above 
mentioned soldiers, who will total some 100,000, receive pay for the whole 
year.”

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“Let no one think that this Commandment entirely forbids the arts of 
painting, engraving, or sculpture. The Scriptures inform us that God Himself 
commanded to be made images of Cherubim >a category of angel@, and also 
the brazen serpent. The interpretation, therefore, at which we must arrive, is 
that images are prohibited only inasmuch as they are used as deities to receive 
adoration, and so to injure the true worship of God. . . .
He >the pastor@ will also inform the unlettered . . . of the use of images, that 
they are intended to instruct in the history of the Old and New Testaments, 
and to revive from time to time their memory that thus, moved by the 
contemplation of heavenly things, we may be the more ardently inflamed to 
adore and love God Himself. He should, also, point out that the images of the 
Saints are placed in churches, not only to be honored, but also that they may 
admonish us by their examples to imitate their lives and virtues.”

values shape how they see the past. An interpretation of history is a 
historian’s view of why events happened and why they were significant.

Comparison in  
Land-Based Empires
Foreigners appreciate only military power. . . . Thus,  
they submit to us wholeheartedly and do not dare to despise  
China once we display our hunting techniques to them. 
—Quinlong, Emperor of China,1735
Essential Question:   By what methods did empires increase their societal 
and cultural influence from c. 1450–c. 1750?
Building and maintaining large land-based  empires is a major theme in 
the period c. 1450 ±c. 1750 . These  empires grew as they incorporated lands 
they conquered. The ir rulers implemented policies to solidify or legitimize 
their rule over a diverse population. However, the conquered often did not 
totally assimilate to the life and culture of their conquerors. In some cases the 
conquered influenced the conquerors, helping to shape a blended culture.  The 
interconnection of hemispheres also led to blended cultures.

Suleiman I besieged the Habsburg-controlled city of Esztergom in 15 with the 
help of French artillery. The figure at the far left is a Janissary. Suleiman is on 
horseback.
178 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONNot all empires were able to maintain their authority. For example, the 
Gunpowder Empires declined, unable to compete with European trading 
companies, especially the British, and unable to resolve conflicts of heirs 
motivated by harem politics see Topic .1. Other factors in the decline 
included weak or corrupt leadership and failure to keep up with developments 
in military and naval technology. The expensive armies each empire needed to 
maintain control placed harsh financial burdens on the peasants and villages 
in the form of taxes and other obligations. Religious conflicts also divided and 
weakened the Gunpowder Empires. 
A deep religious schism divided Muslims and Hindus in Mughal India, 
just as a schism divided Sunni Ottomans and Shi’a Safavids and set the stage 
for conflict between the present-day countries of Iraq and Iran. Connect: 
Write a paragraph comparing the decline of Mughal India with the decline of 
the Mongol Empire. See Topic 2.1.
Military Might
The armies of these land-based empires were well trained, well organized, well 
equipped, and well led. Empires in Eurasia all relied on gunpowder weapons, 
including large cannons, in support of more traditional cavalry and infantry 
units. In the Americas, the fierceness of both the Aztec and Incan warriors 
allowed them to intimidate and conquer neighboring territories. 
Soldiers  In some cases, the rulers of land-based empires developed an 
elite group of soldiers to use in solidifying their control over their territories. 
For instance, both the Ottoman sultan and Safavid shah used enslaved soldiers 
to offset the power of troops who had more loyalty to their tribe or local 
governor than to the sultan or shah. The Janissaries in the Ottoman Empire 
helped to preserve the power of the Ottoman sultan and the Ghulams helped to 
protect the Safavid shah from rival clans. Both the Janissaries and the Ghulams 
were often recruited from minority religious or ethnic groups found within 
the empires. The Janissaries were often enslaved people taken from Christian 
areas of the Ottoman Empire, while the Ghulams came from the Georgian, 
Armenian, or Circassian populations within the Safavid Empire. The system 
of taking people as part of a “blood” tax in the Ottoman Empire this was 
known as devshirme or tribute was not limited to the Ottomans or Safavids. 
Aztecs also required enslaved people or prisoners as part of the tribute offered 
by conquered states. 
:arIare These strong militaries did not prevent conflict among the land-
based empires. The Ottoman Empire and Safavid Empire went to war over the 
territorial claims each had at its border. However, religion also played a role as 
an underlying cause of this conflict. The Ottoman Empire was a predominantly 
Sunni Muslim state, while the Safavids were mainly Shi’a. Each believed the 
other to practice a heretical type of Islam and was willing to go to war over 
this split. Religion was not as important a factor in the conflict between the 
Safavids and the Mughals as it was in the Ottoman-Safavid War. Instead, 
179 COMPARIS ON IN LAND-BASED EMPIRES 179control over resources and trade routes in present-day Afghanistan was at the 
core of the war between these two land-based empires.
Two Muslim powers conflicted when Morocco invaded the Songhai 
Empire in 151. Moroccan forces sacked the capital of Gao and ended the 
empire. However, Morocco was unable to hold onto all the Songhai territory.
Centralized Bureaucracy 
Controlling a large area with such diverse populations required land-based 
empires to establish an organized and centralized bureaucracy. Recruiting 
bureaucratic elites took several forms. In the Ming and Manchu dynasties of 
China, the civil service examination system was used to assess the abilities of 
the members of the scholar-gentry who wished to enter government service. In 
the Ottoman Empire, the devshirme system provided the sultan with a ready-
made pool of civil servants strictly loyal to him, while in the Safavid Empire, 
the shah would enlist a class of bureaucrats from the Persian population of the 
empire, known as “the men of the pen.”

In the Songhai Empire, the mansa , a Mandika word meaning “sultan,” 
employed bureaucrats from the scholarly class educated in the schools, or 
madrasas, of Timbuktu. While the Incas did not use a dedicated scholarly 
class to rule their empire as the Ming and Manchus did, they did organize 
their empire into a federal system of provinces headed by nobles loyal to the 
emperor. Further, these nobles oversaw a very organized political structure 
that was divided on the basis of a decimal system.
180 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONDespite its many similarities to other land empires, the Aztec Empire 
was less centralized and bureaucratic than the other land empires. The Aztec 
created a tributary empire and had little to no direct control over the territory 
within the region of Mesoamerica. It kept control over this region through 
force, fear, and intimidation rather than through a centralized bureaucracy.

Taxation  Some form of taxation or revenue collection was necessary to 
support the bureaucracy and military of the land-based empires of this period. 
Taxation took many forms in these empires:
• Mughal zamindar tax collection:  Mughal emperors appointed tax 
officers or zamindars to collect taxes from the peasant class based on 
land and production.
• Ottoman tax farming:  Rather than employing government tax 
collectors, the Ottoman sultans appointed “tax farmers” to pay an 
annual fixed sum of money for an area to the central government and 
then recoup the outlay by collecting money or salable goods from the 
residents of the area. Many Janissaries were paid their salaries in this 
manner by collecting more money than they paid out to the central 
government.
• Aztec tribute lists:  As the Aztecs or Mexica formed a tributary 
empire, the main source of revenue that supported the Aztec noble 
class and military came from yearly offerings or tributes from the 
surrounding areas. The lists included whichever local product was 
made or valued but could also include a demand for people, many of 
whom became human sacrifices in Aztec religious rituals.
• Ming collection of “hard currency:”  The Ming Empire, like its 
predecessors, issued paper currency as a means to facilitate trade 
and tax collection however the use of paper money led to rampant 
counterfeiting and hyperinflation. The Ming then ordered that all taxes 
should be paid in the form of rice, and later silver coins, known as 
“hard currency.”
181 COMPARIS ON IN LAND-BASED EMPIRES Striving for Legitimacy
While the diversity of the populations of the land-based empires was beneficial 
to the economic and political strength of the empires, ruling over populations 
that included many ethnicities, religions, and tribal ties was challenging. 
Therefore many rulers turned to other than political means to unite their 
subjects in their loyalty to the state. Rulers used religion, art, and monumental 
architecture to legitimize their rule. Akbar attempted a syncretic approach to 
religion in the Mughal Empire, but he had little success in that area.
Sources of Legitimacy Examples
Religion • Rulers in Islamic empires used references to the title 
“caliph,” or successor to the Prophet.
• European monarchs claim to ¸divine right¹ that gave 
the monarch the mandate to rule by the Christian God.
• Conversion to Islam of Songhai rulers and noble class 
provides a religious and legal structure to the empire.
• Aztec (Mexica) use human sacrifice in religious rituals.
Art • Portraits of the Qing emperors and other high oɉcials
• Miniature paintings in the Ottoman Empire

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   WHY DID THE ISLAMI C GUNPOWDER 
EMPIRES  RISE  AND  DECLINE ?
The term “Gunpowder Empires” was coined by Marshall G. S. Hodgson in the 10s 
to refer to the large land empires of Southwestern and South Asia that flourished the 
from 150 to 150  The Venture of Islam: The Gunpowder Empires and Modern 
Times . The term is often used to describe the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals. 
Trade and the Rise of Empires  .enneth Pomeranz and Steven Topik, in their 
2005 book The World That Trade Created , described the empires as part of the growing 
global economy. These authors, taking economic and social perspectives, used coffee 
as one example of the international character of consumer goods: “Coffee’s role in 
sociability and prestige in Europe was enhanced by the arrival of emissaries of the 
Ottoman sultan in France and Austria in 1665±1666, who poured the exotic liquor for 
their aristocratic European guests during extravagant soirees.”
Reasons for Decline  Historians have given various reasons for their declines, 
but most fall into three categories: 1 ineffectiveness 2 intolerance of minorities 
and  failure to modernize. One reviewer summarized historian 9ladimir Minorsky’s 
reasons for the decline of the Safavid Empire: 
a. decline of theocratic ideology
b. opposition between old and new elements in the military class
c.  disturbance in equilibrium among the service classes, which lost interest in 
the cause they were supporting
d. the “shadow government” represented by the harem 
e. degeneration of the dynasty as a result of its insular nature
Military :eaNness  William McNeill pointed out that rulers and military 
administrators did not try to keep up with “subsequent European innovations in 
military and naval matters, leaving them woefully exposed to attack.” McNeill noted 
that the Ottomans’ guns were able to defeat their Islamic rivals, the Safavids, because 
“until about 1600, the Ottoman army remained technically and in every way in the 
very forefront of military proficiency.” Nevertheless, after the time of Suleiman, 
leaders did not themselves lead soldiers in battle, and military discipline declined just 
as efficiency and technology began to lag behind Western Europe.
Tolerance and Intolerance  Amy Chua, Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers 
Rise to Global Dominance—and Why They Fall , suggested a different reason for 
the eventual failure of the Gunpowder Empires. Her thesis was that intolerance 
ultimately became an obstacle to retaining great power. She suggested that empires 
were successful in holding their power when they were at their most religiously and 
ethnically tolerant. This thesis can help explain why the Ottoman Empire, with its 
relative tolerance, outlived the more intolerant Safavid and Mu ghal Empires.

The tsar labored at the reform of fashions, or, more properly speaking, of 
dress. Until that time the Russians had always worn long beards, which 
they cherished and preserved with much care, allowing them to hang 
down on their bosoms, without even cutting the moustache. With these 
long beards they wore the hair very short, except the ecclesiastics, who, 
to distinguish themselves, wore it very long. The tsar, in order to reform 
that custom, ordered that gentlemen, merchants, and other subjects, 
except priests and peasants, should each pay a tax of one hundred rubles 
a year if they wished to keep their beards the commoners had to pay one 
kopek each. Officials were stationed at the gates of the towns to collect 
that tax, which the Russians regarded as an enormous sin on the part of 
the tsar and as a thing which tended to the abolition of their religion.
These insinuations, which came from the priests, occasioned the 
publication of many pamphlets in Moscow, where for that reason alone 
the tsar was regarded as a tyrant and a pagan and there were many 
old Russians who, after having their beards shaved off, saved them 
preciously, in order to have them placed in their coffins, fearing that they 
would not be allowed to enter heaven without their beards. As for the 
young men, they followed the new custom with the more readiness as it 
made them appear more agreeable to the fair sex.

Understand the Context
The voyage by Christopher Columbus in 1492 that connected the Eastern and 
Western hemispheres led to the first global trade networks. They provided the 
framework for historical events for the following centuries. 
Establishment of Maritime Empires   Between 150 and 150, European 
states, starting with the Portuguese and Spanish, sought a transoceanic route 
to Asia. Europeans established trading post empires in the Indian Ocean that 
inadvertently brought them into contact with the Americas. 
Global Exchanges  Trans-Atlantic trade linked the Americas, Europe, 
and Africa for the first time. European colonists who wanted sugar and other 
crops to sell in the global market developed plantations in the Americas. Their 
desire for laborers fueled the trade in enslaved Africans. Trans-Pacific trade 
flourished as well. Silver mined in Latin America was the major commodity. 
Over time, the transfer of crops, animals, and disease between the Eastern 
and Western hemispheres, known as the Columbian Exchange, altered life 
everywhere. The introduction of potatoes, corn, and tomatoes to Europe led to 
population growth. The introduction of deadly pathogens, such as small pox 
and measles, devastated the populations of the Americas. 
Change and Continuity  Within the context of increasing European 
influence, regional commerce and established states in Afro-Eurasia continued 
to flourish. The Mughal, Ottoman, and Qing Empires expanded, creating 
ethnically diverse states. Across the globe, peasant and artisan labor intensified 
as the demand for goods and food increased. These developments set the stage 
for the revolutions that defined the period after 150. 14501550 165017501492

TECHNOLOGICA L INNOVATIONS 191
4.1
Technological Innovations 
The sailors, moreover, as they sail over the sea, when in cloudy weather they 
can no longer profit by the light of the sun, or when the world is wrapped up in 
the darkness of the shades of night, and they are ignorant to what point of the 
compass their ship’s course is directed, they touch the magnet with a needle, 
which (the needle) is whirled round in a circle until, when its motion ceases,  
its point looks direct to the north.  
—Alexander Neckham (1157-1217)
Essential Question:   How did cross-cultural interactions spread  
technology and facilitate changes in trade and  
travel from 1450 to 1750?
Although land-based empires were important during this period, various 
inventions allowed Europeans to venture long distances on the ocean. The 
magnetic compass, originally created in China for fortune telling, helped 
steer a ship in the right direction, as described by Alexander Neckham. The 
astrolabe, improved by Muslim navigators in the 12th century, let sailors find 
out how far north or south they were from the equator. The caravel, a small, 
three-masted sailing ship developed by the Portuguese in the 15th century, 
allowed sailors to survive storms at sea better than earlier-designed ships. 
Cartography , or mapmaking, and knowledge of current and wind patterns 
also improved navigation.
Demographic pressures pushed Europeans into exploration and trade. As 
the population grew, not all workers in Europe could find work or even food. 
Not all sons of the wealthy could own land because primogeniture laws  gave 
all of each estate to the eldest son. In the early 1th century, religious minorities 
searched for a place to settle where people were tolerant of their dissent. All of 
these groups, as well as those just longing for adventure and glory, were eager 
to settle in new areas. Those who left their homelands in search of work, food, 
land, tolerance, and adventure were part of a global shift in demographics.
Developments of Transoceanic Travel and Trade
Europe was never totally isolated from East and South Asia. The Indian Ocean 
trade routes had long brought silk, spices, and tea to the Mediterranean by 
way of the Red Sea. Islamic traders had long known of land routes from China 
to the cities of Baghdad and Constantinople and from there to Rome. Then, 
192 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONin the 16th century, more and more Europeans became active in the Indian 
Ocean, with hopes of finding wealth and new converts as their twin motives. 
However, Europeans faced competition from Middle Eastern traders based in 
kingdoms such as Oman. For example, the Portuguese set up forts in Oman 
but were repeatedly challenged by attempts to remove them. The Omani-
European rivalry  was one reason for Christopher Columbus’s search for a 
new route to India. 
The voyages by Columbus connected people across the Atlantic Ocean. 
European traders became go-betweens linking Afro-Eurasia and the Americas. 
• From the Americas, they purchased sugar, tobacco, and rum.
• From Africa, they purchased enslaved people.
• From Asia, they purchased silk, spices, and rhubarb.
This extensive trade transformed Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, France, and 
Holland into maritime empires , ones based on sea travel. 
Much of this trade was carried out by men. However, in Southeast Asia, 
Europeans conducted most of their business with women, who traditionally 
handled markets and money-changing services in those cultures.
Classical, Islamic, and Asian Technology
Western European countries such as Portugal, Spain, and England were 
developing their naval technology. They were aware of traditions of sailing 
that went back to the classical Greeks, such as using the stars to navigate. 
They combined this knowledge with new ideas developed by Islamic and 
Asian sailors and scholars, which they learned about because of the cross-
cultural interactions resulting from trade networks. Al-Andalus, in what is 
now Spain, was a place where Islamic ideas diffused into Europe.
The leading European figure in this development was Portuguese ruler 
Prince Henry the Navigator. While he never sailed far enough out to sea to 
lose sight of land, he strongly supported exploration. He financed expeditions 
along Africa’s Atlantic Coast and around the Cape of Good Hope. With his 
backing, Portugal explored African coastal communities and kingdoms before 
other European powers. 
Advances in Ideas  As scholars gathered knowledge, they improved the 
safety of sailing on the ocean. For example, Newton’s discovery of gravitation 
increased knowledge of the tides. As a result, sailors could reliably predict 
when the depth of water near a shore would be decreasing, thereby exposing 
dangerous rocks. As people kept increasingly accurate records on the direction 
and intensity of winds, sailors could sail with greater confidence.
Improvements in cartography also improved navigation. An astronomical 
chart is any map of the stars and galaxies. Mariners relied on these maps 
to guide ships’ direction, especially before the introduction of the compass, 
using the skies to help them determine their location. Ancient astronomers 
in Babylonia and Mesopotamia had created star charts as early as the 2nd 
193 TECHNOLOGICA L INNOVATIONS millennium B.C.E. Charts by Chinese astronomers date back to the 5th century 
B.C.E. Charts were also used widely by classical Greek astronomers. Using 
telescopes to help create astronomical charts began in 160, and the practice 
was widely used to map the stars by the end of the 1th century. Astronomers 
typically divided the charts into grids to help locate specific constellations and 
astronomical objects.
Advances in Equipment  Several developments in the equipment used on 
ships made sailing safer and faster than ever. Ships moved adroitly, aided by a 
new type of rudder, another idea imported from China. The astrolabe, improved 
by Muslim navigators in the 12th century, allowed sailors to determine how far 
north or south they were from the equator. 
The compass is the primary direction-finding device used in navigation. It 
works either with magnets or a gyroscope, which is a wheel or disk mounted to 
spin rapidly around an axis in various directions. Other compasses determine 
the location of the sun or a specific star. The magnetic compass, originally 
invented in China, allowed sailors to steer a ship in the right direction. It is 
the oldest and most familiar. It was discovered by mariners in both China and 
Europe in the 12th century. This type of compass works as Earth itself acts as 
an enormous bar magnet. Earth’s magnetic field is almost parallel to the north-
south axis of the globe, which means that freely moving magnets, such as those 
in a compass, take on the same orientation. 
The lateen sail , or a ship sail in the shape of a triangle, was a pivotal piece 
of technology. Used by Arab sailors and in the Indian Ocean, it significantly 
affected medieval navigation and trade. The ancient square sails that preceded 
the lateen allowed sailing only in a single direction and had to be used with 
the wind. The lateen, however, could catch the wind on either side of the ship, 
allowing it to travel in different directions. When used with the square sail, 
the lateen allowed sailors to travel successfully into large bodies of water, 
including oceans, for the first time, thus expanding trade rout es.

Lateen sails are still used on 
modern sailboats.
194 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONNew types of ships also improved trade. By adjusting the ratio of length to 
width of a ship, adding or reducing the number of masts, and using different 
types of sails, builders could adapt ships to improve their efficiency. (Connect:

Long-Term Results  The long-term result of combining navigational 
techniques invented in Europe with those from other areas of the world was a 
rapid expansion of exploration and global trade. About the only part of the Afro-
Eurasia world not affected by the rapid increase in global trade was Polynesia, 
since it was far removed from trading routes. 
The introduction of gunpowder, another Chinese invention, aided Europeans 
in their conquests abroad. Soon enough, however, sea pirates also used the new 
technology, particularly the Dutch pirates known as Sea Beggars. 
In North Africa and in the trading cities along Africa’s east coast, Islam 
spread rapidly as a result of the growth of the Abbasid Empire, centered in 
Baghdad, and the activities of Muslim merchants. Interactions among various 
cultures inside and outside of Africa brought extensive trade and new technology 
to the continent.
Navigational techniques continued to spread throughout the 1th century. 
Russia’s Tsar Peter the Great visited Western Europe in 16 to observe military 
and naval technology. His interest in European technology led him to hire 
technicians from Germany and elsewhere to help build Russia’s military and 
naval power.

1. Use the passages below to answer all parts of the question that 
follows.
“After the year 1500 there was no pepper to be had at Calicut that was not 
dyed red with blood.”
 9 oltaire, 156
“Gunpowder weapons were not new. The Chinese invented gunpowder and 
they made the first true guns in the tenth century, primarily for defensive 
purposes. The Mongols improved these Chinese weapons into a more 
effective offensive force, to blow open city gates. By 121, these weapons 
had reached Europe. Early modern Europeans, Turks, Mughals, and Chinese 
owed their strength in part to improvements in gunpowder weaponry. 
Combined with better military organization and seagoing capability, 
advanced weaponry inevitably affected political and social systems. 
As they spread throughout Eurasia and North Africa, gunpowder weapons 
changed warfare. Europeans learned how to make particularly deadly 
weapons, improving the technology in part because they had easier access 
to metals.”

4.2
Exploration: Causes and Events
You can never cross the ocean unless you have  
the courage to lose sight of the shore
—Christopher Columbus (1451-1506)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the state-
sponsored expansion of maritime exploration?
Thanks in part to improved navigation techniques, Italian cities with ports 
on the Mediterranean had a monopoly on European trade with Asia. By 
controlling access to the trade routes, the Italians controlled prices of Asian 
imports to Europe, driving Spain and Portugal, and later France, England, and 
the Netherlands, into the search for new routes to Asia. Explorers hoped to find 
riches overseas, especially gold and silver. In addition to these economic and 
political reasons, explorers were interested in converting others to Christianity. 
Also, technological breakthroughs in sailing and navigation made bold new 
voyages possible.
Christopher Columbus , quoted above and credited with “discovering the 
New World,” was fortunate in 12 to gain the support of the Spanish monarchs, 
Queen Isabella and .ing Ferdinand, for his voyages across the Atlantic. His 
journeys helped increase the interest in discovery, and the English, French, and 
Dutch supported later exploration.
The Role of States in Maritime Exploration
European states were seeking ways to expand their authority and control of 
resources in the era of empire-building. Conquests brought new wealth to 
states through the collection of taxes and through new trading opportunities. 
In time it also brought great material wealth, especially in silver, to European 
states. Rivalries among European states stoked efforts to expand before 
another power might claim a territory. Religion was also a motivating force 
for exploration and expansion. Many Europeans believed that it was their 
Christian duty to seek out people in other lands to convert them. 
For all these reasons, states were centrally involved in maritime exploration. 
9 oyages such as those Columbus undertook were expensive, and without the 
financial support of a state, they would most likely have been too expensive 
200 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONfor explorers and even most merchants to be able to afford. Since religion was 
tightly woven into the government of most European states, preserving and 
spreading a state’s religion became another reason for state involvement. 
Also, in the 1th century, Europeans generally measured the wealth of 
a country in how much gold and silver it had accumulated. For this reason, 
countries set policies designed to sell as many goods as they could to other 
countries²in order to maximize the amount of gold and silver coming into the 
country²and to buy as few as possible from other countries²to minimize the 
flow of precious metals out of the country. This theory, known as mercantilism , 
required heavy government involvement. 
Expansion of European Maritime Exploration
In no nation were the interests of the state and the interest of explorers 
as closely tied as they were in Portugal, which led the way in European 
exploration as it had in maritime innovations. See Topic 2.. 
Portuguese in Africa and India  The small kingdom of Portugal, bounded 
on the east by the Spanish kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, could expand only 
overseas. Three people led its exploration:
• Prince Henry the Navigator  1±160 became the first European 
monarch to sponsor seafaring expeditions, to search for an all-water 
route to the east as well as for African gold. Under him, Portugal began 
importing enslaved Africans by sea, replacing the overland slave trade. 
• Bartholomew Diaz  sailed around the southern tip of Africa, the Cape 
of Good Hope, in 188, into waters his crew did not know. Diaz feared 
a mutiny if he continued pushing eastward, so he returned home.
•  Vasco Da Gama  sailed farther east than Diaz, landing in India in 
18. There he claimed territory as part of Portugal’s empire. The 
Portuguese ports in India were a key step in expanding Portugal’ s trade 
in the Indian Ocean and with points farther east.
Portuguese in Southeast and East Asia  Early in the 16th century, the 
ruthless Portuguese admiral Afonso de Albuquerque won a short but bloody 
battle with Arab traders and set up a factory at Malacca in present-day 
Indonesia. He had previously served as governor of Portuguese India 150±
1515, sending strings of Indians’ ears home to Portugal as evidence of his 
conquests.
China’s exploration of the outside world came to an end after =heng 
He’s final voyage in the 10s. See Topic 2.. However, less than a century 
later, in 151, the outside world arrived on China’s doorstep in the form of 
Portuguese traders. At that time, Portugal’s superior ships and weapons were 
unmatched among the Europeans. As a result of this advantage, the Portuguese 
had already won control of both the African and Indian coasts. They had won a 
decisive victory over a Turkish-Egyptian-9enetian fleet at Diu, India, in 150. 
201 EXPL ORATION: CA USES AN D EVENTS 201Initial Portuguese visits had little impact on Chinese society. But the 
traders were followed by Roman Catholic missionaries, mainly Franciscans 
and Dominicans, who worked to gain converts among the Chinese people.
The Jesuits soon followed and tried to win over the Chinese court elite. 
Scientific and technical knowledge were the keys to success at the court. Jesuit 
missionaries in Macau, such as Matteo Ricci an Italian, arrived 1582 and 
Adam Schall von Bell a German, arrived 161, impressed the Chinese with 
their learning. However, they failed to win many converts among the hostile 
scholar-gentry, who considered them barbaric.
Trading Post Empire  To ensure control of trade, the Portuguese had 
constructed a series of forts stretching from Hormuz on the Persian Gulf built 
in 150 to Goa in western India built in 1510 to Malacca on the Malay 
Peninsula built in 1511. The aims of the fort construction were to establish 
a monopoly complete control over a market over the spice trade in the area 
and to license all vessels trading between Malacca and Hormuz. The forts gave 
Portugal a global trading post empire , one based on small outposts, rather 
than control of large territories. The Portuguese also restricted Indian Ocean 
trade to those who were willing to buy permits.
Portuguese Vulnerability   The Portuguese succeeded in global trade for 
several decades, but Portugal was a small nation, lacking the workers and the 
ships necessary for the enforcement of a large trade empire. Many Portuguese 
merchants ignored their government and traded independently. Corruption 
among government officials also hampered the trading empire. By the 1th 
century, Dutch and English rivals were challenging the Portuguese in East 
Asia, including islands that are today part of Malaysia and Ind onesia.
The Dutch captured Malacca and built a fort at Batavia in Java in 1620. 
From Batavia, the Dutch attempted to monopolize the spice trade. As a result, 
the English focused on India, pushing the Portuguese out of South Asia.
In the early 16th century, the Portuguese also travelled to Japan to trade, 
followed by Christian missionaries in 15. They formed large Catholic 
settlements until the 1600s, when Japanese rulers outlawed Catholicism and 
expelled the missionaries. 
Spanish in the Philippines  Portuguese explorers such as 9asco da 
Gama were the first Western Europeans to reach the Indian Ocean by sea 
by going around the southern tip of Africa. Spanish ships, however, became 
the first to circumnavigate the globe when the government sponsored the 
voyage of Ferdinand Magellan . He died on the voyage in the Philippine 
Islands in 1522, but one of the ships in his fleet made it around the world, 
proving that the earth could be circumnavigated. 
Spain annexed the Philippines in 1521 when Magellan’s fleet arrived 
there. The Spanish returned in 1565 and started a long campaign to conquer the 
Filipinos, who put up fierce resistance. Manila became a Spanish commercial 
center in the area, attracting Chinese merchants and others. Because of the 
Portuguese and Spanish occupations, many Filipinos became Christians.
202 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe Lure of Riches
Columbus and other European explorers sought a new route to Asia and hoped 
to find gold, silver, and other valuable resources. The Spanish found so little of 
value in their first two decades of contact that they considered stopping further 
exploration. The English, after sponsoring voyages in the 10s, made little 
attempt to explore or settle for almost a century.
However, European interest in the Americas was rekindled when the Spanish 
came into contact with the two major empires in the region, the Aztecs in 
Mesoamerica and the Incas in South America. These empires had the gold and silver 
that made exploration, conquest, and settlement profitable. In addition, Europeans 
soon realized that, by using enslaved Native Americans and later enslaved Africans, 
they could grow wealthy by raising sugar, tobacco, and other valuable crops. 
7raGe $cross the 3acific  China was a particularly enthusiastic consumer of 
this silver from the Western Hemisphere. Silver, for example, made its way from 
what is now Mexico across the Pacific Ocean to East Asia in heavily armed 
Spanish ships known as galleons  that made stops in the Philippines. At the trading 
post in Manila, Europeans exchanged silver for luxury goods such as silk and 
spices, and even for gold bullion. The impressive Manila galleons allowed the 
silver trade to flourish. Indeed, the Chinese government soon began using silver 
as its main form of currency. By the early 1th century, silver had become a 
dominant force in the global economic system.

sponsored expeditions in search of a northwest passage. In 155, for example, 
French explorer Jacques Cartier  sailed from the Atlantic Ocean into the St. 
Lawrence River at today’s northern U.S. border. He did not find a new route 
to Asia, but he did claim part of what is now Canada for France. Eventually, 
explorers such as Cartier and Samuel de Champlain  explored 160±1616 
realized there were valuable goods and rich resources available in the Americas, 
so there was no need to go beyond to Asia.
Like the Spanish, the French hoped to find gold. Instead, they found a land 
rich in furs and other natural resources. In 1608, they established a town and 
trading post that they named Quebec . French traders and priests spread across 
the continent. The traders searched for furs the priests wanted to convert 
Native Americans to Christianity. The missionaries sometimes set up schools 
among the indigenous peoples. In the 1680s, a French trader known as La 
Salle explored the Great Lakes and followed the Mississippi River south to its 
mouth at the Gulf of Mexico. He claimed this vast region for France.
Unlike the Spanish²or the English who were colonizing the East Coast of 
what is now the United States²the French rarely settled permanently. Instead 
of demanding land, they traded for the furs trapped by Native Americans. For 
this reason, the French had better relations with natives than did the Spanish or 
English colonists and their settlements also grew more slowly. For example, 
by 15, the European population of New France , the French colony in 
North America, was only 0,000. The English colonies included one million 
Europeans. 
English Exploration  In 1, the English king sent an explorer named 
John Cabot  to America to look for a northwest passage. Cabot claimed lands 
from Newfoundland south to the Chesapeake Bay. The English, however, 
did not have enough sea power to defend themselves against Spanish naval 
forces²although English pirates called “sea dogs” sometimes attacked 
Spanish ships. Then in 1588, the English surprisingly defeated and destroyed 
all but one third of the Spanish Armada. With that victory, England declared 
itself a major naval power and began competing for lands and resources in the 
Americas.
At about the same time the French were founding Quebec, the English 
were establishing a colony in a land called 9irginia. In 160, about one 
hundred English colonists traveled approximately 60 miles inland from the 
coast, where they built a settlement, Jamestown , on the James River. Both the 
settlement and the river were named for the ruling English monarch, James  I. 
Jamestown was England’s first successful colony in the Americas, and one 
of the earliest colonies in what would become the United States. The first 
colonies in the present-day United States were Spanish settlements in Florida 
and New Mexico.

Dutch Exploration  In 160, the Dutch sent Henry Hudson  to explore 
the East Coast of North America. Among other feats, he sailed up what became 
known as the Hudson River to see if it led to Asia. He was disappointed in 
finding no northwest passage. He and other explorers would continue to search 
for such a route. Though it would travel through a chilly region, it offered the 
possibility of being only half the distance of a route that went around South 
America.
Though Hudson did not find a northwest passage, his explorations proved 
valuable to the Dutch. Based on his voyage, the Dutch claimed the Hudson 
River 9alley and the island of Manhattan. On the tip of this island, they settled 
a community called New Amsterdam , which today is known as New York 
City. Like many port towns, New Amsterdam prospered because it was located 
where a major river flowed into the ocean. 
205 EXPL ORATION: CA USES AN D EVENTSNew Amsterdam became an important node in the Dutch transatlantic trade 
network. Dutch merchants bought furs from trappers who lived and worked in

and others to the Netherlands in exchange for manufactured goods that they

Historians of exploration might well focus a specialized study on the 
search for a northwest passage²on the details of each effort to find 
one and the outcome of the exploration. In a similar way, economic 
historians might well focus a specialized study on the expansion of trade 
networks as a global economy began to develop. However, to appreciate 
the interconnections of historical developments, historians would relate 
the exploratory and the economic developments, looking for ways in 
which developments in one field of study influenced developments in 
the other field. For example, the explorers failed in their mission to find a 
northwest passage, but they found instead that there were goods to trade 
on the land they traveled through, and they explored new territories that 
proved rich with trading possibilities. These findings, in turn, led to the 
desire for more exploration that would lead to new participants in the 
global trade network.

Columbian Exchange
We are crushed to the ground; we lie in ruins.  
;here is nothing but grief and suќering in 4exico and ;latelolco,  
where once we saw beauty and ]alor
—from “Flowers and Songs of Sorrow,” anonymous  
Aztec poet, (c. 1521–1540)
Essential Question:   What were the causes of the Columbian Exchange and 
its effects on the Eastern and Western Hemispheres?  
As the excerpt from the poem above suggests, initial contact and the 
subsequent conquest and colonization of the Americas proved disastrous for the 
native peoples. Overpowered by superior weapons and decimated by disease, 
many native populations declined, dissipated, or were forced to submit to new 
rulers and a new religion.
Although European conquest seriously damaged entire native societies and 
their ways of life, eventually new ways of life developed out of the interaction 
of three broad traditions of culture: indigenous American, European, and 
African. In the process, the Eastern and Western Hemispheres became linked 
in a new way, sharing disease, foods, and animals. For the role Christopher 
Columbus played in establishing the link, these interactions became known as 
the Columbian Exchange .
The Columbian Exchange had far-reaching effects beyond dramatic 
changes in population and biodiversity. It also contributed to a changing 
global economy, sometimes with unintended consequences. For example, 
Spain successfully mined silver in the Americas. However, this silver sparked 
inflation in Spain, which contributed to the downfall of the Spanish Empire.
Diseases and Population Catastrophe
Until the arrival of Columbus, the peoples of the Western and Eastern 
Hemispheres had been almost completely isolated from each other. For that 
reason, the indigenous people of the Americas had no exposure²and therefore 
no immunity²to the germs and diseases brought by Europeans. Although 
European horses, gunpowder, and metal weapons helped conquer indigenous 
Americans, disease was responsible for the majority of deaths. 
Spanish soldiers, called conquistadores , such as Francisco Pizarro and 
210 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONHernin Cortps, brought smallpox  with them. Smallpox pathogens are spread 
through the respiratory system. When Europeans, who were largely immune 
after millennia of exposure in Afro-Eurasia, had face-to-face contact with 
indigenous populations, they infected these populations with the deadly 
disease. 
As colonists began to settle in the Americas, so did insects, rats, and 
other disease-carrying animals. Measles, influenza, and malaria, in addition to 
smallpox, also killed many native peoples of the Americas. 
The indigenous population of the Americas fell by more than 50  percent 
through disease alone in less than a century. Some American lands lost up to 
0 percent of their original populations. It was one of the greatest population 
disasters in human history.
Source:  Wikimedia Commons
Deadly diseases such as smallpox that came from Europe spread rapidly 
in the Americas.
Animals and Foods
Germ and disease transmissions were only one part of the Columbian 
Exchange. Another major component of the exchange was the sharing of new 
crops and livestock in both directions. Before the exchange began around 1500, 
Mesoamerican peoples consumed very little meat. Although contemporary 
Mexican food sold in the United States is reliant on pork, beef, and cheese, the 
indigenous people of Mexico knew nothing of pigs or cows until Europeans 
introduced them. These animals, along with Mediterranean foods such as 
wheat  and grapes, were introduced to the Western Hemisphere and eventually 
became staples of the American diet. 
Another domesticated animal the Europeans brought to the Americas, the 
horse , transformed the culture of the American Indians living in the Plains 
region. With the arrival of the horse, Indians could hunt buffalo on horseback 
so efficiently²and over a larger region²that they had a surplus of food. That 
211 COLUMBIAN E XCHANGE 211efficiency gave them more time for other pursuits, such as art and spirituality. 
However, competition and even armed conflict among tribes increased, with 
those having the most horses having the most power. 
At the same time, European explorers took back Mesoamerican maize  
corn, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, peppers, and cacao  to their home countries, 
where people started to grow them. Potatoes became so popular in Europe that 
they are often thought of as being native to certain regions, such as Ireland. The 
introduction of these vegetable crops caused tremendous population growth in 
Europe in the 16th and 1th centuries.
Cash Crops and Forced Labor
People themselves also became part of the exchange. The coerced arrival 
of enslaved Africans to the Americas brought biological and demographic 
changes. For example, Africans brought okra and rice with them to the 
Americas. Tobacco and cacao produced on American plantations with forced 
labor were sold to consumers in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. 
Even though slave traders kidnapped millions of Africans from their 
homelands, populations actually grew in Africa during the 16th and 1th 
centuries. That population growth happened because of the nutritious foods 
that were introduced to the continent. Yams and manioc, for example, were 
brought to Africa from Brazil. 
The Lure of Sugar  While Spain and Spanish America profited from 
silver, the Portuguese empire focused its endeavors on agriculture. Brazil, the 
center of the Portuguese-American empire, with its tropical climate and vast 
tracts of land, was perfect for sugarcane  cultivation. As disease had decimated 
the indigenous population, however, there were not enough laborers available 
to do the cultivation. Moreover, many of the people who were forced to labor 
in the sugar fields escaped to the uncharted Brazilian jungle. In response, the 
Portuguese began to import enslaved people from Africa, especially from the 
.ongo .ingdom and cities on the Swahili coast.
Slavery  Sugar’s profitability in European markets dramatically increased 
the number of Africans captured and sold through the transatlantic slave 
trade . Sugar cultivation in Brazil demanded the constant importation of African 
labor. African laborers were so numerous in Brazil that their descendants 
became the majority population of the region. Slave importers sold more than 
0 percent of enslaved Africans to the Caribbean and South America. Only 
about 6 percent went to British North America. Until the mid-1800s, more 
Africans than Europeans went to the Americas.
Enslaved people often died from backbreaking working conditions, poor 
nutrition, lack of adequate shelter, and tropical heat and the diseases that 
accompanied such heat. Sugar plantations processed so much sugar that they 
were referred to as engenhos , which means “engines” in Portuguese. Because 
of the engenhos’ horrible working conditions, plantation owners lost from 5 
to 10 percent of their labor force per year. Slavery is discussed in more detail 
in the Topic ..
212 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONGrowing Cash Crops  The Spanish noticed Portugal’s success with 
plantation agriculture and returned to the Caribbean to pursue cash crop  
cultivation, such as sugar and tobacco. Cash crops are grown for sale rather 
than subsistence. Soon, sugar eclipsed silver as the main moneymaker for 
the European empires. (Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the economic 
practices of Spain in the Americas and Portugal in South, Southwest, and 
Southeast Asia. See Topic .2.
African Presence in the Americas
African cultures were not completely lost once captives arrived in the 
Americas. In fact, during the African Diaspora  (dispersion of Africans out 
of Africa, enslaved Africans retained some aspects of their cultures. 
Languages  With a few exceptions, Africans were not able to transplant 
their languages to the Americas. The captives were forced away from their 
communities, and they soon found themselves on ships among captives from 
all across West Africa and, on some slave ships, from across East Africa as 
well. 
Since captives were taken from myriad African cultural groups, most did 
not share a common language. Understandably, they found it difficult, if not 
impossible, to communicate en route. Because of their linguistic isolation 
on the ships and in the Americas, most Africans lost their languages after a 
generation. In spite of this forced isolation from their cultures, West Africans 
managed to combine European colonizers’ languages English, Spanish, 
French, or Portuguese, for example with parts of their West African 
languages and grammatical patterns to create new languages known broadly 
as creole . 
Because the Caribbean islands had a larger concentration of enslaved 
Africans than did North America, creole languages dominate there even 
today. In the United States, which had a smaller percentage of Africans in 
comparison to the total population, few examples of creole languages exist. 
One notable exception is the Gullah or Geechee language of coastal South 
Carolina and Georgia, in places where enslaved people once composed 5 
percent of the population.
Music  Africans brought their music with them. The syncopated rhythms 
and percussion they used influenced later styles. These include  gospel, blues, 
jazz, rock and roll, hip-hop, rap, samba, reggae, and country music. 
One reason many African descendants maintained their musical 
traditions was because enslaved Africans in America used them as a means 
of survival. They sang tunes from home to help them endure long workdays 
as well as to communicate with other Africans, such as when planning an 
escape. They blended European Christian music with their own religious 
songs, known today as Negro spirituals²essential elements of American 
folk music history. Enslaved people also invented the banjo, which is very 
similar to stringed instruments found in West Africa.
213 COLUMBIAN E XCHANGEFood  In addition to rice and okra, Africans brought their knowledge of 
how to prepare these foods. The dish known as gumbo , popular in the southern 
United States, has roots in African cooking. With influences on language, 
music, food, and much more, African culture has had a profound and lasting 
impact on life in the Americas.

Environmental and Demographic Impact
Contact between Afro-Eurasia and the Americas brought dramatic changes 
to both. Most changes resulted from the Columbian Exchange. In addition, 
though, Europeans used agricultural land more intensively than did American 
Indians. For example, colonists cut down trees to clear areas for planting 
crops, and they created large fields that they cultivated year after year. As 
a result, deforestation and soil depletion became problems in the Americas. 
In addition, Europeans often lived in more densely populated communities 
than did American Indians. This increased the strain on water resources and 
created more concentrated areas of pollution.

 —Anonymous West African griot (storyteller) song
Essential Question:   How were the empires of European states established  
between 1450 to 1750, and what economic and labor 
systems fueled them?
European nations, driven largely by political, religious, and economic 
rivalries, established new maritime empires and administered trading posts in 
Asia and Africa and colonies in the Americas. Asian trade frequently exchanged 
silver and gold for luxury goods such as silk and spices, while newly developed 
colonial economies in the Americas often depended on agriculture. 
American plantations relied on existing labor systems and also introduced 
new labor systems. Among these were indentured servitude , arrangements 
through which servants contracted to work for a specified period of 
years in exchange for passage. Another was chattel slavery , a system in 
which individuals were considered as property to be bought and sold. The 
appalling shock of free people being seized and enslaved is captured in the 
griot storyteller song of the West African Wolof people. The growth of 
the plantation economy increased the demand for enslaved Africans in the 
Americas, leading to significant demographic, social, and cultural changes.
State-Building and Empire Expansion
The explorations of European states see Topic .2 were the foundation of 
maritime empires. States claimed lands and established the basis of an empire 
in the areas they explored. 
219 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS Trading Posts in Africa and Asia
Certain regions of East and West Africa were the targets of European conquest 
during the late 15th century. Portuguese ruler Prince Henry the Navigator was 
keenly interested in navigational technology. See Topic .2. He financed 
expeditions along Africa’s Atlantic Coast and around the Cape of Good Hope, 
exploring African coastal communities before other European powers. 
With the cooperation of local rulers, first Portuguese and then other 
European traders set up trading posts along Africa’s coasts. Some local rulers 
traded enslaved people to the Europeans in exchange for gunpowder and 
cannons, giving those coastal governments a military advantage when battling 
neighboring villages. Some African city-states grew wealthy by selling 
enslaved Africans to Europeans. In particular, the .ingdom of Dahomey grew 
stronger because it raided other villages to enslave people, and sold them to 
European merchants. 
African States  In central West Africa, Portuguese explorers, traders, and 
missionaries made inroads into the .ongo and Benin kingdoms. Artwork from 
these societies bears signs of European as well as African cultural influences. As 
early as the 16th century, Benin artisans incorporated images of the European 
“intruder” into their carvings and sculptures. Yet the expansion of maritime 
trading networks supported the growth of some African states, including the 
Asante  Empire and the Kingdom of the Kongo . Their participation in trade 
led to an increase in their influence.
In 18, Portuguese explorer 9asco da Gama see Topic .1 invaded the 
Swahili city-states of East Africa, most of which were thriving commercial 
centers in the Indian Ocean trade. The Portuguese took over trade in .ilwa, 
Mombasa, and other city-states by sending heavily armed ships and building 
fortresses. This takeover threw the region into a devastating decline.
Japan  Just as European states were expanding their trade networks, Japan 
was sharply restricting its networks. Japan had tolerated the first Portuguese 
and Dutch traders and missionaries in the mid-16th century. Thousands of 
Japanese converted to Christianity. Some Christians, intolerant of other faiths, 
destroyed Buddhist shrines. In response, in 158, the Japanese government 
banned Christian worship services. Over the next 0 years, Japan took 
additional steps to persecute Christians and limit foreign influences. By 
the 160s, the government had expelled nearly all foreigners, banned most 
foreign books, and prohibited Japanese people from traveling ab road. 
For more than two centuries, Japan was partially isolated from the rest of 
the world. They allowed some Dutch merchants to live on a small island in 
Nagasaki harbor, in almost total seclusion. In addition, Japan continued some 
trade with the Chinese, mostly carried out by regional lords who were far from 
the capital city with easy access by sea to .orea, Taiwan, and Okinawa. The 
Japanese thought that they were through with the “uncouth” Europeans. 
However, Europeans and Americans would return in the mid-1th century.
China  After the voyages of =heng He in the 15th century, the Ming 
220 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONDynasty  tried to limit outside influence on China by restricting trade. The 
Ming prohibited private foreign trade, destroyed some dockyards, limited 
the size of ships that could be built, and began reconstructing the Great Wall. 
These changes were part of a broader pattern of conservatism under the Ming 
to undo the influence of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty that ruled China before 
them. For example, the Ming reemphasized the importance of Confucianism 
and reinvigorated the traditional exam system. Many of the limits on trade 
were eventually reversed, and China resumed its important role in global trade. 
European Rivalries on Five Continents
European rivalries fueled by political, economic, and religious motives  shaped 
the expansion of empires. Several powers established trading posts in India: 
• The British East India Company had begun a commercial relationship 
with the Mughal Empire in the 1th century. 
• Portugal controlled a coastal trading post in the southwestern state of 
Goa.
• France controlled Pondicherry, a city in the southeastern state of Tamil 
Nadu. 
During the mid-18th century, France and Great Britain, along with their 
respective allies, competed for power on five continents in the Seven Years’ 
War. Britain’s victory in that war in 16 drove the French out of India. The 
Portuguese remained in India until driven out in the mid-20th century .
British in India  At first, British trading posts in India were typical of those 
established by Europeans in India and elsewhere. The East India Company 
EIC established small forts on the coasts that focused solely on making a 
profit through trade. Limited by the power of India’s Mughal Empire, the EIC 
posts controlled very little territory.
However, the EIC then began to expand. It took advantage of the tensions 
between Muslims and Hindus in India and began to increase its political power 
through treaties with local rulers. With the help of European-trained Indian 
private forces called sepoys, the East India Company moved inland, spreading 
its influence. Ultimately, Britain intervened in India politically and militarily 
to such an extent that it controlled much of the subcontinent.
The British Global Network  The British also set up trading posts in West 
Africa, where the Asante Empire limited their impact. Trading posts in Africa, 
India, and elsewhere paved the way for globalization. Each post became a node, 
an intersection of multiple points serving as a trade center for goods from many 
parts of the world.
Europeans in the Americas
Before the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century, the Aztec Empire  in 
Mexico and the Inca Empire  in South America each included 10 million to 15 
million people. However, the spread of European diseases caused their populations 
to plummet. Both empires collapsed quickly when attacked by Spa nish forces.
221 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS In Mexico, helped by groups that the Aztecs had conquered, Cortps’s forces 
overthrew the Aztec by 1521 and established the colony of New Spain . The 
Spaniards melted down the Aztecs’ treasures and sent the gold back home. They 
destroyed Tenochtitlin and built their own capital, Mexico City , on its ruins.
In the Andes of South America, Francisco Pizarro  and his crew attacked 
the Inca and captured their ruler, Atahualpa . Pizarro offered to release 
Atahualpa if the Inca would fill a large room with gold. The Inca complied. 
However, in 15 the Spanish killed Atahualpa anyway. By 152, the Spaniards 
had completed their conquest of the Inca Empire.
Spain Versus Portugal  In the Treaty of Tordesillas  of 1, Spain and 
Portugal divided the Americas between them. Spain reserved all lands to the 
west of a meridian that went through eastern South America. Portugal reserved 
all lands east of this line. This arrangement put Brazil under Portugal’s rule, 
while Spain claimed the rest of the Americas .

222 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn addition to establishing colonies in Mesoamerica and South America, 
Spain explored other parts of North America north of present-day Mexico. The 
explorer Pedro Menpndez de Avilps established a fort in St. Augustine on the 
east coast of Florida in 1565, which became the oldest continuous settlement 
in what later became the United States. Spain would not be able to control all 
of North America, however, because the French, British, and Dutch later made 
claims and settlements there.
France Versus Britain  France and Britain continued to vie for dominance 
in North America. As British settlers moved into former Dutch territory in 
upper New York, they began to form ties with the powerful Iroquois, who had 
been in conflict with the French over trade issues for decades. The British 
hoped that the Iroquois could frustrate French trade interests. Over time, the 
Iroquois began to realize that the British posed more of a threat than the French. 
In a shift of alliances, the Iroquois and French signed a peace treaty known as 
the Great Peace of Montreal in 101. In the same war in which Britain drove 
France out of India, the British drove France out of Canada as well. The North  
American portion of this war is sometimes called the French and Indian War. 
Continuity and Change in Economic Systems
Although the intensification of trade and the increasing influence of Europeans 
brought some disruption to the Indian Ocean trading networks, on the whole, 
the system absorbed the changes and continued its familiar ways of doing 
business. Merchants in the Indian Ocean networks were used to paying taxes 
and fees to states controlling sea lanes and ports and operated often through

223 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS religious and ethnic ties. They did not use arms to protect their trade, and if the 
fees in one trading center became too high, they were free to move elsewhere. 
Europeans in the Indian Ocean Trade  The Portuguese, however, 
arrived with superior naval forces, religious zeal, and a determination to profit 
from the increasingly diverse products being traded, both from Asia to Europe 
and also within Asia. In addition to porcelain and silk from China, cloth from 
Gujarati weavers in western India, agricultural goods from Java, and spices 
from many places created an abundant market for trade and profit. In contrast 
to the ethnic and religious trading ties developed over hundreds of years, the 
Portuguese used their military superiority to take control of trade, creating a 
string of armed trading posts along the trade routes of the Indian Ocean. In 
150, for example, the Portuguese had a decisive victory in the Battle of Diu  in 
the Arabian Sea over the combined forces of Gujaratis, the Mamluks of Egypt, 
and the =amorin of Calicut with the support of 9enice, Portugal’s European 
competitor.  
Despite the differences between the traditional trading networks and those 
controlled by European powers, merchants in the Indian Ocean trade networks 
continued as before in many ways²paying for the right to use certain ports or 
passageways and developing trade links through traditional networks. 
Spain and Gold in the Americas  The Western European search for profit 
began with Columbus. On his first voyage, he was convinced that gold was 
plentiful on Hispaniola , the name he gave the island now occupied by Haiti 
and the Dominican Republic. But gold was sparse in the Caribbean. Desiring 
to return home with something valuable, Columbus and his crew kidnapped 
Tainos, indigenous peoples, and took them, enslaved, to Spain. 
In the early 1500s, the Spanish established a system called the encomienda  
to gain access to gold and other resources of the Americas. Encomenderos , or 
landowners, compelled indigenous people to work for them in exchange for 
food and shelter, as landowners required of serfs in Europe’s manorial system. 
This coercive labor system was notorious for its brutality. 
The Spanish crown often granted land to conquistadores  as a reward 
for their efforts. The  hacienda system  arose when landowners developed 
agriculture on their lands²wheat, fruit, vegetables, and sugar. They used 
coerced labor to work the fields. Most conquistadores were men and many had 
children with native women. This made the Spanish colonies unlike British 
colonies. 
Silver  While gold did not yield riches for Spanish conquistadores, the 
discovery of silver  in Mexico and Peru revived economic fortunes²for both 
individual explorers and Spain. The use of mercury to separate silver from 
its ore increased the profitability of silver mining. By the end of the 16th 
century, the cities of =acatecas, in Mexico, and especially Potost, in the Andes 
Mountains in modern-day Bolivia, became thriving centers of silver mining. 
For this industry to flourish, Spanish prospectors needed labor. The 
indigenous populations would do all but the most dangerous work in the 
mines. In response, Spanish authorities in Peru transformed the traditional 
224 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIncan mit’a system of labor obligation, in which young men were required to 
devote a certain amount of labor to public works projects, into a coerced labor 
system. 9illages were compelled to send a percentage of their male population 
to do the dangerous work in the mines for a paltry wage.
Silver and Mercantilism  The silver trade not only made individual 
Spanish prospectors wealthy, it also strengthened the Spanish economy. 
European powers at the time were adopting mercantilism , an economic 
system that increased government control of the economy through high tariffs 
and the establishment of colonies , claimed lands settled by immigrants from 
the home country. In the case of Spain, the main purpose of the colonies in the 
Americas was to supply as much gold and silver as possible. 
Another way to increase national wealth, according to the mercantilist 
system, was for a colonizing country to export more than it imported. A 
percentage of overseas silver production went directly to the Spanish crown. 
The empire used this wealth to build up the military and establish foreign trade.

225 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS During this era, Europeans sought sources of inexpensive labor in the 
Americas. Western European countries such as Portugal, Spain, and England 
were developing their naval technology, but Portugal was ahead of the others. 
In West Africa during the latter part of the 100s, Portuguese trading fleets 
arrived in the .ingdom of the .ongo seeking enslaved people. Initially they 
took the enslaved Africans back to Europe to work as domestic servants. 
Slavery existed in Africa²including the extensive enslavement of 
women as household workers²well before Europeans sought labor for 
their investments in the Americas. For example, in many societies, the entire 
community shared the land. In order to establish positions of wealth and power, 
individuals not only showcased the property they owned, but also showcased 
the enslaved people they owned. 
Europeans were also not the first foreigners to seek out African labor. Arab 
merchants during the Postclassical Era 600±150 often bought enslaved 
people during their travels to the Swahili Coast of East Africa. However, it 
was the Atlantic slave trade that wreaked the most havoc on African societies. 
Connect: Compose a graphic organizer comparing slavery during Sub-Saharan 
Africa’s early colonial period with slavery from 600 to 150. See Topic 2..  
Why Africans?  Several factors converged to make Africa a target for slave 
raids by Europeans after 150. Slavery in Latin America and the Caribbean 
began toward the end of the 16th century, when European conquistadores 
sought fortunes in gold, silver, and sugar. Land was plentiful, but labor to make 
the land profitable was scarce.
Europeans initially forced indigenous people to do the hard labor of mining 
and farming, but European diseases wiped out large portions of these coerced 
laborers. The enslaved indigenous people who survived often escaped bondage 
because, compared to Europeans, they were more familiar with the territory, 
had social networks that could protect them, and could easily camouflage 
themselves within the native population. Repeated efforts to enslave Native 
Americans failed, although other efforts to coerce labor did have some success.
Labor for Plantations  In North America, plantation owners recruited 
European indentured servants  who would come to work, mostly to grow 
tobacco, for a specified period in exchange for passage, room, and board. 
However, most of these people were not used to the backbreaking agricultural 
working conditions and the climate of the Americas. In addition, indentured 
servants were required to work for only about seven years. If they survived 
their indenture, they became free laborers. Thus, landowners did not think of 
indigenous captives and European indentured servants as ideal workers.
Transport of Enslaved Africans to the Americas  Capturing Africans 
for slavery was invariably violent. When African leaders along the coast 
realized that their kingdoms could economically benefit from the slave trade, 
they invaded neighboring societies in a quest for enslaved people to take back 
to the coast. At times, African rulers were also willing to hand over individuals 
from the lower rungs of their own societies, such as prisoners of war, servants, 
or criminals. 
226 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONHowever, .ing Afonso of .ongo understood that slave raids were not 
easily controllable. Though he had initially allowed slave trading in his 
kingdom, he had no intention of giving up his society’s elite to slavery, nor did 
he want .ongo to be depopulated. .ing Afonso also saw that his authority 
was undermined because his subjects were able to trade enslaved people for 
European goods without his involvement. Before the Europeans came, he had 
been able to control all trade in his domain.
The Horrors of the Journey  Captive Africans, swept away from their 
families, were taken to holding pens in West Africa known as barracoons, or 
“slave castles.” The modern country of Ghana has preserved these “Points of 
No Return,” where thousands upon thousands of Africans saw their homeland 
for the last time. Today, people can visit one such holding prison²the so-called 
House of Slaves on Ile de Gorpe Gorpe Island, on the coast of Senegal.
From these holding pens, slave traders next crammed their captives into 
the dank cargo section of a ship, providing them little water, food, or even 
room for movement. The grueling journey across the Atlantic was known as 
the Middle Passage , because it was the middle part of the captives’ journey. 
Many captured Africans attempted rebellions at sea, but most uprisings were 
crushed.  
During the journey to the Americas, which usually took about six weeks, 
up to half of a ship’s captives might die. Over the hundreds of years of the 
Atlantic slave trade, from the early 1500s to the mid-1th century, 10 to 
15 percent of all African captives perished before reaching the Americas.

Demographic, Social, and Cultural Changes  The growth of the 
planation economy and the expansion of slavery in the Americas led to 
significant changes that affected not only countless individual lives but also 
broad patterns of history. The physical migration of captives had significant 
impact on the demographics of both their African homes and the countries of 
their captivity. The exportation of enslaved people that was required to keep 
the population continuing in the country of captivity caused a century-long 
decline in population in African home countries. 
In addition to physical migration, slavery resulted in a migration of status, 
from free person to enslaved, setting up social classes that remain influential 
in post-slavery countries. Further, it disrupted family organization, since 
families were often separated, and more men than women were taken captive. 
Polygyny having more than one wife became more common. With people 
treated as commodities, as chattel slavery, social and family groupings were 
determined more by supply and demand than by the familial bonds of kinship. 
Each region in which slavery was introduced was affected in a unique 
way. However, in all of them, people with African roots helped shape and 
enrich the language and culture of the societies into which they were brought. 
The mixing of ethnic groups resulted in new groups of multiracial people, 
such as mestizos and mulattos.
The Indian Ocean Slave Trade  While most Africans who were enslaved 
and transported to the Americas came from west and central Africa, there 
was a long-running slave trade in the eastern part of the continent. By routes 
overland or in the Indian Ocean, enslaved East Africans were sold to buyers 
in northern Africa, the Middle East, and India. Many were transported to 
the islands off the southeast coast of Africa, such as Madagascar. The trade 
reached its peak in the 18th and 1th centuries.
228 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEnslaved people taken in the Indian Ocean trade suffered different fates 
from those taken across the Atlantic. People from the Indian Ocean region 
were more likely to work in seaports as laborers in the shipping industry and 
as household servants. Some worked as sailors or even soldiers. Living in 
towns or cities, they had some opportunity to develop communities and to 
work alongside free laborers. Those who ended up in Islamic communities 
had certain rights, such as the right to marry. As a result of the Indian Ocean 
slave trade, African words, musical styles, and customs can be found in Oman, 
India, and elsewhere.

“The widespread use of slavery was a systematic Spanish adaptation on 
the north Mexican frontier wherever nomadic Indians were encountered. 
Almost at the very moment that the New Laws 152 made slavery illegal 
in Mesoamerican Mexico, the Mixtyn War 151-152 in Nueva Galicia 
provided the initial reason for retaining the practice legally on the frontier 
for generations. The discovery of silver at =acatecas sealed the fate of 
Spanish-Indian relations not only on the Gran Chichimeca, but throughout 
most of the North. The inevitable resistance by hunter-gatherers to Spanish 
domination, the shortage of labor, and the semiautonomous political power 
wielded by provincial and local authorities insured the survival of slavery and 
encomienda in northern New Spain into the eighteenth century.”

231 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS THINK AS A HISTORIAN:   PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE  IN PRIMAR Y 
SOURCES
One way to determine the accuracy of historical sources is to identify 
their purpose. However, their stated purpose is not necessarily their 
real purpose. Identifying their intended audience can help pin down the 
purpose of sources. 
Spanish historian, reformer, and later Dominican Friar Bartolomp de 
las Casas c. 18±1566 wrote what he referred to as eyewitness accounts 
of the suffering the Spaniards inflicted on the indigenous people. The 
following passage is from A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies  
published in Seville in 1552. Las Casas had used his observations to help 
pass the so-called New Laws in 152, which outlawed forcing indigenous 
people into slavery and attempted to ban the system of encomienda.
“In the Year 150, the Spaniards sailed to the Islands of St. John 
and Jamaica . . . with the same purpose and design they proposed 
to themselves in the Isle of Hispaniola, perpetrating innumerable 
Robberies and 9illanies as before whereunto they added unheard 
of Cruelties . . . . and Finally by afflicting and harassing them with 
un-exampled Oppressions and torments in the Mines, they spoiled and 
unpeopled this Contrey >country@ of these Innocents. These two Isles 
containing six hundred thousand at least, though at this day there are 
scarce two hundred men to be found in either of them, the remainder 
perishing without the knowledge of Christian Faith or Sacrament.”
Answer the following questions to help understand how the inten ded 
audience can reveal an author’s purpose. 
1. For what audience did Las Casas write these accounts" What does 
that audience suggest about his purpose for writing" 
2. Suppose these accounts had been written by a visitor from a 
competing European power eager to remove the Spanish from 
the Americas and take over the land for itself. What might be that 
author’s audience and purpose"
3. Read the historical perspectives on the brutality of the Spanis h on 
page 265. Then in a sentence or two explain the role of identifying 
purpose and audience in determining the accuracy of a historical 
source, referring to specific examples from that page.

—Charter, Dutch East India Company, 1602
Essential Question:   What economic strategies did maritime empires use 
to increase their power, and how did the developing 
empires affect political, economic,  religious,  and 
cultural dynamics?
Maritime sea-based empires transformed commerce from local, small-
scale trading, mostly based on barter, to large-scale international trade using 
gold and silver. These empires employed new economic models, such as joint-
stock companies, through which investors financed trade by buying shares in 
corporations such as the East India Company, supporting increased trade in 
Asia. New ocean trade routes were opened, aiding the rise of this extended 
global economy. The Atlantic trading system involved the movement of 
labor²including enslaved people²and the mixing of African, American, 
and European cultures and peoples, with all groups contributing to a cultural 
synthesis. Silver, sugar, and slavery were the keys to the development of these 
mercantilist empires.
Economic Strategies
In the 1th century, Europeans generally measured the wealth of a country in 
how much gold and silver it had in its coffers. To achieve this wealth, countries 
used economic strategies designed to sell as many goods as they could to other 
countries in order to obtain maximum amounts of gold and silver. To keep 
their wealth, countries would also spend as little of their precious metals as 
possible on goods from other countries. 
The accumulation of capital , material wealth available to produce more 
wealth, in Western Europe grew as entrepreneurs entered long-distance 
markets. Capital changed hands from entrepreneurs to laborers, putting 
laborers in a better position to become consumers²and even investors, as the 
above quote suggests. Despite restrictions by the Church, lending money at 
high rates of interest became commonplace. Actual wealth also increased with 
gold and silver from the Western Hemisphere.
233 MARITIME EM PIRES DEVELOPCommercial Revolution   
The transformation to a trade-based economy using gold and silver is known as 
the Commercial Revolution . The Commercial Revolution affected all regions 
of the world and resulted from four key factors: the development of European 
overseas colonies the opening of new ocean trade routes population growth 
and inflation, caused partly by the pressure of the increasing population and 
partly by the increased amount of gold and silver that was mined and put in 
circulation. The high rate of inflation, or general rise in prices, in the 16th and 
early 1th century is called the Price Revolution .
Aiding the rise of this extended global economy was the formation of 
joint-stock companies , owned by investors who bought stock or shares in 
them. People invested capital in such companies and shared both the profits 
and the risks of exploration and trading ventures. Offering limited liability , 
the principle that an investor was not responsible for a company’s debts or 
other liabilities beyond the amount of an investment, made investing safer .  
The developing European middle class had capital to invest from 
successful businesses in their home countries. They also had money with which 
to purchase imported luxuries. The Dutch, English, and French all developed 
joint-stock companies in the 1th century, including the British  East India 
Company  in 1600 and the Dutch East India Company  in 1602. In Spain and 
Portugal, however, the government did most of the investing itself through 
grants to certain explorers. Joint-stock companies were a driving force behind 
the development of maritime empires as they allowed continued exploration 
as well as ventures to colonize and develop the resources of distant lands with 
limited risk to investors. 
Commerce and Finance  The Dutch were long the commercial 
middlemen of Europe, having set up and maintained trade routes to Latin 
America, North America, South Africa, and Indonesia. Dutch ships were faster 
and lighter than those of their 
rivals for most of the 1th 
century, giving them an early 
trade advantage. The Dutch  
East India Company was also 
highly successful as a joint-stock 
company. It made enormous 
profits in the Spice Islands and 
Southeast Asia.

234 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONPioneers in finance, the Dutch had a stock exchange as early as 1602.  
By 160, the Bank of Amsterdam traded currency internationally. The Dutch 
standard of living was the highest in Europe as such goods as diamonds, 
linen, pottery, and tulip bulbs passed through the hands of Dutch traders.
France and England were not so fortunate. Early in the 18th century, both 
fell victim to speculative financial schemes. .nown as financial bubbles, the 
schemes were based on the sale of shares to investors who were promised a 
certain return on their investment. After a frenzy of buying that drove up the 
price of shares, the bubble burst and investors lost huge amounts of money, 
sending many into bankruptcy and inflicting wide damage to the economy .
Triangular Trade  The Europeans’ desire for enslaved workers in the 
Americas coupled with Portugal’s “discovery” of West Africa meant that Africa 
became the source for new labor. Enslaved Africans became part of a complex 
Atlantic trading system known as the triangular trade , because voyages often 
had three segments. A ship might carry European manufactured goods such 
as firearms to West Africa, and from there transport enslaved Africans to the 
Americas, and then load up with sugar or tobacco to take to Europe. Sugar was 
the most profitable good from the Americas. By the 100s, Caribbean sugar 
production and rum made from sugar were financing fortunes in Britain, and 
to a lesser extent, in France and the Netherlands.

235 MARITIME EM PIRES DEVELOPRivalries for the Indian Ocean Trade
After Europeans stumbled on the Americas, trade over the Atlantic Ocean 
became significant. However, states continued to vie for control of trade 
routes on the Indian Ocean as well. The Portuguese soundly defeated a 
combined Muslim and 9enetian force in a naval battle in the Arabian Sea 
in 150 see Topic . over controlling trade. They met a different fate, 
though, when they tried to conquer Moroccan forces in a battle on land in 
158. 
Its coffers depleted after the victory, Morocco looked inland to capture 
the riches of the Songhai .ingdom, despite the prohibition of waging war on 
another Muslim state. With thousands of soldiers, camels, and horses, as well 
as eight cannons and other firearms, Moroccan forces traveled months to reach 
Songhai. In 150, in a battle near Gao, the Songhai²despite their greater 
number of fighters²were overcome by the force of firearms. The empire 
crumbled. The Spanish and Portuguese soon overtook much of this territory.
Change and Continuities in Trade Networks
The trading networks involved a new global circulation of goods, wealth, and 
labor. Silver from the Spanish colonies in the Americas flowed to Asia, where  
Asians were eager to exchange their goods²silks, porcelain, steel products²
for silver. Asian goods were eagerly purchased in the Atlantic markets. 
New Monopolies  One way these patterns of trade were maintained was 
through monopolies  chartered by European rulers. Monopolies granted certain 
merchants²usually through a joint-stock company²or the government itself 
the exclusive right to trade. For example, the Spanish government established 
a monopoly first over all the domestic tobacco grown and then over all the 
tobacco grown in its American colonies. The profits from this monopoly 
greatly enriched the Spanish government. The income from tobacco in Spain 
made up about one-third of total revenues. 
Ongoing Regional Markets  At the same time, traditional regional 
markets continued to flourish in Afro-Eurasia. However, improved shipping 
offered merchants the opportunity to increase their volume of products. The 
increasing output of peasant and artisan labor²wool and linen from Western 
Europe, cotton from India, and silk from China²exchanged hands in port 
cities with global connections.

The Atlantic slave trade greatly weakened several West African kingdoms, 
such as .ongo. The loss of so many people slowed population growth. Trade 
competition led to violence among their societies, but also made African 
slave-raiding kingdoms economically dependent on goods from Europe. 
Such societies were slow to develop more complex economies in which they 
produced their own goods. Thus, the slave trade set the stage for European 
conquest and imperialism of the late 1th century. See Topic 6.2.
236 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEconomically, African societies that conducted slave raids, such as the 
Dahomey  and the Oyo, became richer from selling their captives to Europeans. 
This trade also had political effects, because when a society such as the Dahomey 
exchanged enslaved people for guns, its raiders easily took advantage of rival 
societies that had no firearms. Without firearms, neighboring groups could not 
fight off  slave raids, so raiding societies became even richer and more fortified 
with firearms. Intergroup warfare thus became more common and bloodier as 
a result of the slave trade.
Slavery and Gender  Those most affected by the slave trade were the 
peoples and civilizations of West Africa in present-day Ghana and Benin, from 
which most Africans were kidnapped or sold. Gender distributions in those 
regions became severely imbalanced, because more than two-thirds of those 
taken were males. The resulting predominance of women prompted a rise in 
polygyny  the taking of more than one wife and forced women to assume 
duties that had traditionally been men’s jobs. 
Impact of New Foods  While the Atlantic trading system weakened 
Africa in many ways, it also ultimately spurred population growth through 
an improved diet. The Columbian Exchange introduced new crops to the 
continent, such as the American crops maize, peanuts, and manioc also known 
as yucca or cassava, which became staples in the African diet.
Political and Cultural Changes for Indigenous Peoples
Earlier land-based empires, such as those of the Romans, Muslims, and 
Mongols, all grappled with how to deal with conquered people’s traditions 
and cultures. These empires either allowed traditions to exist or they tried 
to graft their ways onto those of their subjects. European empires in the 
Americas stood in stark contrast to these land-based empires. The Spanish and 
Portuguese empires managed to erase the basic social structures and many of 
the cultural traditions of the indigenous Americans within a century of when 
the first European explorers arrived. Europeans’ actions nearly depopulated 
the Americas. 
Political Changes: Colonial Administration  Indigenous political 
structures in Latin America were soon replaced by Spanish and Portuguese 
colonial administrations. Spanish royalty appointed viceroys  to act as 
administrators and representatives of the Spanish crown. To keep these viceroys 
from operating independently of the crown, Spain established audiencias , or 
royal courts, to which Spanish settlers could appeal viceroys’ decisions or 
policies. Slow transportation and communication networks between Europe 
and the Americas, however, made it difficult for the Spanish crown to exercise 
direct control over New Spain. As a result, the Spanish throne did not focus on 
colonial affairs in the Western Hemisphere.
Cultural Changes  The indigenous peoples of the Americas lost a great 
deal of their culture and history at the hands of conquerors. Conquistadors, 
such as Cortps in Mexico, ordered the burning of native books, which were 
237 MARITIME EM PIRES DEVELOPthought to be unholy. Thus, very few original accounts written in Nahuatl, the 
language of the Aztec, exist today.
The scarcity of firsthand accounts from indigenous peoples has shaped 
how historians view this period. For example, because the Spanish burned 
nearly all Aztec documents, most of the information about the Aztec comes 
from documents that were written by Spanish conquistadores and priests after 
the conquest. The authors’ biases and lack of familiarity with Nahuatl limits 
the value of these sources. However, some sources are considered reliable. 
For example, in 155, a Spanish priest named Bernardino de Sahag~n began 
compiling the Florentine Codex, one of the most widely cited sources about 
Aztec life before conquest. A codex is a type of book.
Spanish and Portuguese conquerors transplanted their own languages and 
religion into the Americas. The remnants of this cultural interaction are present 
today. Although indigenous languages thrive in certain regions²in Guatemala 
and in the mountains of Mexico, for example²Spanish predominates through 
much of Latin America, and Brazilians overwhelmingly speak Portuguese.
By 150, those born in America of Spanish origin, or creoles , enjoyed 
political dominance in New Spain. They soon began clamoring for independence 
from the Spanish throne. Connect: Create a two-column chart comparing the

The increase and intensity of newly established global connections between  
hemispheres extended the reach of existing religions. In some areas, the new 
connections contributed to the development of syncretic belief systems and 
practices. In other areas, the connections contributed to religious conflicts. 
Syncretic Belief Systems in the Americas
African religions in the Americas provide powerful examples of religious 
syncretism,  or the combining of different religious beliefs and practices. 
Africans melded aspects of Christianity, usually Roman Catholicism, with 
their West African religious traditions, such as drumming, dancing, and a 
belief in spirits that could take over and act through a person:
• Santería means “the way of the saints.” Originally an African faith, it 
became popular in Cuba and then traveled throughout Latin America 
and to North America.
• Vodun means “spirit” or “deity.” This belief system originated with 
African peoples of Dahomey, .ongo, and Yoruba who were enslaved 
and living in Saint-Domingue, which is now Haiti.
• Candomblé means “dance to honor the gods.” It is a combination 
of Yoruba, Fon, and Bantu beliefs from different parts of Africa. It 
developed in Brazil.
238 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEnslaved Africans in the United States also laid the roots for the African 
American church, a hybrid of Christianity and African spiritual traditions that 
remains one of the oldest and most stable institutions in African American 
communities.
Islam  About 1 in 10 of the enslaved Africans practiced Islam. While some 
of the men who sailed with Columbus may have been Muslims, these enslaved 
Africans became the first significant presence of Islam in the Americas.
Religion in Latin America  Several Catholic religious orders in Europe, 
such as the Dominicans, Jesuits, and Franciscans, sent missionaries to Latin 
America to convert people to Christianity. The missionaries were so successful 
that today most Latin Americans are Roman Catholic Christians. In recent 
decades, Protestant denominations have begun to gain members. 
Numerous examples of religious syncretism originated in the Spanish 
colonies. Catholic saints’ days that coincided with days honored by indigenous 
people were especially celebrated. In Mexico, a cult developed around the 
dark-complexioned Virgin of Guadalupe , who was revered for her ability to 
perform miracles. 
Global Interactions and Religious Conflicts
Syncretic religions also developed in Afro-Eurasia as global interactions 
intensified. Sufism, for example, with its focus on personal salvation, helped 
spread Islam and may have influenced Sikhism, which blended Muslim and 
Hindu belief systems. The Mughal leader Akbar see Topic .2 tried to 
mediate conflicts between Muslims and Hindus under his control.
Religion also played a role in conflicts as global interactions increased. 
The split between Sunni and Shi’a Muslims worsened conflicts between the 
Ottoman and Safavid empires. See Topic .1. The split between Catholicism 
and Protestantism, and between official state religions such as Anglicanism 
and other Protestant sects, helped drive the settlement of North America as 
people sought freedom to worship as they saw fit.

—John Easton, A 5arrati]e of the *auses >hich 3ed to 7hilip’s 0ndian >ar , 1858
Essential Question:   How did the development of state power result in 
external and internal challenges in the period between 
1450 and 1750?
As empires developed and changed, many social, political, and economic 
groups resisted state expansion through a variety of challenges to state power. 
Some of these revolts occurred in the home of the empire. For example, the 
Fronde  civil disturbances in France between 168 and 165 attempted to curb 
growing royal power. 
Other disturbances took place within colonies. For instance, Metacom’s 
War  165±168, also called .ing Philip’s War, was in part a result of English 
colonists using underhanded tactics such as that described in the quote above 
in their continuing pressure to control Native American lands. Several powers 
sought to create empires in the 16th and 1th centuries. They fought with one 
another and with indigenous peoples. 
Resistance to Portugal in Africa
By the 1th century, the Dutch and the English had pushed the Portuguese out 
of South Asia. See Topic 1.. The Portuguese looked to Africa, where it had 
carried out slave raids since the 15th century, to build a colony. In 162, Ana 
Nzinga  became ruler of Ndongo  in south-central Africa present-day Angola. 
In addition to the slave raids by Portugal, other African peoples were attacking 
Ndongo. In exchange for protection from neighboring powers and an end to 
Portugal’s raids, Nzinga became an ally of Portugal. Nzinga was baptized 
as Christian, with the governor of the Portuguese colony as her godfather. 
However, the alliance broke down. Nzinga and her people fled west, taking 
over the state of Matamba . She then incited a rebellion in Ndongo, allied 
with the Dutch, and offered freedom in Matamba to enslaved Africans. Nzinga 
ruled for decades, building Matamba into an economically strong state.
244 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONLocal Resistance in Russia
In contrast to the Portuguese empire, pressures on state power came from 
within Russia, not outside of it. While conditions had improved for serfs see 
Topic 1.6 in Western Europe by the 1th century, the same was not true for the 
serfs in Russia. Wars during the 1th and 15th centuries weakened the central 
government and increased the power of the nobility. 
As demand for grain increased, nobles imposed harsh conditions on 
serfs. But Russian serfs had long been oppressed. First the Mongols and later 
the Russian princes collected heavy tribute and taxes for services such as 
protection or to support the government’s army from the peasants. As a result, 
the peasants’ debts increased, and over time more peasants lost their lands and 
were forced into serfdom. 
Serfdom, Power, and Control  The practice of serfdom benefitted the 
government because it kept the peasants under control, regulated by the 
nobility. Serfdom also benefitted the landowners because it provided free 
labor. Although townspeople were also controlled and not permitted to move 
their businesses freely to other cities, the serfs were practically enslaved, their 
labor bought and sold along with the lands of their owners.
As Russian territory expanded west to the Baltic and east to Siberia, the 
institution of serfdom expanded with it. An agricultural state, Russia kept serfs 
tied to the land long after the practice had ended, practically if not legally, in

245 INTERNA L AND EXTERNA L CHALLENGES TO STATE POWER 245Western Europe. For example, Elizabeth I freed the last remaining serfs in 
England in 15. In contrast, a law of 16 chained Russian serfs to the lands 
where they were born and ensured their service to their landlords, who could 
buy and sell them and administer punishments. The village communes, called 
mirs, also controlled even the small landholders among the peasants. 
Cossacks and Peasant Rebellions  Southwest of Moscow, near the Black 
Sea, peasants who were skilled fighters lived on the grassy, treeless steppes . 
Many were runaway serfs who lived in small groups, influenced by the ways 
of the neighboring nomadic descendants of the Mongols. These fierce Cossack 
warriors were sometimes at odds with the central, autocratic government of 
the tsars. However, these fiercely independent warriors could also be hired as 
mercenaries to defend “Mother Russia” against Swedish, Tartar, and Ottoman 
forces. The Cossacks were thus important in Russia’s expansion to the Ural 
Mountains and farther east into Siberia.
A Cossack known as Yemelyan Pugachev  began a peasant rebellion 
against Catherine the Great in 1 for giving the nobility power over the serfs 
on their lands in exchange for political loyalty, leaving the peasants without ties 
or recourse to the state. Falsely claiming to be Catherine’s murdered husband, 
Peter III, Pugachev gathered a following of discontented peasants, people 
from different ethnic groups, and fellow Cossacks. At one point, these groups 
controlled the territory between the 9 olga River and the Urals. Within a year, 
though, the Russian army captured Pugachev and the Russian government 
executed him. The Pugachev Rebellion  caused Catherine to increase her 
oppression of the peasants in return for the support of the nobles to help her 
avoid future revolts.
Rebellion in South Asia
In the 16th and 1th centuries, the Mughal empire controlled much of what is 
now India and Pakistan. See Topic .1. The Mughals centralized government 
and spread Persian art and culture as well as Islam. However, much of the 
population remained Hindu. The Maratha²a Hindu warrior group²fought 
the Mughals in a series of battles from 1680±10. They created the Hindu 
Maratha Empire.  It lasted until 1818, effectively ending the Mughal rule of 
India.
Revolts in the Spanish Empire 
Spain also experienced rebellions within its territories. The Pueblo Revolt  
took place in 1680 against the Spanish in what is now New Mexico. The 
Pueblo and Apache, two indigenous groups, fought colonizers who were 
trying to force religious conversions. The indigenous people killed about 00 
Spaniards, drove the rest out of the area, and destroyed churches. The Spanish 
reconquered the area in 162.
246 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONStruggles for Power in England and Its Colonies
Although Spain colonized much of the Caribbean, England’s power there 
grew stronger. England defeated Spanish colonists and took control of much 
of Jamaica in 1655. Enslaved people in the Caribbean and former Spanish 
territories in the Americas fought to gain freedom in what were known as 
Maroon wars 128±10 and 15±16. 
Maroons were descendants of Africas who had escaped slavery in Jamaica. 
They escaped their owners and formed independent settlements. Queen 
Nanny , herself had escaped slavery, united all the maroons of the island. 
Jamaicans later recognized her as a national hero.
Slave revolts were common in the Americas, especially in those locations 
where enslaved Africans outnumbered free Europeans. The first recorded slave 
revolt in what is now the United States was the Gloucester County Rebellion  
in 9irginia in 166. In this rebellion, enslaved Africans and white indentured 
servants conspired together to demand their freedom from the governor. 
Authorities found out about their plot, ambushed them, and arrested them. 
Metacom’s War, discussed earlier in this topic, was the final major effort 
of the indigenous people to drive the British from New England. The war 
spread throughout New England and resulted in the destruction of 12 towns. 
Some Native American groups, including the Mohegan  and Pequot , sided 
with the English. Although Native American peoples continued to live in the 
region, the war ended with the subjugation of the Wampanoag people to the 
English colonists. 
Struggles for power took place within England as well. In 1685, James II  
became king. James was Catholic, and his anti-Protestant measures enraged 
many English people. A group of nobles invited William of Orange , who was 
James’s nephew and son-in-law, to invade England with an army and become 
the new king. He agreed, landing in England in 1688. James fled to France. In 
168, William and his wife Mary II  James’s daughter began their joint rule 
of England. Both William and Mary were Protestant, and the English throne 
remained in Protestant hands after that.
English people called this revolt the Glorious Revolution  or the Bloodless 
Revolution. It strengthened the power of Parliament, which passed a law 
forbidding Catholics to rule England. That revolution took place without much 
violence, but religious tensions continued in England and throughout much 
of the world. Connect: Create a graphic organizer of the rebellions that were

249 INTERNA L AND EXTERNA L CHALLENGES TO STATE POWER SHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 was one of the most significant events in New 
Mexico history. But 1680 was not the first time New Mexico’s Pueblos had 
attempted to rebel against the Spanish government. Beginning with the 
Acoma Revolt of 15, Spanish intolerance of Pueblo religious practices 
and a persistent abuse of Pueblo labor had prompted several revolts against 
the Spanish in the seventeenth century. These uprisings, however, were 
discovered and ruthlessly crushed before they could grow into broader 
action. . . . 
The Spanish remained at El Paso until 162. For a while it appeared that 
the revolt had indeed succeeded. Popay and the other Pueblo leaders began 
a systematic eradication of all signs of Christianity and Spanish material 
culture. Everyone was to bathe in a ritual which washed away any trace 
of baptism, and Christian marriages were invalidated until reconfirmed by 
native tradition. . . . 
But it was easier to order the eradication of all vestiges of the Spanish 
presence than to accomplish it. Many items of material culture which had 
been introduced by the Spanish²iron tools, sheep, cattle, and fruit trees, 
for example²had become an integral part of Pueblo life. A few individuals, 
deeply influenced by the teachings of the Franciscans, rescued and hid the 
sacred objects of their adopted religion to await the eventual return of the 
Spanish friars.”

Understanding the internal and external challenges to state power from 
150 to 150 requires understanding the broader context in which they 
developed. This understanding should go beyond simple identification, 
such as “The context in which internal and external challenges to state 
power took place was the widespread expansion of empires.” Instead, 
work to explain how or why the context specifically relates to the 
internal and external challenges to state power. That is, ask, “What 
specifically about the context sheds light on the challenges"” To answer 
that question, complete the following activities.
First, review the four features of the historical concept of em pire 
outlined on the last page of Topic .1. For each bullet point, explain 
in a sentence or two how that context relates to the internal o r  
external challenges to state power you read about in this topic . 
Next, copy the timeline on page 18 on separate paper, leaving 
plenty of room between dates. Then review this topic, adding into 
the timeline the rebellions, revolts, and wars that arose as ch allenges 
to state power. By situating these developments in a chronological 
context, you may discover additional explanations.

Changing Social Hierarchies
>e    order the said 1ews and 1ewesses of our kingdoms to depart and  
ne]er to return or come back to them or to any of them 
 —Ferdinand and Isabella, Edict of the Expulsion of the Jews, 1492
Essential Question:   How were social categories, roles, and practices 
maintained or changed from 1450 to 1750?
As societies faced rebellions from outside and within, social hierarchies 
began to develop and transform. In Europe, the treatment of Jews showed 
that majorities treated non-majority ethnic groups in different ways. Jews had 
been expelled from England 120, France 1, and, as stated above, Spain 
12. The Ottoman Empire, however, provided a safe haven for Jews fleeing 
discrimination in Europe.
Throughout the world, civilizations developed distinctive social hierarchies. 
Different groups²including royalty, nobility, landowners, scholars, and 
soldiers²sought power and influence. In some societies, merchants and 
artisans began to form a middle class. And peasants, serfs, poor people, and 
enslaved people often struggled to stay alive. 
Many states created policies that discriminated against some groups 
based on religion, ethnicity, or social class. For example, Huguenots²French 
Protestants in the predominantly Catholic country²suffered great persecution, 
and many fled to other European countries or to colonies. States also supported 
the formation of elite classes, including the boyars in Russia and the nobility in 
Europe. These elites both supported ruling power and challenged it.
Social Classes and Minorities in Gunpowder Empires
Tension between the military elite and absolutist rulers existed in three Islamic 
empires: the Ottoman Turkey, the Safavids Iran, and the Mughals India. 
They are called gunpowder empires because they succeeded militarily by using 
guns and cannons when they first became widely available. See Topic .1.
Ottoman Society  The Ottoman social system was built around a warrior 
aristocracy that soon began to compete for positions in the bureaucracy with 
the ulama , who were scholars and experts in Islamic law. Within the military, 
the Janissaries gained power and prestige. See Topic .2. Ultimately, the 
Janissaries tried to mount coups against the sultans. 
252 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONAs sultans became increasingly ineffective and incapable, strong advisors 
called viziers  gained influential positions in government, where they spoke for 
the sultan. However, the sultan still had considerable powers. These included 
timar,  a system in which the sultan granted land or tax revenues to those he 
favored. The sultan also used timar to reward soldiers and keep them loyal.
Treatment of Religious Minorities  One reason for the success of the 
Ottoman Empire was its relative tolerance toward Jews and Christians. After 
the Spanish monarch exiled Jews from his kingdom in 12, Sultan Mehmed 
II invited them to settle in Istanbul. Many did. Some Jews became court 
physicians and diplomats. Others contributed to the literary community and 
might have brought the printing press to the Ottoman Empire. While they 
were allowed to worship, they did not have full equality:
• They were permitted to live only in specified areas of the cities. 
• They paid a tax called a jizya that was required of all non-Muslims in 
the empire. 
• They could not hold top positions in the empire, which were reserved 
for Muslims. 
Religious Toleration in the Mughal Empire  The Mughal Empire in 
what is now India began in 1526. Probably its greatest emperor was Akbar 
the Great  ruled 1556±1605, remembered for his military successes and his 
administrative achievements. To help keep his huge, fractious empire together, 
Akbar, like Ottoman rulers, was tolerant of all religions. He ended the jizya 
tax. He gave grants of land and money to Hindus and Muslims, provided funds 
to build a Catholic church, and supported Sikhism. For more on Akbar’s 
religious toleration, see Topic ..
Women in the Ottoman Empire  Women also played social and political 
roles at court. Many wives and concubines of the sultan tried to promote 
their own children as likely heirs to the throne. This practice led to “harem 
politics,” a reference to the harem , a residence where a powerful man’s wives 
and concubines lived. 
One woman, Roxelana , became unusually powerful in the Ottoman 
Empire. When she was a young girl, Crimean raiders stole Roxelana from 
her home in Eastern Europe and sold her into slavery in the Ottoman Empire. 
She was forced to convert to Islam and entered the harem of Suleiman the 
Magnificent, sultan of the empire. Suleiman was notable for his military and 
administrative skill. Suleiman married Roxelana, which was highly unusual. 
She went from being enslaved to commissioning ambitious public works 
projects. 
Roxelana’s son succeeded Suleiman. During the son’s reign, viziers 
complained about a “sultanate of the women.” They believed members of the 
harem had too much influence on politics. Roxelana’s rise showed that it was 
possible²though rare²for people at this time to attain a different social class.Source : Titian, La Sultana Rossa,  c. 1550. John and Mable Ringling Museum

Roxelana became famous for her power as an Ottoman leader.
253 CHANGING SOCIA L HIERARC HIES253Other Social Classes  Merchants and artisans formed a small middle 
class in the empire. Below the middle class were the peasants, who were 
usually poor—particularly because they had to pay tribute to the government 
to help support the 
Ottoman armies. Below 
the peasants were the 
enslaved. They came from 
many areas as the Ottoman 
armies penetrated Central 
and Eastern Europe, 
capturing prisoners of war 
in Ukraine and elsewhere. 
Barbary pirates , those 
who plied the seas near 
North Africa along the

for the Berbers who 
lived there captured 
other Europeans in the 
Mediterranean and then

navy as enslaved galley 
workers. As many as

China’s Qing Dynasty  lasted from 16 until 112. Under this dynasty, the 
Manchu  people from Manchuria ruled over the majority Han Chinese and 
other ethnic groups. Like the Mongols some 00 years earlier, the Manchu 
were ethnically and culturally distinct from the people they ruled. However, 
they were less tolerant than the Mongol leaders, and they resolved to make 
their culture dominant in China. 
Like the Mongols, the Qing put their own people in the top positions of 
government. Also like the Mongols, the Qing maintained continuity with some 
traditional Chinese practices. For example, they maintained the Chinese civil 
service exams and bureaucracy. They recruited Han Chinese to work under or 
alongside Manchus. In time, some²but not all²Chinese came to accept the 
Qing Dynasty as legitimate rulers of China.

254 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONto wear Hanfu, or traditional Han clothing, all men were required to wear their 
hair in queues , the braided pigtail style of the Manchu. This policy was a test 
of loyalty for the Manchu, but it was also a humiliating reminder of the way 
Qing authority challenged traditional Confucian values. A man who refused to 
wear his hair in a queue could be executed. 
The Qing used Han Chinese defectors to carry out massacres against 
Han who refused to assimilate to Qing practices. These defectors played 
a massive role in the Qing conquest of China. Han Chinese General 
Li Chengdong , for example, orchestrated three separate massacres in the 
city of Jaiding within one month. By the end of those four weeks, there 
was hardly a person left alive in the city. Later, Han Chinese defector 
Liu Liangzuo  massacred the entire population of Jiangyin, killing between 
,000 and 100,000 people.
European Hierarchies
Like states in South and East Asia, European states also had a social 
hierarchy. In Europe the top level was royalty²members of a royal family. 
The aristocracy or nobility was the next highest level. Nobles were usually 
wealthy landowners. Nearly every state in Europe had laws that recognized 
a class of nobles and granted them special privileges. The nobility made up a 
small minority of the population but owned most of the land. They maintained 
their power through a system in which lands and titles passed down from one 
generation to the next through a system of inheritance.
The Nobility Makes Gains  In the Netherlands and England, the nobility 
held power and took an active part in the government. Dutch landowners 
provided the stable support for local provincial government. In England, large 
landowners controlled Parliament. However, the landowners had to contend 
with radical religious sects and the middle class, which were two growing 
segments of the social order.
The Nobility Faces Losses  Nobles struggled for power with royalty, the 
emerging middle class of merchants and skilled workers, the priestly class, and 
the common people. A failed uprising in France in the mid-1600s convinced 
Louis XIV  that he must keep power from the common people and the nobility. 
The nobility also faced criticism from writers and thinkers of the time. The 
English statesman Thomas More wrote this about the nobility: “Living in 
idleness and luxury without doing society any good no longer satisfies them 
they have to do positive evil.”
Power of Royalty over Nobility  Gunpowder, cannons, and other 
technological advances allowed rulers to destroy nobles’ fortresses and seize 
their lands. Many rulers believed they deserved absolute power. Louis ;I9 is 
famous for saying, “I am the state.” However, Frederick of Prussia saw things 
differently. He declared, “I am the first servant of the state.” (Connect: Trace 
the changes in social hierarchy from feudal Europe to the 1th century. See 
Topic 1.6.  
255 CHANGING SOCIA L HIERARC HIESGrowing Acceptance of Jews  Jews began to have a larger role in 
many countries starting in the 1th century. Their expulsion from Spain, by 
Ferdinand and Isabella, was particularly significant because so many Jews 
lived there. Many resettled in areas around the Mediterranean Sea, in northern 
Africa or the Middle East. Since the Hebrew word for Spain is Sepharad,  Jews 
who trace their heritage back to Spain became known as Sephardic Jews . In 
contrast, Jews from central and eastern Europe became known as Ashkenazi 
Jews . Jewish scholars once used the term Ashkenazi to refer to Germany. 
Under the influence of the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment, 
prejudices against Jews declined somewhat. Jews began to move more freely 
in Europe. They became particularly important in banking and commerce. 
The Netherlands was especially tolerant of religious dissent, and the Jewish 
minority faced less discrimination there than in most of Europe. Many Jews 
hoped the centuries of discrimination they had confronted were over . 
Russian Social Classes
Moscow
s social hierarchy continued that of .ievan Rus in the 11th century. 
The noble landowning class, the boyars , topped the social pyramid. Below 
them were the merchants. Last and most numerous were the peasants, who 
gradually sank into debt and. They became serfs,  peasants who received a plot 
of land and protection from a noble. In return, they were bound to that land 
and had little personal freedom. If the noble sold their land, control of the serfs 
went with it. Though not technically enslaved, serfs led very hard lives.
The boyar class experienced tensions with the rulers similar to the tensions 
between nobles and rulers in Western Europe. Boyars of Novgorod opposed the 
expansionist policies of Ivan IV , known as “Ivan the Terrible” for murdering 
his own son, among other crimes. After Ivan
s forces defeated Novgorod, Ivan 
confiscated the lands of his boyar opponents. He forced them and their families 
to move to Moscow, where he could keep them under surveillance.
Political and Economic Elites in the Americas
Social structures in the Americas changed drastically during this period 
because of the arrival of Europeans, the importation of African slave labor, and 
outbreaks of disease that killed tens of millions. The combination of European 
settlers, imported Africans, and the conquered indigenous populations led to 
the development of a new social hierarchy based on race and ancestry. Skin 
color became a signifier of power and status in many parts of the Americas 
and, in fact, in all European colonies. Racial and ethnic background defined 
social status in a formal way in the Spanish and Portuguese empires in the 
Western Hemisphere for centuries following the Europeans’ arrival. 
The Casta System in Latin America  At the top of the social pyramid 
in Latin America stood the peninsulares , those who were born on the Iberian 
peninsula. Next down the pyramid were the criollos , those of European

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“Nowadays, some 185 years after most of the Latin American nations 
obtained their independence, none of the Latin governments consider race 
to be an issue. All of these governments are firmly convinced that the racial 
caste system of colonial times has totally disappeared. This firmly held 
conviction is, however, not shared by academics and ordinary citizens who 
have noticed the distinct racial stratification of the Latin American societies. 
For these dissenters, the prevailing racial economic hierarchy and the easily 
uncovered attitudes that consider the dark-skinned unattractive and inferior 
clearly indicate that the racial caste system continues to operate.
Today’s racial caste system is, of course, not nearly as rigid as it was in 
colonial times. But the fact that it has survived 185 years of social, economic, 
and political advances implies that this system is deeply embedded in the 
Latin societies. Hence, it must have relevant social, economic, and political 
effects.”

Evidence in an argument can serve a variety of purposes. Its most common 
purpose is to support the claim at the heart of an argument. Specific facts 
or examples that demonstrate the truth of a more general assertion in the 
thesis fulfill this purpose. Evidence can also modify a claim by providing 
facts, examples, or reasoning that show that parts of the claim are true but 
that other parts are not. Evidence can also refute, or disprove, a claim. 
Evidence that serves this purpose provides facts, examples, or reasoning 
that support an alternative or opposing claim. 
Consider the claim in bold type below in this argument: When 
.ing Ferdinand expelled the Jews from Spain in 12, he provided for a 
three-month period for them to ready themselves for departure. The .ing 
promised that the state would “take and receive them under our Security, 
protection, and royal safeguard” and “that during the said time, no one 
shall harm them, nor injure them, no wrong shall be done to them against 
justice.” Although the King’s promises sound respectful of the Jews’ 
rights to safety, the very act of expulsion marked them as inferior 
and exposed them to relentless harms.  
The statements below are from an account written by an Italian Jew in 
15 Internet Jewish History Source Book. For each statement,  deter -
mine whether it could best be used to support, modify, or refute the claim

1. “ When the edict of expulsion became known. . .  vessels came 
from Genoa to the Spanish harbors to carry away the Jews. The 
crews of these vessels. . . acted maliciously and meanly toward 
the Jews, robbed them, and delivered some of them to the famous 
pirate of that time who was called the Corsair of Genoa. To those 
who escaped and arrived at Genoa the people of the city showed 
themselves merciless, and oppressed and robbed them, and the 
cruelty of their wicked hearts went so far that they took the i nfants

Essential Question:   How did economic developments from 1450 to 1750 
affect social structures  over time?
By 150, most of the world was integrated within a system of economic, 
political, and cultural connections. Better technology enabled the Eastern and 
Western hemispheres to connect. Meanwhile, Western European maritime 
powers created trading empires in the Indian Ocean trading network and in the 
Americas. Religions and other cultural practices continued to spread as a result 
of these interactions, but they also were transformed as new or syncretic forms 
developed. Coercive labor systems continued to exist in this newly connected 
world. However, new forms developed as new economic systems sought to 
exploit natural resources and to generate wealth for Western European nations.
Transoceanic Travel and Trade
The most significant change to the global economy in this period was the 
integration of the Western Hemisphere into the global trading network. This 
change resulted from Western European states wanting to find a sea route to 
Asia. They borrowed and developed technology that made ocean travel easier:
• astronomical charts
• astrolabe
• compass
• magnetic compass
• lateen sail 
• carrack
• caravel
• fluyt
262 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe result was the Columbian Exchange: a biological exchange of crops, 
animals, people, and diseases between the Eastern and Western Hemisphere. 
The Columbian Exchange had wide-ranging effects on both hemispheres.
The Atlantic System  The Columbian Exchange also caused the 
development of a transoceanic trading network called the Atlantic System. 
The Atlantic System was made up of the regions of Western Europe, Western 
Africa, and the Americas and involved the movement of goods and people 
among those regions. Columbian Exchange forever changed who grew what 
foods where and how they grew them. It also unleashed deadly diseases 
on populations that had no immunity to them. In addition, it led to massive 
migrations, many of them forced, and new social structures.
As people migrated or were forced to migrate within the Atlantic System, 
cultural changes occurred. For instance, religion spread and often created 
syncretic belief systems and practices.

Economic Changes
European transoceanic voyages resulted in the integration of the Western 
Hemisphere within the global trading network. This integration had profound 
effects on the global economy. Maritime trading empires emerged, led by the 
Portuguese and followed by the Dutch and the English. As a result, Europeans 
established trading ports and cities along the coasts of Africa and the Indian 
Ocean. This brought Europeans into contact²and often into conflict²with 
existing merchant networks. 
One consequence of this contact and conflict was that Europeans came to 
dominate global trade at the expense of Arab, Indian, and Chinese merchants.

deposits of silver in Spain’s colonies helped further integrate Europeans into 
the global economy. Asian markets and merchants, especially in China, desired 
silver. Shipments of silver to Asia from the Americas became a regular feature 
of the global trade network and helped finance the increasing volume of trade 
between Asia and Europe. Some experts estimate that the amount of silver in 
the global economy tripled in the 16th century.
Mercantilism and Capitalism  European rulers soon came to see the 
benefits of encouraging the expansion of trade, as the wealth that could be 
amassed was considerable. To ensure they participated in wealth accumulation 
from trade, many European monarchs devised mercantilist economic policies 
that would provide the ruler with a steady stream of income. While expanded 
international trade continued to be an important goal of European monarchs, 
mercantilism eventually gave way to capitalism as the predominant economic 
system in the new global economy. Investors formed joint-stock companies, 
also called chartered companies, so they could share the risks and rewards of 
global trading opportunities.

The new global flow of goods and profits produced some significant benefits. 
The flow of wealth into Europe helped to expand the middle class and provided 
the capital that would lead to the Industrial Revolution. However, the huge 
amounts of gold and silver flowing into Spain and China from the Americas 
also produced negative economic effects. In particular, the increase in the 
quantity of money in circulation caused inflation.

Europe, Africa, and Asia continued to prosper. Funding for the arts increased 
as merchants and governments used their rising profits and revenue to sponsor 
artists and authors. Some rulers used their sponsorship of the arts to produce 
art and architecture that helped to legitimize their rule. Other art symbolized 
the growing importance of global trade.

The new global economy also brought about significant disruptions. The 
Columbian Exchange and the Atlantic System caused a demographic 
shift in Africa as the Atlantic slave trade intensified. Slavers captured and 
sold millions of African men. These African men ended up on American 
plantations, producing cash crops that included sugar, cotton, and tobacco. 
As a result, some African communities experienced a gender imbalance. 
Africa’s population declined because of the Atlantic slave trade. Eventually, 
the population increased as people grew new crops, such as manioc.
Traditional forced labor systems, such as serfdom, continued in areas 
of Afro-Eurasia. However, other coerced labor systems developed in the 
Americas as a result of the Columbian Exchange and the Atlantic System, 
in addition to the chattel slavery of the Atlantic slave trade. Many European 
settlers first arrived in the Americas as indentured servants, contracted to work 
for a period of time before they were free to pursue other jobs or occupations. 
The encomienda and hacienda systems, as well as the adoption of the Inca 
mit’a system, are examples of other coerced labor systems in the Spanish 
American colonies. 
New Social Structures  As Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans 
coexisted in the new American colonies, the social structures of the Americas 
changed. New social systems appeared that were based on racial or ethnic 
identity. This division led to a rigid and hierarchial society, with white 
Europeans or Americans of European descent possessing the majority of wealth 
and political power. A new subculture appeared that consisted of people who 
were of mixed European and African heritage. Societal conflicts eventually led 
to revolutions.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   HOW HARSH WERE THE SPANIS H?
After the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, Spanish conquistadors 
created a vast colonial empire in the Americas. In 1552, the Dominican friar 
Bartolomp de Las Casas described the greed, ruthlessness, and cruelty that 
Spanish officials inflicted on native populations. Ever since, historians have 
debated the accuracy of his observations. 
Origins of the Black Legend  Writing in 11, Spanish historian 
Juliin Judertas labeled this belief in the evils of Spanish rule as the Black 
Legend. He argued that during the 16th and 1th centuries, other Europeans 
were jealous of Spanish wealth and power. As a result, they were prepared 
to believe the worst about Spain’s rule. Judertas suggested that historians 
focused so much on cruelty that they ignored the positive achievements of 
Spanish colonialism. 
Debating the Black Legend  Besides jealousy, another factor affecting 
how historians viewed Spain was religion. During the centuries of struggle 
between Protestants and Catholics, the Black Legend fit with the negative 
views many Protestants had toward Catholics. In the United States, where 
Protestants dominated the writing of history in the 1th century, acceptance 
of the Black Legend was common. 
In the first half of the 20th century, many Spanish historians shared the 
perspective of Judertas. Their works reflected the intense national pride that 
many Spaniards felt about their past. In defending Spanish colonization, 
they developed what their critics called a White Legend to counter the Black 
Legend. 
Emphasis on Reform  One American historian active in the debate over 
Spanish colonization was Lewis Hanke. He argued against the Black Legend 
by trying to show that Las Casas was just one of many Spanish reformers. 
Through the efforts of these reformers, Hanke argued, the Spanish empire 
was “one of the greatest attempts the world has seen to make Christian 
precepts >rules@ prevail in the relations between peoples.” 
Defenders of the Black Legend thought Hanke had exaggerated the 
strength of Las Casas and the reformers, thereby making the Spanish look 
better than they were. Others emphasized that despite any attempts at reform, 
what actually happened was extraordinarily harsh.
The Global Context  In recent years, historians taking a more global 
approach to history have compared colonial empires more systematically than 
did previous historians. While they have noted differences among Europeans 
in the Americas, they have found widespread examples of brutality. Whether 
the Spanish were any worse than other Europeans remains hard to determine.

After analyzing the task and developing questions you need to answer 
to complete it see page 18, the next step in writing a long essay 
is to gather and organize your evidence. Gathering evidence  relies 
on recall²how much you remember from your reading and other 
studies. Organizing evidence  requires the skills of seeing patterns and 
connections and using historical reasoning. 
Suppose you are answering this long essay question: “Develop an 
argument that evaluates the extent to which continuity or change over 
time characterized the participation of China in the expanding global 
trade networks from 150 to 150.” Gather the evidence by writing down 
everything you know about China’s role in global trade networks between 
150 and 150. Answer the questions you developed in the application 
activity on page 18. Your essay might include the following: 
• Emperor .angxi relaxed the limits on foreigners, opening 
Chinese ports to European merchants and missionaries.
• China exported silk, porcelain, spice, and tea and imported little.
• Confucian philosophy preferred farmers who produced food 
over merchants who transferred food from one person to 
another.
• Confucian philosophers respected the Jesuits.
• China regarded its culture as superior to those of other countries.
• With the Silk Roads and Indian Ocean trade networks pouring 
gold and silver into China for their goods, the Chinese felt 
wealthy and in no need of foreign commodities.
After writing everything you can remember, organize your evidence. 
Review your notes, looking for patterns related to the task. Which pieces 
of evidence represent a continuity" Which represent a change" Make a 
simple chart to place the evidence in the correct category. Then evaluate 
the extent to which change outweighed continuity or vice versa.

1. Farmers of all provinces are strictly forbidden to have in their possession 
any swords, short swords, spears, firearms, or other types of weapons. 
If unnecessary implements of war are kept, the collection of annual rent 
nengu may become more difficult, and without provocation >prompting@

against samurai who receive a grant of land kyu Ø nin must be brought to 
trial and punished. However, in that event, their wet and dry fields will 
remain unattended, and the samurai will lose their rights chigyo Ø  to the 
yields from the fields. Therefore, the heads of the provinces, samurai who 
receive a grant of land, and deputies must collect all the weapons described 
above and submit them to Hideyoshi’s government.
2. The swords and short swords collected in the above manner will not be 
wasted. They will be used as nails and bolts in the construction of the Great 
Image of Buddha. In this way the farmers will benefit not only in this life 
but also in the lives to come.
. If farmers possess only agriculture implements and devote themselves 
exclusively to cultivating the fields, they and their descendants will prosper. 
This compassionate concern for the well-being of the farms is the reason for

c. 1750 to c. 1900
Understand the Context
Between 1750 and 1900, people continued becoming more integrated into a 
global trade network. New technology, from machinery for spinning thread 
to locomotives to telegraphs to steel mills, fostered closer integration. The 
increased use of machinery in producing goods, a shift known as the Industrial 
Revolution, caused manufacturing output to skyrocket. It began in Great 
Britain and affected all of the world by 2000. The Industrial Revolution set the 
stage for dramatic changes in international relations, politics, and demography.
Foreign Power  As global trade increased, industrializing countries 
protected the access of their businesses to resources for manufacturing and 
to markets for selling goods by establishing control over overseas lands. 
However, these lands often rebelled against foreign domination. Among the 
first to rebel were the United States and Haiti in the 18th century .
A New Type of Country  Industrialization provided the background for 
reorganizing states. Before the 1800s, most people lived in large multi-ethnic 
empires or small homogenous kingdoms. After 1800, people increasingly 
lived in nation-states, a country in which everyone shared the same culture, 
and everyone who shared a culture lived in the same country. Breaking up 
empires and combining kingdoms to create nation-states frequently led to war.
Movements of People  Industrialization was also the context for massive 
human migrations. As demand for labor shifted, millions moved in search of 
work. For example, many Europeans voluntarily resettled in the Americas 
and Australia. South Asians were coerced into taking jobs in southern Africa. 
Millions of Africans were enslaved and taken forcibly to the Americas. These 
movements diversified communities across the world.

THE ENLIG HTENMENT 275
2755.1
The Enlightenment
Except our own thoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power.
—René Descartes (1596 -1650)
Essential Question:   How did the Enlightenment shape the intellectual and 
ideological thinRing that affected reform and revolution 
after 1750?
As empires expanded and trade routes led to more interactions, intellectuals 
in the 1th and 18th centuries such as Descartes began to emphasize reason 
over tradition and individualism over community values. These shifts were 
called the Enlightenment.  The ideals of this movement, such as individualism, 
freedom, and self-determination, challenged the roles of monarchs and church 
leaders and planted the seeds of revolution in the United States, France, and 
around the world.
An Age of New Ideas
Growing out of the Scientific Revolution and the humanism of the Renaissance, 
Enlightenment thought was optimistic. Many writers believed that applying 
reason to natural laws would result in progress. While not denying the existence 
of God, they emphasized human accomplishments in understanding the natural 
world. Such beliefs led to the conclusion that natural laws governed the social 
and political spheres as well. While traditional religion did not disappear, it 
became less pervasive.
New ideas emerged about how to improve society. Schools of thought 
including socialism  and liberalism  arose, giving rise to the period being called 
“the Age of Isms.” Opposing socialism and liberalism were the currents of 
conservatism , particularly popular among the European ruling class.  (All of 
these “isms” are defined later in this topic.
The clash between new ideas and old political structures led to revolutions 
that often had two aims: independence from imperial powers and constitutional 
representation. The breakup of empires and the emergence of new forms of 
government often followed. These developed out of the concept of nationalism , 
a feeling of intense loyalty to others who share one’s language and culture. The 
idea that people who share a culture should also live in an independent nation-
state threatened to destroy all of Europe’s multiethnic empires.
276 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONNew Ideas and Their Roots
In the 17th century, Francis Bacon  emphasized empirical methods of scientific 
inquiry. Empiricism  is the belief that knowledge comes from sensed  
experience, from what you observe through your experience, including through 
experiments. Rather than relying on reasoning about principles provided by 
tradition or religion, Bacon based his conclusions on his observation of natural 
data.
Hobbes and Locke  In the same century, philosophers Thomas Hobbes 
(author of Leviathan , 1651 and John Locke (author of Two Treatises of 
Government, 160  viewed political life as the result of a social contract . 
Hobbes argued that people’s natural state was to live in a bleak world in which 
life was “nasty, brutish, and short.” However, by agreeing to a social contract, 
they gave up some rights to a strong central government in return for law and 
order. 
Locke, on the other hand, argued that the social contract implied the right, 
even the responsibility, of citizens to revolt against unjust government. Locke 
thought that people had natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of property. 
Another of Locke’s influential ideas is found in  An Essay Concerning Human 
Understanding 160, in which he proposed that a child was born with a 
mind like a “blank slate” ( tabula rasa  waiting to be filled with knowledge. 
In a world in which most people believed that an individual’s intelligence, 
personality, and fate were heavily determined by their ancestry, Locke’s 
emphasis on environment and education in shaping people was radical.
The Philosophes  In the 18th century, a new group of thinkers and writers 
who came to be called the philosophes  explored social, political, and economic 
theories in new ways. In doing so, they popularized concepts that they felt 
followed rationally upon those of the scientific thinkers of the 1th century. 
Taking their name from the French word  philosophe “philosopher” , these 
writers included Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin  Franklin from America, 
Adam Smith from Scotland, and several French thinkers
Of particular importance to writers of the new constitutions in France and 
America in the 18th and 1th centuries were the ideas of Baron Montesquieu . 
His famous work The Spirit of Laws 18 praised the British government’s 
use of checks on power because it had a Parliament. Montesquieu thus 
influenced the American system, which adopted his ideas by separating its 
executive branch the president from its legislative branch Congress and 
both from its third branch the federal judiciary. 
Francois-Marie Arouet, pen name Voltaire , is perhaps best known for his 
social satire Candide  162. He was famous during his lifetime for his wit and 
for his advocacy of civil liberties. Exiled for three years due to a conflict with 
a member of the French aristocracy, V oltaire lived in England long enough 
to develop an appreciation for its constitutional monarchy and a regard for 
civil rights. He brought these ideas back to France, where he campaigned for 
277 THE ENLIG HTENMENTreligious liberty and judicial reform. His correspondence with heads of state 
such as Catherine the Great of Russia and Frederick the Great of Prussia and 
his extensive writings, including articles in Diderot’s Encyclopedia,  are still 
quoted today. His idea of religious liberty influenced the U.S. Constitution.
A contemporary of V oltaire was the writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau , who 
expanded on the idea of the social contract as it had passed down through the 
work of Hobbes and Locke. One of Rousseau’s early works was Emile, or On 
Education  162 in which he laid out his ideas on child-rearing and education. 
A later work, The Social Contract  162, presented the concept of the General 
Will of a population and the obligation of a sovereign to carry out that General 
Will. An optimist who believed that society could improve, Rousseau inspired 
many revolutionaries of the late 18th century.
Adam Smith  One of the most influential thinkers of the Enlightenment 
was Adam Smith . In his book The Wealth of Nations 16, Smith responded 
to mercantilism by calling for freer trade. While Smith did support some 
government regulations and saw the benefits of taxes, he generally advocated 
for laissez-faire, a 
French phrase for “leave 
alone.” This approach 
meant that governments 
should reduce their 
intervention in economic 
decisions. Smith believed 
that if businesses and 
consumers were allowed 
to make choices in 
their own interests, the 
“invisible hand” of the 
market would guide them 
to make choices beneficial 
for society. His ideas 
provided a foundation for 
capitalism,  an economic 
system in which the 
means of production,

Deism  The Enlightenment’s emphasis on reason led some thinkers 
to reexamine the relationship of humans to God. Some adopted Deism , the 
belief that a divinity simply set natural laws in motion. Deists compared the 
divinity to a watchmaker who makes a watch but does not interfere in its day-
to-day workings. Deists believed these laws could be best understood through

ideas, many Deists viewed regular church attendance as an important social 
obligation and a way people received moral guidance.

The Age of New Ideas Continues
In Europe and America, Enlightenment thinkers reacted to the social ills 
caused by increasing urbanization and industrialization. Poverty in the cities 
increased. Poor workers lived in slums without proper sanitation and without 
political representation. Various writers proposed solutions to the observable 
problems. Some wanted more government regulations and programs, and 
many Christians called for greater private charity. But some conservatives 
blamed the poor themselves and called on them to change. Conservatism is a 
belief in traditional institutions, favoring reliance on practical experience over 
ideological theories, such as that of human perfectability.
Utopian Socialism  The economic and political theory of socialism  refers 
to a system of public or direct worker ownership of the means of production 
such as the mills to make cloth or the machinery and land needed to mine 
coal. Various branches of socialism developed in the 19th century, providing 
alternative visions of the social and economic future. Those who felt that society 
could be channeled in positive directions by setting up ideal communities were 
often called utopian socialists :
279 THE ENLIG HTENMENT• Henri de Saint-Simon,  of France, believed that scientists and 
engineers, working together with businesses, could operate clean, 
efficient, beautiful places to work that produced things useful to 
society. He also advocated for public works that would provide 
employment. He proposed building the Suez Canal in Egypt, a project 
that the French government later undertook and which opened in 186.
• Charles Fourier  identified some 810 passions that, when encouraged, 
would make work more enjoyable and workers less tired. Like other 
utopian socialists, Fourier believed that a fundamental principle of 
utopia was harmonious living in communities rather than the class 
struggle that was basic to the thinking of Karl Marx.
• Robert Owen  was born in Great Britain. He established intentional 
communities—small societies governed by the principles of utopian 
socialism²in New Lanark, Scotland, and New Harmony, Indiana. He 
believed in education for children who worked, communal ownership 
of property, and community rules to govern work, education, and 
leisure time.
In the later 19th century, socialist groups such as the Fabian Society 
formed in England. The Fabians were gradual socialists: they favored 
reforming society by parliamentary means. Writers H. G. Wells, Virginia 
Woolf, and George Bernard Shaw were prominent Fabians.  By the mid-20th 
century, socialist principles would influence most of Western Europe. 
Classical Liberalism  Others advocated classical liberalism , a belief 
in natural rights, constitutional government, laissez-faire economics, and 
reduced spending on armies and established churches.  Most classical liberals 
were professionals, writers, or academics. In Britain they pursued changes in 
Parliament to reflect changing population patterns so that new industrial cities 
would have equal parliamentary representation. Classical liberals backed the 
Reform Bills of 182, 186, and 188, all of which broadened male suf frage. 
Feminism  This period saw the emergence of the movement for women’s 
rights and equality based on Enlightenment ideas. The French writer Olympe 
de Gouges fought for these rights in the era of the French Revolution. In 
18, France had adopted the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the 
Male Citizen,” a pioneering document in the history of human rights. In 
1791, de Gouges published a “Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the 
Female Citizen,” to point out that women’s rights had not been addressed. 
In 1792 in England, the pioneering writer Mary Wollstonecraft  published 
A Vindication of the Rights of Women. In it, she argued that females should 
receive the same education as males. Universal education, she argued, would 
prepare women to participate in political and professional society, enabling 
them to support themselves rather than relying on men. Wollstonecraft’s 
ultimate goal was for women to gain the same rights and abilities as men 
through the application of reason. Women won the full right to vote in 128.
280 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn 188 in Seneca Falls, New York, activists gathered to promote women’s 
rights and suffrage the ability to vote. In the convention’s “Declaration of 
Sentiments,” organizers Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton declared, 
“All men and women are created equal.” They demanded women deserved the 
right to vote and hold office, hold property and manage their own incomes, and 
be the legal guardians of their children. The Seneca Falls Convention was a 
landmark in the history of the women’s rights movement.
Abolitionism  Reform movements to provide rights and equality extended 
to freedom for enslaved people and the end of serfdom. Abolitionism , the 
movement to end the Atlantic slave trade and free all enslaved people, gained 
followers in the 18th century. Slave trading was banned earlier than slavery 
itself. The first states to ban the slave trade were with Denmark in 180, 
Great Britain in 180, and the United States in 1808. In most countries, the 
slave system depended on a steady supply of new enslaved people in order 
to function. As a result, as soon as the slave trade stopped, slavery began to 
decline. In most parts of the Americas, slavery was abolished within 0 years 
of the end of the slave trade. The United States was the rare country where 
numbers increased after the importation of enslaved people ended. The last 
country in the Americas to end slavery was Brazil, in 1888. 
The End of Serfdom  Serfdom in Europe had been declining as the 
economy changed from agrarian to industrial. Peasant revolts pushed leaders 
toward reform. Queen Elizabeth I abolished serfdom in 1574. The French 
government abolished all feudal rights of the nobility in 18. Alexander II

281 THE ENLIG HTENMENTof Russia abolished serfdom in 1861. The Russian emancipation of 2 million 
serfs was the largest single emancipation of people in bondage in human 
history. 
Zionism  Yet another “ism” in the late 1th century was the emergence of 
Zionism —the desire of Jews to reestablish an independent homeland where 
their ancestors had lived in the Middle East. After centuries of battling anti-
Semitism , hostility toward Jews, and pogroms—violent attacks against Jewish 
communities—many European Jews had concluded that living in peace and 
security was not a realistic hope. To be safe, Jews needed to control their own 
land. Leading the movement was an Austro-Hungarian Jew,  Theodor Herzl . 
Support for =ionism increased after a scandal in France known as the 
Dreyfus Affair . In 18, Alfred Dreyfus, a military officer who was Jewish, 
was convicted of treason against the French government. However, the 
conviction had been based on forged documents by people promoting anti-
Semitism. Dreyfus was ultimately pardoned after time in prison, but the case 
illustrated how widespread anti-Semitism was in France, one of the countries 
where Jews seemed least oppressed. 
=ionists faced many obstacles. The land they wanted was controlled by 
the Ottoman Empire, and Palestinian Arabs were already living in the region. 
Both the Ottomans and the Palestinians were predominantly Muslim, which 
added a religious aspect to the conflict. However, the =ionist movement grew 
in strength until 18, when the modern country of Israel was founded.

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:  DESCRI BE AN ARGUMENT 
The Enlightenment was a time of lively debate and argument centered 
on the human capacity to reason—a key aspect of argument itself. 
Arguments can use reason in a variety of ways. For example, deductive 
reasoning, sometimes called “top-down reasoning,” builds an argument 
from a general proposition All men are mortal to a more specific 
premise Socrates is a man and finally to a conclusion that must be true 
if the other premises are true Therefore, Socrates is mortal. Inductive, 
or “bottom up” reasoning, in contrast, uses specific facts to form an 
uncertain generalization (Chicago has never received snow on any day in 
August, so it’s likely that no future August day will see snow. Arguments 
284 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONcan also use reasoning by analogy, a form of inductive reasoning, to 
assert that two things known to be alike in some ways are likely similar 
in other unknown ways (Human mammals experience a wide range of 
emotions, so it is likely nonhuman mammals experience a similar range. 
Most arguments use several different kinds of reasoning to develop their 
ideas fully. Knowing how to describe the structure of an argument and the 
types of reasoning can help you evaluate the strength of its conclusions.

“Let us bring up women, not to aspire to advantages which the Constitution

education suits them. . . . The paternal home is better for the education of 
women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, 
than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.” —Talleyrand  
“Contending for the rights of women, my main argument is built on this 
simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become 
the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge . . . . If 
children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, 
their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an 
orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering 
the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation 
of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations. . . .>I@ 
earnestly wish to see woman placed in a station in which she would 
advance, instead of retarding, the progress of those glorious principles 
that give a substance to morality. My opinion, indeed, respecting the 
rights and duties of woman, seems to flow so naturally from these 
simple principles, that I think it scarcely possible, but that some of the 
enlarged minds who formed your admirable constitution, will coincide 
with me.” ²Mary Wollstonecraft 12
REFLECT ON THE TOPIC ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. In one to three paragraphs, explain how the Enlightenment shaped the 
ideological and intellectual thinking that affected reform and revolution 
in the period after 1750.
NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONS 285
5.2
Nationalism and Revolutions
Every nation gets the government it deserves.
—1oseph de 4aistre (1753-1821)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the various 
revolutions in the period from 1750 to 1900, including 
influences of the Enlightenment and emerging 
nationalism?
The age of new ideas led to political and philosophical conflicts. Like the 
English statesman Edmund Burke, the French thinker Joseph de Maistre was 
a conservative who went against the tide of Enlightenment thinking. In the 
view of conservative thinkers such as Burke and Maistre, revolutions were 
bloody, disruptive, and unlikely to yield positive results. However, try as 
conservatives might to quell revolutionary change, the desire of common 
people for constitutional government and democratic practices erupted in 
revolutions throughout the 19th century. And many nations did, indeed, get a 
new form of government that responded to the new wave of thinking with its 
key ideals: progress, reason, and natural law.
The American Revolution
The ideals that inspired the American Revolution had their roots in European 
Enlightenment philosophy. The economic ideas of the physiocrats also played 
a part in the American Revolution, providing a defense of free market ideas 
in opposition to English mercantilism. Additionally, the American colonists 
had become increasingly independent politically. Colonial legislatures were 
making decisions usually made by Parliament. Moreover, great distances 
separated the colonists from Parliament and the king in London. With economic 
and political desires for independence grew a new social spirit. 
Declaration of Independence  On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of 
Independence expressed the philosophy behind the colonists’ fight against 
British rule. In the document, Thomas Jefferson picked up the phrase 
“unalienable rights” from John Locke. For Jefferson, these rights were to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In the war that followed, the colonists 
triumphed in 18 with crucial help from Britain’s long-time enemy, France.
286 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe New Zealand Wars
New =ealand had been occupied by Polynesian people, the Maori, since at least 
the mid-1200s. In the period between their arrival and the arrival of Europeans 
the Maori developed a rich culture. The people were divided into individual 
tribes, or iwi, who sometimes engaged in warfare. After colonization by the 
British, made official by annexation of New =ealand in 180, English control 
over Maori affairs increased, as did pressure for their land. These issues resulted 
in a series of wars between the Maori and British collectively known as the 
New =ealand Wars. Though the Maori tribes fought together, developing a 
sense of Maori nationalism, by 182, the British had won. 
The French Revolution
In France in the 180s, revolutionary ideals took on their own spin, summarized 
in the slogan liberté, égalité, et fraternité liberty, equality, and fraternity. 
These ideas, which struck many people as radical, were popularized throughout 
Europe in the writings of the philosophes . 
Economic Woes  However, additional causes led to the French Revolution. 
France had long spent more than it was taking in, partly to finance a series of 
wars. Among this spending was the economic aid that France supplied the 
Americans in their revolution. To address its financial situation, the French 
government called a meeting of the Estates-General in spring 18. Three 
sectors of society, or estates, made up the Estates-General: the clergy religious 
officials, the nobility, and the commoners. However, inequality in voting 
caused the commoners who made up  percent of French society to break 
away and form a new body, the National Assembly. 
The Revolution Begins  In the early days of the French Revolution, 
moderates such as Marquis de Lafayette seemed to be on the point of establishing 
a constitutional monarchy. The National Assembly began meeting in Paris, but 
then the King threatened to arrest the leaders. Angry crowds rioted in Paris and 
elsewhere in France. On July 1, 18, a crowd in Paris stormed the Bastille , 
a former prison that symbolized the abuses of the monarchy and the corrupt 
aristocracy. In the French countryside, peasants rose up against nobles, even 
burning some manor houses. Some royal officials fled France. The king was 
forced to accept a new government with a National Assembly in charge.
The date July 1, 18, became French Independence Day. The most 
permanent changes were enacted early in the Revolution—the abolition 
of feudalism and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man , a 
statement declaring basic human rights. Louis XVI and the nobility refused 
to accept the limited monarchy, which led to dissatisfaction among radical 
groups such as the Jacobins and inspired the establishment of the First French 
Republic in 1792. The Reign of Terror , a period during which the government 
executed thousands of opponents of the revolution, including the king and 
queen, sprang from the Jacobins. After a period of turmoil and war, the brilliant 
general Napoleon Bonaparte became emperor of France in 180.
287 NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONS 287The Haitian Revolution 
At the end of the 18th century, revolutionary forces were also at work in the 
rich French sugar and coffee colony of Haiti  on the western third of the island 
of St. Domingue, also known as Hispaniola. Enslaved Africans began the 
rebellion by killing their masters and burning their homes. They were soon 
joined by Maroons,  individuals who had already escaped slavery in Haiti. 
The examples of the recent American and French revolutions led formerly 
enslaved Toussaint L’Ouverture  to join the revolts in 11 and then to lead 
a general rebellion against slavery. Besides being well-read in Enlightenment 
thought, L’Ouverture proved to be a capable general. His army of enslaved 
Africans and Maroons established an independent government and played the 
French, Spanish, and British against each other. 
Haiti  In 1801, after taking control of the territory that would become the 
independent country of Haiti, L’Ouverture produced a constitution that granted 
equality and citizenship to all residents. He also declared himself governor 
for life. Haiti next enacted land reform: plantations were divided up, with the 
lands being distributed among formerly enslaved and free black people.
L’Ouverture worked with the French but they betrayed and imprisoned 
him. He died in France in 180. But he had cemented the abolition of slavery 
in Haiti, which he set on the road to independence from France.
In 180, L’Ouverture’s successor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, orchestrated 
a Haitian declaration of permanent independence. Thus, Haiti became the 
first country in Latin America to 
win its independence and the first 
black-led country in the Western 
Hemisphere. It was also the only 
country to become permanently 
independent as a result of a slave 
uprising.
Comparing the Haitian and 
French Revolutions  Both the 
Haitian and French revolutions 
grew out of the Enlightenment’s 
insistence that men had natural 
rights as citizens, and that legal 
restraints were limiting the 
freedom of people by forcing 
them into various estates (social 
classes. However, in the case of 
the Haitians, the restraints were 
more severe—the rebellion was 
led by people who had no rights 
at all.

288 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONCreole Revolutions in Latin America
On the Latin American mainland, revolutionary ideals were taken up by 
creoles . Born of European ancestry in the Americas, the creoles were well 
educated and aware of the ideas behind the revolutions in North America and 
France. They considered themselves superior to the mestizos , who were born 
of European and Indian parents. Colonists who were born in Spain or Portugal, 
known as peninsulares , felt superior to everyone. At the bottom of the social 
ladder were the enslaved Africans the indigenous population, and mulattoes , 
those of African and either European or indigenous ancestry. Some of these 
social distinctions remain today.
There were many reasons for discontent in the colonies, each of which 
encouraged some people to desire independence from Spain:
• Many creoles were wealthy owners of estates, mines, or businesses. 
They opposed Spain’s mercantilism, which required colonists to buy 
manufactured goods only from Spain and sell products only to Spain. 
• Creoles wanted more political power. They resented that Spain tended 
to give important government jobs in the colonies to peninsulares. 
• Mestizos wanted political power and a share of the wealth of the 
colonies. Many had jobs in the towns or worked in the mines or on the 
estates of the peninsulares and creoles.
The Bolívar Revolutions  In many parts of South America, the desire for 
independence from Spain grew among the creole class. Fearing the masses, 
the creoles refused the support of mestizos, indigenous people, and mulattos 
people of mixed African and European heritage. The creoles had seen 
the result in Haiti of a slave uprising as well as the excesses of the French 
Revolution during the Reign of Terror. Some creoles, such as Simón Bolívar , 
continued to push for Enlightenment ideals in Latin America. He promoted 
independence of areas that became Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. 
Boltvar was born in 9enezuela in 18 to a family whose ancestors had 
been village aristocrats in Spain. The family had grown very wealthy in 
Venezuela, and Bolívar had access to this wealth for his revolutionary causes. 
After considerable military success in Latin America fighting the Spanish, his 
forces achieved the formation of a large area that he called Gran Colombia. 
He hoped it would become a federation similar to the United States, one based 
on Enlightenment ideals. He described himself as a liberal who believed in a 
free market and the abolition of slavery. Bolívar’s goals and concerns for Latin 
America are outlined in his “Jamaica Letter” 1815: “Generous souls always 
interest themselves in the fate of a people who strive to recover the rights to 
which the Creator and Nature have entitled them, and one must be wedded to 
error and passion not to harbor this noble sentiment.”
The new nations of Latin America suffered from the long wars of 
independence. Armies loyal to their generals led to the rise of the caudillos—
strong, local leaders with regional power bases. These men intervened in 
289 NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONSnational politics to make or break governments. Sometimes the caudillos 
defended the interests of the regional elites and sometimes of the indigenous 
population and the peasants, but in general they disregarded representative 
forms of government and the rule of law.
Results of the Creole Revolutions  Although the constitutions of the 
newly independent countries in Latin America legally ended slavery and 
some social distinctions, governments were often conservative.  The first 
constitution of Peru, for example, forbade voting by those who could not read 
or write in Spanish, which effectively denied most indigenous people the vote 
until the constitution was changed in 1860.  The creoles formed powerful and 
conservative upper class, as they had before the wars of colonial independence. 
Women gained little from the revolutions in Latin America. They were still 
unable to vote or enter into contracts. Most women received little education 
until late in the nineteenth century, and most remained submissive to men. 
One notable exception was Manuela Sienz 1±1856, who was the lover 
of Simyn Boltvar. She actively participated in fighting alongside Boltvar, for 
example, in 1822 in a battle near Quito, Ecuador. An excellent rider as well 
as courageous fighter, she rose to the rank of colonel. On one occasion, she 
saved Bolívar’s life, for which she received the nickname “Liberator of the 
Liberator.” (Connect: In a brief paragraph or outline, trace the connections 
between creole elites and revolutions in Latin America. See Topic .5 
Later Challenges to Spanish Colonialism  Spain’s grip on parts of its 
empire lasted throughout the 19th century. In the Caribbean, Puerto Rico 
and Cuba were among its final colonial holdings. Both islands saw uprisings 
against Spanish rule beginning in the year 1868. 
While many individuals and organizations contributed to the spirit of 
revolution in Puerto Rico, the role of Lola Rodríguez de Tió  was unique. 
A recognized poet during an era of little educational opportunity for women, 
Rodrtguez de Tiy became famous for her eloquent critiques of Spain’s 
exploitive rule over Puerto Rico. Her home became a meeting place for 
political thinkers and revolutionaries. At such meetings, she began to read 
lyrics to a revolutionary song, “La Boriquexa,” which encouraged her fellow 
Puerto Ricans, “Awake from your sleep, for it’s time to fight” 
The 1868 uprising forced Rodrtguez de Tiy into exile in 9enezuela. She 
was allowed to return in 1885, but her critical writings again ended in exile²
this time in Cuba. Once there, she wrote and worked for Cuban independence, 
earning her exile from there, too, to New York. She returned to Cuba in 18 
and spent her remaining years as a campaigner for social justice there.
Revolt in the Philippines
The Philippines, too, remained a Spanish colony throughout the 1th century. 
Educational opportunities, even for well-to-do Filipinos, were limited and 
controlled by religious authorities. As a result, many young men (often creoles 
and mestizos from wealthy families traveled to Europe, especially Madrid 
290 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONand Barcelona, to attend universities. An atmosphere of nationalist fervor and 
republicanism, inspired by Enlightenment thinking, existed in 1880s Europe, 
and these Filipino students embraced it. 
José Rizal became the most prominent of these young agitators, all of 
whom contributed to magazines, pamphlets, and other publications advocating 
for greater autonomy for the Philippines. Called the Propaganda Movement , 
it did not call for revolution or independence. But Spanish authorities viewed 
its members with suspicion. Rizal’s arrest in 182 and execution in 186 
shocked Filipinos and helped spur the first nationalist movement with the 
organization and strength to truly challenge Spanish rule. A serious military 
upheaval, the Philippine Revolution, began in 186.

As nationalism spread beyond Europe, people often created an identity under 
one government where none had existed before. Nationalism increased in 
France and in other areas of Europe and in the Americas. More than in the past, 
people felt a common bond with others who spoke their language, shared their 
history, and followed their customs. Nationalism thrived in France and beyond 
its borders in areas conquered by Napoleon, particularly those in the Germanic 
areas of the declining Holy Roman Empire. Nationalism was a unifying force 
that not only threatened large empires, but it also drove efforts to unite people 
who shared a culture into one political state. 
,talian 8nification  Count di  Cavour, the prime minister of Piedmont-
Sardinia, led the drive to unite the entire Italian Peninsula  under the only 
native dynasty, the House of Savoy. At the time, the region was divided among 
a patchwork of kingdoms and city-states, and most people spoke regional 
languages rather than Italian. Cavour himself spoke French better than he spoke 
Italian. Like other classical liberals, he believed in natural rights, progress, and 
constitutional monarchy. But he also believed in the practical politics of reality, 
which came to be called realpolitik . Thus, he did not hesitate to advance the 
cause of Italian unity through manipulation. In 1858, he maneuvered Napoleon 
III of France into a war with Austria, hoping to weaken Austrian influence on 
the Italian Peninsula. Napoleon III backed out of the war after winning two 
important battles, partly because he feared the wrath of the Pope, who did not 
want his Papal States to be controlled by a central Italian government. 
Nevertheless, it was too late to stop the revolutionary fervor, and soon 
several areas voted by plebiscite, or popular referendum, to join Piedmont the 
.ingdom of Sardinia. To aid the unification effort, Cavour adopted the radical 
romantic revolutionary philosophy of Giuseppe Mazzini , who had been 
agitating for Italian resurgence ( Risorgimento  since early in the nineteenth 
century. Cavour also allied with the Red Shirts military force led by Giuseppe 
Garibaldi , which was fighting farther south in the .ingdom of Naples. 
*erPan 8nification  In Germany, nationalist movements had already 
strengthened as a result of opposition to French occupation of German states 
291 NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONSunder Napoleon Bonaparte. Following the Congress of Vienna, which settled 
the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, revolutions occurred in a number of European 
states, including Prussia and Austria. The revolutions of 188 were the result 
of both nationalism especially a desire for independence and liberalism  
a desire for representation under constitutions that recognized civil liberties.
Prussian leader Otto von Bismarck , who like Cavour favored realpolitik,  
used nationalist feelings to engineer three wars to bring about German 
unification. Bismarck manipulated Austria into participating in two wars, the 
first with Prussia against Denmark 186  and the second between Prussia 
and Austria Seven Weeks’ War of 1866. After winning both wars, Bismarck 
manipulated France into declaring war against Prussia. His armies beat the 
French soundly in the Franco-Prussian War 180. In each of these three wars, 
Prussia gained territory. In 181, Bismarck founded the new German Empire, 
made up of many territories gained from the wars, including Alsace-Lorraine, 
an area long part of France on the border between France and the new Germany.
Global Consequences  By 181, two new powers, Italy and Germany,  
were on the international stage in an environment of competing alliances. 
Balance of power would be achieved briefly through these alliances, but 
extreme nationalism would lead to World War I.
Unification did not solve all Italian troubles . Poverty in Italy, more in the 
south than in the north, led to considerable emigration in the late nineteenth 
century²particularly to the United States and to Argentina, where the 
constitution of 185 specifically encouraged immigration , the movement of 
people into the country from other countries.

292 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONBalkan Nationalism  The Ottoman Empire had been the dominant force in 
southeastern Europe for centuries. But for many reasons, the 17th century saw 
the beginning of its long, slow decline. A failed attempt to conquer 9ienna in 
168 signaled the beginning of successful efforts by Austria and Russia to roll 
back Ottoman dominance in the Balkans. It was largely due to the increasing 
involvement and contact with Western European ideas and powers that Balkan 
nationalism developed. 
In Greece, which by 1800 had been under Ottoman control for more than 50 
years, increased contact with Western ideas meant exposure to Enlightenment 
principles. It also meant exposure to the reverence with which Greece and 
its ancient culture were viewed across Europe. Together, these developments 
helped reawaken Greek cultural pride and stoke the fires of Greek nationalism. 
A protracted civil war against Ottoman forces brought some success. However, 
it took the intervention of a British, French, and Russian fleet, which destroyed 
an Ottoman fleet in 182, to help assure Greek independence. 
Events in other Balkan regions, such as Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania, 
followed a similar, but by no means identical, course. The waning of Ottoman 
control led to greater freedom and an influx of new ideas, including nationalism. 
People began to rally around important cultural markers, such as language, 
folk traditions, shared history, and religion. Later, outside powers, such as 
Russia or Austria, aided in achieving independence.

and Russian forces, the Greeks won their independence by 182. 
293 NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONSOttoman Nationalism  The 180s and 1880s saw the development in 
the Ottoman state of Ottomanism —a movement that aimed to create a more 
modern, unified state. Officials sought to do this by minimizing the ethnic, 
linguistic, and religious differences across the empire. Taking control of 
local schools and mandating a standard curriculum was a major part of this 
drive. But the effects of nationalism were not limited to Balkan territories 
and Ottoman officials. Ethnic and religious groups within the Ottoman 
Empire had nationalist urges of their own, and they viewed Ottomanism with 
suspicion. Ironically, this attempt to create a more unified state actually served 
to highlight and intensify subject people’s feelings of difference and promote 
their desire for independence.
The Future of Nationalism  While nationalism continues to shape how 
people view themselves and their political allegiances, some signs suggest 
that nationalism might be starting to decline. In Europe, many countries 
have agreed to use the same currency, to allow people to travel freely across 
borders, and to coordinate public policies. These changes might reflect a shift 
away from nationalism and toward a larger political grouping. Like city-states 
and empires, nations might someday give way to other forms of political 
organization.

—Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations  (177)
Essential Question:   What factors contributed to and characterized 
industrialization in the period from 1750 to 1900?
In addition to new ideas, new technologies were reshaping societies.  
These technologies led to a dramatic change in society and economies. 
This change was so dramatic that it is called the Industrial Revolution.  
The rigid structure of early factory work described by Adam Smith, 
Scottish economist and philosopher, is one of the most enduring images of 
the Industrial Revolution. Industrialization,  the increased mechanization 
of production, and the social changes that accompanied this shift, had their 
roots in several influences. Among these were the Columbian Exchange 
and rise of maritime trading empires, increased agricultural productivity, 
and greater individual accumulation of capital. As the Industrial Revolution 
spread from Great Britain to Europe and North America, and then to the 
world, it reshaped society, increasing world population, shifting people 
from farm to city, and expanding the production and consumption of goods.
Agricultural Improvements
Just before the Industrial Revolution, in the early 1700s, an agricultural 
revolution  resulted in increased productivity. Crop rotation  (rotating 
different crops in and out of a field each year and the seed drill  (a 
device that efficiently places seeds in a designated spot in the ground 
both increased food production. Also, the introduction of the potato from 
South America contributed more calories to people’s diets. As nations 
industrialized, their populations grew because more food was available to 
more people. And because of improved medical care, infant mortality rates 
declined and people lived longer. With these demographic changes, more 
people were available to work in factories and to provide a market for 
manufactured goods. 
298 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONPreindustrial Societies
During the early 18th century, most British families lived in rural areas, grew 
most of their food, and made most of their clothes. For centuries, wool and flax 
had been raised domestically, and people spun fabrics they needed. 
However, one result of the commercial revolution and the establishment 
of maritime empires see Topic .5 was that Indian cotton became available 
in Britain, and before long it was in high demand. Wool and flax could not be 
produced quickly enough or in a large enough quantity to compete with cotton 
imports. To compete with Indian cotton, investors in Britain began to build 
their nation’s own cotton cloth industry. Using imported raw cotton produced 
by slave labor in the Americas, the British developed the cottage industry  
system, also known as the putting-out system, in which merchants provided 
raw cotton to women who spun it into finished cloth in their own homes. 
Home spinning was hard work and pay was low, but cottage industries 
gave women weavers some independence. While working in their own 
homes, they were also close to children. But cottage industry production was 
slow. Investors demanded faster production, spurring the development of 
technologies and machinery that turned out cloth in more efficient ways. 
Growth of Technology
By the mid-eighteenth century, the spinning jenny  and the  water frame  
reduced the time needed to spin yarn and weave cloth. The spinning jenny, 
invented by James Hargreaves  in the 1760s, allowed a weaver to spin more 
than one thread at a time. The water frame, patented by Richard Arkwright  
in 1769, used waterpower to drive the spinning wheel. The water frame was 
more efficient than a single person’s labor, and this mechanization doomed the 
household textile cottage industry, as textile production was moved to factories 
big enough to house these bulky machines. Arkwright was thus considered the 
father of the factory system .
Interchangeable Parts  In 18, inventor Eli Whitney  created a system 
of interchangeable parts  for manufacturing firearms for the U.S. military. 
In Whitney’s system, if a particular component of a machine were to break, 
the broken component could easily be replaced with a new, identical part. 
Entrepreneurs adapted this method of making firearms to the manufacture of 
other products. The system of interchangeable parts was a pivotal contribution 
to industrial technology. 
Whitney’s system directly led to the division of labor. Factory owners no 
longer had to rely on skilled laborers to craft every component of a product. 
Instead, with specialization of labor, each worker could focus on one type 
of task. For example, one worker might cast a part, and then another worker 
would install the part on the finished product. In the early 20th century, Henry 
Ford expanded the concept of the division of labor, developing the moving 
assembly line  to manufacture his Model T automobiles. (Connect: Compare 
the technological improvements of Islamic and Asian states with those in the 
Western world during the Industrial Revolution. See Topic .1.
299 INDUSTRI AL REVOL UTION BEGINS 299Britain’s Industrial Advantages
Britain had many environmental and geographic advantages that made it a 
leader in industrialization. Located on the Atlantic Ocean with its many 
seaways , the country was well placed to import raw materials  and export 
finished goods. 
Mineral Resources  Britain also had the geographic luck of being located 
atop immense coal deposits. Coal was vital to industrialization because when 
burned it could power the steam engine. The burning of this fossil fuel, an 
energy source derived from plant and animal remains, was also essential in 
the process of separating iron from its ore. Iron production (and later steel 
production allowed the building of larger bridges, taller buildings, and stronger 
ships. Coal mining became the major industry of northern and western Britain, 
including South Wales, Yorkshire, and Lancashire. When the United States 
industrialized, coal-mining areas developed in West 9irginia, Pennsylvania, 
and Kentucky. 
Resources from the Colonies  As a colonizing power, Britain also had 
access to resources available in its colonies, including timber for ships. Largely 
because of the wealth they accumulated during the trans-Atlantic slave trade,

300 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONenough British capitalists had excess capital  (money available to invest in 
businesses. Without this capital, private entrepreneurs could not have created 
new commercial ventures.
Abundant Rivers  Britain, the northeastern United States, and other 
regions also had a natural network of rivers supplemented by publicly funded 
canals and harbors. These water routes made transport of raw materials and 
finished products inexpensive.
Strong Fleets  Britain also had the world’s strongest fleet of ships, 
including naval ships for defense and commercial ships for trade. These ships 
brought agricultural products to Britain to be used to make finished products 
for consumers. 
Protection of Private Property  A vital factor that aided industrialization 
in Britain was the legal protection of private property. Entrepreneurs needed 
the assurance that the business they created and built up would not be taken 
away, either by other businesspeople or by the government. Not all nations 
offered these legal guarantees.
Growing Population and Urbanization  The increases in agricultural 
production caused two shifts in society. As farmers grew more food, they could 
support more people. As they grew it more efficiently, society needed a smaller 
percentage of the population working in agriculture.
This growing population in rural areas did not remain there. Migration was 
sometimes the best of bad options. English towns had traditionally allowed 
farmers to cultivate land or tend sheep on government property known as “the 
commons.” However, this custom ended with the enclosure movement  as 
the government fenced off the commons to give exclusive use of it to people 
who paid for the privilege or who purchased the land. Many farmers became 
landless and destitute. The enclosure movement was thus instrumental in a 
wave of demographic change—forcing small farmers to move from rural areas 
to urban areas such as Manchester  and Liverpool.  The people who moved 
then became the workforce for the new and growing industries.

Industrialization Spreads
No exertions of the masters or workmen could have answered the demands  
of trade without the introduction of spinning machines.
 —1ohn AiRen, A +escription of the Country . . . Around 4anchester, 1795
Essential Question:   How did different types and locations of production 
develop and change over time?
Although the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, it soon spread 
elsewhere. The British cottage industry system for the production of cotton, in 
which merchants provided raw cotton to be spun into cloth in workers’ homes, 
was supplanted by the industrialization of cotton manufacture in factories. 
Cotton became an increasingly valuable commodity in the world economy as 
industrialized Britain, with higher productivity, was able to replace Indian and 
Middle Eastern goods. After Britain industrialized, Belgium and then France 
and Germany followed, and eventually Russia and Japan became industrialized. 
These countries possessed many of the characteristics that allowed Britain to 
industrialize, including capital, natural resources, and water transportation.
Spread of Industrialization
After Britain industrialized, Belgium, and then France and Germany followed. 
Like Britain, these countries possessed capital, natural resources, and water 
transportation. The United States, Japan, and Russia also transformed as 
industrialization spread.
France and Germany  Despite some favorable factors for industrialization, 
France had sparsely populated urban centers, which limited the amount of 
labor available for factories. Also, the French Revolution 18±1 and 
subsequent wars involving France and its neighbors consumed both the 
attention and the capital of France’s elites. These factors delayed the Industrial 
Revolution in France.
Germany was politically fragmented into numerous small states, which 
delayed its industrialization. However, once Germany unified in 181, it 
quickly became a leading producer of steel and coal. 
The United States  The United States began its industrial revolution in 
the 1th century. By 100, the United States was a leading industrial force 
305 INDUSTRI ALIZATION S PREADSin the world. Human capital  the workforce was a key factor in U.S. 
success. Political upheaval and widespread poverty brought a large number of 
immigrants to the United States from Europe and East Asia. These immigrants, 
as well as migrants from rural areas in the United States, provided the labor 
force to work in the factories.

Sugar Caribbean Islands, Brazil Britain (refined sugar)
Cattle and Hogs United States, Ireland, Argentina Britain, United States (meat)
Cotton United States Britain (textiles)
Russia  Russia also began to industrialize, focusing particularly on 
railroads and exports. By 100, Russia had more than 6,000 miles of railroad 
connecting its commercial and industrial areas. The Trans-Siberian Railroad 
stretched from Moscow to the Pacific Ocean, allowing Russia to trade easily 
with countries in East Asia, such as China and Japan. The Russian coal, iron, 
and steel industries developed with the railroad, mostly in the 180s. By 
1900, Russia had become the fourth largest producer of steel in the world. 
However, the economy remained overwhelmingly agricultural until after the 
Communists seized power in 1917. 
Japan  The first country in Asia to industrialize was the one that had 
the least contact with Europe since the 1th century: Japan. In the mid-1th 
century, Japan went through a process of defensive modernization. That is, it 
consciously adapted technology and institutions developed in Europe and the 
United States in order protect its traditional culture. By learning from the West, 
Japan built up its military and economic strength so it could maintain its own 
domestic traditions. In the last four decades of the 19th century, Japan emerged 
as a leading world power. For more details on Japan, see Topic 5.6. 
Shifts in Manufacturing
While Middle Eastern and Asian countries continued to produce manufactured 
goods, these regions’ share in global manufacturing declined.
Shipbuilding in India and Southeast Asia Shipbuilding initially 
saw a resurgence in India at the end of the 17th century, largely due to the 
political alliances formed between India and western countries. However, 
Indian shipbuilding ultimately suffered as a result of British officials’ 
306 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONmismanagement of resources and ineffective leadership during the period 
of British colonization in the late 1th and 18th centuries. In 180, Britain 
designated ships of the British East India Company as the Indian Navy. The 
Indian Navy was disbanded by 186, however, when Britain’s Royal Navy 
took complete control of the Indian Ocean.
Iron Works in India British colonial rule in India also affected the 
country’s mineral production. During the period of company rule— British 
East India Company control over parts of the Indian subcontinent from 1757 
to 1858²steep British tariffs led to the decline of India’s ability to mine and 
work metals. The British also began to close mines completely, especially 
after the Rebellion of 185, because they perceived that the mines were being 
used to extract lead for ammunition.
The ongoing fear of another uprising led to the Arms Act of 188, which 
restricted not only access to minerals, but also to the subsequent production 
of firearms. British colonizers limited India’s ability to mine and work metals 
in areas such as the mineral-rich state of Rajasthan. By the early 1th century, 
most of the mines in Rajasthan were abandoned and the mining industry was 
extinct.
Even though British colonial rule ended in 18, mining and metalworking 
remained practically nonexistent in India until the early 20th century. Lack 
of technological innovation after so many years of abandoned mines led 
to a relatively crude, labor-intensive method of mining, which created the 
false impression that India’s mineral resources were inaccessible. (Connect: 
Identify the similarities in how Britain treated its colonies in South Asia and 
its colonies in the Americas. See Topic .8.
Textile Production in India and Egypt  India and Egypt were both among 
the first to engage in the production and trade of textiles. Just as it stifled 
the production of ships and iron, British colonization also affected textile 
production in India. As the textile industry flourished in India, it undermined 
the British textile mills in Britain, specifically in Lancaster. The owners of the 
Lancaster textile mills pressured the British government in India to impose an 
“equalizing” five percent tax on all textiles produced at the more than 80 mills 
operating in Bombay, thus undermining their profitability.
Egypt’s textile industry, too, experienced difficulties as a result of Europe’s 
worldwide economic reach. In the 18th century, Egypt exported carpets, silks, 
and other textiles to Europe. By the mid-1th century, however, the huge 
growth in European textile production had changed matters. Egypt had lost 
not only its export market in textiles, but much of its domestic market as well.

307 INDUSTRI ALIZATION S PREADSMULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS  
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“The economic relations of Russia with western Europe are fully comparable 
to the relations of colonial countries with their metropolises. The latter 
consider their colonies as advantageous markets in which they can freely sell 
the products of their labor and of their industry and from which they can draw 
with a powerful hand the raw materials necessary for them. This is the basis 
of the economic power of the governments of western Europe, and chiefly for 
that end do they guard their existing colonies or acquire new ones. Russia was, 
and to a considerable extent still is, such a hospitable colony for all industrially 
developed states, generously providing them with the cheap products of her 
soil and buying dearly the products of their labor. 
But there is a radical difference between Russia and a colony: Russia is an 
independent and strong power. She has the right and the strength not to want to 
be the eternal handmaiden of states which are more developed economically. 
She should know the price of her raw materials and of the natural riches hidden 
in the womb of her abundant territories, and she is conscious of the great, not 
yet fully displayed, capacity for work among her people. She is proud of her 
great might, by which she jealously guards not only the political but also the 
economic independence of her empire. She wants to be a metropolis herself. 
On the basis of the people’s labor, liberated from the bonds of serfdom, there 
began to grow our own national economy, which bids fair to become a reliable 
counterweight to the domination of foreign industry.”

Technology in the Industrial Age
Railroad iron is a magician’s rod, in its power  
to evoke the sleeping energies of  land and water. 
—9alph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)
Essential Question:   How did technology shape economic production 
during the period from 1750 to 1900?
As the Industrial Revolution spread, it became increasingly important 
economically. Although he later came to be troubled by the role of technology, 
Ralph Waldo Emerson initially saw the innovations of the industrial age 
as a delightful way to mold nature in the service of humankind. The steam 
engine and then the internal combustion engine, powering railroads, ships, and 
factories, increased access to resources and increased the distribution of goods 
those resources helped produce.
The next technological wave, known as the second industrial revolution, 
came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and involved chemicals, steel, 
precision machinery, and electronics. Electrification lit the streets, and the 
telephone and radio made world-wide, instantaneous communication a reality.
The Coal Revolution 
The new machinery of the Industrial Revolution benefitted from a new power 
source, one more mobile than the streams that had powered the first factories 
with their water power. The version of the steam engine  made by James Watt 
in 1765 provided an inexpensive way to harness coal power to create steam, 
which in turn generated energy for machinery in textile factories. Within 50 
years, steam was producing power for steam powered trains. 
Water Transportation  Steamships revolutionized sailing. The use of 
coal made energy production mobile and dependable. Instead of being fixed in 
one place as a river was, coal-powered steam engines could be built anywhere 
and could be used on ships and trains. Further, unlike the wind, engines could 
be turned on by people when needed and turned off when not. As a result, 
ocean-going ships and boats on lakes were no longer dependent on winds for 
power. On rivers, steam-powered ships were able to travel quickly upstream 
on rivers, up to five miles per hour, instead of having to sail up or be towed by 
311 TECHNOLOG Y IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGEpeople and animals along the shore. Over time, steam-powered ships replaced 
sailing ships in worldwide travel. As a result, coaling stations , especially at 
critical points on trade routes, such as Cape Colony in South Africa and various 
islands in the Pacific, became important refueling points.

186 in Utah.
312 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIron In addition to powering steam engines, coal made possible the 
mass production of iron. Throughout the 100s and into the early 1800s, 
improved processes helped iron producers increase outputs. One of these was 
the introduction of coke, a refined form of coal that made possible the use of 
much larger iron producing furnaces. Cast iron was strong but brittle, making 
it difficult to stretch and shape. But in 1, Englishman Henry Cort patented 
the process for making the less strong but much more workable wrought iron. 
Each was a valuable component in transportation and industry, but greater 
improvements were still to come.
A Second Industrial Revolution
The United States, Great Britain, and Germany were key players in what is 
known as the second industrial revolution , which occurred in the late 19th 
and early 20th centuries. The innovations of the first industrial revolution were 
in textiles, steam power, and iron. The developments of the second industrial 
revolution were in steel , chemicals, precision machinery, and electronics. 
Steel Production  The mass production of steel, an alloy of iron and 
carbon, became possible with the introduction of the Bessemer Process in 
1856. This process involved blasting the molten metal with air as a means of 
removing impurities as well as helping keep the metal from solidifying. Over 
the years, Bessemer’s innovation was refined and improved, allowing steel to 
become the strong and versatile backbone of the industrial society. 
Oil In the mid-1800s, the first commercial oil wells were drilled, tapping 
into a vast new resource of energy. Petroleum, like coal, is a fossil fuel, an 
energy source derived from plant and animal remains. At first, the most 
important product from petroleum was kerosene, which was used for lighting 
and heaters. In 18, inventors developed chemical techniques to extract 
kerosene from petroleum. 
These techniques led to other developments, such as precision machinery 
and the internal combustion engine, which in turn led to automobile and airplane 
technologies. When automobiles were introduced in the early 1900s, gasoline 
as fuel became a more important product from petroleum than kerosene.
Electricity  The harnessing of electrical power had to wait for the 
development of an effective electrical generator. In 1882 in London, the first 
public power station began production. Electrification led to street lighting and 
electric street trains in the 180s. 
Communications  The development of electricity and electronics over the 
years helped lead to important developments in communication technology. 
Inventors had been working with the idea of transmitting sound by electrical 
means since the early 19th century. Finally, a patent for the telephone was issued 
to Alexander Graham Bell  in 186. Early phone systems were notoriously 
low in quality, but Thomas Edison’s 1886 design of a refined voice transmitter 
made telephone use more practical.
313 TECHNOLOG Y IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGERadio developed after the experiments of Italian physicist Gugliemo 
Marconi . In 1901, he was able to send and receive a radio signal across the 
Atlantic Ocean. After further refinements and inventions, radio become a form 
of popular mass media with an impact unlike any previously seen.
Global Trade and Migration
Railroads, steamships, and a new invention called the telegraph made 
exploration, development, and communication possible. The telegraph 
allowed immediate communication. The construction of railroads, including 
the Transcontinental Railroad  that connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans 
when it was completed in 186, facilitated U.S. industrial growth. Like the 
canals, the railroads were heavily subsidized by public funds. The vast natural 
resources of the United States timber, coal, iron, and oil, for example and 
the ability to transport them efficiently contributed to the development of the 
United States as an industrial nation. 
The desire for capital , money available to invest in a business, was a 
driving force domestically and abroad. Products of industrialization, such as 
the railroad, steamship, and the telegraph, directly linked farmers, miners, 
manufacturers, customers, and investors globally for the first time in history .
With the development of the railroad and steamships, such countries as 
Great Britain, Germany, and the United States intensified industrialization, 
increasing the need for resources. Industrialized countries sought to protect 
their access to resources and markets by establishing colonies. 
Whereas earlier trade and migration often centered on coastal cities, 
railroads, steamships, and the telegraph also opened up to exploration and 
development the interior regions around the globe. Access to these areas 
increased trade and migration. (Connect: Write a paragraph describing how 
the Silk Roads set the stage for the industrial developments of the 1800s. See

INDUSTRIALIZATION : GO=ERNMENT ’S ROLE317
5.6
Industrialization: 
Government’s  Role
It is our purpose to select from the various institutions prevailing among 
enlightened nations such as are best suited to our present conditions,  
and adapt them in gradual reforms and improvements of our policy  
and customs so as to be upon an equality with them.
—Emperor 4eiji. letter to President <lysses .rant,1871
Essential Question:   What economic strategies did different states and 
empires adopt, and what were the causes and effects 
of those strategies? 
As Western domination and technology spread, they met with varying degrees 
of acceptance in different nations. Each country experienced competing 
pressures between preservation of traditional values and modernization. 
Egypt and some other countries early adopted policies that encouraged the 
use of industrialized innovations, such as the steam engine, to boost textile 
productivity. Others, such as China, had weakened central governments under 
European ascendency that were unable to promote industrialization effectively.
The Ottoman Empire  The Ottoman Empire, although bordering Europe, 
had not adopted Western technology or Enlightenment ideas. Moreover, 
rampant corruption led to rapid decline, and ethnic nationalism among the 
empire’s diverse population led to widespread unrest. The empire earned the 
nickname “the sick man of Europe.” Europeans, particularly Russians, saw 
opportunities to expand their own empires at the expense of the weakening 
Ottomans. Though they feared the results of a power vacuum from a total 
collapse of the Ottoman Empire, they dismantled it after World War I. A 
smaller nation-state, the Republic of Turkey, and several independent countries 
replaced the former empire.
China  China suffered two great humiliations at the hands of Europeans 
in the 1th century: the Opium War and the split into “spheres of influence.” 
In the 20th century, China shook off foreign domination and briefly became 
a republic. However, its traumatic 19th century left a central government too 
weak to promote industrialization effectively for decades. See Topic 6.5.
Japan  In Japan, in contrast, the central government grew stronger in its 
struggle to maintain independence and territorial integrity in the face of Western 
318 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONchallenges. As the quote at the beginning of this chapter from Emperor Meiji’s 
letter to President Grant indicates, Japan actively sought Western innovations 
that it felt would help make it the equal of Western countries. 
Ottoman Industrialization 
Suffering from problems of overexpansion and failure to modernize, the 
Ottoman Empire underwent palace coups, declining trade, and weakening 
leadership in the 1800s. The empire no longer covered the grand areas of 
Suleiman the Magnificent, who had taken his army to the gates of 9ienna in 
1529. 
The Rise of Muhammad Ali  One part of the Ottoman Empire where the 
sultan ruled in name but had little power was Egypt. In fact, the Mamluks , 
formerly enslaved Turks who formed a military class, had ruled there for some 
600 years. In 1801, the sultan sent an Ottoman army to retake Egypt. In the 
conflict with the Mamluks, an Albanian Ottoman officer, Muhammad Ali , 
rose to prominence, and local leaders selected him to be the new governor of 
Egypt. The sultan lacked the power to do anything but agree.
Because of his power, Ali was able to act somewhat independently of the 
sultan. He joined the sultan’s military campaigns when it benefited him, and 
also undertook several campaigns without the sultan’s permission, including 
in the Sudan and Syria. He also began his own reforms in Egypt.  He began by 
making over the country’s military on a European model. He also established 
schools, sent military officers to be educated in France, and started an official 
newspaper²the first in the Islamic world.

Jean-Franoois Portaels, portrait of Muhammad Ali, 18
319 INDUSTRIALIZATION : GO=ERNMENT ’S ROLE319As part of his reform of the Egyptian economy, Ali taxed the peasants at 
such a high rate that they were forced to give up their lands to the state. The 
government could then control the valuable cotton production and make money 
on the export of cotton and other agricultural products. Secularizing religious 
lands put more agricultural produce in the hands of the government, resulting 
in large profits during the period of the Napoleonic wars 1±1815, when 
prices for wheat were high in Europe.
Muhammad Ali also pushed Egypt to industrialize. He had textile factories 
built to compete with those of the French and British. In Cairo, he had factories 
built to produce armaments. In Alexandria, he set up facilities to build ships so 
that Egypt could have its own navy. The city of Cairo had dozens of small shops 
turning out locks, bolts of cloth, and other parts for uniforms and weaponry. 
Ali is called the first great modern ruler of Egypt partly because of his vision 
of state-sponsored industrialization.
Japan and the Meiji Restoration
Japan’s transition to a modern, industrialized country took less than half a 
century to accomplish. No country made such a rapid change.
A Challenge to Isolation  Between 1600 and 185, Japan had very little 
contact with the rest of the world. However, the rising imperial powers in the 
world were not content to let Japan keep to itself. The great powers of Europe, 
such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Russia, all wanted to sell goods in 
Japan. Further, in the age of coal-powered ships, trading states wanted to be 
able to refuel in Japan as they sailed to and from China and other parts of East 
Asia. 
Japan Confronts Foreigners  In 185, a naval squad led by Commodore 
Matthew Perry  in 185 sailed into Yedo and Tokyo Bay, asking for trade 
privileges. The next year, Perry returned with even more ships, demanding 
that the Japanese engage in trade with the United States. Faced with the power 
of the U.S. warships, the Japanese gave in to U.S. demands. Soon they yielded 
to similar demands by other foreign states. 
The arrival of Perry, and the threat he posed, caused Japanese leaders to 
realize the danger they and their culture were in. They had seen how even 
a large, traditionally powerful country such as China had been humiliated 
by Westerners. They had watched as the British had gone to war to force 
the Chinese to accept opium imports. While some Japanese argued that the 
country could defend itself, many reformers feared it could not. They argued 
that the country should adopt enough Western technology and methods so it 
could protect its traditional culture. To accomplish this goal, they overthrew 
the shogun and restored power to the emperor in 1868, an event know as the 
Meiji Restoration.
Reforms by the Meiji State  Japan systematically visited Europe and the 
United States and invited experts to Japan in order to study Western institutions. 
Then, Japan adopted reforms based on what it admired:
320 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITION• It formally abolished feudalism in 1868 by the Charter Oath .
• It established a constitutional monarchy based on the Prussian model in 
which the emperor ruled through a subordinate political leader.
• It established equality before the law and abolished cruel punishments.
• It reorganized the military based on the Prussian army, building a new 
navy and instituting conscription.
• It created a new school system that expanded educational opportunities, 
particularly in technical fields.
• It built railroads and roads. 
• It subsidized industrialization, particularly in the key industries of tea, 
silk, weaponry, shipbuilding, and a rice wine called sake.
The government financed all of these reforms with a high agricultural tax. 
The taxes proved a good investment because they stimulated rapid economic 
growth. The government’s ability to collect increased taxes also provided 
revenue for the bureaucracy, now centered in Tokyo. 
However, in replicating the methods of Western countries, the Japanese 
also replicated some of industrial society’s problems. For example, accounts 
of abuse and exploitation of female Japanese mill workers are similar to the 
experiences that British female mill workers had recorded decades earlier.

321 INDUSTRIALIZATION : GO=ERNMENT ’S ROLEThe Role of Private Investments  While the relationship between 
industry and centralized government was key to modernization in Japan, 
private investment from overseas also became important. Once new industries 
were flourishing, they were sometimes sold to zaibatsu , powerful Japanese 
family business organizations like the conglomerates in the United States. 
The prospect of attracting investors encouraged innovation in technology. For 
example, a carpenter founded a company in 1906 called Toyoda Loom Works 
that made an automatic loom . The company prospered, modified its name, 
and grew into today’s Toyota Motor Company.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. 
“It was cotton production, especially, that characterized the beginnings of 
Egypt’s integration into the global capitalist system. Cotton was an important 
part of the British Industrial Revolution, as textile mills in Lancashire 
and elsewhere came to symbolize the changes that occurred as a society 
transitioned from a feudal mode of production to a capitalist one. Egypt’s 
initial role in this chain of developments was to supply cotton to British textile 
mills, especially when the American Civil War cut off supplies of cotton from 
the southern United States Beckert, 200, p. 105. 
. . . Many of the major changes in Egyptian agriculture, and in rural Egyptian 
society more broadly, can be traced to the development of the global capitalist 
system. As the British promoted cotton cultivation in Egypt, large estates took 
over land that had supplied the means of subsistence for peasants under pre-
capitalist modes of production. The result was that µthe great majority of the 
peasantry was by the end of the nineteenth century either landless or land-
poor, while a new class of large landowners—an agrarian bourgeoisie—had 
emerged’ Beinin and Lockman, 18, p. 8. This agrarian bourgeoisie assumed 
much of the power in rural Egypt, yet the influx of foreign capital during this 
development of agricultural production in Egypt meant that the foreigners who 
controlled the capital also held much of the power over Egypt as a whole.”

As historians make connections between cultures and eras, they look 
for not only consistent patterns but also for divergent ones. For instance, 
the pattern in France and Germany was consistent: these countries 
realized their need to follow Britain’s charge towards industrializing 
production in order to strengthen their economic presence. This 
trend towards industrializing reveals their interest in gaining a global 
economic presence, perhaps even economic dominance. The states you 
read about in this topic, however, did not follow that pattern.

industrializing shared by the Ottomans and Japanese. In a few para 

Economic Developments 
and Innovations
Man is an animal that makes bargains: no other animal does this  
- no dog exchanges bones with another. 
—Adam Smith (1723-1790)
Essential Question:   How did the development of economic systems, 
ideologies, and institutions contribute to change 
between 1750 and 1900?
Industrialization and modernization led to new philosophies and business 
structures. In the Wealth of Nations 16, Adam Smith, arguing that humans 
are naturally transactional, provided a foundational text in support of capitalism 
and the establishment of private entrepreneurship and shaped the economics 
and politics of the industrial age and the centuries to follow. Mercantilism, 
a system of economic protectionism, was replaced by a laissez-faire “leave 
alone” in French policy that promoted minimal governmental involvement in 
commerce and encouraged countries to reduce tariffs on trade.
These economic ideas were reflected in, and supported by, emerging 
transnational institutions, including banks such as the Hong .ong and Shanghai 
Banking Corporation HSBC and manufacturers such as Unilever. As trade 
increased, so did the availability, affordability, and variety of consumer goods.
(σecWsRn%usiness2UJDni]DWiRn
New ways of organizing businesses arose during the Industrial Revolution. 
Some manufacturers formed giant corporations  in order to minimize risk. A 
corporation is a business chartered by a government as a legal entity owned 
by stockholders  (individuals who buy partial ownership directly from the 
company when it is formed or later through a  stock market . Stockholders 
might receive sums of money, known as dividends, from a corporation when 
it makes a profit. If a corporation experiences a loss or goes bankrupt, the 
stockholders are not liable for the losses. The most that stockholders can lose 
is what they paid for the stock in the first place.
Markets with One Seller  Some corporations became so powerful that 
they could form a monopoly , control of a specific business and elimination of 
all competition. For example, Alfred Krupp of Essen, Germany, ran a gigantic 
company that used the Bessemer process , a more efficient way to produce 
steel, gaining a monopoly in the German steel industry. In the United States, 
John D. Rockefeller created a monopoly in the oil industry.
326 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONCompanies Working Across Boundaries  British-born Cecil Rhodes , 
founder of De Beers Diamonds, was an especially enthusiastic investor in a 
railroad project that was to stretch from Cape Town, in modern-day South 
Africa, to Cairo, Egypt. Connecting all of the British-held colonies with a 
transportation network could make governance easier and aid in conducting 
a war, if necessary. The project was never completed because Britain never 
gained control over all the land on which such a railroad was to be built. 
The overwhelming majority of railway workers in Africa were natives who 
were paid far lower wages than their European counterparts. Thus, railroad 
technology was a means of extracting as many resources as possible from 
subject lands while paying colonial laborers as little as possible.
De Beers was one of many transnational  companies—those that operated 
across national boundaries—that emerged in the 19th century. For example, 
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation , a British-owned bank 
opened in its colony of Hong .ong in 1865, focused on finance, corporate 
investments, and global banking. The Unilever Corporation , a British and 
Dutch venture, focused on household goods²most famously, soap. By 180 
it had soap factories in Australia, Switzerland, the United States, and beyond. 
Unilever sourced the palm oil for its soaps first from British West Africa 
and later the Belgian Congo, where it operated huge plantations. Because 
these companies were transnational, they gained wealth and influence on 
a scale rarely approached before. (Connect: Defend or refute the claim—  
mercantilism was necessary for the eventual growth of transnational 
companies. See Topic ..  
Corporations  A sole proprietorship is a business owned by a single 
person, and a partnership is a small group of people who make all business 
decisions. A corporation differs from these two other major forms of business 
ownership in that a corporation is a more flexible structure for large-scale 
economic activity. It replaced the traditional system of a single entrepreneur 
engaging in high-risk business endeavors with a system of larger companies, 
collectively engaging in lower-risk efforts. By spreading risk, investments 
became much safer and more attractive.

327 ECONOMIC DEVELO PMENTS AND INNOV ATIONS 327Despite critics’ charges that corporations undermined individual 
responsibility, they became a common form of business organization. They 
eventually dominated many areas of business, from banking to manufacturing 
to providing services. With their growth, corporations gained great economic 
and political power. For example, the decision by a corporation about where 
to build a new factory could create thousands of new jobs for a community . 
Banking and Finance  Another way to reduce risk was through insurance, 
especially marine insurance. Lloyd’s of London, with beginnings in a coffee 
house where merchants and sailors went for the most reliable shipping news, 
helped establish the insurance industry. The number of banks rose as merchants 
and entrepreneurs looked for a reliable place to deposit money and to borrow it 
when needed to build a factory or hire workers for a new enterprise. 
(σecWRn0Dss&ulWuUe 
A culture of consumerism  as well as of leisure developed among the working 
and middle classes of society in Great Britain, and for some people, living 
standards rose.  Consumption needed to keep up with production, so producers 
began to advertise heavily, particularly to the middle class whose members 
had some disposable income, money that can be spent on nonessential goods. 
Leisure activities such as biking and boating became popular during the 
late 1800s. In the 1880s, the penny-farthing bicycle below left was replaced 
by the newer safety bicycle below right. The older style featured one large 
wheel and one small one. This allowed riders to travel fast, but the danger of 
falling over was high. The newer style, by using a chain connecting different 
sized gears on the wheels, could go the same speed, but with less risk.

328 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONCompanies encouraged their workers to participate in athletics, because 
they believed that sports rewarded virtues such as self-discipline and playing 
by the rules. The sales of athletic equipment also generated business for those 
who made everything from soccer` balls to sports stadiums.
Perhaps because workers spent most of their waking hours in a bleak 
industrial environment, material goods and leisure entertainment became 
important escapes. In Europe, soccer known there as football, became 
popular, while baseball dominated sports in the United States. Particular sports 
developed along class lines: tennis and golf in England, for example, were 
played by the upper classes, while certain types of rugby were played only by 
the lower classes.
The commercialization of the demand for public culture was also seen in 
the construction of music halls and public parks, particularly during the second 
half of the 19th century. Both the halls and the parks were built to accommodate 
a wide range of social classes. One aim of this mingling of classes was for the 
lower classes to see more civilized, rational behavior so that they would be 
encouraged to emulate it. The manner in which one class may have ultimately 
influenced the other is difficult to quantify, yet the enduring presence of such 
public mingling places remains intact.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“It is especially difficult to explain why consumers chose to use the increasing 
incomes which they had at their disposal for consumption rather than for 
saving or investment. Some historians suggest that consumption increased 
because consumers shared an almost instinctive desire to enjoy a higher 
standard of living and improve their material and psychological well-being. 
Others believe that consumers consumed in order to emulate those around 
them; as Perkin suggests, ‘If consumer demand was the key to the Industrial 
Revolution, social emulation was the key to consumer demand. By the 
eighteenth century nearly everyone in England and the Scottish Lowlands 
received a money income, and nearly everyone was prepared to spend a 
large part of it in  keeping up with the Joneses .’ Other historians maintain 
that consumers were manipulated by the machinations of advertisers and 
other commercial interests. According to Royle, ‘The lubricant to make 
the consumer society of the late twentieth century function smoothly was 
advertising, which was made all the easier with the advent of television.’ ”

Using reasoning processes of comparison, causation, andor continuity

different historical developments. For example, they can explain the 
relationship between the historical development of state-building and 
the historical development of global trading networks by asking such 
questions as:
• How were these developments the same, and how were they 
different? 
• What caused each development, and what were the effects? Did 
one development cause the other? 
• What degree of change did the development bring about? In other 
words, to what extent was continuity preserved or disrupted?  
Two developments during the period 1750 to 1900 have earned the

Reactions to the  
Industrial Economy

—4ary Harris ¸4other¹ 1ones, (1837-1930)
Essential Question:   What conditions led to calls for change in industrial 
societies, and what were the effects of those efforts?
The harsh conditions of industrial life provoked resistance and calls for 
reform. “Mother” Jones, a labor organizer, described the severe deprivations 
of the coal miners working underground all day, and other activists told of 
the horrors of factory work. Philosophers such as John Stuart Mill sought to 
address this growing inhumanity of the industrial era through social reforms 
Others, such as the utopian socialists, argued for completely changing a 
system they considered to be basically flawed. Workers formed trade unions to 
advocate for higher pay and safer working conditions. Various ideologies and 
political movements emerged, some promoting alternative visions of society. 
The Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin, China, and Japan also 
instituted reforms to promote industrialization. In response, in each, faced 
reactions against the results of economic change. 
Labor Unions
Dangerous and unsanitary working conditions, low wages, and long hours 
were common in factory work in the 19th century. A committee of Britain’s 
Parliament released a study called the Sadler Report in 18. The report 
described these conditions. It made many people in Britain, particularly in 
Parliament, aware of the need for reforms. 
Workers also responded to low pay and harsh conditions. They began to 
form  labor unions  —organizations of workers that advocated for the right to 
bargain with employers and put the resulting agreements in a contract. For 
most of the 19th century, unions in Great Britain had to organize in secret 
because the government treated them as enemies of trade. However, by the 
20th century, unions became more acceptable and membership increased. 
333 REACTIONS TO T HE INDUSTRI AL ECONOM Y Unions improved workers’ lives by winning minimum wage laws, limits on 
the number of hours worked, overtime pay, and the establishment of a five-day 
work week.
Voting Rights  Unions sparked a larger movement for empowerment 
among the working class. In 182, 186, and 188, the British parliament 
passed reform bills to expand the pool of men who could vote, thereby giving 
more representation to British cities. The acts reduced property ownership 
qualifications as a requirement for voting. These reforms laid the foundation 
for expansion of the franchise right to vote to all men in 118. British women 
would not gain equal suffrage voting rights until 128.
Child Labor  Along with unions, social activists and reformers hoped 
to improve the living conditions of the least powerful in society. Reformers’ 
achievements especially benefited children. A law in 18 declared that 
children under the age of 10 were banned from working in the coal mines. 
In 1881, education became mandatory for British children between the ages 
of 5 and 10. This focus on education, as opposed to work for monetary gain, 
permanently redefined the role of children in urban society.
The Intellectual Reaction 
As trade and production became increasingly global, the ideas of early 
economists such as Adam Smith see Topic 5.1 were taken in new directions. 
While Smith wrote in an age of individual entrepreneurs and small businesses, 
people of the 1th century witnessed the rise of large-scale transnational 
businesses. This shift caused people to think about society in new ways. For 
example, utopian socialists tried to create new communities to demonstrate 
alternatives to capitalism. 
John Stuart Mill  Some economists, clergy, and intellectuals criticized  
laissez-faire capitalism as inhumane to workers. One of these was a British  
philosopher, John Stuart Mill 1806±18. He championed legal reforms 
to allow labor unions, limit child labor, and ensure safe working conditions 
in factories. While his ideas were controversial in his time, many of them 
eventually become widely adopted in industrial societies.
Mill’s philosophy was called utilitarianism.  Rather than state a set of 
timeless moral rules, as many religions or ethicists did, utilitarianism  sought 
“the greatest good for the greatest number of people.” Unlike utopian socialists, 
who wanted to replace capitalism, utilitarians wanted to address the growing 
problems they saw with it. They viewed themselves as moderate, rational 
advocates of gradual reform.
334 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONKarl Marx
While most reformers wanted to fix what they considered problems with 
capitalism, some people wanted more extensive changes. Karl Marx  1818±
188 was a German scholar and writer who argued for socialism. Unlike 
utopian socialists, whom he scorned because he thought they wanted to escape 
problems rather than confront them, he wanted to look at how the world 
actually operated. He called his approach to economics “scientific socialism.” 
In 188, .arl Marx and his wealthy supporter Friedrich Engels  published 
a pamphlet (now called the  Communist Manifesto  that summarized their 
critique of capitalism. According to Marx, capitalism was an advance on 
feudalism because it produced tremendous wealth, but that it also produced 
needless poverty and misery. This contradiction between wealth and poverty 
occurred because capitalism divided society into two basic classes. 
• The proletariat  was essentially the working class, working in factories 
and mines, often for little compensation. 
• The bourgeoisie  included the middle class and investors who owned 
machinery and factories where workers produced goods. 
Marx said that market competition drove the bourgeoisie to exploit the 
proletariat for the sake of higher profits. Because the bourgeoisie owned the 
means of production , such as machines, factories, mines, and land, they 
received most of the wealth produced. The proletariat, who did the physical 
and dangerous work, received very little, just enough to survive. Marx exhorted 
the proletariat to recognize their shared interest as a class and take control of 
the means of production and share the wealth they created fairly. 
For Marx, socialism would replace capitalism. It, then, would later be 
replaced by a final stage of economic development, communism , in which all 
class distinctions would end. (Connect: Create a chart comparing utopian and 
Marxist thought. See Topic 5.1.
Ottoman Response to Industrialization
In the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was no longer at the peak of its political 
power. However, it maintained some economic power. Sultan Mahmud II  
ruled 1808±18 reformed the Ottoman system. In 1826, he abolished the 
corps of Janissaries, which had opposed him, and developed a new artillery 
unit trained by Europeans. When the Istanbul Janissaries revolted, he had 
them massacred. The abolition of the feudal system in 181 marked the final 
defeat of the Janissaries’ power. Military officers were no longer able to collect 
taxes directly from the populace for their salaries. Instead, tax collections 
went directly to the central government, which paid military personnel, thus 
ensuring their loyalty.
335 REACTIONS TO T HE INDUSTRI AL ECONOM Y Mahmud’s reforms also included building roads and setting up a postal 
service. To fight the power of popular religious charities, he set up a government 
directory of charities. To operate the central administration of government,  
Mahmud II created European-style ministries.
Reorganization  Reforms after Mahmud during the years 18±186 
are called Tanzimat  reorganization and include the following changes:
• The sultans in this period worked to root out long-standing and 
widespread corruption in the central government.
• Education had long been under the control of the ulama, the educated 
class of Muslim scholars. Now the sultans created a secular system of 
primary and secondary schools. Secular colleges were also gradually 
set up, one for each special purpose: military, engineering, translation, 
civil service, and so on.
• The sultans codified Ottoman laws and created new ones, including a 
commercial code 1850 and a penal code 1858. These codes made it 
easier for foreigners to do business in the empire. 
• In 1856, the sultan issued an edict known as the Hatt-i Humayun 
Ottoman Reform Edict that updated the legal system, declaring 
equality for all men in education, government appointments, and 
justice regardless of religion or ethnicity. The new legal system also 
regulated the millets , which were separate legal courts established by 
different religious communities, each using its own set of religious 
laws. Christians in the Balkans protested the new regulations because 
they felt that their autonomy was being threatened. Muslims, on 
the other hand, protested the reforms because they conflicted with 
traditional values and practice.
Although not achieving religious equality, the Tanzimat reforms continued 
to have wide effects in areas such as the military and education. These effects 
continued even when succeeding sultans blocked other reforms. 
Ottoman Economy and Society  The reforms under Mahmud II and the 
Tanzimat occurred during a period of economic change in Turkey. After the 
Napoleonic wars ended in 1815, prices for food and other crops declined in the 
Ottoman Empire. However, a global economy was in place, built partially on 
the flow of wealth into the Mediterranean from European colonial expansion 
in the Americas. Ottoman workers were increasingly paid in cash rather than 
in goods. Financial enterprises such as banking increased. These economic 
changes occurred along with the slow spread of industrialization. The growth 
of industry affected men and women differently. For example, most new 
industrial jobs went to men.
Legal reforms also benefited men more than women. Traditionally, under 
shariah, women had been allowed to hold money, to gain from inheritance, 
and to receive some education. The reforms of Mahmud II made the law more 
secular, and ended the right of women to distribute their property or cash 
through trusts to family members. 
336 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONAlthough women had indirect control of their property, the new 
nonreligious courts ended even these limited rights. Many reforms had no 
effect on women. Since women were excluded from the army, the professions, 
higher education, and commerce, reforms in these areas did not affect them 
directly. The Tanzimat reforms of 18 did not even mention women.
Opposition to Reform  When Sultan Abdulhamid took power in 186, 
he supported the efforts at internal reforms. He accepted a new constitution 
for the Ottoman Empire and he continued to emphasize primary education and 
secularization of the law. A few girls were allowed to attend girls’ secondary 
schools by the beginning of the 20th century.
However, fearful of any “seditious” reform, the sultan and the central 
government maintained tight control over the empire. Abdulhamid eventually 
drove the advocates for reform, known as “Young Turks” into exile. Further, 
his government whipped up anger against minority groups, particularly 
Armenians and Assyrian Christians. Between 18 and 186, between 
100,000 and 250,000 Armenians were killed throughout several provinces in 
what has become known as the Hamidian massacres. For this bloodshed, he 
received the nickname the Red Sultan.
5efRUP(σRUWsin&KinD
Like other powers, China under the Qing Dynasty felt pressure to modernize. 
Its major reform effort of the late 1th century was known as the Self-
Strengthening Movement . It developed as a way for the government to face 
the internal and external problems confronting China. Government officials 
hoped to strengthen China in its competition with foreign powers by advancing 
its military technology and readiness and by training Chinese artisans in the 
manufacture of items for shipyards and arsenals. French and British advisors 
helped Chinese reform efforts. A stable government capable of collecting 
revenue allowed China to repay debts and participate in trade. For the Chinese, 
their existence as an independent state depended upon economic solvency. 
Reform in the name of modernization seemed inevitable. 
As another step toward reform, the Chinese government set up its own 
diplomatic corps and a customs service to help collect taxes on imports and 
exports. The government’s strategy was to graft some modern ideas and 
technology onto Chinese tradition rather than to create major change.
Demand for reform increased after China’s defeat in the Sino-Japanese 
War 18±185. People formed clubs to call for change. One club, led by a 
civil servant named .ang Youwei, was able to meet with Emperor Guangxu . 
Kang convinced the ruler to support a set of sweeping reforms known as the 
Hundred Days of Reform . The reforms included the abolition of the outdated 
civil service exam, the elimination of corruption, and the establishment of 
Western-style industrial, commercial, and medical systems. 
Cixi’s Initial Conservatism  However, the emperor’s aunt and adopted 
mother and the most powerful political figure in the country, Empress 
337 REACTIONS TO T HE INDUSTRI AL ECONOM Y Dowager Cixi , was a conservative. At first, she opposed the reforms and 
wanted to protect traditional social and governmental systems. In a coup d’état, 
Cixi imprisoned the emperor and immediately repealed his reform edicts. 
She feared the influence of foreigners, so she resisted any new technology 
that would extend their reach into her country. For example, she stopped the 
extension of railroad lines and telegraph networks into the Chinese interior.
Reform of the Civil Service  However, toward the end of Cixi’s rule, she 
came to recognize the problems with the civil service system. It was designed 
according to Confucian ideals of respect for rank and hierarchy as well as values 
of civic participation and action. By the 19th century, though, the wealthy were 
using the civil servants to get favors. Revenue dropped off for the government 
as a result of bribes going into the pockets of corrupt civil servants. Moreover, 
non-qualified persons were purchasing civil service posts. China abandoned 
nearly 2,500 years of tradition, one that had yielded an educated bureaucracy of 
scholar-gentry. In spite of this concession, the empress’s overall conservatism 
caused her to fail to cope with demands of modernity in China.
China and Foreign Powers  Unlike Turkey, where Europeans had 
little to gain from either passage or opposition to progressive reforms, in 
China, Europeans encouraged change. When reforms were met with the 
conservatism of Empress Cixi and the 1900 Boxer Rebellion against foreign 
influence see Topic 6.2, the Chinese government, including its provincial 
governors, continued to modernize, with some help from American and 
European advisors. Weakened by internal rebellion and fearing encroachment 
from Japan, China had to accept territorial “protection” from Western powers, 
who in return demanded trade concessions. 
In 111, the Chinese chose to become a republic. See Topic .1. In 
addition, they resisted being swallowed up by their external enemies. China’s 
attempts to preserve its territorial integrity benefited from the efforts of 
the United States to maintain stability in Asia by preventing Japan from 
encroaching farther on its territory after the Russo-Japanese War of 105. 
U.S. efforts were exemplified by the Treaty of Portsmouth, which settled the 
war and was negotiated with the help of President Theodore Roosevelt. 
Resistance to Reform in Japan
Just as China ended its long-standing civil service system, the Japanese also 
ended a traditional system of exercising authority. In 181, Japan gave samurai 
a final lump-sum payment and legally dissolved their position. They were no 
longer fighting men and were not allowed to carry their swords. The bushido , 
their code of conduct, was now a personal matter, no longer officially condoned 
by the government.
Some samurai adjusted to the change by serving the government as 
genros , or elder statesmen. Others, particularly those from the provinces of 
Satsuma and Choshu, resisted the change. They defended their right to dress 
and wear their hair in traditional ways and to enjoy relative autonomy from 
338 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONthe centralized government. The last battle between the samurai shogunate 
forces and those loyal to the emperor occurred in the 180s. Dismayed by 
defeat, the samurai became the main victims of Japan’s rapid modernization. 
Ironically, some of their leaders were the same people who had supported the 
Meiji Restoration in the 1860s. 
Rise and Decline of Liberalization  Some reforms in Japan worked better 
than others. The new schools quickly improved literacy rates, the economy 
rapidly industrialized, and the country began to develop traits of democracy 
such as a free press, strong labor unions, and respect for individual liberties. 
However, by the 120s, army officers again began to dominate the government.
Limits to Reform  
Turkey, China, and Japan each followed its own path in responding to 
industrialization in the 19th century. Of the three, Turkey began to make 
changes earliest. However, Sultan Abdulhamid, though he supported reforms 
at first, became more conservative during his time as ruler. China began to 
make changes only later in the century. In contrast to Abdulhamid, China’s 
Cixi started as skeptical of reform but became more liberal during her reign. 
Japan responded to industrialization with dramatic, rapid changes beginning 
with the Meiji Restoration in 1868. However, the speed and depth of its 
reforms prompted a backlash from conservative members of society.

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:   EXPLAIN THE HISTORIC AL SITUATION   
OF A SOURCE 
Knowing the historical situation of a source—including the other 
contemporaneous opinions swirling about a topic—helps situate the 
source in a spectrum of viewpoints. 
In 18, Samuel Laing, a British politician, wrote a paper called 
“The Causes of, and Remedies for, the Existing Distress of the Country,” 
in reaction to evidence “that as wealth increases, poverty increases in a 
faster ratio.” He proposed systematic, government sponsored emigration 
as one solution to the problem. 
5ead the e[cerpts Eelow from /aing¶s paper and then answer the 
questions that follow to help explain its historical situation. 
“The truth appears to be, that while emigration is advocated simply 
as a matter of profit and loss, and regarded as a cheap and convenient 
mode of shoving misery out of sight, it is not calculated to answer 
the selfish ends of its promoters. But if it were taken up in a spirit of 
charity, and as part and parcel of a comprehensive scheme for raising 
the condition of the poorer classes, and prosecuted by the government 
and society from a sense of duty rather than of self-interest, there seems 
every ground for hoping that emigration might become an instrument 
of great good, not only to the colonies, but to the mother country. If 
the owners of estates, for instance, where the agricultural population 
is clearly redundant, were, with a disinterested view to the good of 
their dependants, to assist them in emigrating, and if the government 
was, under proper guarantees, and with proper discrimination, to 
cooperate in the enterprise, there seems no doubt that much practical 
good might be accomplished. Colonies . . . might be planted in the 
North American settlements with every prospect of success; indeed 
with the certainty that those who, if they had remained at home, 
would have been squalid paupers, will, in a few years, become a 
body of respectable freeholders, and an important acquisition to their 
adopted country. By the same process the condition of those at home 
might be greatly ameliorated, provided active steps were taken by 
the landlord to eradicate the evils which had led to the multiplication 
342 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONof a pauper population. A great writer has said, “Do the duty that 
lies nearest to thee, and already, in so doing, thy next duty will have 
become clearer.” . . . Every step taken in advance with a good motive 
and in a right direction, clears away a thousand difficulties. When it 
is clearly seen that a measure will benefit human beings, and injure 
nothing but abstract theories, let the government strike boldly in, and 
the theories will soon veer round and prove that what has been done 
is right. . . .  Do not let the government risk the certain good that 
is effected under the present system by any hazardous experiment 
unsanctioned by experience; but, on the other hand, do not let them 
sink spellbound under the influence of theories of laissez faire , and 
omit opportunities of doing practical good where it is in their power. 
Let them leave the principle of self-interest to do all the good it can, 
but remember that it can never be a substitute for the higher principles 
of duty and charity, and that emigration, like any other expedient for 
the relief of society, must be conducted in a disinterested spirit of 
enlightened benevolence, in order to accomplish its object.”

5.9
Society and the Industrial Age
Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for the well-housed and fed  
to draw round the bright fire and thank .od they were at home" and for  
the homeless, starving wretch to lay him down and die. 
—Charles +icRens, 6liver Twist (1839)
Essential Question:   How did industrialization cause change in e_isting 
social hierarchies and standards of living?
Industrialization affected not only governments and economies but also 
people’s everyday lives. Dickens illustrated the sharp contrasts in the industrial 
age between the emerging middle class, who enjoyed the benefits of the new 
prosperity, and the urban poor, who were ill-treated. Young children worked 
in factories. Women experienced substantial changes in their lifestyle. Poor  
women took jobs in domestic service and the textile industries, spending less 
time at home. Middle-class women, with no economic responsibilities, felt 
limited by household roles. The middle classes also started spending their free 
time seeking entertainment in theaters, concert halls, and sports facilities. 
(σecWsRn8UEDn$UeDs 
For the first half of the 1th century, urban areas grew rapidly and with little 
planning by governments. This development left a damaging ecological 
footprint and created inhumane living conditions for the cities’ poorest 
residents, members of the working class. Working families crowded into 
shoddily constructed tenement  apartment buildings, often owned by factory 
owners themselves. Tenements were often located in urban slums  (areas 
of cities where low-income families were forced to live, where industrial 
by-products such as polluted water supplies and open sewers were common. 
In conditions like these, disease, including the much-feared cholera, 
spread quickly. So did other public health menaces, such as fire and crime 
and violence. Over time, municipalities created police and fire departments, 
and several public health acts were passed to implement sanitation reform 
by creating better drainage and sewage systems, supplying cleaner water, 
removing rubbish, and building standards to reduce accidents and fire.  
Eventually, industrialization led to increased living standards for many. 
While life could be very hard for poor and working class people, the growing 
middle class had increased access to goods, housing, culture, and education. 
344 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe wealth and opportunities of the middle class were among the reasons 
people continued to stream into cities from rural areas. People living in poverty 
on farms or in villages hoped to find a better life in an urban center. Many did.
Effects on Class Structure  As industrialization spread, new classes of 
society emerged in Britain. At the bottom rungs of the social hierarchy were 
those who labored in factories and coal mines. They were known as the 
working class . Though they helped construct goods rapidly, the technology of 
interchangeable parts and the factory system’s division of labor had deprived 
workers of the experience of crafting a complete product. In comparison to 
the artisans of earlier generations, workers needed fewer skills, so managers 
viewed them as easily replaceable. Competition for jobs kept wages low.

Industrialization created new jobs in factories upper and offices lower that pulled people from rural 
areas into urban areas, a process that continues around the world today.
345 SOCIET Y AND THE INDUSTRI AL AGE345While industrialization created low-skilled jobs, it also required those who 
managed the production of goods to have education and sophisticated skills. 
A new middle class emerged, consisting of factory and office managers, small 
business owners, and professionals. They were white-collar  workers, those 
held by office workers. Most were literate and considered middle class.
At the top of the new class hierarchy were the industrialists and owners of 
large corporations. These so-called captains of industry soon overshadowed 
the landed aristocracy as the power brokers and leaders of modern society.
Farm Work Versus Factory Work  Before industrialization, family 
members worked in close proximity to one another. Whether women spun 
fabric in their own homes or landless workers farmed the fields of a landlord, 
parents and children usually spent their working hours close to each other. 
Industrialization disrupted this pattern. Industrial machinery was used in large 
factories, making it impossible to work from home. Thus, individuals had to 
leave their families and neighborhoods for a long workday in order to earn 
enough money to survive. 
In a factory, work schedules were nothing like they were on a farm or 
in a cottage industry. The shrill sounds of the factory whistle told workers 
when they could take a break, which was obviously a culture shock to former-
farmers who had previously completed tasks according to their own needs and 
schedules. Considering that workers commonly spent 14 hours a day, six days 
a week in a factory, exhaustion was common. Some of these exhausted workers 
operated dangerous heavy machinery. Injuries and death were common.
Effects on Children  The low wages of factory workers forced them to 
send their children to work also. In the early decades of industrialization, 
children as young as five worked in textile mills. Because of their small size 
and nimble fingers, children could climb into equipment to make repairs or into 
tight spots in mines. However, the dust from the textile machinery damaged 
their lungs just as much as it did to adults’ lungs. 
Children who worked in coal mines faced even more dangerous conditions 
than those in mills:
• They labored in oppressive heat, carting heavy loads of coal.
• Coal dust was even more unhealthy to breathe than factory dust.
• Mine collapses and floods loomed as constant threats to life.
Effect on Women’s Lives  The Industrial Revolution affected women in 
different ways, depending on their class position. Because their families needed 
the money, working-class women worked in coal mines until the practice of 
hiring women for coal mining was declared illegal in Britain in the 180s and 
were the primary laborers in textile factories. Factory owners preferred to hire 
women because they could pay them half of what they paid men.
Middle-class women were spared factory work, yet in many ways they 
lived more limited lives than working-class women. Middle-class men had to 
346 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONleave the house and work at an office to provide for their families. If a wife 
stayed at home, it was an indication that her husband was capable of being the 
family’s sole provider. Being a housewife thus became a status symbol. 
By the late 1800s, advertising and consumer culture contributed to a “cult 
of domesticity” that idealized the female homemaker. Advertising encouraged 
women to buy household products that would supposedly make the home a 
husband’s place of respite from a harsh modern world. Pamphlets instructed 
middle-class women on how to care for the home, raise children, and behave 
in polite society and urged them to be pious, submissive, pure, and domestic. 
For working-class women the cult of domesticity was even more taxing, as 
they had to manage the household, care for their children, and work full time. 
Industrialization also spurred feminism. When men left a community to 
take a job, their absence opened up new opportunities for the women who 
remained home. One political sign of this feminism came in 188 at Seneca 
Falls, New York, when 00 people met to call for equality for women.
Effects on the Environment  The Industrial Revolution was powered by 
fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Although burning coal 
produced more energy than burning wood, the effects were extremely harmful. 
Industrial towns during the late 19th century were choked by toxic air pollution 
produced by coal-burning factories. Smog smoke and fog from factories led 
to deadly respiratory problems. Water became polluted, also, as the new 
industries dumped their waste into streams, rivers, and lakes. Cholera, typhoid, 
and other diseases ravaged neighborhoods. 
Source:  John Leech, 3unch, July , 1858.
Before London built a system of public sanitation, the Thames 
River, the source of the city’s drinking water, was filled with 
sewage and industrial pollution. The river spread deadly diseases 
throughout the city.
347 SOCIET Y AND THE INDUSTRI AL AGEIndustrial Revolution’s Legacy
The Industrial Revolution brought about profound changes. Mass production  
made goods cheaper, more abundant, and more easily accessible to a greater 
number of people than ever before. Growth of factories attracted people to 
move, both from rural areas to cities and from agrarian countries to industrial 
ones. Both low-skilled workers and high-skilled professionals moved to take 
advantage of new opportunities provided by industrialization. 
However, the natural by-products of industrial production polluted air 
and water supplies. Industry forever changed the nature of work and the lives 
of workers. Working populations became concentrated in urban centers, as 
opposed to being spread among rural areas. The workplace shifted from homes 
to factories, dramatically altering family life. The Industrial Revolution created 
a new²and many said unequal²working relationship between workers and 
owners. More crowding and more poverty brought more crime.
Global inequalities also increased because of industrialization. States that 
industrialized early desired more raw materials to power their production. They 
searched the world for items such as cotton and rubber. By exploiting overseas 
natural resources, they undercut early industrialization in Egypt, China, and 
India, and ushered in a second wave of colonization.

populated enclave was once renowned for jam-packed, filthy tenements, 
garbage-covered streets, prostitution, gambling, violence, drunkenness, and 
abject poverty. . . . 
Few historians devoted much attention to Five Points in the early years of

CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE  IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGE351
5.10
Continuity and Change  
in the Industrial Age
Capital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power.
—-riedrich Engels and 2arl 4ar_, The Communist Manifesto (1848)
Essential Question:   How did the Industrial 9evolution demonstrate both 
continuity and change? 
The Industrial Revolution, an era that began in the late 18th century, produced 
economic, social, cultural, political, and environmental changes not seen 
since the first Agricultural Revolution, more than 10,000 years before. The 
Industrial Revolution changed how goods were produced, how people earned 
their living, and how businesses were structured. The Industrial Revolution 
also caused sweeping social changes. 
An expansion of the middle class in industrial economies occurred. A 
working class, dependent on factory jobs, emerged. The role of women was 
transformed, as they made up a significant portion of the factory work force. 
Politically, the Enlightenment proved to be a long-lasting and influential 
intellectual movement that influenced events during the Industrial Revolution. 
The effects of the Industrial Revolution inspired the works of economic 
and political philosophers like Adam Smith and .arl Marx. The Industrial 
Revolution altered life locally as well as globally. Rivalries among nations, 
which had existed previously, continued into and throughout this era leading 
to political and economic conflict. Additionally, rigid social orders, based on 
economic or ethnic status, continued within industrial economies. 
Economic Continuities and Changes
The Industrial Revolution transformed the production and consumption of 
goods. In Western Europe, access to abundant natural resources, transoceanic 
trade routes, and  financial capital combined with an increasing population 
resulted in a leadership role in industrialization. The Scientific Revolution, 
begun in the previous era and influenced by scientific knowledge transferred to 
the West from the Islamic world, helped to bring about inventions that would 
lead to the establishment of the factory system and the mass production of 
goods. However, the invention of the machines used to mass produce goods 
352 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONmeant a change from the era of skilled artisans working at their own pace 
to craft unique and well-built products. With automation, many factory jobs 
required only unskilled labor working on an assembly line doing repetitive 
tasks to produce identical goods. As a result, many consumer goods were now 
more readily available, more affordable, and in greater variety than ever before.
Industrialization Around the World  New methods of industrial 
production associated with the Industrial Revolutions spread and changed the 
economies of other areas of the world outside of Western Europe. As a result, the 
United States, Russia, and Japan experienced increased industrial production 
and built more railroads. In the cases of Japan and Egypt, industrialization was 
encouraged through state sponsored efforts to modernize their economies with 
varying degrees of success. However, the industrial economies of Western 
Europe and the United States continued to dominate the global economy while 
the manufacturing output of Middle Eastern and Asian economies declined.

Sources of Raw Materials  Some regions of the world continued to 
produce minerals, crops, and other resources as they had done in previous eras. 
Latin America and Africa were important sources of minerals and metals used 
in industrial processes. Cotton from Egypt, South Asia, and the Caribbean was 
grown and exported to Great Britain and other European countries. Southeast 
Asian areas continued to be sources for spices but also for rubber, tin, and 
timber. 
New sources of raw materials were also made possible by the invention 
of the steam ship and steam locomotive. Maritime trade was made faster and 
cheaper due to steam power, and railroads built in interior regions helped to 
access and exploit previously untapped natural resources. Other inventions 
such as the telegraph helped to improve communication across these far flung 
and sometimes remote areas. These and other technological innovations made 
the movement of goods and people easier and cheaper and led to an increase 
in global trade.
Western Europe  Western Europe began to change from a mercantilist 
economic system designed to make a country wealthy through tightly regulated 
trade to a capitalist system in which private companies were freer to pursue 
their own profits. Philosopher and political economist Adam Smith believed 
that the private pursuit of profit would result in general prosperity . 
353 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGE 353While industrialization and capitalism produced great wealth overall, many 
people had hard, short lives. In response to this suffering, many reformers 
argued for changes. One of these was the German philosopher Karl Marx. 
He argued that the working class, whom he called the proletariat, were being 
exploited by the capital class, or bourgeoisie. He called for workers to unite 
and take control of the means of production, a change that would revolutionize 
society.
Social Continuities and Changes
Industrialization caused significant changes to social structures of Western 
Europe and, later, the United States. Prior to industrialization, the population 
of Western Europe was primarily rural and involved in farming. As factories 
were built in urban centers in greater numbers, mainly due to a new steam 
engine design invented by James Watt, agricultural workers soon migrated to 
find employment in these industrial cities. 
Physical Labor  As the Industrial Revolution spread, the need for factory 
labor increased. An industrial working class emerged. Members of this class 
were paid low wages, worked long hours in poor conditions, lived in squalid 
housing, and resided in crowded and polluted parts of the new industrial cities. 
Much of their daily lives revolved around their jobs in the factories. This was 
a change from the agricultural economy of the previous era, when farmers 
and farm laborers could more or less set their own work schedule based on 
the seasons. In response to their working and living conditions, the working 
class formed worker associations, or labor unions, that used labor strikes and 
collective bargaining to win concessions on wages, working conditions, and 
hours from the factory owners.
2Ifice /aEor  Along with the emergence of the industrial working class, 
the Industrial Revolution also changed the size and make-up of the middle class. 
In pre-industrial society, the middle class was often made up of professionals 
such as doctors and lawyers as well as local merchants or shopkeepers. As 
industrialization occurred, while these pre-industrial occupations continued 
to be part of the middle class, other occupations were added to it, including 
the middle-management of factories, banks, insurance companies, shipping 
agents, and, of course, trading companies.

354 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe Wealthy  The Industrial Revolution also transformed social 
hierarchies in the period from 1750 to 1900. Wealthy owners of industrial 
companies who made money from investments rather than from land overtook 
the aristocracy in wealth and prestige. These capitalists soon made up the 
highest of the upper class in industrial societies. 
Gender and Industrialization  The role of women changed significantly 
during the Industrial Revolution. In an agricultural economy, women provided 
labor at critical times during the planting and harvesting season but were rarely 
paid for their labor. In a proto-industrial system, women were able to earn 
some extra money in the manufacturing of textiles. 
Despite these activities, women were still mainly supported by the labor 
and income of their male family members. This pattern began to change with 
the Industrial Revolution. Due to the low wages paid by the factories, all family 
needed to work. Hence, a woman’s income was just as important to the welfare 
of the family as a man’s. Despite the importance of female labor, women were 
often paid less than men for the same work and denied high-wage jobs.
Political Continuities and Changes
As during the Enlightenment, philosophers living through the Industrial 
Revolution era developed new political ideas about the individual and 
government. During the Industrial Revolution, most people had little to no 
formal voice in government such as the right to vote, but they demanded the 
ability to exercise their “natural rights.” Among these were the rights to petition, 
protest, and rebel against their governments. Sometimes these protests were 
based on nationalism and the right of people to choose their own governments. 
However, political movements of the Industrial Revolution were almost 
always connected to the interests of the growing middle and working classes. 
For example, labor leaders advocated formation of international unions so that 
workers in various countries could unite to demand higher wages. But the 
vast majority of the protests were for the right to vote and to end aristocratic 
privileges. A series of uprising throughout European cities in 188, known as 
the Revolution of 188, were a sign of the growing interest in more pluralistic, 
more democratic governments :
• In Paris , protesters called for greater freedom of the press. 
• In Berlin, people wanted a parliament to check the monarch’s power. 
• In cities in Hungary, people demanded freedom from Austrian control. 
People wanted not just general natural rights, but specific rights recognized by 
their government.
Voting Rights  As the number of wealthy capitalists and the middle class 
grew, more frequent calls for greater political participation were made. As 
a result, some political reforms were enacted that included the extension of 
voting rights to city dwellers, non-landowners, and, eventually, to the working 
355 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGE class. However, the voting franchise was extended to male voters only. 
Women would not gain the right to vote in Western industrial countries until 
the early 20th century. Sometimes voting rights were extended through the 
legislative process, as in Great Britain. However, in other instances, protests 
and revolutions forced governments to enact political reforms. 
One factor in all of these political reforms was the size and influence of the 
middle class. In countries where the middle class was large and economically 
significant, democracy emerged. However, in regions where the middle class 
was small or insignificant, dictatorships remained in place.

The economic changes of industrial capitalism countered the laborer’s vision of social 
equality, citizenship, and independence. As two distinct classes developed, the rich and the 
poor, advocating for equal rights became a movement that spanned the 1th century.
Protections for Workers  Reforms that began in one country often 
spread. For example, Otto V on Bismarck’s social reforms spread throughout 
Europe and eventually the world. All industrializing nations grappled with the 
new challenges that factory life introduced. Among these nations, Germany 
implemented the most comprehensive set of social reforms to protect 
industrial workers. Under the leadership of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, 
Germany started workers’ accident compensation insurance, unemployment 
insurance, and old age pensions for employees. Bismarck was concerned 
that if his government did not address these problems, socialists and more 
radical citizens would demand stronger government action. 
356 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITION
Another effect of the expansion of voting rights was the emergence of 
political parties that represented the working class. These “labor parties” 
advocated for minimum wages, shorter work days, paid sick and holiday 
leave, better working conditions, and health and unemployment insurance.

UNIT 5 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  DID OTTOM AN REFORMS  SUCCEE D?
The industrial era was a period of massive political, economic, and 
social upheaval. Historians have argued over how effectively the 
Ottomans adapted to these changes. 
A Long, Slow Decline  Historians in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries, living in a period when Turkish power was low, generally 
viewed the Ottoman Empire as the “sick man of Europe.” Some mark 
its fall as beginning with its failure to conquer 9ienna in 168. In 
his widely used college textbook, $ +istory of the 0odern :orld 
first published in 150, R. R. Palmer stated that the long slide of 
the 1th-century Ottoman Empire put the empire “behind modern 
industrial nations in its scientific, mechanical, material, humanitarian, 
and administrative achievements.” Its reforms did little to stop the 
slide.
Strength Through Reforms  Recent historians, living in a period 
of increasing Turkish influence in the Middle East, have seen more 
vigor in the Ottomans than did previous scholars. They have credited 
1th-century reforms with providing a stable foundation for the 
success of the Republic of Turkey, established in 12. For example, 
the historian Donald Quataert argued that the Ottomans stabilized 
the economy and gave Europeans more confidence to invest in 
railroads, ports, and public utilities. These projects provided a modern 
infrastructure for the empire, although at the loss of some autonomy 
for the Ottoman government.
While acknowledging the difficulties that capitulations caused, 
Suraiya Faroqhi emphasized that “more recent studies prove that 
Ottoman commerce and artisan production were more varied than they 
might appear at first glance.” Justin McCarthy called the changes in 
the Ottoman system “neither small nor cosmetic,” pointing to “human 
rights, a constitution, Christians in high office, a parliament, the 
middle class in charge of the state, and the power of Islam eroded” as 
evidence of progress on multiple fronts. McCarthy further suggested 
that the empire fell not because of lack of successful reforms or the 
failure to modernize but because of the military power of its rivals.
Develop an Argument:  Evaluate the extent to which historical 
evidence supports one of the perspectives on Ottoman reform.

WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  DEVELO P A THESIS
The thesis statement must 1 assert a historically defensible claim, 2 lay 
out a line of reasoning, and  directly address the topic and focus of the 
task.  
Historically Defensible Claim  A  t h e s i s ,  o r  c l a i m ,  i s  a  n o n f a c t u a l  
statement asserted to be true. It is a statement about which people can 
disagree because it requires an explanation or evaluation. A historically 
defensible claim is one that can be supported with sound historical evidence. 
For example, Marx forwarded the claim that the materials and modes of 
production rather than philosophical ideas shape social structures. He used 
examples from history of the influence of changing production methods²
hunter-gatherer, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, and communism²as 
evidence to defend his claim.
Line of Reasoning  A thesis or claim also conveys a line of reasoning for 
the argument that will be used to explain the relationships among pieces of 
evidence. In Marx’s thesis, for example, the line of reasoning is causation  
the modes of production cause the structure of social relations. Other lines of 
reasoning include comparison and continuitychange. Each line of reasoning 
needs to be embedded in a strong thesis statement. Here are two examples:
&omparison thesis statement  Social relations fundamentally differed  
under the production methods of the feudal system and the production 
methods of capitalism.
&ontinuitychange thesis statement  W h i l e  s o c i a l  r e l a t i o n s  c h a n g e d  
as the purposes and modes of production changed, the resulting social 
structures continued to have an underprivileged class, a continuity with 
long-lasting effects. 
Topic and Focus of Task A strong thesis or claim directly addresses 
the topic and focus of the task. It must be limited to the time and geography 
stated in the long essay question. 
Part of the task will be to “evaluate the extent to which . . . . .” In this 
context, “extent” means degree, scale, magnitude, scope, size, or level. To 
determine extent, you need to carefully analyze and evaluate the similarities 
or differences, continuities or changes, or causes and effects, depending on 
the task you are given. Which were most important, significant, influential, 
long-lasting, or in other ways largest in scope" And, just as important, what 
are your reasons and evidence for evaluating the extent as you did? 
/ong (ssay 4uestion Develop an argument that evaluates the extent 
to which the course of state-sponsored industrialization in Egypt under 
Muhammad Ali and in Japan under the Meiji regime between 150 and 
1900 was similar or different. 
 359
7hesis that clearly addresses the topic and tasN  Between 1750 and 
100, the governments of both Muhammad Ali in Egypt and the Meiji 
regime in Japan employed state-sponsored programs of industrialization 
to help them create a European-style military, but a difference in the nature 
and purpose of each program’s products led to significantly differing 
courses. (Note that the word significantly begins to address extent.
Application: Read the following long essay question and a thesis 
statement developed to address it. Evaluate the thesis statement on how 
well it 1 expresses a historically defensible claim, 2 embeds a line of 
reasoning, and  addresses the topic and task, including evaluating extent, 
and stays within the limitations of the question. Revise the thesis statement 
as appropriate so that it meets all three standards.

The position of women in Japan is apparently unlike that of the sex in 
all other parts of the East, and approaches more nearly their European 
condition. The Japanese women are subjected to no jealous seclusion, 
hold a fair station in society, and share in all the innocent recreations of 
their fathers and husbands. The minds of the women are cultivated with 
as much care as those of men; and amongst the most admired Japanese 
historians, moralists, and poets are found several female names. But, 
though permitted thus to enjoy and adorn society, they are, on the other 
hand, >kept in@ complete dependence on their husbands, sons, or other 
relatives. They have no legal rights, and their evidence is not admitted in 
a court . . . At home, the wife is the mistress of the family; but in other 
respects she is treated rather as a toy for her husband’s amusement, than 
as the rational, confidential partner of his life.

When I encountered silk workers I was even more shocked than I had been 
by the situation of weaving workers.… At busy times they go straight to 
work on rising in the morning, and not infrequently work through until 
12:00 at night. The food is six parts barley to four parts rice. The sleeping 
quarters resemble pigsties, so squalid are they. What I found especially 
shocking is that in some districts, when business is slack, the workers are 
sent out into service for a fixed period, with the employer taking all their 
earnings… Many of the girls coming to the silk districts pass through the 
hands of recruiting agents. In some cases they may be there for two to 
three years and never even know the name of the neighboring town. The 
local residents think of those who have entered the ranks of the factory 
girls in the same manner as tea house girls, bordering on degradation.  If 
one had to take pity on just one group among all these workers, it must be 
first and foremost the silk workers.Enrollment in Japanese Primary Schools

de Sagasta, 186.
Every day we see men with unscrewed-on heads who have no love for order 
nor true affection for their families, who spend their lives on gambling and 
rambling around cold-bloodedly, they leave their children on the street, 
because their wives, whose sphere of action is reduced only to love and 
suffering, do not know how to oppose forcefully the squandering nor how 
to stop in time the abuses from their husbands nor save in this way the 
interests of their children. 
Emancipation protects women from this catastrophe. A woman, 
educated in the management of business, even if she does not make a 
profession of it, knows how to prevent or remedy the problem once it 
has occurred. She does not go through the pain of seeing her children 
begging for bread from door to door, because she has a thousand resources 
to satisfy their needs honorably. She goes to work, and thus she raises 
her children without the need for others’ support that could lead her to 
corruption and to spend a miserable and humiliating life. Love can dry 
tears and sweeten the bitterness of life, but it cannot satisfy hunger nor 
cover nakedness. Love cannot be developed on a sublime and heroic level 
unless one is prepared to work, to put sentiment into practice. 
Emancipation, conceding to women great rights, instills in them a 
great heart that takes them closer to the true perfection to which men can 
aspire here on earth. A woman who, to her physical beauty and spirituality, 
adds education and the ability to act for good in her vast sphere, is the 
ideal type imagined by Christianity, and she is going to carry out progress 
in this century.

Industrialization from  
c. 1750 to c. 1900
Understand the Context
Technological change provided the framework for the historical changes 
between 1750 and 1900. Industrial growth fostered a wider exchange of 
commodities, the expansion of overseas empires, and new patterns of migration. 
Imperialism  Competition among industrializing states increased the 
desire for colonies. Some states strengthened control over existing colonies, 
as the British did in India. Empires expanded into new regions, evident in 
the rapid European colonization of Africa. Economic imperialism emerged 
in parts of Latin American and Asia. Europeans used Social Darwinism and 
religious ideologies to justify their control of others. In general, the Portuguese 
and Spanish declined, the British and French and Russia expanded, and the 
United States and Japan emerged as new empires. 
Resistance to Imperialism  In response to imperialism, anticolonial 
movements developed as part of a larger trend of emerging nationalism. 
Resistance to imperialism took many forms, including rebellion, the 
establishment of peripheral states, and religiously influenced responses. These 
movements set the stage for decolonization in the 20th century.
Migration  New means of transportation and the pull of economic 
opportunity spurred long-distance migration and a larger trend of global 
urbanization. Although many people chose to migrate, coerced migration 
was also common, as slavery and indentured servitude continued to play a 
significant role in the global economy. Increased migration changed the 
demographics and cultures of both sending and receiving societies. 17501850 180019001780

RATIONALES FOR IM PERIALISM 367
3676.1
Rationales for Imperialism
Take up the White Man’s Burden—  
Send forth the best ye breed—  
Go bind your sons to exile  
To serve your captives’ need;  
To wait in heavy harness,  
6n fluttered folk and wild·  
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,  
Half-devil and half-child.
—Rudyard Kipling, “The White Man’s Burden,” 1899
Essential Question:   What ideologies contributed to the development of 
imperialism between 1750 and 1900?
Rudyard Kipling was an English writer who spent his youth in British 
colonial India. The speaker in his poem urged the whites of Western countries 
to establish colonies for the good of the “inferior” people of the word. Whether 
Kipling actually supported this idea is not clear, but his poem was used to justify 
it. Proponents justified European colonization using a variety of explanations, 
from a belief in nationalism, a desire for economic wealth, a sense of religious 
duty, and a belief they were biologically superior. These various motives for 
establishing overseas empires—a policy called imperialism —would lead to 
conflicts in Asia and a scramble to colonize Africa. See Topic 6.2.
Nationalist Motives for Imperialism
In Western Europe, revolutions, the rise of nationalism, and the creation of 
nation-states characterized much of the 1800s. With a strong sense of identity 
and loyalty to a state, many world powers boldly asserted authority over other 
territories. Building an empire in Asia or Africa was one way for a country to 
assert its national identity in the global arena. Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, 
and the Netherlands would long possess overseas colonies.
European Nationalism  After losing its American colonies, Britain looked 
for new lands to open to settlement. In 188 the first British settlers arrived in 
the colony of New South Wales on the east coast of the island continent of New 
368 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONHolland²today’s Australia. See Topic 6.2. Britain was also expanding its 
influence in South Asia, gradually taking control of India from the East India 
Company. By 1857 Britain controlled the entire Indian subcontinent. Ceylon 
Sri Lanka, Burma Myanmar, the Malay States which included Singapore, 
and parts of Borneo in Southeast Asia were also under British control.
France compensated for its humiliating defeat by Prussia in the Franco-
Prussian War 180±181 by expanding its overseas territories. It had already 
occupied Algeria in Northern Africa, New Caledonia and other islands in the 
South Pacific, Senegal in Western Africa, and Indochina in Southeast Asia.
Italy and Germany were newly unified states in the late-1th century. 
Each wanted colonies not only for economic and strategic reasons but also 
for prestige. However, neither began acquiring an empire until the mid-1880s.
While Spain had led the quest for colonies in the first wave of imperialism 
during the 16th and 1th centuries, its power was greatly diminished by the 
19th century. It did not play a dominant role in this second wave of imperialism.
Japan in East Asia  Japan asserted its nationalist pride through incursions 
into Korea. This irritated China, a country that had exerted a strong presence 
in .orea for centuries. The conflict grew into the Sino-Japanese War  18±
185. Japan’s victory gave it control of .orea. Japan also seized Taiwan, 
which was known as Formosa  from the time of Portuguese colonization in the

the late 19th and early 20th centuries that encouraged the growth of Japanese

Cultural and Religious Motives for Imperialism
The Kipling quotation that opens this topic epitomized the condescending 
attitudes shared by imperialism’s proponents. Referring to colonized peoples 
as children reflected how colonizers saw themselves as benevolent protectors 
on a “civilizing mission” rather than invaders. 
Racial Ideologies and the Misuse of Science  The attitudes of whites 
toward others were a form of racism. Colonial powers generally believed 
that they were inherently superior to those they subjugated. Pseudoscientists, 
people who present theories as science that are actually incompatible with the 
scientific method, strengthened these attitudes. They claimed to have proof 
of the intellectual and physical inferiority of nonwhite races. Phrenologists , 
people who studied skull sizes and shapes, believed that a smaller skull size 
proved the mental feebleness of Africans, indigenous Americans, and Asians. 
These ideas have been proven false.
Legitimate science was also subverted to support imperialism. British 
scientist Charles Darwin’s  19th-century theory of evolution by natural 
selection stated that over millions of years, biological competition had “weeded 
out” the weaker species in nature and that the “fittest” species were the ones 
that survived. Some thinkers adapted Darwin’s theory of biological evolution 
to society, creating the theory known as Social Darwinism. While Darwin 
369 RATIONALES FOR IM PERIALISMhimself was not a Social Darwinist, advocates used the “survival of the fittest” 
theory to argue that the spread of European and U.S. power proved the 
biological superiority of whites. Writers and politicians then used Social 
Darwinism to justify further imperialism by powerful countries.
Cultural Ideologies  Based on technological superiority over indigenous 
societies, colonial powers felt justified in superimposing aspects of their 
own cultures on their colonies. For administrative purposes, many colonies 
combined into a single colony peoples from several cultures who often spoke 
different languages and had different customs. Colonizers introduced their 
own language, which helped to unify these often diverse colonies. They also 
introduced their political, educational, and religious institutions and exerted 
other cultural influences on architecture and recreational activities. Expressing 
the belief of many, Congregationalist minister Josiah Strong wrote in 1885, “Is 
there room for reasonable doubt that [the Anglo-Saxon] race . . . is destined 
to dispossess many weaker races, assimilate others, and mold the remainder, 
until, in a very true and important sense, it has Anglo-Saxonized mankind?”  
Religious Motives  Missionaries were among the most tireless “civilizing” 
influences. Like the Spanish and Portuguese Catholic missionaries who 
combined conquest and evangelism during the Age of Discovery, British

and Feejee Islands, and Through the Colonies of New Zealand, New South Wales  188.
The image of a New Zealand village reflects how Europeans viewed native village people as simple. 
370 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONProtestant missionaries of the 18th and 19th centuries also participated 
in colonization. Critics charged that missionaries supported imperialism 
by persuading people to give up their traditional beliefs, such as ancestor 
veneration, and adopt the faith of most Europeans, Christianity. This change 
in religion could pave the way for others who were more focused on economic 
gain. In response, missionaries pointed out that they commonly combined 
religious and humanitarian efforts:
• Missionaries often set up schools for instruction in religion that also 
taught secular subjects, which prepared students to become teachers, 
lawyers, and other professionals. 
• Many missionaries provided improved medicines and medical care. 
• Some missionaries, most famously David Livingstone  from Scotland, 
worked in Sub-Saharan Africa to end the illegal slave trade. 
Economic Motives for Imperialism 
Some people believe the ideological motivations were more accurately 
justifications for pursuing economic motives. Seeking ways to maximize 
profits, companies chartered by the British, French, and Dutch governments 
signed commercial treaties with local rulers in India, East Africa, and the East 
Indies. These treaties gave the Europeans the right to establish trading posts and 
forts to protect their interests. Originally, these companies formed primarily 
for the spice trade. Many companies had quasi-governmental powers, raising 
armies and conquering territory to form colonies. 
As the Industrial Revolution transformed European economies, the desire 
for the sources for raw materials and markets for manufactured goods provided 
by colonies enticed imperial powers to increase their expansion. Imperial 
powers often competed with one another over the best potential resources, 
markets, and trade as demands for low-wage labor, access to markets, and 
control of natural resources increased.
East India Company  The English monarch granted the  East India 
Company  EIC a royal charter in 1600 giving it a monopoly on England’s 
trade with India. After driving the Portuguese out of India, the company traded 
primarily in cotton and silk, indigo, and spices. 
Eventually, the EIC expanded its activities from the Persian Gulf to East 
Asia. By the beginning of the 18th century, it had become the major agent of 
British imperialism in India, and after 18 it became the British government’s 
managing agency in India. Starting in 1620, the EIC engaged in the slave trade, 
and during the 19th century it illegally exported opium to China in exchange 
for tea. The East India Company is often referred to as the English East India 
Company or, after 1707, the British East India Company to distinguish it from 
the Dutch East India Company.
371 RATIONALES FOR IM PERIALISMDutch East India Company  In 1602 the Dutch government gave the 
Dutch East India Company  9ereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, or 
VOC  a monopoly on trade between the Cape of Good Hope at the southern 
tip of Africa and the Straits of Magellan at the southern tip of South America. 
The 9OC concentrated on the islands around Java, replacing the Portuguese 
who had controlled the region. Corruption and debt led the government to take 
control of the company’s possessions in 1799, creating the Dutch East Indies 
today’s Indonesia.
The “New Imperialism”  After the Industrial Revolution and the 
Napoleonic Wars, Britain was the leading economic power throughout the 
first half of the 1th century and already had a sizable colonial empire. Its 
colonies provided raw materials such as cotton, wool, jute, vegetable oils, and 
rubber for its factories, as well as foodstuffs such as wheat, tea, coffee, cocoa, 
meat, and butter for its growing cities. Its colonies—especially settler colonies 
such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa—also provided markets for 
British manufactured goods.
As the Second Industrial Revolution progressed, other nations began 
to challenge Britain’s economic lead. They looked to Asia, Africa, and the 
Pacific to expand their markets, provide raw materials for their factories, and 
food for their growing urban populations.Source:  Getty Images

372 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS 
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“The English in India had always been somewhat more detached from the 
indigenous environment than the Dutch in Indonesia. After the 1780s, their 
isolation gradually intensified and became obvious with the decline in status 
of Eurasian Anglo-Indians. . . . The club became the center of British social 
life in India and the other Asian colonies during the 9ictorian era. In clubs, one 
could feel like a gentleman among other gentlemen while being served by a 
native staff. . . . The large clubs of Calcutta remained closed to Indians until 
16. This type of color bar was especially disturbing because it excluded 
from social recognition the very people who had carried their self-Anglicizing 
[becoming more like the British] the furthest and loyally supported British 
rule. . . . 
In most regions of Africa . . . the Europeans saw themselves as foreign 
rulers separated from the African cultures by an abyss. . . . A process of great 
symptomatic significance was the rejection of the highly educated West 
Africans who had worked with the early mission. They had envisioned the 
colonial takeover as an opportunity for a joint European-African effort to 
modernize and civilize Africa. Instead, they were now, as ‘white Negroes,’ 
despised by all.”
Jurgen Osterhammel, Colonialism , 1997

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that 
follows. 
“Gentlemen, we must speak more loudly and more honestly! We must say 
openly that indeed the higher races have a right over the lower races. . . . 
I repeat, that the superior races have a right because they have a duty. 
They have the duty to civilize the inferior races. . . . In the history of 
earlier centuries these duties, gentlemen, have often been misunderstood; 
and certainly when the Spanish soldiers and explorers introduced slavery 
into Central America, they did not fulfill their duty as men of a higher  
race. . . . But, in our time, I maintain that European nations acquit themselves 
with generosity, with grandeur, and with sincerity of this superior civilizing 
duty. I say that French colonial policy, the policy of colonial expansion, the 
policy that has taken us under the Empire [the Second Empire, of Napoleon 
III], to Saigon, to Indochina [French Southeast Asia], that has led us to Tunisia, 
to Madagascar±I say that this policy of colonial expansion was inspired  
by . . . the fact that a navy such as ours cannot do without safe harbors, 
defenses, supply centers on the high seas . . . . Are you unaware of this? Look 
at a map of the world.”

COLONIZATION  OF AFRICA
In 188±1885, in response to Germany’s arrival as a competitive force

Conference to develop some guidelines and agreements for colonizing 
Africa. See Topic 6.2.

REFLECT ON THE TOPIC ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. In one to three paragraphs, explain the part ideologies played in the 
development of imperialism between 1750 and 1900.
STATE E XPANSION 375
6.2
State Expansion
You must singularly insist on their total submission and obedience, avoid 
developing the spirits in the schools, teach students to read and not to reason.
—King Leopold II (1835–1909), Letter to Christian Missionaries, 1883
Essential Question:   By what processes did state power shift in various 
parts of the world between 1750 and 1900?
King Leopold II of Belgium wanted the Belgian government to conquer 
colonies in a large swath of central Africa—the Congo Basin. The government 
was ambivalent, so Leopold established a private colony himself. However, 
the Belgian Parliament found the king’s rule so abusive that in 1908 it took 
control of the region away from him. Similarly, the Dutch government revoked 
the charter of the Dutch East India Company for abusing its power to make 
treaties, build forts, and maintain armed forces in Southeast Asia. While these 
unusual shifts of power were taking place, other European governments, as 
well as the United States, Russia, and Japan, continued territorial expansion 
through conquest and settlement.
Imperialism in Africa
Europe had a long-standing relationship with Africa because of the slave trade. 
Although most European countries had declared the importation of Africans 
as slave labor illegal by the early 1800s, Europeans continued to export guns, 
alcohol, and other manufactured goods to Africa and import African natural 
resources, such as palm oil, gold, and ivory. England desired palm oil in 
particular because it kept the machinery in its textile factories from becoming 
rusty. In the last part of the 19th century, European tastes for African diamonds 
and ivory kept European empires thriving throughout the African continent. 
Connect: Write a paragraph connecting late 1th century imperialism with the 
African slave trade. See Topic ..
Expanding Beyond Trading Posts  For most of the 1800s, European 
presence in Africa was restricted to trading posts, with a few exceptions. The 
French seized Algeria in 1830, declaring they wanted to prevent pirate attacks. 
Dutch immigrants had lived in South Africa since the 1600s and British 
colonists became more numerous starting in the early 1800s. In the second 
376 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONhalf of the 1800s, European nations expanded their presence in Africa with the 
help of better military technology. For example, the discovery of quinine,  a 
medicine that treats the tropical disease malaria, reduced the danger of living 
in warm, humid regions. The steamship assisted the early trips of individual 
explorers and business owners.
British Control of Egypt  Europeans had long dreamed of dramatically 
shortening the water route to Asia by building a canal connecting the Red Sea 
with the Mediterranean Sea. A 100-mile-long canal could save a trip around 
the entire continent of Africa. This feat was finally accomplished in 186 when 
the Suez Canal was completed. A French company managed the project, but 
most of the labor was performed by as many as 1.5 million Egyptians. Many of 
them were corvée laborers,  unpaid workers who were forced to work on the 
project as a form of taxation. Thousands died in the course of ten years. When 
unrest in the region threatened British commercial interests and the operation 
of the canal in 1882, Britain seized control of Egypt away from the Ottoman 
Empire.
British West Africa  Great Britain established several colonies in West 
Africa before the mid-19th century. In these colonies, Britain spread Western 
education, the English language, and Christianity:
• Sierra Leone  was established in 1787. It was a home for freed people 
from throughout the British Empire who had been enslaved. 
• Gambia was established in 1816. It, and Sierra Leone, were used as 
bases to try to stop the export of enslaved people from the region. 
• Lagos became a crown colony in 1861 and served as a base for the 
annexation of much of the rest of what is now Nigeria. 
• Britain acquired parts of what is now Ghana in stages. For example, the 
Gold Coast  became a crown colony in 18, but the Asante Empire to 
the north did not come under British control until 1901.
Britain used both diplomacy and warfare to expand its empire. For 
example, in 1873, Britain signed a treaty with King Jaja of Opobo in present-
day Nigeria—an area rich in  palm oil—recognizing him as ruler and agreeing 
to trade terms favorable to both sides. Other African rulers agreed to similar 
diplomatic treaties with foreign powers, believing they were protecting their 
sovereignty and trade rights. However, as European competition increased for 
control of African lands, the treaties came to be meaningless and warfare was 
the inevitable result as Africans resisted takeover but met with overpowering 
military strength.
The French in Africa  France drove the Ottomans out of Algeria in 1830. 
By 1870 Algeria had become a settler colony , attracting Spanish, Italian, and 
Maltese as well as French immigrants. In the 180s the French also established 
trading posts in Guinea, the Ivory Coast, and Niger to compete with British 
West African colonies.
377 STATE E XPANSION 377The European Scramble for Africa  
Tensions mounted among industrialized European nations as they competed 
for natural resources in Africa. Leaders feared that the “Scramble for Africa,” 
the competing efforts of Europeans to colonize Africa, would lead to war.
Berlin Conference  Unlike many German leaders who had imperial 
ambitions, Otto von Bismarck had little interest in colonies. However, he 
did want to keep peace in Europe. So in 188±1885, he hosted the Berlin 
Conference, a meeting of European powers to provide for the orderly 
colonization of Africa. No Africans were invited to the conference. European 
powers peaceably agreed to colonial boundaries and to the free movement of 
goods on Africa’s major rivers such as the Niger River and the Congo River.
In most of the continent, Europeans established colonial borders that were 
merely artificial lines that meant little to the people who lived within them. 
These borders divided long-unified societies into different colonies and united 
longtime rival groups into the same colonies. When these colonies became 
independent states in the later 20th century, these borders became the cause of 
extensive warfare by making national unity very difficult.
South Africa and the Boer Wars  During the Napoleonic Wars  
1±1815, the British replaced the Dutch in the Cape Colony  in the southern 
tip of Africa. The British introduced the use of English but allowed people to 
use the Dutch language as well. Many of the Dutch-speaking Afrikaners , the 
descendants of 17th-century Dutch settlers, moved east of the Cape Colony, 
where they came into conflict with indigenous groups, including the =ulus, 
with whom they fought several wars.
Throughout the 19th century, the British and Afrikaners continued to 
fight over land. This conflict came to a boil in the Boer Wars  1880±1881, 
18±102. These conflicts were bloody and brutal. In the end, the British 
army drove the Afrikaners and the Africans from their lands, forcing many into 
refugee camps. These settlements, which were segregated by race, came to be 
known as concentration camps . Medical care and sanitation were very poor, 
and food rations were so meager that many of the interned died of starvation. 
Once news arrived in Britain about the wretched conditions of the camps, 
activists tried to improve the lives of displaced refugees. However, while 
white camps received some attention, conditions in black camps remained 
terrible. Of the 100,000 blacks interned in concentration camps, nearly 15,000 
perished. 
By the end of the Boer Wars, the British had absorbed the settler colonies 
of British and Afrikaner peoples and the black Africans in the southern tip of 
Africa into its empire. Millions of Afrikaner and black African farmers had 
been displaced onto poor land, making it hard for them to earn a decent living.  
Congo  By 1875, Western European nations were poised to penetrate 
Africa’s interior. King Leopold II  of Belgium ruled 1865±10 oversaw the 
invasion and pacification of the Congo in central Africa in order to persuade 
the Belgian government to support colonial expansion. Unlike other European 
378 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONrulers, .ing Leopold owned the colony personally, using colonial officials 
against indigenous Congolese and a ruthless system of economic exploitation 
that allowed him to keep the profits made by the Congo Free State , which 
totaled some 220 million francs 1.1 billion in today’s dollars. 
9isitors to the colony reported on the brutal conditions for the laborers who 
were forced to harvest ivory and rubber. For example, Leopold’s agents severed 
the hands of Congolese workers in order to terrorize others into submission. 
Workers who could not meet their quotas were beaten or killed, while others 
were worked to death. Although the term slavery  was not commonly used 
when describing imperial activities, laborers in the Congo often received no 
payment for their backbreaking work, and their spouses were held captive so 
that the workers would not run away. As many as 8 million people perished 
under King Leopold’s reign of terror in the Congo. In 1908, Belgium took over 
control of the Congo as a regular colony, and conditions improved. Connect:

379 STATE E XPANSIONIndependent Countries  By 1900, the only African countries unclaimed 
by Europeans were Abyssinia  modern-day Ethiopia and Liberia,  a country 
founded by formerly enslaved people from the United States. Because 
Liberia had a dependent relationship with the United States, it was not fully 
independent. Italy attempted to conquer Abyssinia in 1895, but the native 
forces were too strong for the Italians.
Imperialism in South Asia
Portugal, France, and England competed for control of India’s spices, gems, 
and trade with regions to the east. Portugal established a coastal trading port 
on the southwestern coast, in Goa, in the early 16th century. However, it 
never extended its control inland. France established trading ports in the 17th 
century. However, its loss to Britain in the global conflict known as the Seven 
Years’ War  156±16 drove the French out of India. 
England’s East India Company  EIC, steadily encroached on the land 
of the weak Mughal Empire. Eventually, Britain controlled the entire Indian 
subcontinent, from Pakistan in the west to Kashmir in the north to Bengal in 
the east to the island of Ceylon  Sri Lanka in the south. At first, the EIC’s 
small forces of British soldiers protected the firm’s employees. As the British 
crept into India’s interior, they began recruiting native Indian soldiers, called 
sepoys, to join the British colonial army. However, as explained in the next 
topic, the sepoys ignited an unsuccessful rebellion against the British in 1857. 
Imperialism in East Asia
China did not experience imperialism in the same way that South Asia or 
Africa did. It maintained its own government throughout a period of European 
economic domination. As a result of superior military strength, European 
nations carved out sSheres oI influence  within China over which they had 
exclusive trading rights and access to natural resources. See Topic 6.5.  
Internal problems within the Qing government, such as the Taiping Rebellion , 
made it easier for foreign countries to dominate the economic affairs of China. 
During the Taiping Rebellion, which began in 1850, failed civil servant 
applicant Hong Xiuquan and starving peasants, workers, and miners attempted 
to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. With the help of some warlords along with 
French and British intervention, the Qings prevailed in 186.
In the midst of the war, adding to China’s internal problems, the Yellow 
River Huang He changed course, flooding farmland in some areas and leaving 
others open to drought. With agricultural lands devastated, famine followed 
during which many Chinese starved to death. Adding to the troubles, the 
bubonic plague broke out at this time. By the end of the fighting, the rebellion 
was probably responsible for the deaths of more than 20 million people, more 
than half of whom were civilians.
Between 1899 and 1901, an anti-imperialist group called the Boxers—
named because many of their members practiced martial arts, which were 
380 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONknown as Chinese boxing—was attacking Chinese Christians and Western 
missionaries. The Empress Dowager Cixi see Topic 5.8 encouraged the 
Boxers and in 1900 ordered that all foreigners be killed. However, most of 
the estimated 100,000 people who were killed were Chinese Christians. Only 
about 200±250 foreigners died during the Boxer Rebellion . The empress and 
the Qing court suffered a humiliating defeat that undermined their legitimacy. 
Western powers and influence continued to erode Chinese sovereignty in 
subsequent years.
Japan  Industrialized countries outside of Europe also desired colonies. 
Japan had sharply limited its contact with other countries since the early 
1600s. In 185, United States Commodore Matthew Perry came to Japan in 
large warships to secure a treaty that opened Japanese ports to trade. In the 
following decade, Japan overthrew its traditional government in an uprising 
called the Meiji Restoration and began to rapidly industrialize, hoping it could 
become strong enough to protect its distinctive culture. As part of this change, 
Japan began to look outward for territorial gains. An island nation with few 
natural resources and little arable land, it sought lands and natural resources to 
fuel its own growth. 
Partly to relieve population pressures in rural areas and partly to gain 
knowledge of foreign places, Japan’s government began to encourage 
agricultural workers to take seasonal contract work on Hawaii, Guam, and 
other locations. Through a  Colonization Society  established in 1893, leaders 
began plans to establish colonies in Mexico and Latin America. Japan set up 
an empire in East Asia that included parts of China, Korea, Southeast Asia, and 
Pacific islands that lasted from the 180s until the end of World War II.
Imperialism in Southeast Asia
Portugal and Spain originally controlled European trade with Southeast Asia. 
After 1600, the power shifted and the English and Dutch supplanted them.
The Dutch in Southeast Asia  Dutch imperialism in Southeast Asia 
began with a private company, just as English imperialism in South Asia had. 
In 161 the Dutch seized control of the Spice Islands now part of Indonesia, 
so called because they produced spices such as cloves and nutmeg that were in 
great demand in Europe. The Dutch East India Company  VOC  took over 
the spice trade from the Portuguese, setting up several trading posts on the 
archipelago. Although the trade was very profitable for the 9OC, corruption 
caused the company to go bankrupt by 1800. Once the 9OC folded, the Dutch 
government itself took control of the Dutch East Indies . By the mid-19th 
century, the islands were producing cash crops to support the Dutch economy.
Plantations produced tea, rubber, and sugar for export purposes, a situation 
that limited rice cultivation and eventually created enormous hardships  for 
Indonesian farmers who relied on rice to survive. Although criticism of this 
agricultural policy forced the Dutch government to implement humanitarian 
reforms, the reforms failed to meet the needs of the Indonesian people.
381 STATE E XPANSIONThe French in Southeast Asia  The French government also wanted an 
imperial presence in Asia. After it defeated China in the Sino-French War of 
188±1885, France gained control of northern 9ietnam. France later pressured 
Siam to cede control of the territory of modern-day Laos to the French. By the 
180s, France controlled Cambodia, Laos, and all of modern-day 9ietnam. 
Together, these nations became known as French  Indochina . French motives 
for imperialism were like those of the Dutch—a desire for cash crops. Soon 
rubber plantations dotted the landscape of Cambodia and 9ietnam.
The British in Southeast Asia  British influence in Southeast Asia began 
when the East India Company acquired the island of Penang off the northwest 
coast of the Malay Peninsula in 186. In 182, the British founded the port of 
Singapore. Chinese immigrants soon made it the most important seaport in 
Southeast Asia. Eventually, Britain controlled all of the Malay Peninsula, 
Burma Myanmar, and northern Borneo. British investors were originally 
attracted by the region’s mineral wealth, especially tin and gold. In addition, 
Britain promoted the planting of cash crops such as pepper, tobacco, palm oil, 
and rubber. By the end of the 19th century, Malaya  was the world’s greatest 
producer of natural rubber.
Siam  Only one Southeast Asian nation, Siam —modern-day Thailand—
managed to escape the clutches of 19th-century European imperialism. Siam’s 
monarchs deftly handled diplomatic relations with the British and French, 
whose colonies bordered Siam. The Siamese government also instituted a 
series of modernizing reforms, similar to 
Japan’s Meiji reforms. The government 
began to industrialize by building 
railroads, and it set up Western-
style schools in order to create an 
educated populace who could 
fill the ranks of an efficient 
government bureaucracy.
Australia and New 
Zealand
After the loss of its American 
colonies, Britain began to 
consider the possibility of 
establishing various kinds of 
settlements in Australia , finally 
deciding to locate a penal 
colony  there. In 188 the first 
convicts, along with some free 
settlers, arrived in Australia, and 
the east coast became known as 
New South Wales. In the 1820s,

On the royal coat of arms for Siam, the kingdom 
was represented by a three-headed elephant.
382 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONBritain took possession of the entire continent. For decades, the chief economic 
activity of the colony was to house convicts. The discovery that Australia was 
well-suited to producing fine wool provided a new industry, and in the 180s 
larger numbers of free settlers began to arrive. The discovery of copper in 182 
and gold in 1851 helped spur growth.
When Britain annexed the settler colony of New Zealand  in 1839, it was 
made a part of New South Wales. Two years later, after the Treaty of Waitangi  
guaranteeing that the rights of the original Maori  inhabitants would be 
protected by the British crown, it became a separate colony. Nevertheless, open 
war broke out as European settlers encroached on Maori lands. The Australian 
gold rushes provided a market for foodstuffs raised by New Zealand farmers, 
both European and Maori. For many years, sheep grazing and dairy farming 
provided the base for the colony’s economy.

During the 19th century, the United States continued taking land from 
indigenous peoples, as Europeans had done since Columbus arrived. One 
notorious episode was the forced relocation of Eastern Woodlands peoples from 
the Southeast to a new Indian Territory  in what is now Oklahoma. So many 
Native Americans died from exposure, malnutrition, disease, and exhaustion 
that this forced migration became known as the Trail of Tears .
In 182, President James Monroe issued the Monroe Doctrine , which 
stated that European nations should not intervene in the affairs of the countries 
in the Western Hemisphere. Implied in the doctrine was a desire to be an 
imperial power in the Americas. This desire played out in the U.S. war with 
Mexico 185±188, through which the United States gained vast territories in 
the Southwest from Mexico.
Expansion on Land  White Americans believed that they had a Manifest 
Destiny ²a natural and inevitable right to expand to the Pacific Ocean. The 
United States bought Alaska from Russia in 186. Two years later, in 186, the 
completion of a transcontinental railway spurred development of the American 
West. As white settlers moved westward to take advantage of offers of free land, 
Native Americans were forced onto reservations. By 1893, the U.S. Bureau of 
the Census declared that the western frontier was now closed.
Expansion Overseas  The United States turned its focus to lands overseas. 
The United States was not a global power for most of the 19th century. The 
Second Industrial Revolution brought newfound prosperity to the young 
republic. Economic considerations, as well as feelings of nationalism and 
cultural superiority, drove Americans’ desire for territorial conquest. A group 
of American planters overthrew Hawaii’s constitutional monarchy in 1895, but 
the islands did not become a U.S. territory until 1900. In the meantime, the U.S. 
victory in the Spanish-American War  in 1898 brought Guam, Cuba, Puerto 
Rico, and the Philippines under U.S. control. President Theodore Roosevelt, a 
proponent of Social Darwinism, was especially eager to expand U.S. influence 
383 STATE E XPANSIONthroughout the Western Hemisphere. The 10 Roosevelt Corollary to the 
Monroe Doctrine stated that if countries in Latin America demonstrated 
“instability,” the United States would intervene. It did several times. For 
example, in 10 Roosevelt sent U.S. troops to occupy a Caribbean island 
nation, the Dominican Republic, until it repaid its foreign debts.

Russian Expansion
Empress Catherine II “the Great” set out to expand the Russian Empire in 
all directions during her reign 162±16, annexing about half of Poland as 
well as territory won from the Ottoman Empire. Her grandson, Alexander I, 
annexed Finland, Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and part of Armenia during 
his reign 1815±1825. 
Beginning in the 10s, Russian merchants sponsored voyages to Alaska. 
In 1808 the Russian-American Company, which was similar to the British and 
Dutch East India companies, established permanent headquarters in Novo-
Arkhangelsk modern-day Sitka. From there they explored the west coast of 
384 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONNorth America. In 1811, they selected the site for a settlement at Fort Ross in 
California. They abandoned Fort Ross in 18 and in 186 sold Alaska to the 
United States, ending Russian plans to make the North Pacific a Russian sea.
Russia continued to push into Central Asia during the 19th century, 
leading to an intense rivalry between the Russian and British empires as they 
competed unsuccessfully for dominance in Afghanistan—a rivalry that came 
to be known as the Great Game . Russia also succeeded in annexing lands 
from China, most notably a large portion of Manchuria.

Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“The American continents, by the free and independent condition which they 
have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for 
future colonization by any European powers. . . .
We should consider any attempt on their [Europeans’] part to extend their 
system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. 
With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power we have 
not interfered and shall not interfere. But with the Governments who have 
declared their independence and maintain it, and whose independence we 
have, on great consideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could 
not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in 
any other manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light than 
as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States.”

—Túpac Amaru II, c. 1780
Essential Question:   How and why did internal and e_ternal factors influence 
state building between 1750 and 1900?
In response to European imperialism, nationalist movements emerged 
throughout South America, Africa, and Asia. Often the movements’ leaders, 
such as T~pac Amaru II in Peru, had European style educations. Many had 
developed a deep understanding of such Enlightenment ideals as natural 
rights, sovereignty, and nationalism. Some worked in official posts in colonial 
government. Some colonial elites used the education that imperialism provided 
them to drive out their conquerors in the 20th century. Anti-imperial resistance 
often created new states. 
Nationalist Movements in the Balkans
At its most powerful, the Ottoman Empire stretched deep into Europe. However, 
by the early 19th century, it was losing its hold on its remaining European 
territories in the Balkan Peninsula . Inspired by the French Revolution, ethnic 
nationalism emerged as the peoples of the Balkans sought independence. The 
growing ethnic tensions in the region set the stage for World War I.
Serbia 1815 and Greece 182 won independence only after long wars. 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Bulgaria all rebelled against 
Ottoman rule. In 1877, Serbia and Russia came to their aid in what was to be 
the last and most important Russo-Turkish War. After the war ended in 1878, 
the Treaty of Berlin freed Bulgaria, Romania, and Montenegro but placed 
Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Austria-Hungary.
389 INDIGENOUS RESPONSES TO STATE E XPANSIONResistance and Rebellion in the Americas
In North America, following the British victory over the French in the French 
and Indian War, the British issued the Proclamation of 1763.  This act reserved 
all the land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River for 
Native Americans²the first time a European government had recognized the 
territorial rights of indigenous peoples. However, the British colonists resented 
this interference in colonial affairs. After winning independence, citizens of the 
new United States soon overran the Ohio and Illinois river valleys, displacing 
Native Americans.
Cherokee Nation  After 1800, the Cherokee assimilated to white settler 
culture, adopting colonial methods of farming, weaving, and building. They 
developed a syllabic alphabet for writing their language. Within a short time, 
almost the entire tribe was literate, and the Cherokee Phoenix  became the 
first Native American newspaper in the United States. The Cherokee nation  
adopted a constitution based on the U.S. Constitution. 
But assimilation did not save the Cherokee from white Americans’ greed. 
After the discovery of gold in 1829 on Cherokee land in Georgia, attempts 
began to force the Cherokee off their land. After Congress passed the Indian 
Removal Act  of 1830, the Cherokee and other Southeast Native American 
tribes were forced to relocate to what is now Oklahoma. U.S. expansionism 
continued, affecting many Native American peoples.
Ghost Dance  In the northwestern United States around 186, prophet-
dreamers among the Northern Paiute Indians announced that the dead would 
soon come back and drive out the whites, restoring the lands and traditions of 
Native Americans. The Ghost Dance  rituals of dances and songs were meant 
to hasten this event. The Ghost Dance spread from the Sierra Nevada to the 
Missouri River and from northern Texas to the Canadian border. It reached the 
Sioux by 1890, coinciding with the Sioux revolts. Sioux warriors wore “ghost 
shirts.” However, the Ghost Dance resistance movement fell at the Wounded 
.nee Massacre in 180, marking the end of the Indian Wars.
Túpac Amaru II  José Gabriel Condorcanqui was a cacique  hereditary 
chief in southern Peru. He was descended from the last Inca ruler, T~pac 
Amaru, and took the name Túpac Amaru II . Born around 10, he continued 
to identify with his Inca heritage in spite of having received a formal Jesuit 
education. In 1780 he arrested and executed a colonial administrator, charging 
him with cruelty. This action led to the last general Indian revolt against Spain, 
which at first was supported by some criollos  Spaniards born in America. The 
revolt spread throughout southern Peru and into Bolivia and Argentina before 
T~pac Amaru II and his family were captured in March 181. They were taken 
to Cuzco, the former capital of the Inca empire. There Túpac Amaru II was 
forced to watch as his wife and sons were executed before he was tortured and 
executed himself.
390 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONFrench Intervention in Mexico  In 186 a group of Mexican conservatives 
conspired with Emperor Napoleon III of France to overthrow the liberal 
government of Benito Juárez , a full-blooded =apotec. Mexico owned France 
money, and Napoleon III wanted to further his imperialist ambitions. He 
offered to make a European noble, Archduke Maximilian, the emperor of 
Mexico. Maximilian was crowned on June 10, 186. After three more years of 
war, Mexicans forced the French to withdraw from Mexico. Maximilian was 
executed on June 1, 186, and Juirez resumed the presidency.
South Asian Movements
By the mid-19th century, sepoys,  Indian soldiers under British employ, made up 
the majority of the British armed forces in colonial India. Most were Hindus or 
Muslims. In 185, the British began using rifle cartridges that had been greased 
with a mixture of the fat of cows and pigs. Hindus, who view the cow as sacred, 
and Muslims, who refuse to slaughter pigs, were both furious. Both were 
convinced that the British were trying to convert them to Christianity. Their 
violent uprising, known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 or the Sepoy Mutiny, 
spread throughout cities in northern India. The British crushed the rebellion, 
killing thousands, but the event marked the emergence of Indian nationalism.
After the Indian Rebellion, Britain also exiled the Mughal emperor for his 
involvement in the rebellion and ended the Mughal Empire. In its place, the 
British government took a more active role in ruling India. From 1858 until 
India won independence in 1, the British Raj, the colonial government, 
took its orders directly from the British government in London.
Under the Raj, many Indians attended British universities. In 1885, several 
British-educated Indians established the Indian National Congress. Though 
begun as a forum for airing grievances to the colonial government, it quickly 
began to call for self-rule. Connect: Compare the motives and outcomes of the 
Haitian Revolution with those of the Indian Rebellion of 185. See Topic 5.2.

The first meeting of the Indian National Congress in 1885 was dominated by 
Hindu representatives. As a result, many Indian Muslims were suspicious of it.
391 INDIGENOUS RESPONSES TO STATE E XPANSIONSoutheast Asian Resistance
By the 1880s, the only independent country remaining in Southeast Asia was 
Siam Thailand. The rest of the region was under the control of the Spanish, 
Dutch, British, and French.
Vietnam  From the beginning of French colonialism in the region, many 
9ietnamese resisted. By 188, when 12-year-old Ham Nghi became emperor, 
his top advisers were vocal critics of the French. The French soon tried to 
assert their control by raiding the royal palace, but the young emperor had been 
removed for safety. Ham Nghi’s supporters continued to resist French rule until 
he was captured in 1888 and exiled to Algeria. The resistance continued until 
1895 under Phan Dinh Phung, who became a hero to future revolutionaries in 
the 9ietnamese resistance movement.
Philippine Resistance  The Philippines  came under Spanish control in 
the 16th century, but there was no public education there until 186. However, 
wealthy Filipinos sent their sons to Europe to study. One of those young 
men, José Rizal , started a reform movement called Liga Filipina Philippine 
League in 182. Though the Liga was loyal to Spain, the Spanish feared 
it. They promptly arrested and executed Rizal, an action that shocked many 
Filipinos.
There had been numerous rebellions throughout the history of Spanish rule, 
but now, for the first time, Filipinos had nationalist ambitions and the education 
needed to carry them out. In 186 several revolts broke out in provinces around 
Manila, marking the beginning of the Philippine Revolution . The Spanish-
American War  broke out in 1898, and after a decisive American victory in the 
Battle of Manila Bay, exiled Filipino revolutionaries returned. Based on U.S.  
sympathy for Philippine independence, the rebels expected freedom.
However, the Treaty of Paris  ending the war merely transferred control 
of the Philippines from Spain to the United States. By the time the treaty was 
ratified in February 18, hostilities had broken out in what was to be known 
as the Philippine-American War . The war ended in a U.S. victory in 1902. An 
estimated 20,000 Filipino troops were killed, and more than 200,000 civilians 
died as a result of the war. Of the ,00 Americans who lost their lives, nearly 
two-thirds of them died of disease. Organized resistance continued until 106, 
but the Philippines remained a U.S. possession until 16. 
Resistance in Australia and New Zealand
The Aboriginal  people have been in Australia for an estimated 50,000 years 
and have the oldest continuous culture on Earth. At the time of European 
settlement, there may have been as many as 1 million people in 500 clans, 
speaking 700 languages. 
Australia  In 1788, the British began sending convicts and soldiers to 
establish colonies in New South Wales. The government instructed the settlers  
392 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONto treat the indigenous inhabitants kindly. However, the colonial government 
did not recognize indigenous land ownership. Further, because the indigenous 
inhabitants were not considered British subjects, they were not protected by 
law. Thousands of Aboriginal people were killed as they tried to defend their 
territory and resources from European settlers.
New Zealand  Compared to the Aboriginals in Australia, New Zealand’s 
Maori  were newcomers, having arrived from Polynesia in the 1th century. 
Under the 180 Treaty of Waitangi , Britain had promised to protect the 
property rights of the Maori. Within a short time, the Maori became alarmed 
by British settlement patterns, and the first of a series of Maori Wars broke 
out. The British were eventually able to overcome the Maori in 186. Relations 
deteriorated again in the 1850s as the Maori became reluctant to sell more 
land to settlers, fearing for their future. Ignoring the promise of the Treaty 
of Waitangi, the government attempted to pressure the Maori to sell land, 
sending troops in 1861 to dislodge the Maori from the property in question. 
Another decade of fighting ensued. The war ended in an uneasy peace in 
182, but by 100 the Maori had lost most of their land.
African Resistance
Organized African resistance to imperialism developed later than Indian 
resistance. One reason for this difference in timing is that European powers 
had been in India much longer than they had been in Africa. In addition, British 
colonial governments in India were partially run by Indians, while colonial 
governments in Africa were largely run by military officials from Europe. 
However, by the end of the World War I 11±118, Western-educated 
Africans had a shared identity and nationalism known as Pan-Africanism .
Sokoto Caliphate  In West Africa in the 18th century, rulers often mixed 
Islamic and traditional religious practices. In 180, a group of Muslim 
intellectuals led by Usman dan Fodio  15±181 started a drive to purify 
Islam among the Hausa tribes of the region. He created a caliphate with its 
seat at the new town of Sokoto. The Sokoto Caliphate  established the slave 
trade as a means of economic growth at a time when the British were trying 
to stop it. The British navy attempted to intercept the ships of the Sokoto 
Caliphate, free the enslaved people, and relocate them in their colony Sierra 
Leone. The Sokoto Caliphate was the largest African empire since the 16th 
century. It was finally subdued in 10 when the British made it part of their 
colony of Nigeria.
South Africa  From 1811 to 1858, the British fought the native Xhosa  
people, who did not want to be ruled by Europeans, whether Dutch or English. 
In 1856±185, in the region east of the Cape Colony, some of the cattle of 
the local Xhosa were getting sick and dying, perhaps from diseases caught 
from the cattle of the British settlers. The Xhosa began to kill their cattle 
and destroy their crops in the belief that these actions would cause spirits to 
remove the British settlers from their lands. Some 00,000 head of ;hosa 
393 INDIGENOUS RESPONSES TO STATE E XPANSIONcattle may have been killed. The immediate result of the Xhosa Cattle Killing 
Movement  was famine and the deaths of thousands of people. However, the 
British were not driven out of the area.
In the 1870s, the British fought the Zulu Kingdom, located on the South 
African coast of the Indian Ocean, which had become a well-organized and 
centralized state. At first, this Anglo-Zulu War went in favor of the Zulus, but 
eventually the British defeated them, and their lands became part of the British 
colony of South Africa.
Samory Touré’s War  In West Africa in 1868, Mande chieftain Samory 
Touré  180±100 led a group of warriors to establish a powerful kingdom in 
Guinea, extending it until the early 1880s. He opposed French attempts to 
annex West Africa, first fighting them in 188. The French finally succeeded 
but offered Samory their protection. When he was unable to extend his 
kingdom to the east, he again went to war with the French in 1891. After his 
forces were ejected, he tried to reestablish his kingdom in the upper Ivory 
Coast. The French finally captured him in 188 and sent him into exile.

394 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMahdist Revolt  In East Africa in 1881, a Sudanese Islamic cleric, 
Muhammad Ahmad  18±1885, declared himself the Mahdi , or “guided 
one,” who would restore the glory of Islam. The Sudanese had resented 
Egyptian rule for decades, and the arrival of the British in 1873 only fueled 
their resentment. Ahmad turned the political movement into a religious one, 
forming an army to fight against Egypt. By 1882, the Mahdist army had taken 
control of the area around the capital, Khartoum. The next year, a joint British-
Egyptian military expedition launched a counterattack against the Mahdists. 
The Mahdists finally overran the British-Egyptian forces in January 1885. 
After Ahmad’s death in June of that year, the Mahdist movement disintegrated, 
weakened by infighting among rival leaders. The British returned to Sudan  in 
186, and finally defeated the Mahdists in September 188.
Yaa Asantewaa War  Beginning in 1823, the British made several attempts 
to subjugate the Asante Empire  in present-day Ghana in West Africa. The first 
four were unsuccessful. The fifth and final war is known as the Yaa Asantewaa 
War or the War of the Golden Stool. It began in March 100, when the British 
governor of the Gold Coast demanded the Golden Stool, a symbol of national 
unity. Yaa Asantewaa  180±121, a mighty warrior queen, led a rebellion 
against the British. It was the last African war led by a woman, and it resulted 
in the deaths of 2,000 Asante and 1,000 British. The death toll was higher 
than in the first four wars combined. The war ended in September 100 with 
a British victory. Yaa Asantewaa was exiled, and Asante as Ashanti became 
part of the Gold Coast colony.

SOURCES
Perspective, or point of view, is a powerful filter of experience. Historical 
accounts from varying perspectives require historians to understand 
the significance of the point of view and use that understanding to 
determine how useful a source is, and for what purpose. For example, 
firsthand indigenous responses to state expansion between 150 
and 1900 provide historians with a perspective of the people whose 
lands and cultures were being taken over. At the same time, accounts 
of colonization solely through the lens of the colonizers would also 
provide a limited perspective. As the final word on what happened, each 
type of source has limitations. For this reason, historians are able to 
present a more accurate picture of the past when they examine sources 
with varying points of views and appreciate the significance of those 
perspectives.

Global Economic Development
Peruvian guano [bird droppings] has become so desirable an article to the 
agricultural interest of the United States that it is the duty of the Government 
to employ all the means properly in its power for the purpose of causing that 
article to be imported into the country at a reasonable price. 
—U.S. President Millard Fillmore, December 2, 1850
Essential Question:   How did environmental factors contribute to the global 
economy between 1750 and 1900?
Economics was among the most influential of the several motives driving 
imperialism. Britain industrialized rapidly during the 1700s and 1800s. In 
order to feed industries’ desires for raw materials, such as cotton, copper, 
and rubber, Europe looked to Asia and Africa. American agriculture, as 
noted by President Fillmore, looked to South America for fertilizer. The 
people of these continents were also potential consumers of European 
and American manufactured goods. Finally, colonial peoples provided 
the labor for large-scale projects, such as building railroads or telegraph 
lines. Colonial workers were paid meager wages for difficult and dangerous 
labor. In short, natural resources, new markets, and low-wage labor drove 
economic imperialism.
Technological Developments
The Industrial Revolution did not just take place in factories. It affected 
transportation and communication as well. 
Railroads  Before the introduction of railroads , transportation from the 
interiors of colonies to coastal ports was by water or by roads. Most colonies 
had few roads, and those that existed were usually poorly maintained and 
often unusable during rainy seasons. Transportation by water was limited to 
coastal areas and river basins. The introduction of railroads lowered the cost of 
transporting raw materials for shipment to Europe. At the same time, railroads 
helped open up colonial markets for manufactured goods.
Europeans often pointed to their railroad projects as evidence that 
imperialism helped the peoples of Asia and Africa. However, providing new 
transportation technology to the colonies primarily served the interests of the 
399 GLOBAL ECONOMIC DE=ELOPMENTcolonizers. In India, the British built a complex railway network that stretched 
from the interior to the coasts in order to ship raw materials out of the country 
easily.
British-born Cecil Rhodes 185±102, founder of De Beers Diamonds, 
was an especially enthusiastic investor in a railroad project that was to stretch 
from Cape Town, in the Cape Colony of South Africa, to Cairo, Egypt. 
Connecting all of the British-held colonies with a transportation network could 
make governance easier and aid in mobilizing for war, if necessary. The project 
was never completed because Britain never gained control over all the land 
on which it was to be built. The overwhelming majority of railway workers 
in Africa were natives who were paid far lower wages than their European 
counterparts. Thus, railroad technology was a means of extracting as many 
resources as possible from subject lands while paying colonial laborers as little 
as possible.
Steamships  Because they required huge quantities of coal as fuel, early 
steamships  could travel only limited distances. However, steamboats could 
transport people, mail, and goods on navigable rivers such as the Ganges in 
South Asia and the Congo in Africa. After the development of more efficient 
steam engines in 1870, steamships became practical for long distances. In 
the 1870s, the development of compression refrigeration equipment made it 
possible to ship perishables such as meat and dairy products across oceans. 
Telegraph  Invented in 1832, the electric telegraph  transformed 
communications. Instead of taking days, weeks, or even months, news could 
travel instantaneously. Telegraph service was introduced in India in 1850, just 
five years after it started in Britain. Telegraph lines often followed railroad 
routes. Submarine underwater telegraph cables soon crossed oceans. In 1866 
the first permanent transatlantic cable was laid between the United States and 
England. Telegraph service between England and Australia was introduced 
in 182, and in 18 service between Portugal and Brazil allowed instant 
communication between Europe and South America.
Agricultural Products
When Europeans arrived in Asia and Africa, they found mainly agricultural 
economies, with most people raising enough food to live on—subsistence 
farming—with perhaps a little left over to sell. Subsistence farming is still 
common throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of Latin 
America. Under control of imperialist powers, subsistence farmers abandoned 
their traditional ways and grew cash crops  instead. These were crops such 
as tea, cotton, sugar, oil palms, rubber, and coffee that were grown for their 
commercial value rather than for use by those who grew them. Imperial 
demands for cash crops had a damaging effect on subject nations. As cash 
crops replaced food crops, food prices rose.
400 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe growing European middle classes created a demand for meat. Cattle 
ranches in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay produced beef for export. Sheep 
herders in Australia and New Zealand exported lamb and mutton. New 
technology allowed meat to be shipped over long distances. Meat could 
be processed and canned in packing plants or shipped fresh or frozen in 
refrigerated steamships.
Guano , bat and seabird excrement, is rich in nitrates and phosphates. 
These make it an excellent natural fertilizer. Because of the dry climate in Peru 
and Chile, vast quantities of guano had accumulated before people began 
mining it in the 1th century. Between 180 and 1880, millions of tons of 
guano were dug by hand and loaded onto ships for export, often by indentured 
Chinese or Polynesian laborers.

401 GLOBAL ECONOMIC DE=ELOPMENTRaw Materials
The demand for raw materials that could be processed into manufactured 
goods and shipped away—often back to the providers of raw materials—
turned colonies into export economies.  Imperial attention focused on the 
tropical climates that were conducive to the presence of raw materials, unlike 
some imperial countries.
Cotton  Britain’s Parliament banned Indian cotton  textiles in 1721 
because they competed with the native wool industry. Soon after, cotton from 
Britain’s southern colonies in America shifted production. The colonies would 
provide the raw materials, and England would manufacture textiles. During 
the Industrial Revolution, Britain’s great textile mills got 80 percent of their 
cotton from the United States.
When the American Civil War erupted, northern warships blockaded 
Confederate ports, cutting off the supply of cotton. As a result, farmers all 
over the world, from Australia to the West Indies, replaced food production 
with cotton to make up for the shortage. Cotton farmers in India were able 
to benefit from the shortages caused by the Civil War, but Egypt benefited 
most. Egypt had already developed a fine long-staple variety of cotton and 
ramped up production. By the end of the 19th century, 93 percent of Egypt’s 
export revenue came from cotton. Raw cotton production from Egypt and 
India supported the manufacturing of textiles that Britain exported all over the 
world.
Rubber  Natural rubber  is made from the latex sap of trees or vines. 
It softens when warm and hardens when cold. In 1839, Charles Goodyear 
developed a process known as vulcanization that eliminated these problems 
and helped create the modern rubber industry. Rubber was used to produce 
tires for bicycles and eventually automobiles, hoses, gaskets, waterproof 
clothing, and shoe soles, among other items.
Rubber trees are native to the Amazon rainforest of South America, where 
they grew wild but widely dispersed. Latex could also be extracted from vines 
native to Central Africa, though they were destroyed in the process. Each source 
provided about half the world’s rubber supply, but they soon were inadequate 
to meet the demand as rubber became an important industrial material. In both 
sources, “rubber barons” forced indigenous people into virtual slavery. In some 
cases, companies mutilated or killed workers who failed to meet their quotas.
In 186, the British India Office obtained rubber tree seeds from Brazil. 
After being propagated in England, the seedlings were sent to Ceylon Sri 
Lanka and Singapore. Before long, thousands of acres of forest were cleared 
to make room for rubber plantations in Malaya, Indochina, the Dutch East 
Indies, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
Palm Oil  The machinery in Europe’s factories required constant 
lubrication to keep it working, creating a demand for palm oil , which was 
402 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONalso used for candle making. The oil palm originated in West Africa, where it 
was used as a staple food product for 5,000 years. Palm oil was so valued that 
it was used in place of money in many African cultures. Palm oil became an 
important cash crop in West Africa, where prisoners of tribal war were often 
enslaved to help with the palm oil crops. European colonists established oil 
palm plantations in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.
Ivory  The tusks of elephants provide the product ivory . Most of the ivory 
trade was with Africa, since both male and female African elephants have large 
tusks, which average six feet in length. Ivory was prized for its beauty and 
durability. It was used primarily for piano keys, billiard balls, knife handles, 
and ornamental carvings. In the mid-19th century, the European scramble for 
ivory preceded the scramble for colonies. The Ivory Coast C{te d’Ivoire got 
its name from the fact that the French originally set up trading posts there for 
the acquisition of ivory and the purchase of enslaved people.
Minerals  Some of the most valuable products were mineral ores used in 
manufacturing. They came from around the world:
• Mexico produced silver. 
• Chile produced copper , which was used for telegraph cables and 
electrical power lines. 
• Northern Rhodesia now =ambia and the Belgian Congo produced 
copper. 
• Bolivia, Nigeria, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies produced tin, 
which helped meet the growing demand for food products in tin cans.
• Australia and South Africa, as well as parts of West Africa and Alaska, 
produced large deposits of gold.
Diamonds  Because of his frail health, Cecil Rhodes was sent to South 
Africa in 1870 to join a brother on a cotton farm. In 1871 the brothers joined 
the diamond  rush and went to Kimberley, the center of mining activity. After 
completing a degree at Oxford University, Rhodes acquired some of the De 
Beers mining claims and formed the De Beers Mining Company  in 1880. By 
1891, De Beers accounted for 90 percent of the world’s diamond production. 
Rhodes also had a large stake in the world’s largest gold fields, which were 
discovered in 1886 on South Africa’s Witwatersrand. Connect: Analyze 
Africa’s changes in trade from the trans-Saharan trade, including the effects of 
the slave trade, through the industrial era. See Topics 2. and ..
By the age of 29, when Rhodes was elected to the Cape Parliament, he 
was the most powerful man in Southern Africa. He sought to expand to the 
north, into Bechuanaland Botswana and what became known as Rhodesia 
and is now Zimbabwe and Zambia, with the dream of building a railroad from 
Cape Town to Cairo—and claiming all the land along the route for the British 
Empire. In 1890, Rhodes became the prime minister of the Cape Colony where 
his racist policies paved the way for the apartheid , or racial segregation, that 
plagued South Africa during the 20th century.
403 GLOBAL ECONOMIC DE=ELOPMENTGlobal Consequences
Industrialization was accompanied by the need to find raw materials that could 
be turned into finished products to be sold globally²often bought with the 
profits from raw materials. As urban populations grew, the demand for food 
was increasingly met by imports made possible by new technology such as 
refrigeration. As the industrialized nations grew wealthier, stock exchanges 
developed, allowing more people to invest their capital, and the need to protect 
global markets and investments grew rapidly.
Consequences of Commercial Extraction  Farmers were allowed to 
raise only cash crops, such as sugar, cocoa, or groundnuts, at the expense of 
other agricultural products. This use of land led to monocultures,  or a lack 
of agricultural diversity, particularly in developing nations. Large areas were 
often cleared of forests to make room for farming, which took its toll on both 
biodiversity and the climate. Cash crops such as cotton rapidly depleted the 
soul’s natural fertility. Moreover, crop diseases and pests spread more easily 
when there was only one crop planted in an area. 
Today, many former colonies have been unable to rediversify their land 
use because the development of monocultures has badly damaged croplands. 
As a result, they often must import basic agricultural goods in order to feed 
their people.

“Fermented drinks such as alcohol also have the benefits of killing parasites

production was eating up nearly half of the wheat harvest in Britain. There was 
no possible way for Britain’s domestic agriculture to feed the rapidly expanding 
population and keep them in beer, too. There just wasn’t enough farmland for 
every new mouth in the industrial era. Calories had to come from an outside

Economic Imperialism
Let us ask, where is your conscience? I have heard that the smoking of opium 
is very strictly forbidden by your country; that is because the harm caused by 
opium is clearly understood. Since it is not permitted to do harm to your own 
country, then even less should you let it be passed on to the harm of other 
countries – how much less to China! 
—Lin Zexu, Chinese Commissioner in Canton,  
letter to British Queen Victoria, January 15, 1840
Essential Question:   What economic factors contributed to the imperialism 
in the global economy between 1750 and 1900? 
For centuries, India was the world’s leading supplier of finished cotton 
textiles. By the late 18th century, the Industrial Revolution and a new source of 
cotton from America had allowed Britain to flood the market with inexpensive 
textiles, pushing independent Indian textile artisans out of business. By the 
late 19th century, India was producing only raw cotton for Britain, not cotton 
textiles. After Britain’s textile factories processed India’s cotton, the colonial 
government sold some of its factory-made or “finished” textiles back to the 
Indian subcontinent at inflated prices.
Another critical raw material for Britain was the drug opium. The poppies 
from which it is obtained grew easily on South Asia’s fertile lands, and selling 
it to the Chinese became very profitable for Britain. The Chinese, as Lin =exu 
expressed in the letter to Queen 9ictoria, objected to the export of opium to 
their country, and the conflict resulted in the first Opium War. The Chinese 
paid a heavy price for their attempt to curtail the opium trade and ended up 
losing much trading independence.
The Rise of Economic Imperialism
The agricultural influence and power of raw materials shifted away from Asia 
and Latin America to industrialized states such as Britain, the United States, 
France, Japan, and Germany between the late 19th century and the beginning 
of the 20th century. Economic imperialism , a situation in which foreign 
business interests have great economic power or influence, developed as 
businesses took advantage of natural resources beyond their borders. People, 
raw materials, and refined materials were the main resources exploited. Cash 
crops and mineral resources were produced on a large scale. As in the colonial 
408 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONera of the 15th to the 18th centuries, colonial powers served their own economic 
interests by turning colonies into export economies that produced goods not for 
domestic use but to be sent to colonial powers to sell for profit. 
Economic Imperialism in Asia
England’s defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 created an opening for the 
British and Dutch to take over the spice trade in Asia from the Spanish and 
Portuguese, who formerly had a monopoly on it.
India  The English East India Company  formed in 1600 to engage in the 
lucrative spice trade. However, the company soon ran into opposition from the 
Dutch. By the mid-1600s cotton and silk textiles from India had replaced spices 
as the East India Company’s major import, and by the 1700s the company 
dominated the world textile trade. Indian weavers learned to create fabrics with 
patterns that would appeal to European tastes. With the Industrial Revolution, 
India began supplying raw cotton to the textile mills of Britain, and the demand 
for finished Indian textiles decreased.
Dutch East Indies  The Dutch East India Company  had a monopoly on 
trade with the Dutch East Indies in present-day Indonesia, where the Spice 
Islands  were located. By the second half of the 18th century, it had switched its 
focus from shipping to agricultural production. The Dutch government revoked 
the company’s charter in 1799 and took direct control of the Dutch East Indies. 
In 1830, the Dutch government introduced the Culture System , which forced 
farmers to choose between growing cash crops for export or performing corvée 
labor , compulsory unpaid work. Under this system, villagers either had to set 
aside one-fifth of their rice fields for such export crops as sugar, coffee, or 
indigo, or work in a government field for 66 days if they had no land. If the 
crops failed, the villagers were held responsible for the loss. The practice was 
finally abolished in 180.
China  Chinese goods such as porcelain, silk, and tea were in great demand 
in Great Britain. However, the Chinese were not interested in British goods, 
and in this trade imbalance, British silver reserves became very low. To make 
up for this shortfall, the East India Company began forcing farmers in India 
to grow opium , an addictive drug that also relieves pain and reduces stress. 
The company then sold it for silver in China, where millions of people became 
addicted to the illegal drug. The company then used its profits to buy tea and 
other goods.
The Chinese emperor criminalized the use of opium in 1729. However, the 
ban had little effect. The Chinese objection to the importation of this drug led to 
the first Opium War 18±182. The Chinese government seized the British 
opium warehoused in the port of Canton Guangzhou. War broke out when 
British warships destroyed a Chinese blockade keeping ships from Canton, 
the only port China allowed to trade with foreigners. The British attacked 
and occupied Canton and engaged in several other successful battles, finally 
capturing Nanking Nanjing. 
409 ECONOMIC IM PERIALISM 409The conflict between Britain and China revealed the fate of nonindustrialized 
nations. China had not anticipated the power that industrialized nations were 
gaining or the shift in the balance of power that was taking place. Industrialized 
nations in Europe would begin to dominate and defeat states that lacked the 
military technology needed to stand against British steamships and weaponry.
The resulting Treaty of Nanking  required China to open up four additional 
ports to foreigners, cede the island of Hong Kong to Britain, and pay damages. 
It also forced the Chinese to allow free trade, which the British took to include 
trade in opium.
Neither Britain nor China was completely satisfied with the Treaty of 
Nanking. The British wanted the use of opium legalized, while the Chinese 
were unhappy about the concessions they had been forced to make. Hostilities 
erupted in October 1856 after Chinese officers boarded a British trading ship, 
searched it, lowered the flag, and arrested some Chinese sailors. The French 
joined the British in what came to be known as the second Opium War 1856±
1860. The Treaty of Tientsin Tianjin following that war allowed foreign 
envoys to reside in Beijing, opened several new ports to Western trade and 
residence, and allowed freedom of movement for Christian missionaries. After 
additional negotiations, opium was legalized, and China ceded to Britain the 
southern portion of Kowloon Peninsula, which was adjacent to Hong Kong. 
Connect: Compare how Western states and the Qing Dynasty treated the 
Chinese population. See Topic ..
SSheres oI ,nfluence Japan, France, Germany, Russia, and the United 
States sought the same trading privileges that Britain attained after winning 
the Opium Wars. By the end of the century, these nations began forcing China 
to give them exclusive trading rights in areas known as sSheres oI influence . 
It was at this time that the Open Door policy, proposed by the United States, 
allowed for a system of trade in China to be open to all countries equally in 
order to keep any one power from total control of China. See the map on the

Economic Imperialism in Africa
Before colonization, most farming in Africa was to raise food crops. After 
colonization, land that had been devoted to growing food was converted to 
cash crop production to provide raw materials for European industries and 
goods for European markets. In exchange, the Africans received cotton textiles, 
canned food, and alcoholic beverages. This unequal trade structure made the 
colonies economically dependent on the imperial powers.
Reliance on a single cash crop, one grown to be sold, in a country or 
region left many Africans vulnerable during periods of drought, economic 
decline, or falling world prices. Food production declined as farmers chose to 
plant cash crops such as cotton, which would increase the value of their land. 
Food shortages, even famines, could arise because the most arable land was 
devoted to growing crops for export.
410 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEgypt  had embraced cotton as a cash crop before the American Civil War 
and more than doubled production between 1861 and 186. By the end of the 
century, cotton accounted for 93 percent of Egypt’s exports. It was also the 
leading cash crop in Sudan , where the Plantation Syndicate, a group of British 
weaving companies, dictated land use to farmers. When the British colonized 
Uganda , they encouraged cotton as a cash crop there as well, and it soon 
replaced enslaved people and ivory as the chief export.
In Kenya , most native peoples were herders. Groups like the Kikuyu 
were moved to reserves with poor soil and bad climates. In the fertile Rift 
9alley, the colonial government gave the land to white settlers, forcing most 
Africans to relocate. Those who remained were forced to provide cheap 
labor for white farmers. African farmers were also forbidden to participate 
in export of any cash crops, and prohibited from growing some cash crops, 
such as coffee and tea.PACIFIC

411 ECONOMIC IM PERIALISMAfter missionaries introduced it to the area in the 1880s, cocoa became the 
major cash crop on the Gold Coast.  This region soon became the largest cocoa 
producer in the world. Cocoa was also an important cash crop in the Ivory 
Coast, Nigeria, and the Portuguese colonies of São Tomé and Angola.
Palm oil, palm kernels, and peanuts also called groundnuts were already 
major exports from West Africa before colonization. It was a valuable raw 
material because it was used as a lubricant for the machines of the industrial 
revolution in Europe.
Slavery in Africa  Slavery was outlawed in British colonies in 1833, but it 
persisted elsewhere in Africa. The French army often used enslaved people as 
payment for its African soldiers, and French colonial administrators relied on 
enslaved people for many of their staff. It was not until 1912 that slave raiding 
and trading was suppressed in most of Africa. Slavery was not abolished by 
law throughout Africa until the first quarter of the 20th century.
Slave labor was used to produce many of the cash crops, especially oil 
palms which produced palm kernels as well as palm oil, coffee, and cocoa. 
Some companies felt a moral responsibility to oppose the use of enslaved 
people in the production of the raw materials they used. For example, cash 
crop production in French-ruled colonies in Africa came about as a result of the 
end of the slave trade in the French Empire in 188, along with the economic 
transformations brought about in France by the Industrial Revolution. Quaker-
owned Cadbury’s, for example, stopped buying slave-grown cocoa from 
Portuguese African colonies in 1908 after the slave trade was exposed.

412 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEconomic Imperialism in Latin America
In the second half of the 19th century, Latin America was subjected to imperialist 
aggression from both Europe and the United States. The “new imperialism” 
was concerned with a world capitalist economy as the industrialized nations of 
Europe and the United States sought raw materials, low-wage labor, and new 
markets for their goods. The emerging middle classes of Latin America were 
hungry for the latest European news and fashions.
Britain replaced Spain as Latin America’s major trading partner. Companies 
based in Britain became the largest investors in Latin America, followed by 
ones from France and Germany. Europeans invested over 10 billion in Latin 
America between 180 and 11, primarily in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil. 
Role of the United States  The United States was not yet as established 
a world power as Britain or France. However, the Second Industrial 
Revolution brought newfound prosperity to the young republic. U.S. corporate 
investments came later and were concentrated at first in Mexico and Cuba. 
These investments supported infrastructure and industry, especially railways, 
shipping, and the emerging banking and financial sectors. They also financed 
mining, guano, and meat processing and packing plants. In 182, the Monroe 
Doctrine, the U.S. policy of opposing European colonialism in the Americas, 
told the world that Latin America was in the U.S. sphere of influence.
Investments in Argentina  In the late 19th century, Britain had invested 
more in Argentina  than in its own colony of India. As much as 10 percent of 
British foreign investment was in Argentina. British investors, entrepreneurs, 
and business leaders helped turn Argentina into the richest country in Latin 
America and one of the dozen richest in the world by the outbreak of World War 
I. They improved breeding stock and developed large-scale farming throughout 
the grassy plains, known as the Pampas . They also financed infrastructure and 
building projects, such as the railroad and telegraph systems. Because of its 
location on the shallow Rio de la Plata, Buenos Aires needed to build a new 
port to facilitate passenger service and the massive import and export of goods 
and services. The British financed and designed the new port, Puerto Madera.
Mining in Chile  Spain colonized the region of present-day Chile between 
150 and 1818. Chile’s economic development was initially dependent on the 
export of agricultural produce. The wealth of these raw materials brought 
dependency on Spain and tension among neighboring states. Copper would 
come to dominate Chile’s exports. The mining sector in Chile would come to 
be one of the pillars of the Chilean economy, making up for more than one- 
third of government income. 
Rubber Industry in Brazil  Brazil once had a booming rubber industry. 
However, it declined after people began growing rubber in Malaysia at a lower 
cost. The shift of rubber production demonstrated how trade was organized to 
the advantage of companies based in Europe and the United States. Economic 
competition brought prosperity to some regions, but it was always fragile.
413 ECONOMIC IM PERIALISMCentral America and the Caribbean  Foreign investors often used their 
governments to act as “strong men” to help them achieve the ends they wanted. 
The United Fruit Company was an American corporation that traded in tropical 
fruit, primarily bananas, grown on Latin American plantations and sold in the 
United States and in Europe. The United Fruit Company allied itself with large 
landowners to pressure governments to maintain conditions that would be 
favorable for the U.S. company. In a short story, the writer O. Henry coined the 
term “ banana republics ” to describe small Central American countries under 
the economic power of foreign-based corporations. The banana republics were 
politically unstable states with an economy dependent upon the exportation of 
a limited-resource product, such as bananas or minerals. 
Patterns of imperial control over territories and transportation networks 
in Central America, the Caribbean coast of Colombia, Ecuador, and the West 
Indies continued as companies sought political dominance to gain monopolies 
over natural resources. 
Economic Imperialism in Hawaii
The power of investments to transform and dominate small or weak states 
could also be seen in the Pacific islands. A group of American businesses 
and sugar planters in Hawaii went so far as to overthrow the constitutional 
monarchy in 1893, hoping that the islands would be annexed by the United 
States. In 1898, Hawaii became a territory of the United States.
Contextualizing Economic Imperialism
The Industrial Revolution developed the demand for raw materials and the 
technological ability through steamships, railroads, and military weapons to 
control other territories. These set the stage for economic imperialism.

415 ECONOMIC IM PERIALISMSHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“It was at this moment that the East India Company EIC ceased to be a 
conventional corporation, trading and silks and spices, and became something 
much more unusual. Within a few years, 250 company clerks backed by the 
military force of 20,000 locally recruited Indian soldiers had become the 
effective rulers of Bengal. An international corporation was transforming 
itself into an aggressive colonial power. . . .
We still talk about the British conquering India, but that phrase disguises a 
more sinister reality. It was not the British government that seized India at 
the end of the 18th century, but a dangerously unregulated private company 
headquartered in one small office, five windows wide, in London, and 
managed in India by an unstable sociopath—[Robert] Clive.
In many ways the EIC was a model of corporate efficiency: 100 years into its 
history, it had only 5 permanent employees in its head office. Nevertheless, 
that skeleton staff executed a corporate coup unparalleled in history: the 
military conquest, subjugation and plunder of vast tracts of southern Asia. 
It almost certainly remains the supreme act of corporate violence in world 
history. For all the power wielded today by the world’s largest corporations—
whether ExxonMobil, Walmart or Google²they are tame beasts compared 
with the ravaging territorial appetites of the [militarized] East India Company. 
Yet if history shows anything, it is that in the intimate dance between the 
power of the state and that of the corporation, while the latter can be regulated, 
it will use all the resources in its power to resist.”

CAUSES O- MIGRATIO N IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLD417
6.6
Causes of Migration in an 
Interconnected World
I would advise all my friends to quit Ireland—the country most dear to me; 
as long as they remain in it they will be in bondage and misery.
—An Irish settler who had lived in Wisconsin for a year,  
in a letter to The Times  of London, May 14, 1850
Essential Question:   How did environmental and economic factors 
contribute to patterns of migration between  
1750 and 1900?
An increasingly global economy characterized by economic imperialism 
and the availability of different modes of transportation promoted a new era 
in migrations. As industrialization grew, populations moved to urban centers. 
Some workers who left their homelands, such as the Lebanese merchants in 
the United States or the Italian laborers in Argentina, could travel back to 
their native country for visits or to retire. Others, like the Irish settler quoted 
above, chose a permanent resettlement as relief from economic and political 
difficulties. Other movements of people were coerced. To meet the demands 
for workers, coerced and semi-coerced migration of people resulted in slavery, 
indentured servitude, and convict labor. 
Migration through Labor Systems
The desire for low-wage labor was linked to the exploitation of natural resources 
in the system of economic imperialism. Even though slavery was gradually 
being abolished in imperial territories in the 19th century, the demand for the 
agricultural goods that enslaved workers had produced was still increasing. 
European states recruited new laborers to work on plantations, where they 
produced enormous wealth that fueled industrial growth at home:
• Indian laborers migrated to British colonies in the Caribbean, South 
Africa, East Africa, and Fiji. 
• Chinese laborers migrated to California and British Malaya to build 
railroads and serve as farmhands, gardeners, and domestics. 
• Japanese laborers migrated to Hawaii, Peru, and Cuba to work on  
sugar plantations. 
418 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONSlavery  Most countries in the Americas abolished the African slave trade 
in the early 19th century. Slavery itself continued, but without a fresh supply 
of enslaved people, the institution declined. Only in the United States did the 
number of enslaved people increase after the abolition of the slave trade. The 
last countries to abolish slavery in the Americas were the United States 1865, 
Cuba 1886, and Brazil 1888. 
In spite of prohibitions, Africans continued enslaving one another well 
into the 20th century. As slavery was being abolished, labor was still desired, 
so imperial countries turned to other forms of coerced labor.
Indentured Servitude  People who worked for a set number of years 
before becoming free were indentured servants. Many people became 
indentured as a way to pay for their transportation from a desperately poor 
community to one with more opportunity. Others were forced to do so to pay 
off a debt. 
Some of these servants intended to work temporarily, earning money for 
their family, and then return home. But many stayed in their new country. As a 
result, indentured laborers brought their home cultures to their new lands and 
altered the demographics of these lands. For example, the cultures of Mauritius 
in the Indian Ocean off Southeast Africa, Fiji in the South Pacific, and 
Trinidad in the Caribbean added a strong Indian influence.
Asian Contract Laborers  Many Chinese and Indian workers were 
an early substitute for the slave trade. They were forced or tricked into

419 CAUSES O- MIGRATIO N IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLD419servitude. Britain first tried this form of labor after ending the slave trade 
in 1806. They imported 200 Chinese to Trinidad. Between 18 and 18, 
the British, French, Dutch, and Spanish had imported between 250,000 
and 500,000 Chinese workers to their colonies in Southeast Asia, Africa, 
and the Caribbean. About 125,000 Chinese were sent to Cuba alone, where  
80 percent worked the sugar plantations.
The life of an Asian contract workers was riddled with difficulty and 
unjust treatment. While they were not property, they were unskilled laborers 
or porters who were exploited as substitutes for slave labor, often working for 
subsistence wages. The media of the time brought the treatment of them to 
the attention of the public by criticizing the system as a new form of slavery. 
In 1855, Britain stopped its trade. In 1862 Congress banned the contract Asia  
labor trade in the United States, and in 18, under international pressure, 
Portugal ended it. A treaty between China and Spain in 1877 terminated the 
contracts of Chinese workers still in Cuba.
British Penal Colonies  In the late 1700s, Great Britain established a 
penal colony  in Australia after losing its original one in Georgia as a result 
of the American Revolution. The British government shipped convicts  from 
England, Scotland, and Ireland as well as British colonies such as India, to 
Australia. There, they performed hard labor and suffered harsh treatment. 
Actual imprisonment of the convicts was rare. Most performed labor for 
free settlers, worked for the government in record keeping, or worked on 
government projects such as road and railway building. The majority of 
convicts earned their freedom after a prescribed number of years of service. 
Some people sent to penal colonies were never allowed to return to Great 
Britain. In addition, because transportation back home was expensive, the 
majority decided to stay in Australia. By 1850, the British government ended 
the transportation of convicts to Australia, largely because a stay in Australia 
was not considered much of a punishment.
Australia also attracted free settlers, especially after gold was discovered 
there in 1851. Some 50,000 Chinese came during this gold rush. Eventually 
Australia became one of Britain’s most successful settler colonies.
French Penal Colonies  The French also had penal colonies in Africa, 
New Caledonia, and French Guiana. New Caledonia, an island part of an 
archipelago in the southwest Pacific Ocean 50 miles from Australia, served as 
a penal colony from 186 to 18 for both convicts and political prisoners. The 
penal colony in French Guiana, which included Devil’s Island, was notorious 
for its harsh treatment of convicts. Prisoners were underfed and forced to do 
hard labor. Although the French stopped transporting convicts in 1938, Devil’s 
Island continued to hold prisoners until 1953. Connect: Describe the changes

420 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMigration in the Face of Challenges
The word diaspora  is often applied to mass emigrations from a country or 
region that may take place over a period of many years. The African slave trade 
was responsible for one of the biggest diasporas in history, the involuntary 
emigration of millions of people between the 16th and 1th centuries. Most 
diasporas, however, were the result of poverty, political conditions, or famine.
India  Poverty was the principal reason that drove Indians to leave the 
subcontinent. In 18, the British began sending Indians to Mauritius as 
indentured laborers to replace enslaved workers on the sugar plantations. By 
188, Indians were working on plantations in British Guiana Guyana, Dutch 
Guiana Surinam, Natal South Africa, Fiji, and British and French islands in 
the Caribbean. Most Indian laborers signed five-year contracts. Many renewed 
their contracts, and some decided to stay permanently, accepting a piece of 
land or a lump sum rather than their passage back to India. Over 1.5 million 
Indians were shipped to colonies in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Oceania 
before Britain abolished the indenture system in 116. Between 1880 and 
1938, two systems recruited labor in Southeast Asia. 
• The kangani foreman who oversees workers system in Ceylon and 
Malaya recruited from their own extended family.
• The maistry  supervisors system in Burma recruited laborers within a 
structured system with defined hierarchies and sent them to plantations, 
usually in Southeast Asia. Conditions were highly exploitative.
China  The Chinese diaspora did not begin in earnest until the middle 
of the 19th century, with the gold rushes in California, South Australia, and 
western Canada. However, most Chinese migrants were not engaged in mining. 
Despite prejudices toward Chinese immigrants, the Chinese were instrumental 
in the development of the U.S. Transcontinental Railroad. Some Chinese paid 
their own way, but many more left China as indentured laborers. The vast 
majority of Chinese emigrants were males who planned to return to China 
after their time abroad.
People left China for many reasons, some to escape poverty or famine, 
others for better opportunities. Beginning in the late 18th century, a population 
explosion in coastal cities and contacts through foreign trade led large numbers 
of Chinese to emigrate  to Southeast Asia. Most of them were illiterate, landless 
peasants looking for opportunities abroad. However, most of the Chinese did 
not arrive in Southeast Asia until the mid-1th century, after the first Opium 
War made it easier for them to leave. Many people left as a result of the poverty 
and disorder brought on by the Taiping Rebellion 1850±186. See Topic 
6.2. After the middle of the century, most Chinese emigrated to the Americas, 
Europe, Australia, or New Zealand. 
421 CAUSES O- MIGRATIO N IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLDIreland  People emigrated from Ireland for many reasons. Some left for 
political reasons. Britain abolished the Irish Parliament in 1801 when Ireland 
became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Roman 
Catholics and Protestant dissenters faced religious discrimination from their 
British rulers. Evictions of tenant farmers increased after the 186 repeal of 
the Corn Laws, which had regulated the import and export of grain. During 
the Great Famine  185±18 that destroyed the potato crop for four years, 
as many as  million people emigrated from Ireland. Most went to the United 
States, but many others went to England, Scotland, Canada, or Australia.
Emigration continued even after the famine ended; as many people left 
Ireland in the first four years after the famine was over as left during the height 
of the famine. The Irish had been going to Great Britain and the United States 
to build canals since the 18th century, and they continued to leave to help build 
railroads. During the 18th and 19th centuries, 300,000 free Irish emigrated to 
Australia, and 5,000 Irish convicts were transported there. In the second half 
of the 1th century, about 5,000 Irish went to Argentina, although only about 
20,000 remained there. The rest moved on to the United States.

422 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONItaly  The first wave of Italian emigration began with the unification of 
Italy in 1861 and continued until 100. More than  million people left Italy 
during those four decades. More than half of them went to other countries in 
Europe, with most of the rest going to North and South America, Australia, 
and New Zealand. The main reason for the Italian diaspora was poverty. Two-
thirds of the emigrants during this period were men with traditional skills. 
Farmers had an increasingly difficult time making a living in harsh conditions, 
especially in a society where land was subdivided over generations. Some 
left for political reasons, while others left for economic reasons related to 
organized crime, especially in South Italy. Those who left often sent money 
back to family members, encouraging further emigration.
Migration to Settler Colonies
Large numbers of British citizens lived in all the colonies of the British 
Empire. Most who moved abroad permanently went to settler colonies such 
as Canada, South Africa, Australia, or New Zealand. Those who went to other 
colonies such as India, Malaya, or .enya, usually did so with no intention of 
staying permanently. Many went as officers or soldiers in the British army, as 
government officials in the Colonial Service , or as managers for plantations 
or other colonial enterprises. 
Technical Experts  Engineers and geologists migrated to South Asia 
and Africa. One was Andrew Geddes Bain, who emigrated to Cape Town, 
South Africa, in 1816. Bain initially worked on eight major roads and 
passes but moved on to a career in geological studies. Bain prepared the first 
comprehensive geological map of South Africa in 1852. In 185, he reported 
back to the British government about the copper mines in Namaqualand.  
British engineers were so numerous in the colonies that they formed a type 
of diaspora. They spread Western science and technology through the world. 
However, as they did, they blended their knowledge with the experience of 
engineers from the colonial lands. Together, people from Europe and the 
colonies collaborated on both public works and private industrial projects. 
Argentina  During the 19th century, Argentina was part of Britain’s 
“informal” empire. Britain invested more in Argentina than it did in India, 
the so-called “Jewel in the Crown” of the British Empire. Unlike most of 
the people who emigrated to make a new life for themselves, the British 
who settled in Argentina during the 19th century were not trying to escape 
poverty or persecution. They were primarily businessmen, traders, bankers, 
and engineers. They founded banks, developed the export trade in agricultural 
products, built railroads and other infrastructure, and imported luxuries that 
appealed to the growing Argentine middle class. 
Japan  Before 1868, Japan was closed to the rest of the world. However, 
by 1893, the Japanese government had decided that Japan should acquire an 
overseas empire and established the Colonization Society . Its aim was to 
export Japan’s surplus population as well as commercial goods. In 1892 the 
423 CAUSES O- MIGRATIO N IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLDSociety made an unsuccessful attempt to start an agricultural settler colony in 
Mexico. The failure of that attempt did not deter the society from sending 0 
Japanese to Peru in 1899 for contract work. At the same time, many young 
Japanese men were leaving Japan to study in the United States, congregating 
mostly in such cities as San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle on the West Coast. 
Tensions and anti-immigrant sentiment toward Japanese people intensified 
as immigrants assimilated to life in America. In 1907, the Gentlemen’s 
Agreement between the United States and Japan was an informal agreement 
that the U.S. would not impose restrictions on Japanese immigration, and 
Japan would not allow further emigration to the U.S. The agreement was never 
ratified and was ultimately ended by the Immigration Act of 12.
Migration,Transportation, and Urbanization
Improvements in transportation technology allowed some who migrated for 
work reasons to return to their home societies, either for a period of time or 
permanently. For example, in 1885, an agreement between the governments of 
Japan and Hawaii allowed Japanese laborers to go to Hawaii to work on the 
sugar plantations under three-year contracts. Approximately 29,000 Japanese 
went to Hawaii over the next nine years. During that time, thousands more 
Japanese went to other destinations in the South Pacific, including Australia, 
New Caledonia, and Fiji, under similar contracts. Most planned to return home 
after a few years.

Italian immigrants were so important to 
the economic and cultural development of 
Argentina that the city of Mendoza erected  
a monument to them in what is known as  
the Plaza Italia.
424 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIndustrial workers from Italy had similar arrangements for working in 
Argentina and then returning home, though many Italians settled permanently 
in Argentina. Since most industry was located in urban areas, both internal and 
external migrants often settled in cities, which increased in size and influence 
around the globe.

“Due to its structural weakness, the local silk industry could not withstand 
foreign competition from the silk of Japan and China and later on the 
introduction of artificial fabrics. It is also argued by many historians that the 
decision of many Christians to emigrate from the mountain was also stirred 
by increasing urbanization, the emergence of a middle class, and the fear of 
conscription in the Ottoman army. 
Commenting on the post-1860 generation of peasants, Akram .hater >wrote@:
‘Having grown in relative prosperity, these peasants were facing 
limitations that threatened to send them economically a few steps 
backward. At the end of the 1880s silk was no longer the golden 
crop it had been ten or twenty years before. At the same time, 
rising land prices and shrinking inheritance combined to make the 
economic future bleak. So it was that many peasants arrived at the 
year 1887 with a sense of malaise [uneasiness]. They did not have 
much land, and what little they had did not promise to make them 
a ‘good’ living. . . . Although some villagers did migrate seasonally 
to neighboring cities like Aleppo and Bursa, these areas provided 
limited opportunities as they were experiencing their own economic 
crises. . . . These drawbacks made a number of peasants look for other 
ways out of their dilemma—namely, how to make enough money 
quickly to guarantee their status as landowners and not slip back into 
the ranks of the landless laborers. About the only option that appeared 
on the economic horizons was emigration.’ ”

It shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come, or having so come after 
the expiration of said ninety days to remain within the United States. 
—Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
Essential Question:   How and why did patterns of migration affect society 
between 1750 and 1900?
Migration in the 19th century—whether undertaken freely to escape poverty 
or seek opportunity or coerced as part of an imperialist labor system—led to 
demographic changes with long-lasting results. Laborers tended to be male and 
from particular ethnic groups, such as the Indian indentured servants brought 
to work on sugar plantations in the Caribbean or the Chinese laborers recruited 
to complete the transcontinental railroad in the United States. These migrants 
often formed ethnic enclaves and created cultural groups that maintained 
elements of their native culture and religion while absorbing the influences 
of their new locations. For example, many Indians in Trinidad and Tobago 
practiced Hinduism and contributed to Caribbean musical traditions. These 
migrants also left behind women who sometimes took on the roles formerly 
filled by men and thus brought about change in migrants’ home societies. 
Migrant groups often experienced racial and ethnic prejudice. The Chinese 
Exclusion Act, noted above, was the first major U.S. federal legislation that 
specifically suspended immigration of a specific ethnic group. 
Changes in Home Societies
The experiences of migrants and the families they left behind varied widely 
depending on the norms of their home cultures. Migrant laborers were more 
often male than female, so in some places their migration—whether internal 
or external—brought a shift in demographics and gender roles in the societies 
they left. In some societies, males waited to emigrate until a male relative 
was available to live with and help support the women and children who did 
not emigrate with the males. In these places, women’s roles were much the 
same as before their husbands left. However, in other places, women gained 
some autonomy and authority as they took on responsibilities once filled by 
their husbands and took a meaningful place in society outside the bounds 
430 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONof family responsibilities. If they later followed their husbands to another 
country, they often participated more fully, though far from equally, in family 
decision-making than women who had not been on their own. If their husbands 
returned, women who had taken up their husbands’ responsibilities sometimes 
continued to play a role outside of domestic life, while those who had been put 
in the care of male relatives remained in traditional gender roles. 
Most male migrants sent remittances, funds from their foreign earnings, 
back home. If the remittance were large enough, women often reduced 
their hours working outside the home and spent more time with family 
responsibilities while also exercising considerable decision-making power 
over how the money was spent. In some places, the receipt of remittances 
correlates to girls’ longer school attendance; in other places boys seem to  have 
been the greater beneficiaries of remittance-supported education.

Immigrants were interested in a new economic start but intent on carrying 
with them their own traditions and culture. Ethnic enclaves , clusters or 
neighborhoods of people from the same foreign country, formed in many 
major cities of the world. In these areas inhabitants spoke the language of their 
home country, ate the foods they were familiar with from home, and pursued a 
way of life similar to that they had known in their home countries. At the same 
time, they influenced the culture of their new  homes which absorbed some of 
the migrants’ cultural traditions.
Chinese Enclaves
Many Chinese emigrated in search of work during the latter half of the 1th 
century—some to work on sugar plantations or for other agricultural endeavors, 
others to work in industry and transportation. Together, they spread Chinese 
culture around the world. 
Southeast Asia  The Chinese who migrated to Southeast Asia thrived 
under colonial rule. In Indochina, the French encouraged them to engage 
in commerce. In Malaya, they managed opium farms and controlled opium 
distribution for the British. In the Dutch East Indies, some Chinese held posts 
with the colonial government. As time went on, many Chinese throughout the 
region became business owners and traders, often founding family businesses. 
Some Chinese acquired great wealth as moneylenders or through international 
trade. By the end of the 19th century, the Chinese controlled trade throughout 
Southeast Asia and were a significant presence in the region. 
The Americas  Chinese immigrants first came to the United States in 
large numbers during the height of the California gold rush . Many worked in 
mines, but others found work on farms or in San Francisco’s garment industry.

431 E--ECTS  O- MIGRATIO N431Between 18 and 18, some 225,000 Chinese laborers were sent to 
Cuba and Peru on eight-year contracts. Almost all of them were male, and 80 
percent of them were sent to work on sugar plantations alongside enslaved 
Africans in Cuba and replacing enlaved workers in Peru, where slavery had 
been abolished. Other Chinese in Cuba were employed as servants, in cigarette 
factories, and in public works projects. Several thousand contract laborers in 
Peru helped build the Andean railroad and worked in the guano mines. In the 
1870s, some Chinese built settlements in the Peruvian Amazon, where they 
were active as merchants and grew rice, beans, sugar, and other crops.
In each area they lived, Chinese immigrants left their cultural stamp. Some 
Peruvian cuisine is a fusion of Chinese foods and ingredients and cooking 
styles of Peru. As in other areas, Chinese immigrants sometimes married local 
people and thus contributed to the multicultural diversity of populations. 
Indian Enclaves 
The British Empire abolished slavery in 1833. However, it was replaced with a 
system that was little better, indentured servitude. Indians were among the first 
indentured servants sent to work in British colonies.of family responsibilities. If they later followed their husbands to another 
country, they often participated more fully, though far from equally, in family 
decision-making than women who had not been on their own. If their husbands 
returned, women who had taken up their husbands’ responsibilities sometimes 
continued to play a role outside of domestic life, while those who had been put

432 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIndians in Africa  Many Indians went to Mauritius,  islands off the 
southeast coast of Africa, and Natal , a colony that is today part of South 
Africa, as indentured servants on sugar plantations. In Natal and British East 
Africa, they built railways. Nearly 32,000 indentured Indian workers went 
to .enya to work on railroad construction between 1886 and 101, but only 
about ,000 chose to stay. Today, Indians continue to make up significant parts 
of the population of these regions.
Both Hindus and Muslims emigrated from India to South Africa. The 
Hindus brought with them their caste system and the social laws that stem 
from it, but they soon abandoned the caste system. In contrast, many kept up 
Hindu traditions and had alters in their homes to honor deities.
The Hindu and Muslim Indian population of South Africa was divided 
by class, language, and religion. However, Indians in South Africa shared 
the injustice of discrimination, which became central to the work of a young 
Indian named Mohandas Gandhi . He arrived in Pretoria, South Africa, in 
1893, where he intended to practice law. After suffering repeatedly from racial 
discrimination, Gandhi became an activist. He founded the Natal Indian 
Congress  and worked to expose to the world the rampant discrimination 
against Indians in South Africa. In 11 Gandhi returned to India, where he 
became a leader in the Indian nationalist movement against British rule.
Indians in Southeast Asia  Between 18 and 1 India was the major 
source of labor for the British Southeast Asian colonies of Ceylon, Burma, 
and Malaya. Many Indians went to Malaya as indentured laborers. Indentured 
servitude was eventually replaced by the kangani system , under which entire 
families were recruited to work on tea, coffee, and rubber plantations in Ceylon, 
Burma, and Malaya. Their lives were less restricted than those of indentured 
laborers, and they had the advantage of having their families with them. It is 
estimated that about 6 million Indians migrated to Southeast Asia before the 
kangani system was abolished. Because Southeast Asia was relatively close, 
Indian workers there often kept close ties with India.
Indian traders settled in many countries where there were indentured 
laborers. They also looked for business opportunities throughout the British 
Empire, such as British East Africa.
Indians in the Caribbean Region  So many Indians were sent to work 
on the sugar plantations in and around the Caribbean that today they comprise 
the largest ethnic group in Guyana  and Trinidad and Tobago , and the 
second largest group in Suriname, Jamaica, Grenada, Saint 9incent and the 
Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Martinique and Guadeloupe. In many of the other 
Caribbean nations Indians constitute a sizable proportion of the population. In 
addition, they have blended ethnically with migrants from other parts of the 
world, creating a unique culture, affecting national cuisines, film, and music. 
Many of the countries in the region celebrate the arrival of the Indians with 
annual holidays or festivals.
433 E--ECTS  O- MIGRATIO NIrish Enclaves in North America
Before the American Revolution, most Irish who came to North America were 
Protestant descendants of Scots who had previously migrated to Ireland. They 
are often referred to as Scots-Irish . Most came as indentured servants. Those 
who paid their own passage often went west to the frontier.
After the American Revolution, most new Irish immigrants who came 
to the United States settled in northern cities. Many others went to British 
North America Canada, where they were able to get cheap land grants. By 
the 1830s, most new Irish immigrants were poorer than earlier settlers, and 
Catholic. Most of those who settled in cities worked in factories. Many of 
the men who came to the United States helped construct the canal system . In 
Canada as well as the United States, many Irish farmed. Most Irish immigrants 
were able to create decent lives for themselves and their children.
Half of the  million Irish who fled Ireland during the Great Famine 
came to North America. Most of this huge wave of Irish immigrants faced 
many hardships, not the least of them anti-immigrant nativist and anti-
Catholic sentiments in the United States. Nevertheless, immigration from 
Ireland continued strong after the Great Famine ended until the 1880s, when 
it gradually slowed. Many of these new immigrants were single women who 
came to the United States looking for work and husbands. More than half 
became domestic servants. Many of the men who came during this period were 
unskilled laborers.
Wherever they settled, the Irish in the United States spread their culture—
their lively dance music and holiday traditions such as the celebration of St. 
Patrick’s Day. They also had a strong influence on the conditions of laborers 
through their efforts at promoting labor unions, and their great numbers 
ensured the spread of Catholicism in the United States.
Second-generation Irish were often either white-collar  or skilled blue-
collar  workers. Many became “stars” of the new popular culture  that was 
taking root at the end of the century as boxers, baseball players, and vaudeville 
performers. Many second-and third-generation Irish, such as the Fitzgeralds 
and the Kennedys, became very wealthy and powerful.
Italians in Argentina
During the 18th and 19th centuries only the United States surpassed Argentina  
in the number of immigrants it attracted. The 1853 Argentine Constitution not 
only encouraged European immigration, but it also guaranteed to foreigners 
the same civil rights enjoyed by Argentine citizens.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Italians made up almost half of 
the European immigrants to Argentina. Today people of Italian descent make 
up more than 55 percent of the Argentine population. As a result, Italians have 
had an enormous influence on all aspects of Argentine culture and language. 
Argentine Spanish has absorbed many Italian words, and Italian is still widely 
spoken in Buenos Aires.
434 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONArgentina was underpopulated and had an enormous amount of fertile land, 
which appealed to Italian immigrants. Most of them were farmers, artisans, and 
day laborers. Wages in Argentina were much higher than in Italy. Agricultural 
workers, for example, could earn five to ten times as much in Argentina as in 
Italy. In addition, the cost of living, even in Buenos Aires, was much lower 
than that of many rural Italian provinces. Both of these factors allowed most 
immigrants to raise their standard of living greatly in a very short time. By 
10, Italian immigrants owned nearly 0 percent of Buenos Aires’ commercial 
establishments.
Prejudice and Regulation of Immigration
In the United States and Australia, native-born residents resented immigrants 
from China who were willing to work for lower wages. In response to these 
resentments, governments institutionalized discrimination against the Chinese. 
Regulation in the United States  
Nativists were powerful enough in California that a revised constitution ratified 
in 1879 included several provisions that targeted people from China:
• It prohibited the state, counties, municipalities, and public works from 
hiring Chinese workers. 
• It prevented individuals from China, and any others who were not 
considered white, from becoming citizens on the grounds that they were 
“dangerous to the well-being of the State.” 
• It encouraged cities and towns either to remove Chinese residents from 
within their limits or to segregate them in certain areas.
With many thousands of Chinese living in the United States by 1882, 
Congress banned further Chinese immigration by passage of the Chinese 
Exclusion Act . Initially limited to a ten year period, the policy was extended 
periodically and made permanent in 102. This act, which was finally repealed 
in 1, showed the discrimination in the United States.
After the U.S. Congress excluded Chinese immigrants, some of them began 
to move to Mexico. Mexican President 3orfirio 'ta] promoted immigration as 
well as development, especially in the northern area bordering the United States. 
Rather than working as laborers in the mines or railroads, most worked as truck 
farmers, shopkeepers, or manufacturers.
White Australia  
Before the Australian gold rushes of the 1850s and 1860s, most of the Chinese in 
Australia were indentured laborers, convicts, or traders. During the gold rushes, 
the Chinese population grew to around 50,000. In response to the influx of Chinese 
miners, the parliament of the province of 9ictoria passed a Chinese Immigration 
Act in 1855 that limited the number of Chinese who could come ashore from each 
ship. Many Chinese got around this law by landing instead in South Australia.
435 E--ECTS  O- MIGRATIO NIn December 1860, white miners in the goldfields of New South Wales 
attacked the area where Chinese miners were quartered, killing several and 
wounding many others. Several other attacks followed. One of the worst 
occurred on June 0, 1861, when several thousand white miners attacked the 
Chinese and plundered their dwellings.
In response to this violence, the New South Wales Legislative Council 
passed the Chinese Immigration Regulation and Restriction Act  in 
November of that year. The act, eventually repealed in 186, was an attempt 
to restrict the number of Chinese immigrants from entering the colony. By the 
end of the gold rushes in 1881, New South Wales passed the ,nflu[ oI Chinese 
Restriction Act , which attempted to restrict Chinese immigration by means of 
an entrance tax. 
After the gold rushes, the Chinese in Australia turned to other sources of 
income, such as gardening, trade, furniture making, fishing, and pearl diving. 
While Chinatowns  Chinese enclaves developed in cities across Australia, 
the Chinese made their biggest economic contributions in the Northern 
Territory and north Queensland regions. Eventually, however, anti-Chinese 
sentiment grew. Because the Chinese artisans and laborers would work for 
less than white Australians, resentment increased. Anti-Chinese leagues also 
began to develop.
Although the number of Chinese in Australia was declining, they were 
becoming more concentrated in Melbourne and Sydney and thus more visible. 
After six separate British self-governing colonies in Australia united under a 
single centralized government in 1901, the new parliament took action to limit 
non-British immigration. The new attorney general stated that the government’s 
policy was to preserve a “white Australia.” The White Australia Policy , as it 
was known, remained in effect until the mid-1970s. Connect: Compare the 
experiences in Australia of Chinese and Japanese immigrants. See Topic 6.6.

those who ha]e a diќerent complexion or who ha]e slightly flatter noses than 
ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much.
—Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness , 1899
Essential Question:   What was the relative signiÄcance of the effects of 
imperialism from 1750 to 1900?
Industrial capitalism caused significant developments between 150 to 100. 
The manufacturing capacity of industrialized nations caused an increase in 
the availability, affordability, and variety of both capital financial assets and 
consumer goods. However, this increased industrial capacity also led to an 
increased demand for natural resources—“the conquest of the earth”—to use 
in manufacturing these goods. Additionally, domestic markets soon became 
saturated, leading industrialized nations to seek out foreign markets to soak 
up the excess production. Competition for these markets increased among 
industrialized economies, especially those in the West. To reduce competition 
and increase profits, Western nations continued to look to empire-building, 
begun in the previous era, as a solution to these challenges. 
Ninetheenth-century imperialism also caused significant effects, including 
increased migration, the rise of independence movements within the colonies, 
and increased political and economic rivalry among Western European nations 
that would lead to catastrophic events in the early 20th century.
Changes in Standards of Living
Due to increased automation, the use of interchangeable parts, the division 
and specialization of labor, and the assembly line, the efficiency of industrial 
production increased. This efficiency led to greater output, especially of such 
consumer goods as textiles, home furnishings, clothing, and porcelain. As the 
supply of consumer goods increased, the availability of goods rose and the 
prices fell. In addition, increased global industrial production led to greater 
competition and variety of both consumer and capital goods. For some people, 
standards of living improved with the proliferation of consumer goods. 
One way economists measure standard of living is by tracing patterns 
in real wages²those adjusted for inflation. Real wages signify the amount 
440 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONof goods or services that can be bought. In the early years of the Industrial 
Revolution, some studies show that real wages grew slowly, but after 1819   
the pace of growth accelerated, and between 1819 and 1852 they doubled.  The 
growth of real wages paralleled the rise in consumption. By these measures, 
standards of living increased for people of all income groups. 
At the same time, however, the distribution of income the wealth gap 
became more pronounced. Additionally, some of the rise in income was offset 
by the growing problems in an industrialized society—pollution, crowded 
cities, and the costs of wars. With these taken into consideration, standards of 
living may not have risen for many people. 
Overseas Expansion
As more countries industrialized and the capacity to produce goods increased, 
overproduction became a serious economic issue. Domestic markets could 
no longer consume the amount of goods being produced. As a result, 
international trade transformed industrial economies from mercantilist to 
capitalist systems. Industrialized economies looked to increase exports of 
their products. The desire to increase exports, however, caused both economic 
and political rivalries among industrialized countries as businesses sought out 
new international customers and enlisted their government’s assistance to help 
open previously closed or inaccessible markets.Average Percentage of GD P*

As production increased, new and greater amounts of natural resources 
were required by industrial economies. In addition, such common industrial 
resources as coal and iron, tin, bauxite, rubber, and copper were also imported 
from sources in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. A key effect of 
industrial capitalism, therefore, was the expansion of imperialism in the 19th 
441 CAUSATIO N IN THE IMPERIAL AGE441century. Industrialized countries, especially those in Western Europe, the U.S., 
and Japan, saw the benefits of controlling trade and resources of other areas of 
the world. This trend was a continuation from the previous era during which 
European countries created colonies in the Western Hemisphere and in the 
Indian Ocean. 
In contrast, the dependent colonial economies that provided raw material 
to and markets for the imperial powers often saw little economic development 
from participation in the world economy. Reliance on the cash crops introduced 
by imperial powers often left them vulnerable to natural disasters and volatile 
markets. 
In this era, however, states and people in regions that had previously been 
able to resist European colonization found themselves increasingly dominated 
by Western powers. Most areas of Africa came under the direct control of 
European colonizers. Large portions of South Asia and Southeast Asia were 
colonized, mainly by Great Britain and France, respectively. Even China, the 
most dynamic civilization in previous eras, succumbed to the domination of 
Western and Japanese imperialists. Western powers were able to achieve this 
level of dominance because of the technological advances associated with the 
Industrial Revolution. Advances in military technology, ship building, and 
medicine helped Western European nations  assert control over these other 
regions. 
Seeds of Revolution and Rebellion
In the late 1700s, the former North American colonies of Great Britain  revolted 
against its colonial rule and declared themselves the independent nation of 
the United States of America. Shortly after, France threw off the yoke of the 
monarchy and established a republic. In the early 1800s, former Spanish and 
Portuguese colonies in South America also became independent states. 
As western imperialism took hold in other parts of the world, the seeds 
of resistance and rebellion that would, in time, lead to new nation-states took 
root. Westernization assimilation of Western culture was often resisted in 
colonized or dominated areas. In South Asia, for example, Indian soldiers 
known as sepoys rose up in rebellion against the British East India Company. 
While the rebellion was brutally suppressed by British soldiers, the effect 
was the disbandment of the British East India Company and the direct rule 
of India by the British government, commencing a period now known as the 
British Raj. Similarly, westernization was opposed in China by the Boxers 
who attempted to rid China of Western influence, especially from Christian 
missionaries. These nascent independence movements would lead to the more 
widespread and successful nationalism of the post-World War II period.
442 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMigration and Discrimination
One of the more significant effects of modern imperialism was the migration 
from dependent or less industrial areas of the world to the dominant industrial 
economies. People emigrated from rural areas to urban areas within countries 
and from less developed areas of Europe to more developed areas of Europe. 
Immigrants looking for economic opportunity left many European 
countries and settled in the United States and Canada, often making up a large 
proportion of the industrial workforce. Some immigrants signed contracts to 
travel to areas to work for a prescribed period of time, pay back the cost of 
their transport, and then either settle in these areas or return to their homelands. 
These indentured laborers, as they were called, came from China, Japan, South 
Asia, and Europe and found themselves working and living in the Americas, 
Southeast Asia, Africa, or Australia. If they chose to settle in their host 
country, they often formed enclaves, or communities, with others from their 
home country. Often, these immigrants were faced with discrimination based 
on race, religion, or other factors. The spread of global capitalism resulted 
in the accumulation of wealth by the middle and upper classes, while the 
working classes in the industrial economies, already exploited by the profit 
motive, found themselves in direct competition for jobs with immigrants from 
nonindustrial countries.
REFLECT ON THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. Causation There are many ways to determine the relative significance 
of the effects of a historical development. These are some of the criteria 
for ranking the relative impact of effects:
• The depth of change it brought about in people
• The number of people it affected
• How long the effect lasted
• The importance of the change it represented
 Choose one of the effects of imperialism and evaluate it based on these 
criteria for determining significance.
2. In one to three paragraphs, explain the relative significance of  the 
effects of imperialism from 1750 to 1900.

UNIT 6 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   HOW DID COLONIZATION  PROMOTE  
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC GROWTH&
In the 19th century, the European powers believed that building a 
modern economy required establishing colonies. They focused on the 
economic and political benefits of imperialism. 
Problems with Imperialism  By the early 20th century, as the 
struggles of the workers and the burden of imperialist wars began to take 
a toll, some historians focused on the costs of imperialism. British writer 
J. A. Hobson argued in his book Imperialism: A Study 10 imperialist 
competition for new resources and markets was a flaw in capitalism. The 
accumulation of capital in the hands of a few profit-seeking capitalists 
pressured governments to take over underdeveloped nations and to protect 
access to them. Hobson then explained how this was justified, based on 
the needs of a growing population or hopes for quick profits, but that 
those supporting this greed for territorial acquisition did not consider the 
associated political and economic costs. 
Hobson believed that the system could be improved through greater 
global cooperation and planning. In contrast, Russian revolutionary 
9ladimir Lenin wrote in Imperialism, The Highest Stage of Capital 
Development 11 that imperialist conflicts would cause capitalist 
states to destroy each other and usher in the era of communism. 
%enefits to SoPe  In the late 20th century, historians living in an age 
of increasing globalization re-studied the roots of the world economy. 
Immanuel Wallerstein, an American social scientist, popularized world-
systems theory. He described a dynamic system of two main regions: 
• The core included highly developed nations that accumulated 
capital and demanded resources and markets from under- or less-
developed regions
• The periphery consisted of regions that provided resources and 
markets as well as labor needed by the core 
Wallerstein traced the roots of this world-system to the mid-16th century. 
Colonialism became the means by which peripheral states became 
incorporated into the world economy. However, Wallerstein noted that 
politics and culture vary within the world economy, so nations could be 
semi-peripheral at some point and possibly move to the core—or the 
other way around. He cited Spain as an example. Although this world-
system caused inequalities, its dynamic nature insured its durability.

WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  WRITE  THE INTROD UCTION
After you analyze the task, gather and organize evidence, and develop 
an effective thesis statement, much of the hard work in writing a long 
essay is behind you. The most challenging task still remaining is to write 
an introduction that 1 serves as a blueprint for the rest of the essay and 
2 casts the topic in a broader historical perspective.
The Introduction as Blueprint  In generic terms, a good introduction 
conveys the framework or limits of the topic as well as a clear debatable and 
defensible claim. The claim should be expressed in one or more sentences in 
the same location—ideally the introduction. The introduction also suggests 
the organizational pattern and reasoning process that will unfold in the rest of 
the essay. In other words, it conveys without saying, “Here’s what I’m going 
to argue. Here’s the reasoning process I am going to use to convince you. 
Here’s the order I will use to present my ideas.” The reasoning process may 
be causation, continuity and change, or comparison. Each reasoning process 
suggests a unique organization. See Write as a Historian in Topic  .. 
Historical Perspective  A good introduction also relates the topic of 
the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occur before, during, or that continue after the time frame of the question. 
In other words, it conveys without saying, “Here’s how this topic relates 
to what came before it/what came after it/what else was going on in other 
parts of the world or other aspects of society, and any number of broader 
historical patterns and trends.” The introduction is a good place to point out 
the historical perspective, but it will need further development later in the 
essay. A simple reference to a historical perspective is not sufficient to earn 
points on the exam.
Application  Find both the blueprint and historical perspective in the 
following introduction. How does the introduction answer these questions:
• What is the author’s argument? 
• What reasoning process will the author use? 
• What order will the author likely use? 
• How does the topic relate to broader historical events, 
developments, or processes?
The new global capitalist economy that developed between 1750 and 
1900 brought many obvious changes as smokestacks and ships laden 
with raw materials for industry became commonplace. One of the 
most dramatic changes, however, was the effect of industrialization on 
patterns of migration, from the countryside to the city and from one 
country to another. These changes in turn brought about significantly 
different social conditions that laid the foundation for challenges many 
countries continue to face today.

LONG ESSAY QUESTIONS
Directions:  Write essay responses to 1, 2, and EITHER 3 or 4. The suggested 
writing time for each essay is 40 minutes.
1. In the period 1750 to 1900, some European powers suffered a decrease 
in influence, and new empires emerged²one in the Americas and one 
in Asia.  
Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which the global 
balance of power shifted during that era.
2. From 1750 to 1900, nationalist movements emerged throughout South 
America, Africa, and Asia as resistance to imperialist powers increased.  
Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which internal factors 
influenced the process of state building during that era. 
3. European powers divided up much of Africa and India from 1750 
to 1900, but indigenous peoples had their own opinions about 
imperialism.  
Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which the responses 
of native people to imperialism were similar in India and Sub-Saharan 
Africa between 1750 and 1900. 
4. As the economy grew increasingly global from 1750 to 1900, 
working people in Eurasia, the Americas, Australia, and Africa began 
moving into urban centers and across borders, but many had the same 
motivations their ancestors had.  
Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which the migration 
patterns from 1750 to 1900 show changes or continuities over time.

UNIT 7:   Global Conflict  
After 1900
Understand the Context
The 20th century was a time of great social and political change, much of which 
resulted in tension and division. People and states challenged existing political 
and social orders, while new technologies and scientific advancements both 
advanced understanding of the universe and enabled the two world wars to be 
increasingly destructive. 
Shifting Powers  Challenges to existing states and political establishments 
set the stage for shifting powers throughout the 20th century. Long-established 
states such as the Ottoman Empire dissolved, while new political experiments 
such as communism emerged in Russia, China, and elsewhere. The ongoing 
power of nationalism and traditional rivalries, combined with economic 
instability, soon embroiled most of Europe and its colonies, the United States, 
Japan, and China in the First World War. Though dubbed “the war to end all 
wars,” it was not. World War II was far larger and bloodier. Additional conflicts 
occurred as colonized regions fought for independence.
A Changing World  Rapid advances in technology altered the 
understanding of the universe and the natural world in the 20th century. 
Advancements in communication, transportation, industry, agriculture, and 
medicine brought people longer lives, greater opportunities to find meaningful 
work, and better access to information. However, emerging military 
technologies also made war more deadly. World War I featured advancements 
such as the aircraft, while World War II enabled the development of the atomic 
bomb. Mass atrocities were also brought about by the intentional destruction 
of entire ethnic or religious groups of people, including the Holocaust during 
World War II. Totalitarian governments, such as the one under Joseph Stalin 
in the Soviet Union, adopted repressive policies that resulted in the deaths of 
many millions of people.19002000 1950A political

SHIFTING POWER453
4537.1
Shifting Power
I shall never, under any circumstances, agree to a representative form  
of government because I consider it harmful to the people whom God  
has entrusted to my care. 
—Russian Tsar Nicholas II (1905)
Essential Question:   How did internal and external factors contribute to 
change in various states after 1900?
An intense period of rebellion continued into the early 100s. Nicholas II, the 
last Russian tsar, clearly did not understand the force of the political opposition 
to his rule that resulted in his assassination in 118. In the 20th century’s first two 
decades, rebellions erupted against long-standing authoritarian governments 
in Russia, China, and Mexico. Revolutionaries unseated ruling governments in 
each country, challenging the existing political and social order and instituting 
their own political philosophies and practices. Established land-based and 
maritime empires collapsed under pressure from internal and external forces. 
By the end of the century, a new global order had emerged.
Revolution in Russia
By the early 20th century, Russia was falling behind most of Europe, the 
United States, and Japan in wealth in power. 
Russia’s  most obvious challenges were internal. While governments 
in other industrializing states in the 19th century were actively promoting 
economic growth, Russia was not. It was slow to expand education for 
peasants, build roads and other parts of its transportation networks, and support 
entrepreneurs with loans and contracts. Further, the tsarist government resisted 
calls for political reform. It did was reluctant to recognize civil liberties and to 
allow more citizens to participate in government. 
These internal problems led to external ones. Without a strong economic 
base to support a military, Russia then became weaker in international affairs:
• It lost the Crimean War (1853–1856) against the Ottoman Empire,, 
which was supported by Great Britain and France.
• It lost the Russo-Japanese War 10±105 in a battle for power in 
East Asia.
454 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn the fall of 1917, the Bolsheviks , an organization representing the 
revolutionary working class of Russia under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, 
seized power and set up a communist government with Lenin at its head. 
The communists  believed that workers eventually should own the means of 
production and that collective ownership would lead to collective prosperity 
and a just society. Toward that long-term goal, the Soviet government abolished 
private trade, distributed peasants’ crops to feed urban workers, and took over 
ownership of the country’s factories and heavy industries (see Topic 7.4)
Key Events Leading to Revolution in Russia
Internal •  Bloody Sunday, January 22, 1905: Thousands of workers 
marched peacefully to petition the tsar asking for better working 
conditions, higher wages, and universal suɈrage. The tsar’s troops 
and police began shooting. About 1,300 marchers were killed.
•  The Revolution of 1905:  In strikes responding to Bloody Sunday, 
400,000 workers refused to work. The tsar tried to appease the 
protesters. However, by the end, thousands of workers had been 
killed, inQured, or exiled.
External •  Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905): Russia and Japan both 
wanted to expand their influence in 2orea and Manchuria. Japan 
won easily, the first time in modern history that an East Asian state 
had defeated a European power.
•  World War I: Germany declared war on Russia in 1914. Russians 
quickly realized how poorly trained and armed their troops were. 
Civilians suɈered from extreme food shortages.
The success of the Bolsheviks in taking power shook the world. They 
were the first example of communists running a large country. Throughout the 
capitalist world, from Europe to the United States to Japan, people worried that 
communists were a danger to their governments as well. The conflict between 
communism and capitalism would become an important issue shaping world 
affairs in the rest of the 20th century.
Upheaval in China
China was another land-based empire that collapsed in this period from 
problems it faced at home and from other countries. The Qing Dynasty had 
come to power in China in 1644. Finally, a revolution overthrew it in 1911, 
creating a republic led first by Dr. Sun Yat-sen . However, his rule was short. 
Internal Challenges  China faced daunting domestic concerns in the 19th 
century, each of which weakened support for the government. One of these was 
ethnic tension. China consisted of dozens of ethnic groups. The largest group 
was the Han. The rulers of the Qing Dynasty were Manchus, from a region 
northeast of China. Many Chinese, particularly the Han, never fully accepted 
the Qing as legitimate rulers of China. By the late 1th century, the Qing had 
ruled China for over two centuries, but they had remained ethni cally distinct. 
455 SHIFTING POWERA second problem was the constant danger of famine. China experienced 
rapid population growth between the mid-100s and mid-1800s, but could not 
expand the amount of farmland or productivity rapidly enough to provide a 
stable food supply. Any natural disaster, such as a drought or a flood, could 
result in the early deaths of thousands of people. 
Third, government revenues were very low. The imperial government had 
not updated the tax system to adjust to changes in the economy. As a result, 
compared to Europe or the United States, taxes in China were low. This meant 
that the government did not have the resources to maintain roads, bridges, and 
irrigation canals. 
External Challenges  China had been one of the wealthiest, most 
powerful, most innovative states in the world for much of its recorded history. 
However, starting in the late 18th century, it faced growing threats to its 
position by industrialization in Europe. In the late 18th century, Europeans 
interested in the Chinese market could trade only in the city of Canton 
Guangzhou. Europeans commonly bought tea, rhubarb, porcelain, and silk. 
In Europe, Chinese fashions, table settings, and art objects were very popular. 
The Chinese received European silver in exchange for they sold. However, the 
Chinese did not desire the products Europeans produced, and they looked down 
on Europeans as violent and less civilized. In response to growing European 
influence in China, many Chinese did rally behind the empress in the 180s.  
Chinese Republic  However the desire to support the empress against 
foreign pressure was not enough to save the Qing Dynasty. In 111, the last 
Chinese dynasty was overthrown by a revolutionary movement led by Sun 
Yat-sen. Though a Christian, Sun believed that China should continued to 
follow such Confucian principles as loyalty, respect for ancestors, and efforts 
to promote social harmony. He combined these traditions with ideas he later 
elaborated upon in his book The Three People’ s Principles:
• Democracy:  Sun believed in sovereignty, not for all the people but 
for those Chinese who were “able.” In Confucian terms, this meant a 
country governed by active and pragmatic experts in the name of the 
people. He felt that expelling foreign capitalists from China would 
enable China to redistribute revenues from land taxes more fairly , since 
the revenues would not have to be used to pay debts to foreigners.
• Nationalism:  Sun advocated patriotism and loyalty, primarily to central 
authority.
• Livelihood:  Sun wanted to end the extreme unequal distribution of 
wealth in China and the harsh economic exploitation.
Sun Yat-sen’s Legacy  Sun never had enough military strength to rule 
all of China. 9arious warlords controlled the majority of the country. Sun 
recognized the weakness of his position. After two months in office, he gave 
up his position to a military leader.
456WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe party Sun led, the Chinese Nationalist Party, or .uomintang, would 
later regain power. It would rule China for two decades before losing a civil 
war with Chinese Communists see Topic .5.While both the .uomintang 
and the Communists would honor Sun as the founder of the Chinese republic, 
neither would fully implement his principles. 
Self-Determination in the Ottoman Collapse
By the beginning of the 20th century, the once-mighty Ottoman Empire²
now “the sick man of Europe”²had relatively few exports and a waning 
agricultural economy. The empire relied mostly upon its position as a trade 
center. Egypt, by contrast, continued to make profits from cotton.
The Young Turks  As Ottoman prosperity declined, a group of reformers 
known as the Young Turks  emerged. They advocated for a constitution like 
those of the European states. They also advocated 7urNification an effort 
to make all citizens of the multiethnic empire identify with Turkish culture, 
which was heavily Islamic. For the millions of Armenians in the empire, 
who were mostly Christians, this was difficult. In response, some Young 
Turks scapegoated, or unfairly blamed, Armenians for the empire’s economic 
problems. Connect: Compare the cultural assimilation forced on Armenians 
to that forced on American Indians. See Topic 6.. 
)iJht $Jainst )oreiJn ,nfluence  Turks resented many Europeans, 
particularly the British and the French, for their economic policies. Foreign 
investments had given Europeans undue power in the empire. Further, 
Europeans had imposed trade privileges that were unprofitable for the 
Ottomans. Because of these resentments,  the Ottoman Empire secretly allied 
with Germany in World War I. See Topic .2. After Germany’s defeat in 
World War I, the Ottoman Empire was dismantled by the victorious powers. 
It was replaced by a smaller nation-state, the Republic of Turkey, and several 
independent countries.
9ictorious Allied forces immediately sent troops to occupy Anatolia. 
Although the sultan of the Ottoman Empire remained on his throne, he had 
little power. He served as a mere puppet for British forces that hoped to control 
the lands of the former empire. 
The Rise of Atatürk  During the war, a group called the Turkish National 
Movement organized an army to fight for self-determination. Led by Mustafa 
.ePal the Turkish Nationalists defeated British and other forces in 121. The 
Republic of Turkey was established in 12, with .emal as the first president. 
The new national assembly awarded him the surname Atatürk  “father of the 
Turks” in recognition of his role in establishing the new republic.
Atatrk’s policies focused on reforming Turkey to make it more like the 
Western democracies. He was determined to create a secular nation, not one 
with strong Islamic influences. He implemented several reforms: establishing 
public education for boys and girls, abolishing polygyny, and expanding 
457 SHIFTING POWERsuffrage to include women. As a symbolic gesture, he wore mainly Western 
suits and hats and encouraged others to do the same. Despite his reforms, he 
ruled as a dictator for 15 years. He did not give up power before his death  
in 1938.
Power Shifts in Mexico 
Mexico entered the 20th century as an independent nation firmly under the 
control of a dictator, 3orfirio 'ta] . He oversaw a period of stability and some 
economic progress. However, he had allowed foreign investors, particularly 
those from the United States, control over many of the country’s resources. 
Additionally, the wealthiest 1 percent of the population controlled  percent 
of the land. Typical Mexican peasants were landless.
Revolution  In 1910, Díaz jailed Francisco Madero , the opposition 
candidate for president. This act, combined with the growing opposition 
to Díaz’s strong-armed policies, accommodation to foreign powers, and 
opposition to land reform, ignited the Mexican Revolution.  Madero escaped 
and set up revolutionary offices in El Paso, Texas. Then, in 111, Madero’s 
troops, under the command of )rancisco ³3ancho´ 9illa  defeated Mexican 
troops, sending Díaz into exile. One revolutionary leader, Emiliano Zapata , 
began the actual process of redistributing land to impoverished peasants. 
Until 120, Mexico suffered from political instability and devastating 
violence. Between 110 and 120, conflict resulted in around 2 million deaths, 
out of a population of around 15 million people. Political violence continued 
for another decade. However, two results came out of conflicts between 110 
and 10 that provided Mexico with stability for the rest of the century:
• Mexico adopted a new constitution in 11. It included the goals of 
land redistribution, universal suffrage, and public education. These 
principles continued to guide Mexico’s government.
• The Institutional Revolutionary Party , or 35, was formed in 1929. 
Though widely criticized as corrupt, the PRI dominated Mexican 
politics. Until 2000, all presidents were PRI members.

On the surface, modern revolutions appear to follow a similar pattern. 
In The Anatomy of Revolution 18, Crane Brinton described the 
similarities of four political revolutions: the English Revolution of the 
160s, the American Revolution of 16, the French Revolution of 
1789, and the Russian Revolution of 1917. Brinton thought that all four 
revolutions went through four stages.
1. Citizens become dissatisfied with government.
2. Moderates gain more power.
3. Radicals take over in a “terror” phase.
4. The process culminates in a period of relative calm and 
acceptance.
Within this pattern, each revolution had unique revolutionary 
circumstances and outcomes. For example, Brinton acknowledged 
that the American Revolution, unlike the other three, lacked a “terror” 
phase. He concluded his study by noting that some top-down reforms 
imposed by government or elite leaders brought more lasting social 
change than the political revolutions he described.

CAUSES OF WORLD WAR I 461
7.2
Causes of World War I
The next great European war will probably come out of  
some damned foolish thing in the Balkans.
—German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck (1888)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and consequences  
of World War I?
In the years before World War I, social and political developments, including 
shifting powers, contributed to the escalation of tensions that resulted in 
global conflict. European nations, expanding their empires, competed for raw 
material resources in Africa and Asia. A series of mutual alliances created 
entanglements that committed nations to defense systems that would draw 
them into war. Arms races involving Germany, Great Britain, and Russia gave 
military establishments great influence.
The immediate cause of the war’s outbreak had its roots in yet another 
cause of conflict²a rising wave of nationalism. As Bismarck predicted, this 
clash erupted in the Balkans when Serbian nationalists, protesting  Austria-
Hungary’s control over the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, assassinated 
Austro-Hungarian $rchGuNe )ran] )erGinanG . Thus World War I began.
Immediate Causes of the Great War
World War I, which lasted from 1914 to 1918, was known as the  Great  
War ²not because of its positive nature, but because of the immense 
scale of the fighting. No previous war had involved as many nations from 
different parts of the world or killed as many soldiers and civilians. However,  
World War I did more than create an enormous body count. It fundamentally 
weakened the Western European powers, thus encouraging the growth of 
nationalism and appeals for self-rule within European colonies in Asia and 
Africa. Treaties signed at the end of this war helped set the stage for World 
War II. World War I was one of the most significant events of the 20th century.
A long series of events led up to World War I. The immediate cause was 
the assassination by Gavrilo Princip  of $rchGuNe )ran] )erGinanG  the 
heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, on June 28, 11. 
Princip, a Serbian, was a member of the Black Hand , a nationalist 
462WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONorganization devoted to ending Austro-Hungarian presence in the Balkans. 
From the Austro-Hungarian perspective, however, the Black Hand was a 
terrorist group. 
Immediately after the assassinations, Austria-Hungary sent an ultimatum 
to the Serbian government, demanding that it end all anti-Austrian agitation 
in Serbia. When the Serbian government rejected the ultimatum, Austria-
Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28, 11. Austria-Hungary looked to 
its ally Germany, a stronger nation with more firepower, for military assistance 
to punish Serbia. Serbia, populated by ethnic Slavs, looked to other Slavic 
countries, particularly Russia, for help. On August 1, Germany declared war 
on Russia, and two days later on France. The following day, Britain declared 
war on Germany, and on August 6 Austria declared war on Russia. By the end 
of August 11, Japan’s entrance into the conflict changed a relatively minor 
incident into a true world war.
Long-Term Causes of the Great War
Princip’s actions were not the sole cause of World War I. Tensions in Europe 
had been simmering for decades. One way to remember the sources of these 
tensions is with the acronym MAIN: Militarism, Alliances, Imperialism, and 
Nationalism.
Militarism  Defined as aggressive military preparedness, militarism  
celebrates war and the armed forces. European powers had been competing for 
dominance one way to prove their strength was to invest in the military. Great

The arrest of Gavrilo Princip after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in 
Sarajevo, Bosnia, June 28, 11.
463 CAUSES OF WORLD WAR I 463Britain and Germany in particular spent a great deal of money on building up 
their armies and navies, heavily recruiting young men to join their armed forces 
and building more ships and amassing other military hardware. Because of the 
Industrial Revolution, it was possible to mass-produce weapons and supplies. 
A nation’s militaristic attitude influenced its public to view war as a festive 
competition, more like a game than a gravely serious matter. “Everybody said, 
µIt’ll be over by Christmas,’” a British soldier named Bill Haine recalled.
Alliances  In their quest for power, European nations also formed secret 
alliances ²groups whose members secretly agree to protect and help one 
another when attacked. When one member of an alliance was attacked in any 
way, the other members were expected to stand up for that particular member. 
This system explains why Russia and Germany were ready to jump into the 
conflict between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. 
Furthermore, countries that were allied with other countries were also 
sworn enemies of members of other alliances. For example, Britain and France 
were allies with Russia in the alliance called the Triple Entente , and all three 
viewed Germany as a rival²for different reasons. France was bitter about its 
defeat in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) and the loss to Germany of 
Alsace-Lorraine, a major industrial region with rich deposits of iron ore. Both 
Britain and France competed with Germany for colonies in Africa. After the 
war began, the Triple Entente became known as the Allies  as they were joined 
by Italy, Japan, China, the United States, and other countries. By the end of the 
war, there were a total of 2 Allies and “Associated Powers.”
The Allies’ rival alliance before the war was known as the Triple 
Alliance , composed of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. However, 
when the war began, Italy remained neutral until 115, when it switched 
its allegiance and joined the Allies. At the outbreak of the war, the Ottoman 
Empire and Bulgaria joined the former Triple Alliance, which was now 
called the Central Powers .

464WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONImperialism  The alliance system developed largely because Western 
European countries became bitter rivals for global domination. One of the 
most important ways these nations could assert their power and generate 
wealth was to own overseas colonies. During the latter half of the 19th century, 
for example, Western European countries scrambled for any available land 
in Africa to add to the colonies they already owned in Asia, the Americas, 
and the Pacific. Once European powers had claimed nearly all the land in 
Africa, they began fighting with one another over colonies. Thus, imperialism 
was a driving force behind tensions in Europe leading up to the archduke’s 
assassination. Connect: Describe the development of imperialism and how it 
could have led to the tensions of the early 20th century. See Topic 6.2.
Nationalism  The assassination of the archduke in June 1914, the 
immediate cause of war, illustrates the growth of nationalism, the final long-
term cause of the Great War. On a basic level, nationalism originates from 
a feeling of pride in one’s national identity. Multinational empires such as 
the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire had to contend with 
different nationalist movements among their subject peoples. Serbs like Princip 
wanted to rid their land of Austro-Hungarian domination, and Arabs were tired 
of the limitations the Ottoman Empire imposed on them. Both groups sought 
self-determination ²the idea that peoples of the same ethnicity, language, 
culture, and political ideals should be united and should have the right to form 
an independent nation-state. Militant nationalists among Serbs and Arabs 
fought for the Allies, thus extending the boundaries of the Great War.
Consequences of the Great War
As the 20th century began, most Europeans looked forward to a bright future. 
They expected a century of peace guaranteed by alliances, prosperity as a 
result of their colonial empires, and continued progress. All of that optimism 
was shattered on one fateful day in 1914.
Virtually every major event during the remainder of the 20th century was 
a direct or indirect result of World War I. The war led to the downfalls of four 
monarchies: Russia, Austria-Hungary, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire. It 
redrew the maps of Europe and the Middle East with the disintegration of 
Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Germany lost all its overseas colonies 
to various Allied nations, and the former Ottoman provinces of Iraq, Palestine, 
Syria, and Lebanon came under the control of Britain and France. But the war 
also led to the beginning of the end of colonialism.
New technologies made World War I the deadliest and most destructive 
war in human history. It disrupted European economies and had profound 
social consequences, including the rise of communism and fascism, colonial 
revolts, and genocide. There was a massive shift of power from Europe to the 
United States.

“Germany’s military culture developed a constellation of mutually reinforcing 
characteristics that enhanced tactical efficacy. Unleashed in war, however, 
these characteristics propelled the army to ever greater, and in the end, 
dysfunctional extremes of violence. . . . These interactive and self-generating 
characteristics . . . include:
• risk-taking 
• the dogmatic conviction that annihilation was the sole goal of war 
• resulting prescriptions for correct fighting (the offensive, concentration of

• minutely technical planning 
• focus on the tactical and operative rather than the strategic 
• disregard of logistics and thus growing unrealism 
• the conviction indeed requirement of one’s qualitative superiority over one’s 
enemies 
• a romantic ruthlessness and actionism (exaggerated drive for action) on the 
part of officers in order to bridge the gap between risk and reality 
• and finally the acceptance of self-destruction (and thus willingness to destroy 
everyone else, as well).

British poet Wilfred Owen’s “Dulce et Decorum Est” is one of the most 
famous war poems of the 20th century. Most of the poem describes the horrors 
of modern warfare, and the final lines of the excerpt, translated as “It is sweet 
and noble to die for one’s country,” he labels “The old Lie.” No previous war 
had involved as many nations from different parts of the world and none had 
killed as many soldiers and civilians.
At the outbreak of World War I, Britain was the only major power going 
into the war without universal conscription , compulsory enlistment in the 
armed forces. Realizing that patriotism could be contagious, the British Army 
began to recruit “Pals Battalions” made up of men who already knew each 
other. The first of these was made up of a group of stockbrokers from the City 
of London. Other Pals Battalions were recruited in cities throughout Britain, 
such as Liverpool and Manchester. Because the men who volunteered were 
friends or associates, these battalions were especially close knit. By the end of 
the war, one out of four British men had served in the military.
Changes in Warfare
Many modern films such as 6aving 3rivate 5yan, set during World War  II, 
and Platoon , set during the Vietnam War,  show that war is not a glorious 
experience, but most Europeans saw warfare differently during the first 
few months of World War I. “Everybody said, µIt’ll be over by Christmas,’ 
” a British soldier named Bill Haine recalled. The war began in June 11. 
470 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONHundreds of thousands of teenage boys enthusiastically enlisted in the military, 
dreaming of heroism. Wartime assemblies sounded more like high school pep 
rallies, in which speakers naively predicted swift and easy victories in battles 
against supposedly inferior enemies. Leaders of some of the socialist parties 
were among the few Europeans who spoke out against the war. Even socialists 
were divided on the issue, however, as many supported the war efforts of their 
nation.
At the time, few people actually understood how brutal 20th-century 
warfare could be. As the war dragged on, the world became aware of the 
horrific effects of new advances in war technology and tactics, such as trench 
warfare, poison gas, machine guns, submarines, airplanes, and tanks. 
•  The defining experience for most soldiers in this war was the 
time spent in the trenches, long ditches dug in the ground with the 
excavated earth banked in front in order to defend against enemy fire. 
Trench warfare  was not a glorious way to fight a war. Combatant 
nations dug hundreds of miles of trenches facing one another, and 
soldiers slept, ate, and fought in the trenches for months at a time. 
Trenches were often cold, muddy, and rat-infested. Many soldiers 
died from diseases caused by unhygienic conditions. Erich Maria 
Remarque’s 12 novel, $ll 4uiet on the :estern )ront,  and the 1930 
film based on it give a vivid sense of a soldier’s life in the trenches. 
Remarque was a young German soldier during World War I.
•  Poison gas  was one of the most insidious weapons of the new style 
of warfare. Chlorine, phosgene, and mustard gas were used during 
World War I. Soldiers were soon equipped with gas masks, which were 
effective when used immediately. Although fatalities were limited, 
the effects of a gas attack could be extremely painful and long lasting. 
Many veterans suffered permanent damage to their lungs. After the 
war, international treaties outlawed the use of poison gas.
•  Developed in the late 1800s, machine guns could fire more than 500 
rounds of ammunition per minute, increasing the deadly impact of 
warfare. The weapon made it difficult for either side in a battle to gain 
new territory.
•  Although primitive submarines  had been used briefly in the American 
Civil War, they played a much larger part in World War I, wreaking 
havoc on the shipping lanes of the Atlantic Ocean.
•  Airplanes  in 11 were still light, small, and unable to carry many 
weapons. Therefore, they did not present much of a threat to troops, 
vehicles, or ships. At first, airplanes were used mainly to carry on 
reconnaissance observation of enemy lines. By 115 they were being 
fitted with machine guns and aerial combat began. Individual “air 
aces” would engage in “dog fights” with enemy aircraft.
•  The British developed tanks  to protect troops as they moved across 
vast areas of difficult terrain, even over trenches, with the ability to fire 
471 CONDUCTING WORLD WAR I 471at the enemy. They were developed by the Royal Navy, and originally 
referred to as landships . They got their name from the fact that during 
their development, they were disguised as water tanks.
With both the Central Powers and the Allies using brutal weapons and 
tactics, neither side could defeat the other. The result was a bloody four-year 
stalemate  in which the death toll and suffering rose ever higher.
The United States Enters the War
Economic ties between the United States and the Allies were one underlying 
reasons for U.S. entry into the war in 11. In addition, many Americans 
believed that the Allied nations were more democratic than the Central Powers 
were. A third reason was growing resentment against the Germans, especially for 
U-boat  (submarine attacks on ships carrying civilians, including Americans. 
On May , 115, a German submarine attacked and sank the Lusitania , an 
ocean liner carrying more than 100 U.S. citizens among its passengers. 
The event that finally pushed the United States into the war was the 
interception of the Zimmermann  Telegram  in January 1917. In this document, 
the German government offered to help Mexico reclaim territory it had lost to 
the United States in 188 if Mexico allied itself with Germany in the war .
Total War
Combatant nations intensified the conflict in World War I by committing all 
their resources to the war effort. This strategy, known as total war , meant 
that a nation’s domestic population, in addition to its military, was committed 
to winning the war. Thus, millions of civilians, including women, worked 
in factories producing war materials. Workers imported from China helped 
make up for labor shortages in Britain, France, and Russia. Entire economies 
were centered on winning the war. Governments set up planning boards that 
set production quotas, price and wage controls, and the rationing of food and 
other supplies. They censored the media and imprisoned many who spoke out 
against the war effort.
Propaganda was another component of total war. Propaganda  is 
communication meant to influence the attitudes and opinions of a community 
around a particular subject by spreading inaccurate or slanted information. 
Governments invested heavily in army and navy recruitment campaigns and 
other wartime propaganda. Posters and articles in newspapers and magazines 
often depicted the enemy crudely or misrepresented the facts of the war 
completely. For example, American and British propaganda demonized the 
German army, exaggerating reports of atrocities against civilians. Likewise, 
German propaganda demonized the Americans and the British. 
The use of highly emotional and often misleading information fomented 
hatred and bitterness across borders, among civilians as well as soldiers. Other 
propaganda was more subtle. For example, the U.S. government sent artists 
to the front lines in Europe to illustrate scenes of battle and glorify Allied 
soldiers.
472 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONA Global War
World War I was fought in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Pacific and Atlantic 
Oceans. Not since the Seven Years’ War of the late 18th century had there 
been such a global war . Most of the major combatants in World War  I ruled 
colonies in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and the Pacific. Competition for these 
colonies was one major reason for war. Imperialism extended the boundaries 
of the war, and major battles were fought in North Africa and the Middle East. 
Japan entered the war on the side of the Allies so that it could take control of 
German colonies in the Pacific²the Marshall Islands, the Mariana Islands, 
Palau, and the Carolines. Japan also occupied Tsingtao Qingdao, a German-
held port in China.
The British seized most of Germany’s colonies in Africa. However, the 
Germans held on to German East Africa, later called Tanzania. The British also 
defended the Suez Canal from an attack by the Ottoman Empire. 
Colonial troops reinforced their home countries’ forces in several battles. 
About half a million Australians and New =ealanders enlisted to fight the 
war. These troops formed a special corps known as ANZAC  and fought in a 
bloody year-long campaign at Gallipoli , a peninsula in northwestern Turkey, 
that resulted in heavy Allied losses with little to show for the effort. Canadian 
troops fought in several European battles. Britain drafted Africans and Indians 
for combat roles in Europe. Some 0,000 Gurkha soldiers from Nepal fought in 
the Indian Army. Approximately 1. million soldiers served in the Indian Army Posters recruiting sailors and soldiers for World War I in the United States and Great Britain reflected how 
governments used art and media to appeal to nationalist feelings in the early 20th century.

50,000 Africans, mostly from West Africa and Algeria, as well as another 
110,000 Europeans from North Africa. Some ,000 Indochinese soldiers 
fought in the French army, with nearly 50,000 more working in support roles 
behind the lines. Some colonial troops fought in hopes that their efforts would  
gain them recognition from their colonizers, who often promised the colonies 
self-rule after the war ended.
Arabs, long under the rule of the Turkish-led Ottoman Empire, fought with 
the Allies because the British promised self-rule after the war if they were 
victorious. Arab troops attacked Ottoman forts in Arabia and present-day Israel 
and helped the British take over the cities of Baghdad, Damascus, and 
Jerusalem.

474 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONWomen and the War  In the early 20th century, most countries did not 
allow women to vote or to be soldiers. However, the sheer numbers of men 
enlisting meant that women’s lives changed significantly. They began replacing 
those men on farms and in factories. Thousands of women served on the front 
lines as nurses, ambulance drivers, and switchboard operators. 
Most countries forebade women from serving in combat, but Russia, 
Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria allowed it. In 11, the Russian government 
created an all-female battalion military unit as propaganda to shame men into 
continuing to fight. The commander Maria Bochkareva led the First Russian 
Women’s Battalion of Death.
The Paris Peace Conference
The war itself greatly damaged Europe. However, the peace conference held in 
its wake would have even more profound effects on the entire world. The leaders 
of the victorious countries at the Paris Peace Conference  became known as 
the Big Four:  Woodrow Wilson  United States, David Lloyd George  (Great 
Britain), Georges Clemenceau  (France), and Vittorio Orlando  (Italy). The 
Italians walked out of the peace conference in a rage because Italy would not 
get Dalmatia and other territories that they had been promised for joining the 
Allies, including the city of Fiume on the Adriatic Sea. Russia was not invited 
to the conference because it had undergone a communist revolution. Russia’s 
Bolshevik leaders refused to honor Russia’s financial debts to the Allies, who 
in return refused to recognize the Bolshevik government.
The Big Four had different visions of how to settle the peace. President 
Wilson’s pledge to establish “peace without victory” reflected his belief that 
no one country should be severely punished or greatly rewarded. France’s 
Clemenceau rejected this view. He believed that France, out of all the Allies 
represented at the conference, had suffered the most and thus deserved special 
considerations to be protected from Germany. He also argued that the victorious 
powers should seek some sort of revenge on the Central Powers for starting the 
war. Clemenceau complained that Wilson was an unrealistic idealist who was 
naive about European relations, even though Wilson had a Ph.D. in history. 
David Lloyd George tended to support Clemenceau’s ideas, but he often acted 
as an intermediary between the two differing points of view.
Fourteen Points  Despite Clemenceau’s protests, Wilson pushed for his 
principles, which he outlined in a document called the Fourteen Points . He 
particularly wanted to create a League of Nations , an organization in which 
all nations of the world would convene to discuss conflicts openly, as a way to 
avoid the simmering tensions that had caused World War I. Although the other 
nations agreed to establish the League, the U.S. Senate voted against joining 
it and against ratifying the Treaty of Versailles , the 1919 peace treaty with 
Germany.

Powers deserved the right to self-determination , to decide their own political 
futures. Instead of the colonies and territories of the Central Powers being 
snatched up by the Allies, conquered peoples should have the right to decide 
their own political fate. A number of new nations were created or resurrected 
in Europe as the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires were broken up: 
Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. 
The last three of these were home to Slavic peoples. 
The Treaty of Versailles  Because Wilson failed to convince France 
and Britain not to punish Germany, the Treaty of Versailles treated Germany 
harshly. Most notably, Germany had to pay billions of dollars in reparations  
for damage caused by the war, give up all of its colonies, and restrict the size 
of its armed forces. Germans took the entire blame for the war. Signing the 
treaty was humiliating for German leaders. Moreover, the terms of the treaty 
caused tremendous hardship to the nation during the decade following World  
War I. The German economy suffered from sky-high inflation, partly due 
to the reparations the country was forced to pay. The German people were 
bitter in the immediate aftermath of the Paris Peace Conference. Resentment 
toward the Weimar Republic , which had agreed to the terms of the Treaty of 
Versailles, set the stage for an extreme and militaristic political party known 
as the Nazis to take power barely 15 years later. Connect: Compare the forces

478WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:  IDENTI-@ SUPPORTING E=IDENCE
In 1914, on hearing of German atrocities toward Belgians, the British 
government undertook its own investigation headed up by 9iscount James 
Bryce, a widely respected  scholar, a former ambassador to the United States, 
and a friend of President Wilson. His committee reviewed the depositions of 
1200 witnesses, though they did not do the actual interviewing of the witnesses. 
Nor were the depositions given under oath. In order to make the report as 
credible as possible, the committee decided to leave out the most sensational 
accounts. The final report used 500 of the 1200 reports. It was translated 
into 30 languages and was reprinted in the 1ew <orN 7imes  Even though the 
most violent and lurid reports were eliminated, the report still detailed many 
gruesome acts and presented the following conclusions:
“It is proved:
i That there were in many parts of Belgium deliberate and 
systematically organized massacres of the civil population, 
accompanied by many isolated murders and other outrages.
ii That in the conduct of the war generally innocent civilians, both 
men and women, were murdered in large numbers, women violated, 
and children murdered.
iii That looting, house burning, and the wanton destruction of 
property were ordered and countenanced by the officers of the 
German Army, that elaborate provisions had been made for systematic 
incendiarism at the very outbreak of the war, and that the burnings 
and destruction were frequent where no military necessity could be 
alleged, being indeed part of a system of general terrorization.
iv That the rules and usages of war were frequently broken, 
particularly by the using of civilians, including women and children, 
as a shield for advancing forces exposed to fire, to a less degree by 
killing the wounded and prisoners, and in the frequent abuse of the 
Red Cross and the White Flag.
Sensible as they are of the gravity of these conclusions, the Committee 
conceive that they would be doing less than their duty if they failed 
to record them as fully established by the evidence. Murder, lust, and 
pillage prevailed over many parts of Belgium on a scale unparalleled 
in any war between civilised nations during the last three centuries.
Our function is ended when we have stated what the evidence 
establishes, but we may be permitted to express our belief that these 
disclosures will not have been made in vain if they touch and rouse 
the conscience of mankind, and we venture to hope that as soon as the 
present war is over, the nations of the world in council will consider 
what means can be provided and sanctions devised to prevent the 
recurrence of such horrors as our generation is now witnessing.”

Economy in the Interwar Period
>e had to struggle with the old enemies of peace·business and financial 
monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism,  
war profiteering 
—U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1936)
Essential Question:   How did different governments respond to economic 
crises after 1900?
Not long after the global trauma of World War I, a global economic crisis 
resulted in the Great Depression of the 1930s and eventually led to World War 
II. It undermined faith in the market-based economics that had delivered such 
wealth as imperialism spread. As unemployment, hunger, and homelessness 
increased, people turned to their governments for help. Governments had 
long been essential to capitalism²building roads, providing schools, and 
regulating trade²but across the world in the 10s, government intervention 
in the economy increased. The United States became more liberal as President 
Roosevelt identified inequities and activities that undermined the economy 
and could lead to war. Countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, however, 
turned radically to the right. In Russia, government economic control was 
instituted through the implementation of often repressive Five-Year Plans 
based on production quotas.
The Great Depression
From today’s perspective, the effects of World War I can look small compared 
to the even greater destruction caused by World War II. However, the effects  
were massive. Many Western Europeans felt bewildered. World War I brought 
anxiety to the people who suffered through it. The Allied nations, though 
victorious, had lost millions of citizens, both soldiers and civilians, and had 
spent tremendous amounts of money on the international conflict. The defeated 
Central Powers, particularly Germany and the countries that emerged from the 
breakup of Austria-Hungary, suffered even greater losses.
The Treaty of 9ersailles forced Germany to pay billions of dollars in 
reparations to the war’s victors. War-ravaged Germany could not make these 
payments, so its government printed more paper money in the 1920s.
481 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO DThis action caused inflation, a general rise in prices. Inflation meant that 
the value of German money decreased drastically. To add to the sluggish 
postwar economy, France and Britain had difficulty repaying wartime loans 
from the United States, partly because Germany was having trouble paying 
reparations to them. In addition, the Soviet government refused to pay Russia’s 
prerevolutionary debts.
Global Downturn  Although the 120s brought modest economic gains 
for most of Europe, the subsequent Great Depression  ended the tentative 
stability. Agricultural overproduction and the United States’ stock market crash 
in 12 were two major causes of the global economic downturn. American 
investors who had been putting money into German banks removed it when 
the American stock market crashed. In addition to its skyrocketing inflation, 
Germany then had to grapple with bank failures. Germany thus suffered more 
than any other Western nation during the Great Depression. The economies 
of Africa, Asia, and Latin America suffered because they depended on the 
imperial nations that were experiencing this enormous economic downturn. 
Japan also suffered during the Depression because its economy depended 
on foreign trade. With the economic decline in the rest of the world, Japan’s 
exports were cut in half between 12 and 11.

Keynesian Economics  The Great Depression inspired new insights into 
economics. British economist John Maynard Keynes  rejected the laissez-
faire ideal. He concluded that intentional government action could improve 
the economy. During a depression, he said, governments should use Geficit 
spending  (spending more than the government takes in) to stimulate economic 
activity. By cutting taxes and increasing spending, governments would spur 
economic growth. People would return to work, and the depression would end. 
New Deal  The administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  
used .eynes’s ideas to address the Great Depression in the United States. 
Roosevelt and his backers created a group of policies and programs known 
collectively as the New Deal . Its goal was to bring the country relief, recovery, 
and reform: relief  for citizens who were suffering, including the poor, the 
unemployed, farmers, minorities, and women recovery  to bring the nation out 
of the Depression, in part through government spending and reform  to change 
government policies in the hopes of avoiding such disasters in the future.
By 1937, unemployment was declining and production was rising. 
.eynesian economics seemed to be working. However, Roosevelt feared 
that government deficits were growing too large, so he reversed course. 
Unemployment began to grow again. The Great Depression finally ended after 
the United States entered World War II in 11 and ran up deficits for military 
spending that dwarfed those of the New Deal programs. 
Impact on Trade  The Great Depression was a global event. Though it 
started in the industrialized countries of the United States and Europe, it spread 
to Latin America, Africa, and Asia. By 12, more than 0 million people 
worldwide were out of work. People everywhere turned to their governments 
483 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO Dfor help. As unemployment increased, international trade declined, a decline 
made worse as nations then imposed strict tariffs, or taxes on imports, in an 
effort to protect the domestic jobs they still had. 
In contrast to most countries, Japan dug itself out of the Depression 
relatively rapidly. Japan devalued its currency that is, the government lowered 
the value of its money in relation to foreign currencies. Thus, Japanese-made 
products became less expensive than imports. Japan’s overseas expansionism 
also increased Japan’s need for military goods and stimulated the economy. 
Political Revolutions in Russia and Mexico
In the century’s first two decades, rebellions erupted against long-standing 
authoritarian governments in Mexico, China, and Russia. See Topic .1. 
Revolutionaries unseated the ruling governments in each country, instituting 
their own political philosophies and practices. The revolutions influenced 
subsequent events in the Soviet Union, Mexico, and China in the interwar 
years. Each country took a different approach to managing their national 
economy.
Continuing Revolution in Russia  Although Lenin and the Bolshevik 
Party had promised “peace, land, and bread” during World War I, they instead 
presided over a populace that faced starvation during the widespread Russian 
Civil War  118±121. Hundreds of thousands of Russians, Ukrainians, 
and others revolted against the Russian government’s actions. Urban factory 
workers and sailors went on strike, and peasants began to hoard their food 
stocks. Industrial and agricultural production dropped sharply.
By 1921, Lenin realized that the Russian economy was near complete 
collapse. In an attempt to remedy this, he instituted a temporary retreat 
from communist economic policies. Under his New Economic Plan  (NEP ), 
he reintroduced private trade, allowing farmers to sell their products on a 
small scale. Although the government permitted some economic liberties, it 
maintained strict political control. The NEP enjoyed modest successes, but it 
came to an end when Lenin died in 1924.
Joseph Stalin  Several years after Lenin’s death, Joseph Stalin took 
control of the Politburo , the Communist Party’s central organization, setting 
himself up as a dictator. He remained in power for almost 0 years. Once in 
power, Stalin abandoned Lenin’s NEP and instituted the first Five-Year Plan , 
which was meant to transform the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  (also 
called the USSR  or the Soviet Union  into an industrial power. He wanted his 
largely agricultural nation to “catch up” to the industrial nations of the West. 
At the same time, Stalin collectiYi]eG  agriculture, a process in which farmland 
was taken from private owners and given to collectives to manage. In theory, a 
collective, or NolNho], was a group of peasants who freely joined together to 
farm a certain portion of land. In practice, however, peasants were forced by 
the state to work on a specific collective and were expected to follow detailed 
plans and to reach specific goals set by the government. 
484WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThis elimination of private land ownership and the forced redistribution 
of land, livestock, and tools enraged farmers. Each year, the government 
seized food to send to the cities. The farmers retaliated against collectivization 
by burning crops and killing livestock. Many moved to the cities for a better 
life.
A series of five-year plans had mixed results. The collectivization of 
agriculture was a huge failure. Millions of peasants starved to death, especially 
in the Ukraine. However, heavy industry grew tremendously in the 10s. 
Although consumer goods were in short supply, there were plenty of factory 
jobs available, and the cost of living was low.
Stalin’s brutal regime is widely condemned today. He punished his political 
opponents by executing them or sentencing them to life terms in gulags , or 
labor camps, where many died. In addition, his agricultural policies led to the 
deaths of many millions of Soviet citizens. Because Stalin kept tight control 
of the press, details of his atrocities went largely unreported. Nonetheless, in 
the 10s, an economically depressed world viewed the U.S.S.R. with a mix

Topic 5.8.)
Party Rule in Mexico  The economy took a different direction in Mexico. 
The Mexican revolution saw the emergence of one strong political party, the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI. This party dominated Mexican 
politics for most of the 20th century. The Mexican political system has often 
been called corporatist since the ruling PRI party claimed favors, such as access 
to primary education and jobs created through improvements to infrastructure, 
for its constituents.
During PRI’s rule, there was a vast improvement in the economy, 
especially in the period from 1930 to the 1970s. In the 1930s, efforts at land 
reform were successful under /i]aro CirGenas . In 1938, for example, his 
regime nationalized the country’s mostly foreign-owned oil industry, angering 
foreign investors. This company, Petryleos Mexicanos or PEMEX , became 
the second largest state-owned company in the world. Despite these reforms, 
however, the interwar period did not see dramatic changes in Mexico’s social 
hierarchy.
Rise of Right-Wing Governments
In some countries, the turn to the right was radical. A new political system 
known as fascism  arose that appealed to extreme nationalism, glorified the 
military and armed struggle, and blamed problems on ethnic minorities. 
Fascist regimes suppressed other political parties, protests, and independent 
trade unions. They justified violence to achieve their goals and were strongly 
anticommunist. Germany turned to fascism (see Topic 7.6), and some other 
countries did as well.
485 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO DRise of Fascism in Italy  Benito Mussolini coined the term fascism,  
which comes from the term fasces , a bundle of sticks tied around an axe, which 
was an ancient Roman symbol for authority. This symbol helped characterize 
Italy’s Fascist government, which glorified militarism and brute force. 
The Italian fascist state was based on a concept known as corporatism , 
a theory based on the notion that the sectors of the economy²the employers, 
the trade unions, and state officials²are seen as separate organs of the same 
body. Each sector, or organ, was supposedly free to organize itself as it wished 
as long as it supported the whole. In practice, the fascist state imposed its will 
upon all sectors of society, creating a totalitarian state ²a state in which the 
government controls all aspects of society.
Mussolini Takes Control  Even though Italy had been considered 
one of the victors at the 11 Paris Peace Conference²along with Britain, 
France, and the United States²Italy received very little territory from the 
Treaty of Versailles. This failure to gain from the war caused discontent in 
Italy. Amid the general bitterness of the 120s, Mussolini and his allies in the 
Fascist Party managed to take control of the parliament. Mussolini became a 
dictator, repressing any possible opposition to his rule. Militaristic propaganda 
infiltrated every part of the Fascist government. For example, schoolchildren 
were taught constantly about the glory of their nation and their fearless leader, 
“Il Duce .” 
Part of Mussolini’s fascist philosophy was the need to conquer what he 
considered an inferior nation. During the imperialist “Scramble for Africa” in 
the 19th century, Italy seized Libya  and colonized Italian  Somaliland , now 
part of Somalia. However, the Italian army was pushed back by Abyssinia, 
modern-day Ethiopia, in the 180s. In 1, Mussolini called for the complete 
conquest of Abyssinia. In 15, 100,000 Italian troops crossed the border from 
Somaliland to Abyssinia, defying sanctions from the League of Nations. This 
time, the Italian army overpowered Abyssinia’s while the global community 
did little to stop the conquest. Many historians believe the Abyssinian crisis 
destroyed the League of Nations’ credibility. In 16, Mussolini and Germany’s 
Adolf Hitler formed an alliance they hoped would dominate Europe. 
Fascism and Civil War in Spain  After the economic decline in the early 
10s, two opposing ideologies, or systems of ideas, battled for control of 
Spain. The Spanish Civil War  that resulted soon took on global significance 
as a struggle between the forces of democracy and the forces of fascism.
The Spanish Republic formed in 11 after .ing Alfonso 9III abdicated. 
In 16, the Spanish people elected the Popular Front , a coalition of left-
wing parties, to lead the government. A key aspect of the Front’s platform 
was land reform, a prospect that energized the nation’s peasants and radicals. 
Conservative forces in Spain, such as the Catholic Church and high-ranking 
members of the military, were violently opposed to the changes that the Popular 
Front promised. In July of the same year, Spanish troops stationed in Morocco 
conducted a military uprising against the Popular Front. This action marked the 
beginning of the Spanish Civil War, which soon spread to Spain itself. General 
486WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONFrancisco Franco  led the insurgents, who called themselves Nationalists . On 
the other side were the Republicans  or Loyalists , the defenders of the newly 
elected Spanish Republic.
Foreign Involvement  Although the nations of Europe had signed a 
nonintervention agreement, Hitler of Germany, Mussolini of Italy, and Antonio 
Salazar of Portugal contributed armaments to the Nationalists. Civilian 
volunteers from the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France 
contributed their efforts to the Loyalists. Many historians believe that without 
the help of Germany, Italy, and Portugal, the Nationalist side probably would 
not have prevailed against the Republic of Spain.
Guernica  The foreign involvement in Spain’s struggle also escalated the 
violence of the war. One massacre in particular garnered international attention. 
The German and Italian bombing of the town of Guernica  in northern Spain’s 
Basque region  was one of the first times in history an aerial bombing targeted 
civilians. Many historians believe that the bombing of Guernica was a military 
exercise for Germany’s air force, the Luftwaffe .
The tragedy of Guernica was immortalized in Pablo Picasso’s painting of 
that name, commissioned by the Republic of Spain and completed in 18. 
Although abstract, the painting brilliantly depicts the horrific violence of 
modern warfare and is one of the most significant works of 20th-century art.

Franco’s Victory  The Spanish Civil War 16±1 ended when 
Franco’s forces defeated the Loyalist army. He ruled Spain as a dictator until 
his death in 15. Spain did not officially enter World War II 1±15, but 
the government offered some help to Germany, Italy, and Japan.
5ise oI a 5eSressiYe 5eJiPe in %ra]il  As in Europe, parts of Latin 
America also became more conservative. During the interwar years, Brazil 
was considered Latin America’s “sleeping giant” because of its slow shift 
487 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO Dfrom an agricultural to an industrial economy. Large landowners dominated 
the nation’s economy, which frustrated members of the urban middle class. 
Compounding their frustration was the workers’ suffering caused by the Great 
Depression. Discontent led to a bloodless 10 coup, or illegal seizure of 
power, which installed Getulio Vargas as president.
9argas’s pro-industrial policies won him support from Brazil’s urban 
middle class. They believed he would promote democracy. However, his actions 
paralleled those of Italy’s corporate state under Mussolini. While Brazil’s 
industrial sector grew rapidly, 9argas began to strip away individual political 
freedoms. His Estado Novo  “New State” program instituted government 
censorship of the press, abolition of political parties, imprisonment of political 
opponents, and hypernationalism , a belief in the superiority of one’s nation 
over all others and the single-minded promotion of national interests. While 
these policies were similar to those of European fascists, the Brazilian 
government did not praise or rely on violence to achieve and maintain control.
Moreover, even though Brazil had close economic ties with the United 
States and Germany in the late 10s, Brazil finally sided with the Allies in 
World War II. This political alignment against the Axis powers made Brazil 
look less like a dictatorship and more liberal than it actually was. World War II 
prompted the people of Brazil to push for a more democratic nation later. They 
came to see the contradiction between fighting fascism and repression abroad 
and maintaining a dictatorship at home.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS 
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“It has been repeated ad nauseam >to a sickening degree@ that the oil industry 
has brought additional capital for the development and progress of the country. 
This assertion is an exaggeration. For many years throughout the major period 
of their existence, oil companies have enjoyed great privileges for development 
and expansion, including customs and tax exemptions and innumerable 
prerogatives. . . . Potential wealth of the Nation miserably underpaid native 
labor tax exemptions economic privileges governmental tolerance²these 
are the factors of the boom of the Mexican oil industry. .  . . These organizations, 
whether authorized by the Government or not, are charged with innumerable 
outrages, abuses, and murders, always on behalf of the companies that employ 
them. . . .
It was therefore necessary to adopt a definite and legal measure to end this 
permanent state of affairs in which the country sees its industrial progress held 
back by those who hold in their hands the power to erect obstacles. . . . It is 
necessary that all groups of the population be imbued with a full optimism and 
that each citizen, whether in agricultural, industrial, commercial, transportation, 
or other pursuits, develop a greater activity from this moment on, in order to 
create new resources which will reveal that the spirit of our people is capable 
of saving the nation’s economy by the efforts of its own citizens.”

491 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO DTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:  SIGNIFICANCE  OF HISTORICAL  SITUATION
When Mexico nationalized the oil industry, some foreign countries whose oil 
companies were taken over boycotted Mexican oil and urged consumers to 
boycott other Mexican products. As a result, Nazi Germany became Mexico’s 
biggest customer for oil. The United States, however, had a “Good Neighbor” 
policy with Mexico and took a softer approach.

7hen answer the Tuestions that follow
“The Government of the United States . . . notes that the applicable 
precedents and recognized authorities on international law support its 
declaration that, under every rule of law and equity, no government is 
entitled to expropriate private property, for whatever purpose, without 
provision for prompt, adequate, and effective payment therefor. . . .
My Government considers that its own practice has amply 
demonstrated that it is the consistent friend of reform, that it has 
every sympathy with misfortune and need, and that it recognizes fully 
the necessities of the under-privileged. It cannot, however, accept 
the idea that these high objectives justify, or for that matter require, 
infringement on the law of nations or the upsetting of constitutionally 
recognized guarantees. . . .
Every sovereign nation is in possession of powers to regulate its 
internal affairs, to reorganize, when needful, its entire economic, 
financial, and industrial structure, and to achieve social ends by 
methods conforming with law.
Instead of using these recognized and orderly methods, the 
Government of Mexico in effect suggests that whenever special 
conditions or circumstances obtain in any one country, that country 
is entitled to expect all the other nations of the world to accept a 
change in the settled rules and principles of law, which are domestic 
quite as much as international, solely in order to assist the country 
in question to extricate itself from difficulties for which it is itself 
entirely responsible. Specifically, it is proposed to replace the rule of 
just compensation by rule of confiscation. Adoption by the nations of 
the world of any such theory as that would result in the immediate 
breakdown of confidence and trust between nations, and in such 
progressive deterioration of international economic and commercial 
relations as would imperil the very foundations of modern civilization. 
Human progress would be fatally set back. . . .
492 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe vital interest of all governments and of all peoples in this question 
and the imperative need of all countries to maintain unimpaired the 
structure of common justice embodied in international as well as in 
basic national law, lead me, particularly in view of the warm friendship 
existing between the two countries, to appeal most earnestly to the 
Mexican Government to refrain from persisting in a policy and 
example which, if generally pursued, will seriously jeopardize the 
interests of all peoples throughout the world.”

Unresolved Tensions After 
World  War I
The British Government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their 
freedom, but has debased it economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually.
—Indian National Congress, Declaration of Purna Swaraj  
(Independence +ay 9esolution, 1anuary 2, 1930)
Essential Question:   How did continuities and changes in territorial holdings 
create tensions after World War I?
As economic crises beset countries after World War I, unresolved disputes 
over the control of land continued to fester. The victors in the war, European 
powers and Japan, generally kept or expanded control over colonial territories. 
However, anti-imperial resistance was growing throughout Asia and Africa. 
In a larger context, the spread of nationalism in these regions was part of the 
same global trend that included the breakup of empires in Europe, the success 
of communism in Russia, and the spread of anti-immigrant sentiments in the 
United States. The example of Turkey’s push for self-determination was already 
discussed in Topic .1. Similarly, events such as the May th Movement in 
China and groups such as the Indian National Congress demonstrated how 
nationalism was spreading throughout the world.
(σecWsRfWKe:DU
The effects of World War I varied around the world. The United States 
prospered because of all the war materials and agricultural products it sold 
to Britain and the other Allies. By contrast, the European countries that 
suffered the greatest damage in the war were economically devastated.
Effects on Colonial Lands  While nationalist movements had been 
brewing for decades in colonies in South Asia and West Africa, the war 
renewed the hopes of people in these regions for independence. African and 
Asian colonial troops contributed thousands of soldiers to the Allied war 
effort. In addition, this disastrous war showed colonial peoples that imperial 
powers such as Britain and France were not invincible.
German propaganda during the war had predicted that colonial soldiers’ 
experience in the war would lead to a great uprising against colonial rule. 
494 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThis did not materialize, although there were several local rebellions. 
Between November 115 and September 116, a large group of villages in 
French West Africa, between the 9 olta and Bani rivers in what later became 
Burkina Faso, united in an effort to drive out the French. It was only with 
a great effort and loss of life on both sides that the French managed to put 
down the revolt. The rebellion forced the French to recognize that they had 
an obligation to the people they colonized. After World War I, many war 
veterans from the French colonies assisted in colonial administration after 
they returned home.
Colonized people’s war experiences raised their expectations. They 
thought that the principle of self-determination, as expressed in Wilson’s 
Fourteen Points, would get them closer to self-rule. Nationalists in Africa 
and Asia hoped that the blood they had shed for their “home countries” 
would earn them some respect from Western Europe and thus begin a 
Gecoloni]ation  process. 
However, the peace conference’s Big Three ²David Lloyd George, 
Woodrow Wilson, and Georges Clemenceau after Italy left²were not 
interested in freeing the colonies. After World War I, European powers 
granted self-determination only to white countries in Eastern Europe. Middle 
Eastern lands that had been a part of the  Ottoman Empire came under the 
control of France and Britain in the League of Nations mandate system. Former 
German colonies in Africa had the same fate. German territories and spheres 
of influence in East Asia and the Pacific were transferred to various victorious 
nations of World War I. India and nearly every nation in Africa²as well as 
most of the Middle East²continued to be controlled by European nations.
Wilson even refused to meet with a group of Vietnamese nationalists, 
including a young Ho Chi Minh, who asked to speak with him about 
self-determination for Vietnam. This rejection fueled stronger nationalist 
movements in colonies scattered across the southern rim of Asia and in 
parts of Africa. The seeds of African, Arab, and Asian nationalism were 
sown largely in the aftermath of World War  I, although they did not come to 
fruition until much later.
The Mandate System
Arab rebels of the former Ottoman Empire were especially insulted by the 
results of the peace conference. They had been promised self-rule if they fought 
with the Allies. Instead, the Allies forgot all of their promises and, through the 
League of Nations, established a mandate  system  to rule the colonies and 
territories of the Central Powers. Article 22 of the League of Nations charter 
stated that colonized people in Africa and Asia required “tutelage” from more 
“advanced” nations in order to survive. Thus, the Allied countries²including 
France, Great Britain, and Japan²were able to increase their imperial holdings 
through a new form of colonization. For example, Cameroon, which had been 
a German colony, was divided and transferred to France and Britain as separate 
mandates. Japan seized the German-held islands of the Western Pacific.
495 UNRESOL=ED  TENSIONS  A-TER WORLD WAR  I495The Middle East experienced enormous upheaval because of the fall of the 
Ottoman Empire. Palestine, Transjordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq all became 
League of Nations mandates. These Arab states were not yet sovereign lands 
but virtual colonies of Great Britain and France. This infuriated the Arabs who 
lived in these lands and set the stage for a nationalist movement known as  
Pan-Arabism —an ideology that called for the unification of all lands in North 
Africa and the Middle East.
Another source of conflict arose in 11, when the British government 
issued the Balfour Declaration , which stated that Palestine  should become a 
permanent home for the Jews of Europe. Those who supported a Jewish 
homeland were known as Zionists . After the Allied victory in the Great War, 
European Jews moved in droves to Palestine, which Britain controlled.
Anti-Colonialism in South Asia
The setback presented by the Paris Conference inspired anticolonial activists 
to redouble their efforts. In South Asia, the Indian National Congress  formed 
in the late 19th century to air grievances against the colonial government. By 
the end of World War I in 118, it had become a strong voice for independence.
Massacre at Amritsar  In the spring of 1919, a group of Indian 
nationalists gathered in a public garden in Amritsar, Punjab, to protest the

had recently made such public gatherings illegal. Armed colonial forces fired 
hundreds of shots into the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 379 people and 
wounding 1,200 more. 
The Amritsar massacre radicalized many Indians. It convinced moderate 
members of the Indian National Congress that independence from Britain was 
the only way forward.
Gandhi  By the 1920s, Mohandas Gandhi  had brought the congress’s 
cause to the Indian masses and caught the attention of the world. His 
satyagraha  “devotion-to-truth” movement  embarked on a campaign of civil 
disobedience  that encouraged Indians to break unjust laws and serve jail time. 
These actions, he believed, would stir the consciousness of the empire and the 
international community and expose the injustice of Britain’s imperial system.
Gandhi, who came to be known by Indians as Mahatma , or “the great 
soul,” led a boycott against British goods. After returning to India from South 
Africa, Gandhi wore the traditional cotton Hindu dhoti  rather than the Western-
style suits he had worn as a lawyer in Natal. Wearing homespun clothes was 
a form of protest against British fabrics made from Indian cotton and sold to 
Indians at inflated prices. 
One of Gandhi’s first campaigns became known as the Salt March . British 
authorities had made it illegal for Indians to produce their own sea salt. The 
commodity was easy to make in the tropical country, but Britain wanted a 
monopoly on salt. In 10, Gandhi led thousands of Indians to the Arabian Sea 
and simply picked up a few grains of salt, in defiance of Britain’s unjust edict.

497 UNRESOL=ED  TENSIONS  A-TER WORLD WAR  IThe Two-State Solution  While anticolonial sentiment was building, 
leaders of the independence movement disagreed about how India should 
define its national identity. Muslim leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah , a member 
of the Muslim minority in the largely Hindu Indian National Congress, 
originally favored Muslim-Hindu unity but later proposed a two-state plan for 
South Asian independence. He was concerned that Muslim interests would 
be overwhelmed by Hindu concerns in an independent India. He proposed  
creating a separate state, Pakistan , that would include the heavily Muslim 
western and eastern parts of South Asia. This proposal made several leaders, 
including Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru , who eventually became India’s first 
prime minister, anxious about the region’s future. Although independence did 
not come for India and Pakistan until after World War II, the interwar years 
were critical times for the anticolonial movement. Connect: Write a paragraph

Nationalism in East Asia
.orea, China, and Japan had not been formally colonized by Europe, but they 
did suffer from European domination. These countries also demonstrated the 
spread of the desire for self-determination.
The March First Movement in Korea  The small country of .orea had 
suffered under increasing Japanese influence since the 180s. In 110, Japan 
took control of .orea. After World War I, Japan expected to expand its role 
in East Asia, just as European states did in the Middle East. The prospect of 
European support for a stronger Japan, and the mysterious death of the .orean 
emperor, caused .orean resentment to explode. On March 1, 11, .oreans 
began a series of protests that involved as many as 2 million .oreans out 
of a population of 17 million. The occupying Japanese forces cracked down 
harshly, killing several thousand .oreans. But the March First Movement  
demonstrated the power of .orean nationalism.
The May Fourth Movement in China  During World War I, China 
supported the Allies. Britain and France hired nearly 150,000 Chinese 
to work in factories, dig trenches and do other support work. China hoped 
that the victorious Allies would support China’s desire to reclaim German-
controlled land on the Shandong Peninsula in northeast China. However, 
Japan wanted the same land. At the Paris Peace Conference in 11, Great 
Britain and France sided with Japan. Infuriated, Chinese intellectuals and 
workers staged anti-Japanese demonstrations beginning on May , 11. 
The May Fourth Movement  symbolized China’s growing nationalism and 
demand for democracy. Angered by Europe’s support for Japan, many Chinese 
rejected Western-style government. They turned toward the Marxist model of 
the Soviet Union. Several May Fourth leaders joined the Chinese Communist 
Party. In the years after the May Fourth protests, two main groups fought for 
power: the communists and the nationalists. 
498WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• The Chinese  Communist Party (CCP ) was founded in 1921. It 
was eventually led by Mao Zedong  or Mao Tse-tung, the son of a 
prosperous peasant, who was inspired by the communist revolution 
in Russia. Instead of energizing the working classes of Chinese cities, 
however, Mao believed that China’s communist revolution could be 
based on the revolt of peasants, who made up the vast majority of 
China’s population. 
• The Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang , was led by  Sun Yat-
sen. He was devoted to full independence and industrialization, and 
he allied with Mao’s forces to free China from foreign domination and 
overthrow the warlords. Following Sun’s death in 125, Chiang Kai-
shek  took control of the Nationalist Party. Chiang was a conservative 
and had a deep-seated distrust of communism. In 1927, Chiang’s forces 
attacked and nearly annihilated Mao’s forces, initiating the Chinese 
Civil War.
The Long March  Mao and remnants of the Chinese Communist Party 
retreated into China’s interior, where for several years they trained in hiding. In 
1, Chiang’s forces again attacked Mao’s army in the rural areas of Jiangxi. 
After the attack, Mao’s forces began the  /onJ March  a year-long, 6,000-mile 
long retreat. It traversed treacherous mountains, deep marshes, and extremely 
dry deserts. Of the 80,000 or more who began the Long March, only 10,000 
remained to assemble in 15 in northern China. 
The Chinese Communist Party was weak after the Long March. 
However, peasants admired Mao and his army’s tremendous stamina and 
their commitment to their ideals. This support among peasants would later be 
important for the success of the Communists in winning control of the country.
While the Communists were retreating on the Long March, the Nationalist 
.uomintang continued to rule much of China during the 10s. Chiang, 
however, had alienated many. Old traditions were losing support, but he 
advocated Confucianism. When opponents criticized him, he suppressed free 
speech. When people accused the Nationalists of corruption, he did not stop it. 
China -aSan anG ManchuNuo  In 15, the Nationalists and 
Communists in China suspended their civil war to unite against a more pressing 
danger: Japan. Seeking access to natural resources on the Asian mainland, 
Japan had invaded Manchuria in northern China in September 11. Tensions 
increased when someone, either Chinese dissidents or Japanese soldiers, 
attacked a railway owned by Japan near Mukden. When the League of Nations 
condemned Japan’s actions in Manchuria, Japan gave up its membership in 
the League and seized more land. In 1932, the Japanese set up a puppet state 
called Manchukuo.  To make Manchukuo seem like an independent Chinese 
state, it selected the last Chinese emperor to sit on its throne. Connect:

ended. It seized the Philippines under partial U.S. control at the time, the 
Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, Burma, and numerous Pacific islands. 
Japan termed these territories the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . 
Although Japan claimed to be liberating people from Western imperialism, 
people in the region experienced Japan as a conqueror.
Resistance to French Rule in West Africa
As in South Asia, people all over Africa were disappointed that their colonies 
did not achieve independence after World War I. Pro-independence movements 
in Africa began with European-educated intellectuals. For example, the future 
leader of .enya, -oPo .enyatta studied in London. /poSolG SenJhor the 
future leader of Senegal, studied in Paris. In Europe, African intellectuals 
learned to recognize the racial discrimination taking place in their homelands. 
Most members of the educated elite worked for the colonial government, if 
they were not self-employed attorneys or doctors. 
Africans under colonial rule resisted the colonizers. Black workers in 
French West Africa staged a series of strikes, including a strike of railway 
workers in 11 and a general strike in 16. Some of these actions spread 
throughout French West Africa Senegal, Benin, Ivory Coast, and Guinea. 
Strikers protested discriminatory wage and benefit policies and in some cases 
won a number of their demands through a compromise settlement.

Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“After >World War I@, the world was divided into two camps: one is the 
revolutionary camp which includes the oppressed colonial peoples and the 
exploited working class throughout the world. Its vanguard is the Soviet 
Union. The other is the counter-revolutionary camp of international capitalism 
and imperialism, whose general staff is the League of Nations.
That war resulted in untold loss of life and property. . . . French imperialism 
was the hardest hit. Therefore, in order to restore the forces of capitalism in 
France, the French imperialists have . . . built new factories to exploit the 
workers by paying them starvation wages. They have plundered the peasants’ 
land to establish plantations and drive them to destitution. They have levied 
new heavy taxes. They have forced our people to buy government bonds. 
In short, they have driven our people to utter misery. They have increased 
their military forces, firstly to strangle the 9ietnamese revolution secondly 
to prepare for a new imperialist war in the Pacific aimed at conquering new 
colonies thirdly to suppress the Chinese revolution and fourthly to attack 
the Soviet Union because she helps the oppressed nations and the exploited 
working class to wage revolution.
World War Two will break out. When it does the French imperialists will 
certainly drive our people to an even more horrible slaughter .”

CAUSES OF WORLD WAR II 503
7.6
Causes of World War II
It is blood which moves the wheels of history.
—Benito Mussolini (1914, before he became Il Duce , the Leader)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and consequences of  
World War II?
The causes of World War II lay in the unresolved issues in the aftermath of 
World War I. Economic instability in the postwar economies of Europe led to 
civil unrest in Italy and Germany. In Italy, the rise of fascism was directly related 
to the downturn of the Italian economy that occurred after World War I. Benito 
Mussolini and his National Fascist Party came to power in 122 because of 
their promises to renew the Italian economy and create another Italian empire 
in the Mediterranean and beyond. The peace settlement after World War I also 
placed unsustainable economic and political terms on Germany and instituted 
territorial distributions that took away resources and created resentment among 
the German population. Thus, the ideology associated with Italian fascism and 
militarism²as seen in the quotation above²spread to Germany, where Hitler 
and the Nazis adopted it.
The Path to War
Out of the context of the broad economic and political trends emerged Adolf 
Hitler . His extreme views on the superiority of the Aryan race and his vision 
of a great German civilization led him to persecute Jews and other minorities 
and to systematically seize land. 
5ise oI 1a]isP  Following Germany’s defeat in 1918, the democratically 
elected Weimar Republic  replaced the monarchical rule of the kaiser. Under 
the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the new German government not only had 
to pay billions in war reparations, but it also was not allowed to have an army. 
The Weimar Republic, appearing weak to the demoralized German people, 
became especially unpopular during the Great Depression.
The rolls of the unemployed swelled due to the weak German economy. 
Large numbers of young men, including many World War I veterans, found 
themselves with few job prospects. Such an environment fostered alienation 
and bitterness. Many Germans perceived the Weimar Republic to be too weak 
to solve the country’s problems, so they looked to right-wing political parties 
that promised strong action.
504 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONHitler had declared his extreme anti-Semitic views in his book Mein Kampf  
“My Struggle”, which he began writing in 12 while in a Bavarian prison 
after a failed coup attempt. The National Socialist German Worker’s Party, or the 
1a]is, came to power legally after the party did well in the 1932 parliamentary 
elections. In early 1, the president of Germany, Paul von Hindenburg, invited 
Adolf Hitler to form a government as chancellor, which he did. Hindenburg died 
in 1, giving Hitler the opening he needed to declare himself  president.
Through manipulation, the Nazi Party instilled fear and panic in the 
German people, making them believe that they were in a state of emergency. 
For example, the Nazis staged a burning of the Reichstag , the German 
parliament building, and blamed radical extremists for the act. Using domestic 
security as justification, Hitler outlawed all other political parties and all forms 
of resistance to his rule. 
Hitler openly promoted ultranationalism and scientific racisP , a 
pseudoscientific theory that claimed that certain races were genetically superior 
to others. He also advanced an extreme form of  anti-Semitism , or hostility 
toward Jews. He filled his speeches with accusations against German Jews, 
whom Hitler claimed were responsible for the nation’s domestic problems. 
Nazi propaganda emphasized a need for a “pure” German nation of “ Aryans ,” 
purged of “outsiders”²not only Jews, but also Slavs, communists, Roma also 
known as Gypsies, and gay men and women. Hitler suggested that the only 
way for Germany to live up to its potential was to eliminate the corrupting 
influence of these groups, particularly the Jews.
Nuremberg Laws  Hitler’s anti-Jewish campaign began with laws 
designed to disenfranchise and discriminate against them. The Nuremberg 
Laws , passed in 15, forbade marriage between Jews and gentiles people 
who are not Jewish), stripped Jews of their citizenship, and unleashed a series 
of subsequent decrees that effectively pushed Jews to the margins of German 
society. German Jews, many of whom were successful in their careers and felt 
assimilated into German society, were shocked by the way they were being 
treated. Some Eastern European nations, such as Romania and Bulgaria, also 
passed laws discriminating against their Jewish citizens. 
The Axis Powers  Hitler then sought new allies to help him acquire 
/eEensraum  living space for the new German empire. He did not try to hide 
his ambition to conquer the entire continent. Hitler’s lust for land eventually 
brought the international community to the brink of war. He first formed a 
military pact with Fascist Italy, the Rome-Berlin Axis , in October 16.  In 
addition to their need for military support, the two countries shared a political 
ideology and economic interests. Germany then created a military alliance with 
Japan based on mutual distrust of communism, known as the Anti-Comintern 
Pact  The alliances among these three nations created the Axis Powers 
Kristallnacht  Hitler’s campaign to rid Germany of Jews predated his 
aggressive land grabs in Europe. His propaganda and the Nuremberg Laws 
successfully created an atmosphere of hostility, hatred, and distrust within 
505 CAUSES OF WORLD WAR II 505Germany. This tension erupted one night in early November 18. 
Kristallnacht , the “Night of the Broken Glass,” produced anti-Jewish riots 
that ostensibly occurred in response to the assassination of a German diplomat 
by a Jewish teenager. Although it appeared to be a spontaneous burst of outrage 
on the part of the German citizenry, Nazi leaders had actually engineered the 
entire operation. The riots resulted in the deaths of more than 90 German Jews 
and the destruction of nearly every synagogue in Germany and some 7,000 
Jewish shops. More than 0,000 Jews were dragged from their homes, arrested, 
and sent to concentration camps. Most of these prisoners were eventually 
released on orders to leave Germany, an option not given to later concentration 
camp prisoners.
Nazi Germany’s Aggressive Militarism
The terms of the Treaty of Versailles severely limited the German military after 
World War I. Yet Hitler wanted a stronger military to acquire more land. In 
March 15, he broke the treaty when he announced the creation of a German 
air force and a policy of conscription to enlarge the size of the army.
The Treaty of Versailles   Under the treaty, a strip of land in the Rhineland 
1 miles wide was set up as a buffer zone between Germany and France. 
Germany was not allowed to station troops there. Hitler broke the agreement, 
sending German troops into the Rhineland on March , 16. Both France and 
Britain protested this move, but they took no other action.

506WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONSome British believed that Hitler was the strong anticommunist leader that 
central Europe needed to keep order. Others were simply reluctant to return 
to war. So Britain followed a policy of appeasement , giving in to Germany’s 
demands in hopes of keeping the peace. However, Germany’s military expansion 
and its support of the fascist Spanish Nationalist government during the Spanish 
Civil War 16±1 indicated that Hitler was increasing his power. Connect: 
Describe the connection between the militarism that led up to World War I and 
World War II. See Topic .2.  
*erPan$ustrian 8nification  With his military revived and alliances in 
hand, Hitler felt confident about taking his next step in the creation of a new 
German empire, the Third Reich . His plan was to bring Austria, where he 
was born, under German rule. Hitler used the threat of invasion to pressure 
the Austrian chancellor into giving more power to the Austrian Nazi Party. As 
Hitler had planned, the Austrian Nazis then opened the door for German troops 
to occupy Austria with no resistance. With the Anschluss  (political union), 
Austria officially became part of the Third Reich in March 18.
C]echosloYaNia  The annexation of Austria was only the first step for Hitler. 
He wanted more. In September 18, he issued a demand to Czechoslovakia for 
the border territory of the Sudetenland  Most of the people who lived in this 
region spoke German Hitler argued that the area was a natural extension of his 
Aryan empire. The German leader met with the leaders of Britain, France, and 
Italy in Munich to discuss his demands. Neville Chamberlain , the British prime 
minister, again argued that a policy of appeasement would keep the peace and 
put an end to Hitler’s demands for more land. The Munich Agreement  allowed 
Hitler to annex the Sudetenland in return for a promise that Germany would not 
take over any more Czech territory. This was a fateful miscalculation. Hitler saw 
that the British were not willing to stand up to his illegal land grabs, emboldening 
him to seize control of all of Czechoslovakia with an armed invasion in 1939. 
7he Conflict oYer 3olanG  Hitler next set his sights on the Polish port 
of 'an]iJ. Although Germany did have some historical claims to the port, in 
reality, Hitler was merely looking for an excuse to invade Poland. Britain, in 
the meantime, had reached the end of its policy of appeasement and agreed to 
protect Poland from a German attack. Britain and France also reached out to the 
Soviet Union to form a stronger alliance against Germany.
Germany, however, was already in negotiations with the Soviets. With the 
signing of the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact on August 2, 1, the 
two nations pledged not to attack one another. During the negotiations for the 
pact, Hitler secretly offered Stalin control of eastern Poland and the Baltic States 
if Stalin would stand by during a German invasion of western Poland. With this 
assurance in hand, Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1, claiming 
that Poland had attacked first. Britain and France honored their agreement to 
protect Poland and declared war on Germany. These actions marked the official 
start of World War II in Europe.

Japan’s Expansion in Asia
By the time Germany invaded Poland in 1, Japan had already been moving 
aggressively against .orea and China for almost 50 years. In 11, Japan had 
invaded Manchuria. After several months of fighting, it successfully created 
the state of Manchukuo under its control. Then, in 1, a small incident in 
this region between Japanese troops and Chinese troops quickly escalated. 
Soon, Japan had launched a full-scale invasion of China. This marked the start 
of World War II in Asia.

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:   IDENTIF Y ASSUMP TION S SH APING POINT  
O- =IEW
The point of view of a source is often shaped by underlying assumptions.   
For example, the .orean Declaration of Independence states: “We 
proclaim >our independence@ to the nations of the world in affirmation of 
the principle of the equality of all nations.” The underlying assumption 
that shapes the point of view in this statement is that all nations are equal, 
a position with which reasonable people agree. That sound assumption 
establishes a legitimacy to other aspects of the declaration. If it had 
instead said, “. . . in affirmation of the principle of the superiority of  
.oreans,” the point of view would be sufficiently narrowed that its 
legitimacy would be questioned, since enlightened opinion recognizes 
equality of people and nations.

We shall never surrender. 
—British Prime 4inister Winston Churchill (1une 4, 1940)
Essential Question:   What similarities and differences were there in the 
methods governments used to conduct war?
During World War II, governments rallied all their resources in the war effort. 
The call to intense nationalism, as illustrated in Winston Churchill’s speech 
in the British House of Commons, was part of concerted policies that used 
all forms of communication to mobilize the population. Appeal to ideological 
beliefs, including fascism and communism, dominated daily life during the 
conflict and minimized resistance to militarism.
Governments also used new military technology and tactics, including the 
atomic bomb and “total war,” disregarding previously accepted laws of war. 
These policies increased the level of wartime casualties.
Japan and Imperialist Policies
With the military in control of the government, Japan harbored imperialist 
ambitions that would lead to a world war in the Pacific. The Mukden Incident 
and the takeover of land in Manchuria in a state called Manchukuo see 
Topic  7.5) were early efforts in this drive. 
New Order in East Asia  The occupation of parts of China was but one step 
in Japan’s overall strategy, which was to create a “New Order in East Asia.” The 
Japanese had looked to expand into Soviet Siberia, but when Germany and the 
Soviets signed the Nonaggression Pact of 1939, Japan had to look elsewhere 
for new territory. Nearby Southeast Asia, which had been under the control 
of imperial powers in Western Europe and the United States, was the most 
obvious target. However, Japan faced obstacles. Its occupation of China led 
to economic sanctions by the United States. Because Japan’s economy relied 
on oil and scrap iron from the United States, sanctions threatened to strangle 
512 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONits economy and undercut its military expansion. Therefore, Japan began to 
plan to retaliate against the United States with military force in the hope that 
by doing so, the Western powers would submit to Japan’s imperial ambitions.
Germany’s Early Victories and Challenges
Once war broke out in Europe, Hitler moved swiftly to acquire territory. He 
embarked on a strategy called Elit]NrieJ , or lightning war, to quickly subdue 
Poland. Germany used rapidly moving tank divisions supported by the air 
force in its four-week campaign. At the end of September 1, Germany and 
the Soviets divided the country as they had planned when they signed the 
German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact.
Germany’s rapid success in Poland encouraged Hitler to attack and 
conquer Denmark and Norway in April 10 and the Netherlands, Belgium, 
and France in the following month. Germany then proceeded to bring the 
government and resources of the conquered nations under its control. As 
the Germans approached Paris, the French government fled to Bordeaux, in 
southern France. Germany took direct control of the northern two-thirds of 
the country. The French set up a new pro-Nazi regime based in Vichy under  
Marshal Henri-Philippe Pptain, an aged World War I hero. Connect: Create

British-American Relations  Fearing that it would be the next victim 
in Germany’s relentless and rapid campaign, Britain asked the United States 
for support. Despite a long history of isolationism from European troubles, 
President Roosevelt believed the United States should help the British. 
In 1940, the two powers signed the Destroyers-for-Bases Agreement , 
in which the United States promised delivery of 50 destroyers in exchange 
for eight British air and naval bases in the Western Hemisphere. In the 11 
513 CONDUCTING WORLD WAR II 513Lend-Lease Act , the United States gave up all pretensions of neutrality by 
lending war materials to Britain. Also in 11, Britain and the United States 
forged a policy statement known as the Atlantic Charter , which set down 
basic goals for the post-war world. The charter included such provisions as the 
restoration of self-government to those deprived of it, the abandonment of the 
use of force, and the disarmament of aggressor nations. 
The Battle of Britain  In Europe, Britain was the last major holdout 
against Nazi power. In July 10, Hitler ordered a large campaign against 
the small island nation by the Luftwaffe , the German air force. He believed 
that bombardment from the air would sufficiently weaken the country so 
that German sea and land forces could mount a successful invasion. Initially 
targeting military bases in this Battle of Britain , the Germans turned to 
bombing British cities after the British Royal Air Force conducted a raid on 
Berlin. Winston Churchill  termed this Britain’s “finest hour” as the civilian 
population in London and other cities withstood months of relentless bombing.  
The targeting of cities did provide one advantage for Britain: the British 
military was able to rebuild after the earlier raids on its bases. Ultimately, 
Britain’s superior planes and radar system allowed it to destroy German planes 
faster than they could be replaced. By May 11, Hitler was forced to postpone 
indefinitely any attempted invasion of Britain.
War on the Soviet Union  After failing to invade Britain, Hitler turned 
east. He attacked the Soviet Union to eliminate Bolshevism and to create 
/eEensraum— land for settlement and development²for the German people. 
Germany’s turning its focus to the east took pressure off Britain. Germany 
began its invasion of the Soviet Union in June 11. Initially the Nazis 
experienced rapid success as they had in Western Europe, capturing large 
amounts of territory and two million Soviet troops. However, the German 
forces soon found themselves at the mercy of the harsh Russian winter. The 
Soviets defended the city of Leningrad in the Siege of Leningrad , which lasted 
three years and led to the deaths of a million Soviet men, women, and children.
Japan Overreaches
Japan experienced rapid victories in the Pacific. It launched a surprise air attack 
on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor  in Hawaii on December  , 11, 
destroying much of the U.S. Pacific fleet. Japan then seized the Philippines, 
the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, Burma, and numerous Pacific islands. 
Japan believed that the surprise attack and the damage to the U.S. Pacific 
Fleet would prompt the United States to negotiate a settlement favorable to 
Japan immediately. Instead, U.S. isolationism disappeared overnight public 
opinion demanded retaliation against Japan. Great Britain and China joined 
the United States in the fight against Japanese aggression. The war truly 
became global when, within days, Hitler responded to the U.S. declaration of 
war against Japan with his own declaration of war against the United States.
514 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONColonial Armies  As the Axis powers expanded into new territory, 
Western colonies began to join the Allies in the war effort. For example, the 
Indian Army, which had started the war with only 200,000 men, ended the 
war as the largest volunteer army in history with more than 2.5 million men. 
Although the Indian Army sent troops to North Africa, the bulk of its troops 
fought against the Japanese in Southeast Asia. 
Home Fronts
Like World War I, World War II was a total war. Most countries mobilized 
all their resources, including the civilian population, to achieve victory. The 
United States started with the strongest industrial sector of any country in the 
world and it added stringent government planning to provide factories what 
they needed. In addition, unlike anywhere in Europe, U.S. industry operated 
without threat of military attack. The United States ramped up production of 
the resources required for war, including ships, tanks, planes, landing craft, 
radar equipment, guns, and ammunition. With the enlistment of large numbers 
of men in the armed forces, women found far more opportunities to work in 
factories and offices. The U.S. government promoted art of “Rosie the Riveter” 
to encourage women to succeed at jobs that were once thought to be for men.
Instead of mobilizing all available citizens in the war effort, German 
leaders relied on forced labor, some of it in concentration camps. At its peak, 
20 percent of the wartime workforce was forced labor, with 600,000 French 
citizens working in German war plants and 1.5 million French soldiers working 
in prisoner-of-war (POW) camps. The solution was counterproductive, 
however. The workers were treated so poorly that productivity was low. 
In Japan, efforts on the home front were confused. The government 
presented an optimistic view of the war instead of trying to mobilize resources. 
The government took pride in not using women in the war effort, claiming that 
the enemy is “drafting women but in Japan, out of consideration for the family 
system, we will not.” The government was able to systematically remove 
children from cities to the countryside when bombing of cities started late in 
the war. It was also successful in rationing food throughout the war. Connect:

The Tide Turns in the European Theater
With its entry into the war in December 11, the United States joined the 
other Allied powers, Great Britain and the Soviet Union. In spite of political 
differences, the three nations were united in their determination to achieve a 
military victory and agreed that Axis surrender must be unconditional.
In early 12, the Allies were struggling in Europe and North Africa. 
General Erwin Rommel , the “Desert Fox,” led German troops in Egypt and 
threatened to take the northern city of Alexandria. But in the second half 
of 1942, the tide turned. The British defeated Rommel at the Battle of El 
515 CONDUCTING WORLD WAR IIAlamein  And after months of fighting, a Soviet counteroffensive successfully 
defeated the pride of Hitler’s military, the German Sixth Army, in the Battle 
of Stalingrad . Although the Germans remained in control of most of Western 
Europe, the momentum of the war in Europe had turned against the Nazis.
7Ke7iGe7uUnsinWKe3Dciðc7KeDWeU
The year 12 was also crucial in the war against Japan. The first Allied 
victory occurred in May in the %attle oI the Coral Sea  when the U.S. Navy 
stopped a Japanese fleet set to invade New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, 
thus helping to prevent a future invasion of Australia. The following month, 
with the destruction of four Japanese aircraft carriers at the Battle of Midway 
Island , Allied naval forces demonstrated their superiority in the Pacific. These 
battles stopped the advance of the Japanese. The first major Allied offensive 
was on the island of Guadalcanal , which ended in early 1 with an Allied 
victory. 
The Allied forces in the Pacific under U.S. General Douglas MacArthur 
used a strategy called island-hopping  The Allies attacked islands where Japan 
was weak and skipped those where Japan was strong. The Allies slowly, and at 
great human cost, moved through the Philippines, getting closer to Japan itself.
Technology was critical to Allied success. The development of fleets of 
aircraft carriers , ships that allowed planes to take off from and land on their 
decks at sea, provided air support for battleships and increased the range and 
flexibility of naval forces. Aircraft were used for raids on enemy ships and 
bases and for intelligence gathering. Submarines sank about 55 percent of the 
Japanese merchant fleet, severely damaging Japan’s supply lines.
The Last Years of the War
The Allied successes of 12 put the Axis powers on the defensive in 1. 
The Allies identified Italy as the weakest point under Axis control in Europe. 
In spite of German forces sent to aid Italy, the Allies gained control of the 
island of Sicily in July 1, leading to the fall of Mussolini. After the Allies 
invaded southern Italy in September 1, Italy turned against its former ally. 
After months of slow and costly progress, the Allies finally recaptured Rome 
on June 4, 1944. 
June 6, 1, has become known as D-Day , when about 150,000 Allied 
forces under the command of U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower launched an 
amphibious invasion from England, landing on the beaches of Normandy in 
northern France. Allied casualties were high. Eventually, however, the Allies 
established a base to begin the march toward Paris, which was liberated in 
August. With control of Western Europe slipping away, Germany’s defeat was 
drawing closer.
The Germans made one final push against the Allies during the winter of 
1944. The Battle of the Bulge  was fought in the Ardennes Forest across parts 
of France, Belgium, and Luxembourg. An Allied victory left Germany with no 
516WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONrealistic expectation of winning the war, yet Hitler refused to give up. Allied 
air raids began to systematically destroy Germany’s infrastructure and Allied 
troops crossed the Rhine River into Germany in March 15. One month later 
they were approaching Germany’s capital city of Berlin.
On the Eastern Front, Soviet troops were also moving rapidly toward 
Germany. In July 1, the largest tank battle of the war, the Battle of Kursk , 
was fought about 00 miles south of Moscow. The Soviets challenged this 
instance of German Blitzkrieg by successfully holding their defensive position 
and then counterattacking. The Soviets then made rapid progress through the 
Ukraine and the Baltic States in 1. After taking control of Warsaw, Poland, 
in January 15, the Soviets moved on to Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. In 
April 15, they advanced on Berlin.
Victory in Europe  Hitler spent the war’s final days hiding in a bunker, 
a fortified underground shelter, in Berlin. Although the country was falling 
apart, he continued to live under the delusion that somehow Germany would 
triumph. The end came on April 0, 15, when Hitler committed suicide. 
His ally Mussolini had been killed by members of the Italian resistance two 
days before. After Hitler’s death, members of Germany’s High Command 
acknowledged that continuing the war would be futile. In the first days of May, 
Germany surrendered to the Allies. May 8, 15, marked the official end of 
the war in Europe and was designated as Victory in Europe Day or V-E Day 
Victory over Japan  In early 15, U.S. forces captured the islands of 
Okinawa and Iwo Jima and prepared to attack the Japanese mainland. In March 
15, U.S. troops fire-bombed Tokyo, killing about 100,000 people and leaving 
about a million others homeless. Although the island-hopping campaign had 
weakened Japan’s hold on the Pacific, the emperor was not ready to surrender. 
The United States was beginning to consider the costs of invading the Japanese 
homeland, which it feared might lead to enormous Allied casualties. Despite 
initial hesitations about using nuclear weapons, President Truman ordered 
the U.S. Army Air Force to drop the first atomic bomb on the Japanese city 
of Hiroshima  on August 6, 15. The nuclear age had begun. Three days 
later, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki , resulting in an estimated 
total of 10,000 Japanese civilian deaths. The months of Allied victories, 
combined with these devastating nuclear attacks, caused Japan to surrender 
unconditionally on August 1. Truman designated September 2, the day of the 
formal surrender ceremonies, as Victory over Japan Day or V-J Day .
Consequences of World War II
World War II was the bloodiest war in human history. It resulted in the deaths 
of around 5 million people, two-thirds of whom were civilians. As later topics 
explain, it changed how people thought about racism, colonial empires, and 
international relations. Further, it provided the context for a fierce ideological 
battle between the United States and the Soviet Union that would shape global 
affairs for the following five decades.

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“Nearly 50,000 American women served in uniform, both at home and abroad. 
. . . . General Eisenhower felt that he could not win the war without the aid of 
the women in uniform. µThe contribution of the women of America, whether 
on the farm or in the factory or in uniform, to D-Day was a sine qua non of the 
invasion effort.’
Women in uniform took office and clerical jobs in the armed forces in order 
to free men to fight. They also drove trucks, repaired airplanes, worked as 
laboratory technicians, rigged parachutes, served as radio operators, analyzed 
photographs, flew military aircraft across the country, test-flew newly repaired 
planes, and even trained anti-aircraft artillery gunners by acting as flying targets. 
Some women served near the front lines in the Army Nurse Corps, where 
16 were killed as a result of direct enemy fire. Sixty-eight American service 
women were captured as POWs in the Philippines. More than 1,600 nurses 
were decorated for bravery under fire and meritorious service, and 565 WACs 
in the Pacific Theater won combat decorations. Nurses were in Normandy on 
D-plus-four.”

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:   E=IDENCE TO SUPPORT, MODI-@, OR RE-UTE
In the years following the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, historians have considered, from almost every angle, the 
question of whether or not the bombs were needed to end the war. 
Each position has offered evidence to support it. That same evidence 
might modify  someone else’s argument²change it somewhat or add a 
complexity²or it might refute or disprove it entirely. 
The following excerpt is from an article that appeared in The Atlantic  
in December 16. It states a clear position on the question.
“The facts are these. On July 26, 15, the Potsdam Ultimatum 
>issued by the United States, Great Britain, and China@ called on 
Japan to surrender unconditionally. On July 2 Premier Suzuki issued 
a statement, purportedly at a cabinet press conference, scorning as 
unworthy of official notice the surrender ultimatum, and emphasizing 
the increasing rate of Japanese aircraft production. Eight days later, 
on August 6, the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima the 
second was dropped on August  on Nagasaki on the following day, 
August 10, Japan declared its intention to surrender, and on August 1 
accepted the Potsdam terms.
On the basis of these facts, I cannot believe that, without the atomic 
bomb, the surrender would have come without a great deal more of 
costly struggle and bloodshed.”
.arl T. Compton, “What If the Atomic Bomb Had 
Not Been Used"”
5ead the following statements and determine whether each suppor ts, 
modifies, or refutes &ompton¶s position
520 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION1. “A >2005@ Harvard University Press volume by Professor 
Tsuyoshi Hasegawa of the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, is the most comprehensive study yet undertaken 
of Japanese documentary sources. The highly praised study 
argues that the atomic bomb played only a secondary role in 
Japan’s decision to surrender. By far the most important factor, 
Hasegawa finds, was the entry of the Soviet Union into the war 
against Japan on Aug. 8, 15, two days after the Hiroshima 
bombing.”²Gar Aperovitz, “From the Archives: Atomic 
Bombing of Japan Was Unnecessary,” July, 2005
2. “My reading of the history of World War II has convinced me 
that Japan would not have surrendered if the bombs had not been 
dropped even after that some in the military tried to prevent 
the Emperor from surrendering. American military leaders 
predicted that an invasion of Japan would have produced 1 
million Americans killed or wounded. The Japanese had fought 
fiercely in Okinawa in the spring of 15 100,000 Americans 
and Japanese died in this one small island.”²Michael Barone, 
:ashington ([aminer , August 201
3. “The charge that Harry Truman was willing to condemn tens of 
thousands of people including Allied servicemen and prisoners 
of war to die by prolonging the war, and tens of thousands more 
Japanese by using the bombs merely to impress the Soviets, is 
one that ought not be made without substantial proof. Tweaking 
mangled documents, especially in a volume >Hasegawa’s book@ 
published by a prestigious academic press Harvard, utterly 
fails to meet this criterion and does a profound disservice to 
unsuspecting readers.”²Robert James Maddox, “Disputing 
Truman’s Use of Nuclear Weapons²Again,” American Thinker ,

REFLECT ON THE TOPIC ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. In one to three paragraphs, explain similarities and differences in how 
governments used a variety of methods to conduct war.
MASS ATROCITIE S521
7.8
Mass Atrocities
Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians? 
—German Führer Adolf Hitler (August 22, 1939)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and consequences of mass 
atrocities from 1900 to the present?
The deaths of fighting forces in the two world wars were only part of the 
total casualties. Genocide, ethnic violence, and other atrocities took place as 
extremist groups rose to power. During and after World War I, the Ottoman 
Empire, ruled by a clique of “Young Turks” who were disturbed by the 
continuing decline of Ottoman power, perpetrated the Armenian genocide in 
which some 1.5 million Armenians died. As Adolf Hitler implemented the 
Holocaust, he referred to the Armenian annihilation as a reminder of how little 
the Nazis need fear for the systematic murder of six million Jews.
Ethnic atrocities did not end after World War II. Dictator Pol Pot wanted  to 
“purify” Cambodian society along racial, social, and political lines, resulting in 
the deaths of 1.6 to 1.8 million Cambodians. See Topic 8.6. And in Rwanda, 
the majority Hutu government directed mass slaughter of the Tutsi minority.
Atrocities in Europe and the Middle East
After three years of a bloody stalemate, the United States entered World War 
I in 11, despite considerable popular protests in the United States against 
American involvement. By the summer of 118, when U.S. forces were 
in place in Europe, U.S. actions helped push the war in the Allies’ favor. 
Allied advances against the Central Powers forced Germany to surrender on 
November 11, 118, which became known as Armistice Day .
Between 8 million and 9 million soldiers died in the war, with more than 
21 million wounded. In France, Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary, fewer 
than half of all young men who fought for their countries returned physically 
unharmed. Soldiers who did return often bore emotional scars. 
Civilian casualties were harder to record, but estimates range anywhere 
from 6 million to 1 million. This was one of the first modern wars where 
civilians were considered legitimate targets. Although the Allies’ propaganda 
often exaggerated accounts of atrocities, reports of German soldiers raping 
women and killing families during their march through Belgium were common.

Armenian Genocide  The most shocking example of such atrocities were 
the deaths of between 600,000 and 1.5 million Armenians  in Turkey. This action 
has been called the 20th century’s first genocide , the attempted killing of a group 
of people based on their race, religion, or ethnicity. The Ottoman government 
alleged that the Christian Armenians, a minority within the Ottoman Empire, 
were cooperating with the Russian army, an Ottoman enemy during World  
War I. As punishment for this cooperation, the Ottoman government deported 
Armenians from their homes between 115 and 11 and into camps in Syria 
and what is today Iraq. Many Armenians died from starvation, disease, or 
exposure to the elements. Turkish troops executed others. Armenians have 
argued that the deaths were genocide. The Turkish government has said the 
deaths were the result of actions of war, ethnic conflicts, and disease, not 
genocide. Connect: Create a graphic organizer comparing the Armenian 
genocide with the Nazis’ extermination of millions of Jews. See Topic .6.
Pandemic Disease
War-related deaths continued past Armistice Day in the form of an influen]a 
epidemic . Under peacetime circumstances, a virulent disease might devastate 
a concentrated group of people in a particular region. However, in 118, 
millions of soldiers were returning home as the war ended. As they did, 
they had contact with loved ones and friends, thereby spreading the flu. In 
11, the epidemic became a pandemic , a disease prevalent over a large area  
or the entire world, killing 20 million people in Europe, the United States, and 
elsewhere. India alone may have lost 7 million people to the disease. 
The worldwide spread of the disease was another sign that while nationalism 
remained a powerful political force, improvements in transportation were 
creating a global culture that would create global challenges. Whether people 
could create effective international responses was unclear.
523 MASS ATROCITIE S5236uσeUinJDnG)DPine
A more intangible casualty of the war was the loss of a sense of security and 
hopefulness. The term Lost Generation , first used to describe American 
expatriate writers living in Paris after the war, came to be used more broadly 
to describe those suffering from the shock of the war. World War I was the 
bloodiest war thus far in history. It resulted in tremendous suffering and death 
for both military personnel and civilians.
Famine in the Ukraine  In the Soviet Union, peasants strongly resisted 
Stalin’s collectivization of agriculture. They hid or destroyed their crops and 
killed their livestock rather than turning them over to state control. This led 
to famines from human action rather than by weather or crop failures. The 
famines in 12 and 1 were especially devastating in the Ukraine, one of 
the Soviet Union’s most fertile farming regions. An estimated  million to 10 
million peasants died as a result of these famines. The government took much 
of the crops that were grown to feed industrial workers or to use for industry. 
Although peasants starved, industry grew.
Casualties of World War II
Because of the widespread fighting, advances in the technology of destruction, 
and its impact on the economies and civilian life of so many nations, the effects 
of World War II were unprecedented. Although exact casualty figures have 
been impossible to determine, total deaths probably numbered 0 million to 50 
million. Maybe half of those were citizens of the Soviet Union, and millions 
of others were from Germany, Poland, China, and Japan. Losses among U.S. 
troops were fewer, but still considerable: about 20,000 soldiers killed and 
more than 600,000 wounded. Civilian casualties from attacks on land, air, 
and sea from government executions based on political rationales, including 
genocide and from disease and starvation caused by the war likely exceeded 
military casualties.
7he 1a]is  During the war, the world gradually learned about Nazi 
brutality. In its pursuit of territory, Germany forcefully removed many Slavic 
peoples, including one million Poles, and Roma, also known as Gypsies, from 
their homes. Heinrich Himmler , the leader of the Nazi special police, the SS, 
oversaw these policies. In addition, more than  million residents of conquered 
territories were forced to work in labor camps or in jobs that supported the 
German war effort. The Nazis sent political opponents, people with disabilities, 
and gay people to the camps. But the largest single group the Nazis targeted 
were the Jews. When Hitler became chancellor, he instituted many policies 
that reflected these extreme anti-Semitic views, such as the Nuremberg Laws  
of 15 that banned Jews from certain professions and certain schools. Jews 
were forced to live in sections of cities called ghettos . 
524 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn 12, the Nazi persecution of Jews turned into mass murder. They 
began a campaign led by the SS to kill all Jews in Europe, a plan they called 
the “ Final Solution .” Initially, Nazi killing units moved from place to place, 
shooting Jews and burying them in mass graves. Later the SS began rounding 
up Jews and shipping them to death camps, where Nazis gassed them. 
Auschwitz and Treblinka in Poland and Dachau in Germany were some of the 
largest camps. By the end of the war, the Nazis had killed about six million 
Jews, an act of genocide known as the Holocaust  The Nazis killed another 
five million people who belonged to other persecuted groups or were Soviet 
prisoners of war. The Nazis worked many to death in labor camps and 
massacred others. 
The Japanese  During the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1, Japanese 
soldiers killed at least 100,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians in what was 
called the Rape of Nanking. During World War II, although the Japanese did 
not carry out a dedicated policy of genocide that paralleled the Holocaust, 
millions of people died as a result of their policies. Under the program “ Asia 
for Asiatics ,” Japan forced people they had conquered into labor programs. 
These included service in the military, on public works projects, and on farms 
to reduce the food shortage in Japan. The Japanese army forced women in 
.orea, China, and other occupied countries to become “comfort women,” 
prostitutes for Japanese soldiers. Because of these harsh programs, more than 
a million civilians died in 9ietnam alone. Perhaps an equal number of Allied 
prisoners of war and local workers perished while doing forced labor for Japan.One shocking aspect of the Holocaust was how the Nazis used technology  ²trains, poisonous gas, and 
ovens for cremation shown here²to make their attempt at genocide more ef ficient and more deadly.

525 MASS ATROCITIE SThe Allies  Air warfare carried out by the United States and the other Allies 
brought a new type of deadly combat to civilians. The Allies’ fireEoPEinJ  of 
German cities, particularly Hamburg  in 1943 and Dresden  in 1945, caused 
large casualties. The number of deaths in Hamburg was about 50,000. Dresden 
had fewer casualties, maybe 25,000 deaths, as 15 square miles of its historic 
city center were destroyed. The United States also used firebombing in Tokyo  
The final two air attacks in the war, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, produced not 
only high casualties, but tremendous fear about the destructiveness of a future 
war fought with nuclear weapons. These weapons had been developed by an 
international group of scientists working in the United States. The scientific 
achievement was impressive, but it also required developments in other areas 
to have military use. For example, to deliver the nuclear weapons required 
improvements in airplane design to allow long flights carrying heavy loads. 
There is a great difference between the planes used in World War II and those 
used in World War I. In addition, the widespread use of the aircraft carrier by 
several powers extended the airplanes’ reach. Using these developments in 
planes and ships, countries could carry out air attacks anywhere in the world.
Genocide and Human Rights
The global community said “never again” to genocide after the horrors of the 
Holocaust. However, genocides continued to occur.
Bosnia  Ethnic conflict drove the genocide in Bosnia . The end of World 
War I brought with it the creation of several new nations in Eastern Europe, 
including Yugoslavia. That country was home to Serbians, who were Eastern 
Orthodox Christians Croats and Slovenes, who were Catholic and Muslims 
in the regions of Bosnia and .osovo. Marshal Josip Broz Tito led communist 
Yugoslavia from the end of World War II until his death in 180. As dictator, 
Tito tried to suppress separatist tendencies among the peoples of Yugoslavia 
by keeping Serbia and Croatia, the two largest republics, from dominating the 
smaller ones.
After the Soviet Union collapsed, so did Yugoslavia. When Slovenia, 
Croatia, and Montenegro declared independence, they each defined citizenship 
in terms of ethnic background and religion. Serbian nationalists led by the 
demagogue Slobodan Miloševicc ´  were particularly emphatic about ethnic 
purity. Serb forces, in attempts to dominate states such as Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and .osovo, committed horrific acts of ethnic cleansing  against Muslims 
from Bosnia and .osovo, killing or driving people who were not part of the 
main ethnic group from their homes. Bosniaks, .osovars, and Croats fought 
back, causing more casualties. Serb soldiers raped untold numbers of Muslim 
women. In total, more than 300,000 people in the region perished over the 
course of Yugoslavia’s EalNani]ation , or disintegration into separate states. 
Rwanda  One of the smallest countries in Africa, Rwanda  was the site of 
one of the worst genocides in modern history. Ethnic and tribal hatred going 
526WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONback to the colonial era was behind the slaughter. Belgian colonizers had treated 
the minority Tutsis better than the majority Hutus . The latter group resented 
all the power that the Tutsis enjoyed. When Rwanda won independence from 
Belgium in 162, the Hutu majority easily won control of the government and 
took revenge on the Tutsis by discriminating against them. In response, tens of 
thousands of Tutsis fled the country and formed a rebel army.
In 1, Tutsi and Hutu forces in Rwanda began negotiations for a coalition 
government in which both ethnic groups would share power. The negotiations 
were cut short in 1 when Rwanda’s president, a Hutu, was killed in an 
airplane crash, supposedly shot down by rebel forces. This incident lit the 
flames of genocide. Over the next three months or so, between 500,000 and 
1 million civilians²mostly Tutsis and some moderate Hutus²were killed. 
Some sources estimate that casualties were even higher.
International responses ranged from insufficient to callous. United Nations 
peacekeepers were instructed not to use force to restore order. There were also 
too few peacekeepers to protect all Rwandans. Individual countries, including 
the United States, evacuated their personnel from the country after Belgian 
peacekeepers were killed. UN peacekeepers and individual nations  failed to 
evacuate any Rwandans. The Rwandan genocide focused attention on the lack 
of leadership in the international community. It became clear that the United 
Nations needed to think seriously about its role in violent conflicts if it wanted 
to effectively protect human lives and human rights.

western Sudan. Most of the people involved were Muslim, but some were 
nomadic pastoralists of Arab descent, while others were non-Arab farmers. 
The government of Sudan was controlled by Arab Muslims. Two Darfur rebel 
groups composed of non-Arabs took up arms against the Sudanese government 
in response to attacks from nomads. In response, the government unleashed 
Arab militants known as the Janjaweed  translation: “evil men on horseback” 
on the region. Together with Sudanese forces, the Janjaweed attacked and 
destroyed hundreds of villages throughout Darfur, slaughtering more than 
200,000 people, mostly non-Arab Muslim Africans. More than one million 
people were displaced, creating a refugee crisis that spilled into neighboring 
Chad. Despite negotiations, appeals, and the  International Criminal Court 
charging Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir with war crimes, the genocide 
continued.

Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“The Holocaust was the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution 
and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators.  
. . . The Nazis, who came to power in Germany in January 1, believed that 
Germans were ‘racially superior’ and that the Jews, deemed ‘inferior,’ were an 
alien threat to the so-called German racial community. . . .
To concentrate and monitor the Jewish population as well as to facilitate 
later deportation of the Jews, the Germans and their collaborators created 
ghettos, transit camps, and forced-labor camps for Jews during the war  
years. . . .
Between 11 and 1, Nazi German authorities deported millions of 
Jews from Germany, from occupied territories, and from the countries of many 
of its Axis allies to ghettos and to killing centers, often called extermination 
camps, where they were murdered in specially developed gassing facilities.”

What does it take to make people “capable of committing such

question by relating genocide to other historical developments, such as 
the following:
• War²has an influence on people’s psyche that makes them more 
likely to kill members of an “outgroup” which is perceived to be a 
threat
• Economic crisis²fosters a need to scapegoat others as being 
responsible for the economic problems, softening a resistance to 
killing them
• Enlightenment thinking²  focuses on the perceived perfectibility 
of society, sometimes in terms of removing biological threats.

CAUSATION IN GLOBAL CONFLICT 531
7.9
&DusDWiRnin*lREDl&RnñicW
As long as there are sovereign nations possessing great power,  
war is inevitable. 
—.erman-American Physicist Albert Einstein (1945)
Essential Question:   What was the relative signiÄcance of the causes of 
global conflict from 1900 to the present?
The 20th century saw significant changes to the global order. At the beginning 
of the century, the West dominated the global political order. However, the 
First and Second World Wars resulted in a power shift within the Western 
political sphere from Western Europe to the United States. These global 
conflicts also resulted in the emergence of new states around the world as 
independence movements ended the colonial relationships that existed in the 
previous century. 
The Ottoman, Russian, and Qing empires that had existed at the beginning 
of the century all collapsed due to internal decay and political revolutions. 
Other areas of the world also saw political upheaval as nations struggled with 
both economic depression and calls for greater democracy. Often, though, 
totalitarian governments emerged out of these political and economic crises. 
3RliWicDl&DusesRf*lREDl&RnñicW  
in the 20th  Century
Many historians refer to World War I as the first “total war.” The war was 
fought on an industrial scale by soldiers from around the world, including 
soldiers from colonial areas. The combatants discovered more, and deadlier, 
methods of killing each other. Long-range artillery, poison gas, flamethrowers, 
and machine guns led to the deaths of millions of soldiers on both sides. The 
roots of this conflict lie in several main causes. A balance of power in Europe 
had been established during the 1th century through a constantly shifting 
system of alliances. However, these alliances proved instrumental in escalating 
the scope of the war as European nations jumped into the conflict to honor 
their commitments. 
Nationalism was a growing force for political change in Europe. As such, 
Serbian nationalism was the main spark that created conflict in the Balkans, 
known as the “powder keg of Europe,” which led to the expansion of the war 
532WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONthroughout Europe. An arms race among the great powers of Europe helped 
to increase the possibility of war as well. Lastly, the imperial rivalry among 
Western nations, as well as Japan and Russia, helped to increase tensions over 
commerce and access to resources.

Some of the same issues that brought about World War I also led to World 
War II. Fascism was nationalism in an extreme form. The fascist governments 
of Germany and Italy defied international pressure and treaties when they 
invaded neighboring territories. The alliance of Germany, Italy, and, eventually, 
Japan was opposed by the Western democracies of Great Britain and France. 
However, it was the inability of the Western democracies to offer a strong 
response to Germany’s aggressive militarism that launched Europe and the 
rest of the world into war. Additionally, Japan’s imperial ambitions in Asia 
were the main cause for war to break out in the Pacific between Japan and the 
United States. Connect: Compare the motivating factors for wars fought in 
the 20th century with wars fought in the 1th century. See Topic 6..
(cRnRPic&DusesRf*lREDl&RnñicW  
in the 20th  Century
The primary economic cause of global conflict in the early 20th century was the 
acquisition and control of markets and resources. In the 1th century, Western 
European governments, followed by the United States, Russia, and Japan, 
began policies to take control of trade, territory, or both in Asia and Africa. In 
previous centuries, armed conflict would often erupt over the rivalry to control 
the natural resources of these areas. However, as the Industrial Revolution 
spread from Great Britain to the rest of Western Europe, and then to the United 
States, Russia, and Japan, control over markets to sell consumer goods was a 
primary motive of imperialistic policies. Attempts were made, particularly in 
the late 1th century, to prevent wars over trade but these attempts had mixed 
success.
533 CAUSATION IN GLOBAL CONFLICT 533The Opium Wars, the First and Second Sino-Japanese War, the Crimean 
War, and eventually the First and Second World Wars had these economic 
factors as some of their root causes. For example, the desire of Imperial Japan 
to take over territory in Asia to obtain sources of oil, rice, rubber, and other 
raw materials led to the decision of the United States and other countries to 
place an embargo on Japan that cut off oil and steel exports from the United 
States to Japan. The result was the Japanese decision to attack the U.S. Pacific 
Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, causing the United States to enter World War 
II. Economic crisis also helped lead to global conflict. The severe economic 
effects of the Great Depression (1929–1939), including high unemployment 
and low wages, led to the rise of populist leaders like Adolf Hitler who 
promised to rebuild the economies of their states. 
(σecWsRf*lREDl&RnñicWinWKeWK&enWuUy
Rapid advances in science and technology led to a better understanding 
of the natural world and brought about advances in many areas, including 
communication, transportation, industry, agriculture, and medicine. States also 
improved their war-making capabilities. As a result, one of the most significant 
effects of the global conflicts of the 20th century was the immense loss of life 
as warfare became deadlier to both combatants and civilians alike. Large-scale 
aerial bombing that targeted populated areas, deadly policies that targeted 
specific minority groups such as European Jews, and the use of new military 
technology such as the atomic bomb all meant that global conflict would 
cause unprecedented deaths among the civilian population. In addition, mass 
starvation and crimes against humanity were also responsible for millions of 
civilian deaths during the 20th century.

534WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONGlobal conflict in the 20th century also brought about notable political 
changes in the world. In the beginning of the century, the Mexican Revolution 
took place because many Mexicans wanted political and economic reforms. 
Populist movements formed and, eventually, Mexico created a new constitution 
with more political and economic rights for the majority of Mexicans. 
However, true democratic institutions in Mexico emerged and evolved slowly. 
As a result of World War I, regime change occurred in both the Ottoman 
Empire and the Russian Empire. In addition to the effect of the First World 
War, ineffective or corrupt leadership was also instrumental in bringing about 
the political revolutions that toppled the monarchies of these states. While the 
Ottoman government was replaced by a Western-style democracy, the Russian 
Revolution instituted a totalitarian government headed by the Communist 
Party. 
Resentment of the Treaty of Versailles, the peace agreement that ended  
World War I, also helped to bring about totalitarian regimes in Germany and 
Italy. These fascist governments appealed to people’s nationalism and desire 
to restore the country’s glory and standing in the world, leading their nations 
toward war. 
World War I weakened the colonial powers, and after the war, U.S. 
President Woodrow Wilson advocated for the self-determination of people to 
choose their government or nation-state. This was seen as a sign that colonies 
had the right to demand independence. Many people in the colonies also felt 
that their support of or active participation in the war meant that they were 
owed some form of self-government. When those in power did not meet these 
demands, organized independence movements formed or grew. 
The desire for independence continued to grow after World War II, as 
the colonial powers were further weakened by the war and unable to afford 
the cost and labor power to rebuild and maintain their empires. Many new Civilian Deaths in the Second World War

535 CAUSATION IN GLOBAL CONFLICTstates formed during this time. Former colonies that had a small foreign settler 
population gained their independence relatively peacefully, while colonies 
that had a sizeable foreign settler population often experienced a more violent 
process towards independence. 
Perhaps the largest independence movement, in terms of the number of 
people involved, took place in India. Relying on passive resistance and civil 
disobedience, the people of the British colony of India achieved independence 
in 1. However, due to religious and ideological differences, the Indian 
subcontinent was partitioned into a Muslim-dominated Pakistan which 
originally included East Pakistan, now Bangladesh and a Hindu-dominated 
India. See Topic 8.6. The tensions between Muslims and Hindus living in 
British India did not disappear with independence. These tensions have led to 
several military conflicts between the two countries since partition.
Another significant effect of the global conflicts of the 20th century 
was a repositioning of power in the Western countries²away from Western 
Europe and to the United States. Because of the participation of the United 
States in both the First and Second World Wars, as well as the smaller scale 
of destruction the U.S. experienced compared to Western European countries, 
the United States became a world power, playing the dominant role in the 
transatlantic relationship. However, the Soviet Union soon emerged as a 
second superpower in opposition to the United States.

UNIT 7 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WHAT CAUSED TOTALITARIANI SM?
Scholars disagree about why so many totalitarian states, states with 
complete control over every aspect of public and private life, emerged 
in the 20th century. While many countries moved toward democracy, 
Russia, Germany, Italy, and Spain became dictatorships between the 
two world wars. Scholars often explain the rise of totalitarianism from 
their own discipline’s viewpoint. 
An Economist’s View  An Austrian economist, Friedrich Hayek, argued 
that totalitarianism had developed gradually and was based on decisions about 
economic policy. In his 1 book The Road to Serfdom, Hayek concluded that 
totalitarianism grew in Western democracies because they had “progressively 
abandoned that freedom in economic affairs without which personal and 
political freedom has never existed in the past.” He viewed socialism and 
fascism as two sides of the same coin, since centralized government planning 
and state power characterized both. 
Political Scientists’ View  In contrast, the American political scientists 
Carl Friedrich and =bigniew Brzezinski focused on political and ethnic issues, 
not economic ones. They contended that the totalitarian regimes in Germany, 
Italy, and the Soviet Union had their origins in the upheaval brought about by 
World War I. The forces of nationalism unleashed by the war, combined with 
the need to respond politically to the global depression that followed World 
War I, created fertile ground for strong nationalistic rulers who could rise to 
political power and address ethnic conflict.
A Historian’s View  American historian and journalist William Shirer 
identified the origins of Nazism in Germany’s distant and distinctive past. He 
concluded that Germanic nationalism, authoritarianism, and militarism dated 
back to the Middle Ages. “The course of German history . . . ,” he wrote, 
“made blind obedience to temporal rulers the highest virtue of Germanic man, 
and put a premium on servility.” No other country developed the same sort of 
Nazism because no country had Germany’s past.
A Sociologist’s View  American sociologist Barrington Moore looked to 
the past to explain totalitarianism. However, rather than focus on what made 
each country unique, he searched for patterns in the social structures of groups 
of countries. In his book 6ocial 2rigins of 'ictatorship and 'emocracy  
166, Moore looked at why Great Britain, France, and the United States 
evolved into democracies, while Japan, China, Russia, and Germany evolved 
into dictatorships. For Moore, two vital steps in creating a democracy were 
developing a middle class and breaking the power of the landed aristocracy. 
Countries that failed to do these things were more likely to become dictatorships.
Develop an Argument :  Evaluate the extent to which historical evidence 
supports one of the perspectives on totalitarianism. 
 537
WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  WRITE  THE SUPP ORTING  PARAGRA PHS
The supporting paragraphs in your long essay will demonstrate your skill in 
using evidence. They will also demonstrate your ability to follow a reasoning 
process and develop a complex interpretation of the prompt.
Use of Evidence  Suppose your thesis is that imperialism and militarism 
are the two most significant causes of global conflict in the period 100 to the 
present. To earn any points, you need to provide two examples of evidence 
relevant to your thesis²that is, directly connected to your topic. For example, 
you might point out that imperialism caused conflict not only between 
competing empires but also between the imperialists and the native peoples 
whose land they colonized. You might also note that militarism fed nationalist 
competition and reduced the gravity of warfare in the eyes of the public. For 
both points of evidence, you would include specific examples.
However, to earn the maximum number of points, you need to show 
how your evidence supports your argument. For example, you would need 
to point out that because imperialism touched nearly every part of the globe 
and disrupted so many native peoples, it was a far more significant cause of 
global conflict than other causes, such as European alliances. You would use 
examples to show the breadth of imperialist reach and the smaller sphere of 
European alliances. You might explain in a second paragraph that militarism 
was such a significant cause of global conflict because it was the force that 
made imperialism possible. You might also provide examples of the increasing 
power of military technology to inflict harm. Using such terms as Eecause and 
for this reason  will help you link your evidence to your argument.
Historical Reasoning and Complexity Your supporting paragraphs also 
need to show that you have framed your argument with historical reasoning²
causation, continuity and change, or comparison. You can show this framing in 
your choice of key words as well as in the organization you use. For example, 
if you are comparing imperialism in Africa with imperialism in South America, 
you could organize your material so that you cover imperialism in Africa in one 
or more paragraphs and then move on to cover imperialism in South America, 
noting similarities and differences as you go. Or you might subdivide the topic 
of imperialism into such categories as its effect on social structures and its 
effect on economic matters and discuss both regions in each category. 
To earn the most points, however, your supporting paragraphs must 
demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development that is 
the focus of the prompt. You can show your complex understanding in many 
ways. You can explain both similarities and differences or address multiple 
causes and effects. You could make insightful connections across geographic 
areas and time periods. You could also use evidence from other sources to 
corroborate verify, qualify set limitations, or modify revise an argument 
that addresses the question. See Write as a Historian in Topic 8. for more on 
these uses of evidence.)

Kaiser to Tsar , July 28, 11 >this and the previous telegram crossed@: It 
is with the gravest concern that I hear of the impression which the action 
of Austria against Serbia is creating in your country. The unscrupulous 
agitation that has been going on in Serbia for years has resulted in the 
outrageous crime, to which Archduke Francis Ferdinand fell a victim. 
The spirit that led Serbians to murder their own king and his wife still 
dominates the country. You will doubtless agree with me that we both, you 
and me, have a common interest as well as all Sovereigns to insist that all 
the persons morally responsible for the dastardly murder should receive 
their deserved punishment. In this case politics plays no part at all.
On the other hand, I fully understand how difficult it is for you and your 
Government to face the drift of your public opinion. Therefore, with regard 
to the hearty and tender friendship which binds us both from long ago with 
firm ties, I am exerting my utmost influence to induce the Austrians to deal 
straightly to arrive to a satisfactory understanding with you. I confidently 
hope that you will help me in my efforts to smooth over difficulties that 
may still arise.
Kaiser to Tsar, July 2, 11: I received your telegram and share your 
wish that peace should be maintained. But as I told you in my first 
telegram, I cannot consider Austria’s action against Serbia an “ignoble” 
war. Austria knows by experience that Serbian promises on paper are 
wholly unreliable. . . . I therefore suggest that it would be quite possible 
for Russia to remain a spectator of the Austro-Serbian conflict without 
involving Europe in the most horrible war she ever witnessed.

Am sending Tatischev this evening with instructions. The military 
measures which have now come into force were decided five days ago for 
reasons of defence on account of Austria’s preparations. I hope from all 
my heart that these measures won’t in any way interfere with your part as 
mediator which I greatly value. We need your strong pressure on Austria 
to come to an understanding with us.

Kaiser to Tsar, July 0, 11: Best thanks for telegram. It is quite out of the 
question that my ambassadors language could have been in contradiction 
with the tenor of my telegram. Count Pourtalès was instructed to draw 
the attention of your government to the danger 	 grave consequences 
involved by a mobilisation I said the same in my telegram to you. Austria 
has only mobilized against Serbia 	 only a part of her army. If, as it is now 
the case, according to the communication by you 	 your Government, 
Russia mobilizes against Austria, my role as mediator you kindly intrusted 
me with, 	 which I accepted at you>r@ express prayer, will be endangered 
if not ruined. The whole weight of the decision lies solely on you>r@ 
shoulders now, who have to bear the responsibility for Peace or War.
Kaiser to Tsar, July 1, 11: On your appeal to my friendship and 
your call for assistance began to mediate between your and the Austro-
Hungarian Government. While this action was proceeding your troops 
were mobilized against Austro-Hungary, my ally. Thereby, as I have 
already pointed out to you, my mediation has been made almost illusory .
I have nevertheless continued my action. I now receive authentic news 
of serious preparations for war on my Eastern frontier. Responsibility 
for the safety of my empire forces preventive measures of defence upon 
me. In my endeavours to maintain the peace of the world I have gone 
to the utmost limit possible. The responsibility for the disaster which is 
now threatening the whole civilized world will not be laid at my door. In 
this moment it still lies in your power to avert it. Nobody is threatening 
the honour or power of Russia who can well afford to await the result of 
my mediation. My friendship for you and your empire, transmitted to me 
by my grandfather on his deathbed has always been sacred to me and I 
have honestly often backed up Russia when she was in serious trouble 
especially in her last war.
The peace of Europe may still be maintained by you, if Russia will 
agree to stop the military measures which must threaten Germany and 
Austro-Hungary.

UNIT 8: COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION 545
UNIT 8:   Cold War and 
Decolonization
Understand the Context
The aftermath of the world wars provided the context for two developments 
in the late 20th century: the decline of colonial empires and the rise of a tense 
conflict between capitalist and communist states known as the Cold War. These 
conflicts became intertwined, resulting in numerous wars.
Decolonization  Against the backdrop of the world wars, nationalist 
movements in African and Asian colonies intensified. In the decades following 
World War II, colonies achieved independence through negotiation, and in 
some cases, armed struggle. The creation of independent states often resulted 
in population resettlements and challenges to inherited colonial boundaries. 
In newly independent states, as in more established states, governments 
actively promoted economic development. Movements to redistribute land 
and wealth gained support in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Some of these 
movements, such as the one in China, embraced a form of communism. Even 
after independence, connections between postcolonial states and former 
colonial empires continued through migration and economic relationships.
The Cold War  After World War II, with Europe weakened, the United 
States and the Soviet Union USSR emerged as competing superpowers. The 
resulting Cold War was a power struggle between capitalism and communism, 
expressed through competing military alliances, a nuclear arms race, and 
proxy wars in postcolonial states in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. 
While the Cold War heightened global tensions, movements advocating 
nonviolence and alternatives to the established order, such as the Non-Aligned 
Movement, also became influential. By the late 100s, Soviet economic 
and military stagnation and public discontent contributed to the collapse of 
communist governments in Eastern Europe and the end of the Cold War. 19002000 1950The Soviet Union refuses

SETTING T HE STAGE FOR T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION 547
5478.1
Setting the Stage for the Cold 
War and Decolonization
We would consider it our moral duty to lend all support to the ending of 
colonialism and imperialism so that people everywhere are free to mould 
their own destiny. 
—Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indian independence movement leader in the 1920s 
Essential Question:   What was the historical context for the Cold War  
after World War II?
After the global conflict of World War II, the largely unfulfilled hopes for 
greater colonial self-government after World War I were revived. Shastri’s 
anti-imperialist sentiments helped explain how global affairs changed after 
the war ended in 15. Colonies’ desire for independence became intertwined 
with a global ideological conflict between capitalist countries led by the 
United States and communist countries led by the Soviet Union.
Bringing the War to an End
During World War II, the leaders of Great Britain, the United States, and the 
Soviet Union, known as the Big Three , held several meetings to plan for the 
post-war world. Three of these were particularly important. 
The Tehran Conference  During the Tehran Conference  in Iran in 
November 1, the Allies agreed that the Soviet Union would focus on 
freeing Eastern Europe, while Britain and the United States would concentrate 
on Western Europe. In addition, Britain and the United States agreed to a 
Soviet demand to shift some Polish territory to the Soviet Union, which would 
be offset by Poland gaining territory elsewhere, mostly from Germany.
The Yalta Conference  By February 15, the Allies knew that Germany 
was near defeat, but they disagreed about what should happen after Germany’s 
surrender. At the Yalta Conference,  at a resort on the Black Sea, the leaders 
focused on plans for reconstructing Eastern Europe and for defeating Japan. 
• Franklin Roosevelt wanted free, democratic elections in Eastern 
Europe. He also wanted the Soviets to join the war against Japan. 
548 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• Stalin demanded influence over Eastern Europe. Fearful that another 
Napoleon or Hitler would invade Russia from the West, he wanted 
Eastern Europe as a buffer zone. In return for Soviet help against 
Japan, he wanted control of islands claimed by Japan, ports ruled by 
China, and part ownership of a Manchurian railroad.
Roosevelt thought that after years of overseas war, the American public 
was unlikely to support a war against the Soviets over the fate of democracy in 
Eastern Europe. The conference ended with a Soviet pledge to fight Japan, but 
the Soviets offered only vague assurances on free elections in Eastern Europe. 
The Potsdam Conference  The final meeting among leaders of the Big 
Three, the Potsdam Conference, began in July 15 in Germany. Harry 
Truman , who had become president after Roosevelt died on April 12, 
represented the United States. Churchill started the conference but lost his 
position as prime minister in mid-July and was replaced by Clement Atlee. 
Truman insisted on free elections in Eastern Europe. However, by then  
Soviet troops had occupied the region. Stalin refused Truman’s demand. With 
the backing of Soviet power, communists eventually gained control of East 
Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. 
By 15, the United States and the Soviet Union lacked trust in one 
another and had begun the aggressive rhetoric that would become standard 
for four decades following World War II. Potsdam and the earlier conferences 
failed to settle important issues between the world’s major powers. As a result, 
the stage was set for a cold war between countries still devastated by a hot war. 
Shifting Balance of Power
When the war ended in 15, parts of Europe and Asia had been devastated. 
The war resulted in 0 million to 60 million deaths. It destroyed factories, 
roads, bridges, and other structures needed for industrial production. It forced 
millions of people to move. Many were fleeing communism or searching for 
safety and opportunity. 
Massive Destruction in Europe  Wartime losses were not evenly 
distributed throughout Europe. In general, East and Central Europe suffered 
greater losses than did Western Europe. Worst hit were the Soviet Union, 
Poland, and Germany. Each lost between 10 and 20 percent of its population. 
Countries such as Great Britain and France, despite their losses, maintained 
strong traditions of democracy and the rule of law. They still had strong 
educational systems, including outstanding universities. They remained home 
to large, innovative corporations. These advantages provided the foundation 
for Western Europe to become a global leader after the war. However, because 
of the massive physical destruction and population loss in victorious and 
defeated nations, Europe became less influential and powerful in the rest of the 
world, while the United States and the Soviet Union became more powerful. 
Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the destruction caused by World  
War I and World War II. See Topic .8.  
549 SETTING T HE STAGE FOR T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATIONThe U.S.-Soviet Rivalry  In 15, then, the United States was poised to 
become the most powerful country in the world. Of all the major countries 
involved in the war, the United States suffered the least. Heavy fighting 
occurred on U.S. soil, in the Philippines, but the U.S. mainland was 
untouched by attacks. Its industrial base and infrastructure not only remained 
intact but also grew stronger through government-funded military contracts. 
Further, the loss of life in the United States was far lower than in Europe. The  
relative prosperity of the United States allowed it to provide financial aid to 
European countries after the war. This aid program, called the Marshall Plan, 
is described in Topic 8.2.
The United States also had developed atomic weapons and used them 
during the war, making the country even more formidable. The Soviets 
successfully tested an atomic bomb of their own in 1. By the end of the 
10s, only the Soviet Union could challenge the United States in military 
might and political influence. 
Advances During the War  Military research at universities and in private 
companies, often funded by government, resulted in tremendous technological 
developments during World War II. Among the items that were developed 
for, improved, or used more widely by the military were air pressure systems 
for airplane cabins, refrigeration for food, stronger plywood for construction, 
and a variety of plastics for many uses. One of the most important advances 
was the spread of the use of penicillin, which saved the lives of thousands of 
wounded soldiers. Each of these advances would be adapted for civilian use, 
thereby improving the lives of millions of people. 
The Start of the Cold War
The U.S.-Soviet tensions evident at Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam made conflict   
likely. However, the high costs of the war meant that neither superpower 
wanted a full-scale war with the other. Rather, they settled into a cold war,  a 
conflict does not involve direct military confrontation between two or more 
rival states. The Cold War between the superpowers played out in propaganda 
campaigns, secret operations, and an arms race. 
The deadliest results of the Cold War occurred outside the lands of the 
two superpowers. The U.S.-Soviet rivalry led both countries to arm opposing 
sides in conflicts around the world, thereby transforming small civil wars and 
regional conflicts into much larger events. This increased the death tolls and 
level of destruction in these wars.
In the early 150s, the United States and Soviet Union each developed a 
hydrogen bomb  that was much more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped 
on Japan at the end of World War II. The arms race fostered close ties between 
the military and the industries that developed weapons. Before he left office in 
161, President Dwight Eisenhower  expressed his concerns about the U.S.-
Soviet competition for supremacy in nuclear armaments. He warned against 
allowing the military-industrial complex,  the informal alliance between the 
550 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONgovernment and the large defense contractors, to gain too much power. In later 
decades, citizens in many countries expressed similar worries. They began to 
protest the stockpiling of nuclear weapons.
Breakdown of Empires
After World War II, efforts resumed to undermine colonialism. The start of 
World War I had marked the high point of colonial empires. The British, the 
French, and other Europeans had colonized almost all of Africa, India, and 
Southeast Asia, and they dominated China. Empires based in Austria, Turkey, 
and Russia were multiethnic states, but each was dominated by one group, 
leaving others feeling discriminated against. After World War I, the demand for 
self-determination , the idea that each country should choose its own form of 
government and leaders, was spreading. The Austro-Hungary Empire and the 
Ottoman Empire crumbled, restructured into multiple new countries. However, 
in China, India, and throughout Africa, Europeans generally maintained their 
power, even expanding it over territories that had been part of the Ottoman 
Empire. 
During World War II, the leading colonial powers focused on stopping 
Hitler. As a result, the anti-colonial movements probably grew stronger, but 
actual independence made little progress. However, after World War II, the 
foundation was set for the dismantling of colonial empires: 
• In the colonized world, movements for self-determination grew. Often, 
they included both advocates of greater self-rule and proponents of full 
independence.
• World War II had so weakened Great Britain, France, and the other 
colonial powers that they had fewer resources to resist independence. 
• The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union gave 
anti-colonial activists two superpowers to recruit as supporters. 
The successful efforts of people to undermine colonial empires are described 
in Topics 8.5 and 8.6.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“On November 1, 152, the United States successfully detonated “Mike,” the 
world’s first hydrogen bomb, on the Elugelab Atoll in the Pacific Marshall 
Islands. The 10.-megaton thermonuclear device, built upon the Teller-Ulam 
principles of staged radiation implosion, instantly vaporized an entire island 
and left behind a crater more than a mile wide. The incredible explosive 
force of Mike was also apparent from the sheer magnitude of its mushroom  
cloud. . . . Half an hour after the test, the mushroom stretched 60 miles across, 
with the base of the head joining the stem at 5,000 feet.
Three years later, on November 22, 155, the Soviet Union detonated its 
first hydrogen bomb on the same principle of radiation implosion. Both 
superpowers were now in possession of the µhell bomb,’ as it was known by 
many Americans, and the world lived under the threat of thermonuclear war 
for the first time in history.”

8.2
The Cold War
Let us not be deceived—we are today in the midst of a cold war.
—Bernard Baruch, banker and presidential advisor, 1947
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the ideological  
struggle of the Cold War?
After World War II, the democratic United States and the authoritarian Soviet 
Union emerged as the strongest countries in the world. Both countries had 
expanded their territorial control and influence after the war. After the Potsdam 
Conference in Germany in 15, Truman and Stalin soon recognized their 
rivalry for dominance over Europe and Asia. The ideological conflict noted by 
Baruch, the power struggle between capitalism led by the United States and 
communism led by the Soviet Union, was the central global conflict over the 
next 0 years.
&RRSeUDWiRn'esSiWe&RnñicW7Ke8niWeG1DWiRns
Despite ideological differences, the Allies shared a commitment to building 
a new organization to promote peace and prosperity to replace the League of 
Nations. The League had failed for two significant reasons:
• It lacked the support of all the world’s powerful countries, particularly 
the United States.
• It lacked a mechanism to act quickly to stop small conflicts from 
escalating into large ones.
In 1, leaders of the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and 
China discussed the idea of the  United Nations (UN) . The UN was established 
in 15. Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the United Nations with the 
League of Nations. See Topics . and .5.
Rivalry in Economics and Politics
The existence of the United Nations did not prevent tensions from growing 
worse between the Soviet Union and the West. Winston Churchill’s March 
16 speech symbolized the Cold War. Churchill said that “an iron curtain has 
descended across the continent” of Europe. The metaphor of the Iron Curtain 
described the split between Eastern and Western Europe. 
555 THE COLD WARCapitalism and Communism  One difference between the United 
States and the Soviet Union was how they organized their economies. 
• In the United States, Western Europe, and other capitalist countries, 
economic assets, such as farms and factories, were mostly owned 
privately. Hence, private interests determined economic decisions. 
People had the freedom to act in their self-interest. 
• In the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and other communist 
countries, economic assets were owned by the government. The 
system emphasized equality and fairness. 
Democracy and Authoritarianism  A second difference was how 
the rivals organized their political systems. In the United States, people 
chose their elected leaders through free elections. Further, they relied on an 
independent press to provide accurate information about the government 
and political parties to compete for votes. In the Soviet Union, elections 
were not significant, the press was operated by the government, and a single 
party dominated politics.
Criticisms and Similarities  Each side pointed to what it saw as 
flaws in the other. In the United States, people attacked the Soviet system 
for restricting the rights of people to speak and worship freely, to elect 
their own representatives, and to allow businesses to operate efficiently. 
Soviets accused the United States of giving poor people the “freedom 
to starve” and for discriminating against African Americans and other 
minorities. The Soviet Union also stressed its emphasis on women’s 
equality as a difference between its system and that of the United States.
Despite the difference in the U.S. and Soviet models, some analysts 
emphasized their similarities. For example, in both, control of big economic 
decisions was in the hands of groups, either the government or millions of 
corporate shareholders. Further, both countries often acted out of fear of the 
other, which made the military a powerful force in each. 
&RnñicWsin,nWeUnDWiRnDl$σDiUs
Each side wanted to expand its system of thought throughout the world. 
This competition resulted in a long-running battle for influence over the 
opinions of people and alliance with governments. 
The USSR and Its Satellite Countries  The Soviets were determined 
to make the governments of Eastern Europe as much like the Soviet 
government as possible. They therefore directed the countries of Bulgaria, 
East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania to develop five-year 
economic plans focused on developing industry and collective agriculture 
at the expense of consumer products. All political parties other than the 
Communists were outlawed.
These actions allowed the USSR Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
to exploit the Eastern European nations to benefit the Soviets rather than 
556 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONto help those countries grow. The satellite countries —small states that 
are economically or politically dependent on a larger, more powerful 
state²were forced to import only Soviet goods and to export only to the 
Soviet Union. Moreover, the governments of these countries were just as 
dictatorial as the Soviet government. Connect: Create a graphic comparing 
Communist and earlier Western imperialism. See Topic 6.2.
World Revolution  Beginning with the October Revolution of 11, 
the Soviet Union viewed capitalism as a threat to its power. This view was 
enhanced with the concept of world revolution, a belief that organized 
workers would overthrow capitalism in all countries. The Soviets supported 
revolutions and uprisings between 11 and 12 in Germany, Bavaria, 
Hungary, northern Italy, and Bulgaria. Soviet interference elevated 
Western suspicions about Soviet intentions. After World War II, growing 
revolutionary feelings became a serious threat to Western powers and to 
governments in Central and Southern Europe. 
Containment  U.S. diplomat George .ennan worked in the U.S. 
Embassy in Moscow during the 10s and in 16. .ennan believed that the 
Soviet Union would continue to expand its borders and its influence abroad 
if it could. He advocated a policy of containment ²not letting communism 
spread farther. Some politicians criticized .ennan for accepting the status 
quo. They argued for a more aggressive policy of overthrowing existing 
regimes in order to “roll back” the spread of communism.
Truman Doctrine  .ennan’s reports influenced President Harry 
Truman. A speech in 1 outlined the Truman Doctrine , a strong statement 
that the United States would do what it had to do to stop the spread of 
communist influence, specifically in Greece and Turkey. The Soviet Union 
wanted to put military bases in Turkey so it could control the Dardanelles, 
the strait between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. In Greece, left-
wing groups controlled by Communists were close to gaining control of the 
government. Truman pledged U.S. economic and military support to help 
the two countries resist this communist domination.
The Marshall Plan  After World War II, the United States was deeply 
concerned about rebuilding Europe. The United States provided assistance to 
those countries soon after the war ended. However, many U.S. leaders thought 
more was needed to get European allies back on their feet economically. 
Based on the belief that a communist revolution could happen in economically 
unstable nations, the new goal was to rebuild Europe into a prosperous and 
stable region. The Marshall Plan,  enacted in June 1, was designed to 
offer 12 billion in aid to all nations of Europe, including Germany. This 
money would be used to modernize industry, reduce trade barriers, and 
rebuild Europe’s damaged infrastructure. The plan worked. Economic output 
in the countries aided was 5 percent higher in 151 than it had been in 18.
The Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites refused to 
participate in the plan. Instead, in 1, the Soviets developed their own 
557 THE COLD WARplan to help rebuild Eastern Europe²the Council for Mutual Economic 
Assistance (COMECON) . The scope of the organization was narrower 
than that of the Marshall Plan. It was limited primarily to trade and credit 
agreements among the six members. Its impact was modest compared to the 
Marshall Plan.
The Space Race and the Arms Race 
Space Race  In 15, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, 
called Sputnik , into orbit around Earth, inaugurating what become known as 
the Space Race . The United States launched its first satellite in January 158. 
The two nations competed to become the first with a manned satellite orbiting 
Earth and, later, the first to land a human on the moon.

and Space Museum. Source:  Wikimedia Commons
Launch of first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, on 
January 1, 158. 
Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD)  Early in 15, the Soviets tested 
the first intercontinental ballistic missile  ICBM capable of delivering a 
nuclear warhead into U.S. territory. The United States tested a similar missile 
later that same year. Both countries realized that they had become so powerful 
that they had reached a point of mutual assured destruction . That is, regardless 
of who started a war, both would be obliterated by the end of it. Since neither 
side could win a nuclear war, neither side had an incentive to start one. As long 
as both sides kept improving their technology, the balance of terror between 
them would keep the peace²everyone hoped.
The Non-Aligned Movement
Many new African and Asian countries wanted to stay out of the U.S.-Soviet 
Cold War. They wanted an alternative framework for international economic, 
political, and social order²one not dominated by the two superpowers. In 
558 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION155, Indonesia hosted a conference, known as the Bandung Conference after 
the city where it was held, for representatives of these countries. Delegates from 
China, India, and 2 other countries²representing more than half the world’s 
population²passed resolutions condemning colonialism. The impulse that 
prompted the Bandung Conference led countries to formally organize the Non-
Aligned Movement in 161. However, non-aligned countries faced challenges:
• Member states tried to combine support for stronger international 
institutions with efforts to advance their own interests. For example, 
Indian leader Jawaharlal Nehru supported a stronger UN, but he 
opposed its efforts to intervene in the conflict between India and 
Pakistan over control of the region of .ashmir. 
• Member states often became more closely allied with one superpower 
or the other. When war broke out between Somalia and Ethiopia in 
1, the Soviet Union supplied aid to Ethiopia, prompting the United 
States to supply aid to Somalia.

561 THE COLD WARTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   EXPLAIN  THE HISTORICAL  SITUATION  OF 
THE “RED SCARE ”
Communists are sometimes called “reds.” A “red scare” is a period 
during which non-Communists are especially fearful and suspicious 
that Communists are plotting a takeover, often through infiltrating 
government institutions. A red scare happened in the United States in 
the years after World War II. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin 
became the leading voice for hunting down Communist spies and 
infiltrators. He made unfounded allegations against politicians and 
hundreds of civilians, suspecting them of being Communists and 
Soviet spies. In Wheeling, West 9irginia, on February , 150, 
Senator McCarthy gave an infamous speech proclaiming that he had 
a list of members of the Communist Party who were in the U.S. State 
Department.
“The reason why we find ourselves in a position of impotency is not 
because our only powerful potential enemy has sent men to invade 
our shores . . . . but rather because of the traitorous actions of those 
who have been treated so well by this Nation. It has not been the less 
fortunate, or members of minority groups who have been traitorous 
to this Nation, but rather those who have had all the benefits that the 
wealthiest Nation on earth has had to offer . . . . the finest homes, 
the finest college education and the finest jobs in government we can 
give. 
This is glaringly true in the State Department. There the bright young 
men who are born with silver spoons in their mouths are the ones 
who have been most traitorous . . . I have here in my hand a list of 
205 . . . names that were made known to the Secretary of State as 
being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still 
working and shaping policy in the State Department . . .”

;he only thing that kept the *old >ar cold was the mutual deterrence aќorded 
by nuclear weapons.
—Chung  4ong-joon,  South 2orean politician  and business  leader, 2013
Essential Question:  In what ways did both the Soviet Union and the United 
States seeR to maintain influence  during the Cold War?
With the start of the Cold War, new military alliances for mutual protection 
formed in different parts of the world. The threat of nuclear war, as noted 
above by Chung Mong-joon, kept the United States and the Soviet Union from 
starting a war that could end in unprecedented global destruction. But proxy 
wars , such as the ones in .orea and 9ietnam, resulted in millions of deaths. In 
a proxy war, a major power helps bring about a conflict between other nations 
but does not always fight directly. These conflicts underlined the political and 
philosophical divide between the superpowers.
The superpowers faced off in Cuba and several other Central American 
countries as well as in the African country of Angola. The combination of 
military, economic, and nuclear influence across the globe made the world a 
tense place for decades after World War II²the war the two superpowers had 
worked together to end.
Allied Occupation of Germany
The conflict among the Allies after World War II was exemplified by the debate 
over how to occupy the defeated country of Germany. The Allies agreed to 
partition the country among France, Great Britain, the United States, and the 
Soviet Union. The three Western Allies wanted to combine their zones into one 
state under democratic principles.  
Berlin Blockade  The Allies also decided to divide Germany’s capital, 
Berlin, into four zones. The three Western zones would become a free city that 
was located within the Soviet zone of Germany. The Soviets wanted to stop 
these Western plans and control all of Berlin. They set up a blockade of the 
Western zones in Berlin to prevent the West from moving supplies into the area 
by land. The Western Allies did not want to risk a military confrontation with 
the Soviets and ultimately began the Berlin Airlift . Through this operation, 
563 EFFECT S OF T HE COLD WARthe Allies flew supplies into Western zones between February 18 and May 
1, when the Soviets lifted the blockade. 
Two Germanys  After the blockade ended, Germany split into two states. 
West Germany became the Federal Republic of Germany. East Germany 
became the German Democratic Republic. The division of Europe into East 
and West was complete. 
Berlin Wall  As citizens of East Germany saw the prosperity and 
democratic lifestyle of West Germany, many wanted to move to the West. 
Between 1 and 161, about 2.5 million East Germans fled.
However, the East German and Soviet governments were determined to 
keep people in East Germany. They knew that the exodus to the West reflected 
poorly on the communist system, and it was hard on their economy. They 
first set up barbed-wire fences patrolled by guards along the perimeter of East 
Germany and between East and West Berlin. In August 161, they began 
replacing the fences in Berlin with a wall, which became known as the Berlin 
Wall . Between 161 and 18, when the Berlin Wall fell, soldiers killed about 
150 people as they tried to escape over it.
NATO, the Warsaw Pact, and Other Alliances
Only a few years after World War II ended, the Soviet Union dominated the 
Eastern European countries they had occupied during the war. Communist 
governments in those countries²buoyed by support and the direct influence 
of Stalin²subjected their people to the same suppression and economic 
system as the Soviet Union. Many Western European countries feared such a 
dominant communist presence on their doorstep. 
Out of a desire to coordinate their defenses in case of a conflict with 
the Soviets, several Western nations created the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO)  in April 1. The treaty pledged mutual support 
and cooperation within the alliance against conflicts and wars. Its original 
members were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Iceland, 
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United States. 
Membership in this Brussels-based organization expanded considerably in the 
decades after its founding.
The Soviet Union’s response to NATO was the Warsaw Pact , created 
in 155. Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, 
Romania, and the Soviet Union were the original members. Warsaw Pact 
nations combined their armed forces and based their army leaders in Moscow, 
the capital of the Soviet Union. These nations were known as the communist 
bloc.
Two countries with communist political systems successfully resisted 
Soviet control. Albania, located next to Greece, joined the Warsaw Pact but 
withdrew in 168. It became more closely tied to China. Yugoslavia, under the 
authoritarian leadership of Marshall Josip Broz Tito, never joined the Warsaw 
564 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONPact. In the 10s, ethnic divisions caused Yugoslavia to break apart into 
several countries, including Slovenia, Serbia, and Croatia.
Other treaty organizations formed in an attempt to halt the spread of 
communism in other regions:
• In 15, Australia, France, Great Britain, New =ealand, Pakistan, the 
Philippines, Thailand, and the United States formed the Southeast 
Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) . 
• The Central Treaty Organization (CENTO)  was an anti-Soviet 
treaty organization formed by Great Britain, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and 
Turkey to prevent the spread of Communism in the Middle East. The 
United States was not a full member, but it joined CENTO’S military 
committee. 
During the Cold War, the United States formed alliances with more than 0 
states. It was sometimes easier for the United States to influence and negotiate 
through these smaller alliances than through the United Nations.
Proxy Wars
The ideological Cold War was accompanied by hot wars in Asia, Africa, Latin 
America, and the Caribbean. They were called proxy  wars  because the armies 
of smaller countries were proxies, or stand-ins, for the two superpowers. These 
wars often combined specific local issues, such as a battle against colonialism 
or for land reform see Topic 8., with the international conflict over the 
spread of communism. Though proxy wars occurred in small countries, some 
resulted in millions of deaths. 
Two of the biggest confrontations were the .orean War and 9ietnam War 
in Asia. In both instances, the countries were split into northern and southern 
sections. In both countries, a communist government ruled the northern section. 
Korean War  Just as the victorious powers divided Germany after World 
War II, they also divided the .orean Peninsula. The Soviets occupied the north 
while the United States and its allies occupied the south. The Korean War  
150±15 began when North .orea invaded South .orea in an attempt to 
reunite the country under its leadership. In response, the UN voted to defend 
South .orea militarily. The Soviet Union could have vetoed the resolution, 
but its representative was absent during the vote because the Soviet Union was 
boycotting all Security Council meetings in protest over a disagreement about 
China’s seat on the Security Council.
UN military forces supporting the South .oreans came from 16 member 
countries, but the United States provided the largest number and the overall 
commander, General  Douglas MacArthur . The Soviet Union did not send 
troops, but it sent money and weapons to North .orea. The UN forces pushed 
back the North .oreans across the inter-.orean border and drove toward 
North .orea’s border with China. The Chinese, allies of North .orea and 
concerned that the UN forces would try to invade China as well, sent Chinese 
565 EFFECT S OF T HE COLD WARtroops across the border and entered the war against the United States and its 
allies. After three years of fighting and some four million civilian and military 
casualties, the war ended in a stalemate. The two parts of .orea remained 
divided, with a demilitarized zone in between. 
Vietnam War  U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, following the 
Truman policy of containment, sent military advisers to South 9ietnam to 
train the South 9ietnamese army and to prevent a communist takeover by 
North 9ietnam. Eisenhower’s successor, President John F. .ennedy, increased 
the number of advisers from 1,000 to 16,000. Some U.S. citizens believed 
America could not afford to lose a confrontation in 9ietnam. They thought a 
communist victory would weaken U.S. prestige around the world. 
However, the United States was supporting an undemocratic and 
unpopular South 9ietnamese ruler, Ngo Dinh Diem. In 16, Buddhist monk 
Thich Quang Duc publicly set himself on fire in Saigon to protest the South 
9ietnamese government’s favoring of Catholics over Buddhists. His protests 
inspired others. A military coup, with U.S. support, soon overthrew Diem. 
In 16, President Lyndon Johnson  sent more U.S. troops to South 
9ietnam. Johnson believed in the domino theory  —the idea that if one 
country in the region became communist, other countries would soon follow. 
Johnson feared that China and the Soviet Union would bring all of Southeast 
Asia under communist rule. Connect: Trace foreign intervention in Southeast 
Asian affairs through the 9ietnam War. See Topic 6.2.
The Bay of Pigs Crisis  Fidel Castro and other communist revolutionaries 
overthrew the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista in 15. Castro soon set up 
a dictatorship in Cuba. On August 6, 160, the new government started to 
nationalize foreign-owned industries, which was a common communist 
strategy. Cuba nationalized businesses and properties of the national telephone 
and electricity companies Texaco, Esso, and Sinclair oil companies and 6 
sugar mills owned by U.S. firms. As a result of these economic losses for its 
citizens, the United States broke off trade with Cuba and cut diplomatic ties. 
Castro in turn accepted Soviet aid and aligned Cuba’s foreign policy with that 
of the Soviet Union. 
In 161, newly elected U.S. President John F. Kennedy  had grave 
concerns about the presence of a communist country located only 0 miles 
from the coast of Florida. Before .ennedy took office, a group of Cuban exiles 
who opposed Castro had asked for U.S. government backing to invade Cuba 
and overthrow Castro. .ennedy gave his support. The resulting Bay of Pigs  
invasion was a total failure. Even worse for the United States, it cemented the 
Cuba-Soviet alliance.
The Cuban Missile Crisis  In response to the Bay of Pigs, the Soviets 
began to support Cuba with arms and military advisors. Soviet Premier Nikita 
Khrushchev , who came to power after Stalin, saw an opportunity in Cuba. 
In 162 he shipped nuclear missiles to Cuba. .hrushchev felt justified in his 
actions because in the summer of 161 the United States had placed nuclear 
missiles in Turkey, a U.S. ally that shared a border with the Soviet Union. 
566 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn October 162, U.S. intelligence learned that more missiles were on their 
way to Cuba. .ennedy ordered the U.S. Navy to prevent the missiles from 
reaching Cuba. He called his action a “quarantine” because a blockade was 
technically an act of war. Regardless of the term, the two superpowers were on 
a collision course that threatened nuclear war. 
Ultimately, the two leaders pulled back from the brink. .hrushchev 
called back the Soviet ships and removed the missiles that had been delivered 
to Cuba. In return, the United States pledged to quietly remove its missiles 
from Turkey. After this incident, leaders of both countries realized that better 
communication between their countries was needed. In 16, the two countries 
set up a Hot Line , a direct telegraphteleprinter link between the U.S. and 
Soviet leaders’ offices.
Test-Ban Treaty  People worldwide worried about deaths and 
environmental harm from nuclear war or nuclear testing. In 16, the Soviet 
Union, the United States, and more than 100 other states signed the Nuclear 
Test-Ban Treaty . France and China did not sign it. This agreement outlawed 
testing nuclear weapons above ground, underwater, and in space. The goal was 
to cut down the amount of radiation that people would be exposed to as a result 
of weapons testing. Underground testing remained legal. In 168, the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty called on nuclear powers to prevent the spread of 
military nuclear technology and materials to non-nuclear countries.
Angola  The Portuguese colony of Angola in southwest Africa won its 
independence in 15, after 1 years of armed struggle. Like the 9ietnamese, 
the Angolans had to fight a war to end their colonial status. 
However, Angola faced greater ethnic conflict than did 9ietnam. The 
borders of Angola, like those of many newly independent African countries, 
had been set by European colonial powers with little regard for traditional Source:  CIA 162

567 EFFECT S OF T HE COLD WARregions. Rival ethnic groups were thrown together under one government. 
Angola was more a multiethnic empire consisting of three distinct cultural 
groups than a nation-state in which everyone shared a common culture. Each 
group had fought for independence. Each wanted to control the country’s 
lucrative diamond mines. And each was supported by other countries:
• The USSR and Cuba backed the Mbundu tribe.
• South Africa backed the Ovimbundu tribe.
• The United States backed the Bankongo tribe.
Upon independence, civil war broke out. In 2002, after 2 years of fighting, 
the rivals agreed on a cease-fire. However, threats of violence from militant 
separatist groups remained.
Contra War  In Nicaragua in 1, the -year dictatorship by the Somoza 
family was ended by the rebel Sandinistas, who called themselves socialists. 
Two years later, conservative opponents of the Sandinistas, known as Contras, 
tried to overthrow them. From 181 to 188, the Contra War gripped the 
country. Wanting to isolate the Sandinistas, the United States heavily backed 
the Contras with covert support. The Contra War took the lives of tens of 
thousands of Nicaraguans. The war ended after the signing of the Tela Accord 
in 18 and the demobilization of the Contra and Sandinista armies. 
Antinuclear Weapon Movement  
The nuclear arms race spawned a reaction known as the antinuclear weapons 
movement . One of the first such movements developed in Japan in 15 in 
opposition to U.S. testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific Ocean. In 155, 
more than one-third of Japan’s population signed a petition against nuclear 
weapons. In the late 10s and early 180s, the antinuclear weapons movement 
expanded to other countries, particularly to the United States and Western 
Europe. On June 6, 182, some one million people demonstrated in New York 
City against the creation, buildup, and possible use of nuclear weapons.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“The epitaph for the disastrous April 1±1, 161, attempt to overthrow 
communist dictator Fidel Castro by invading Cuba with 1,500 amateur 
soldiers and a handful of piston-engined B-26 ground-attack bombers was 
spoken soon afterward by President John F. .ennedy. µHow could I have 
been so stupid"’ he asked an aide.
A better question might have been, How could the Central Intelligence Agency 
have bungled things so badly" The answer is that the CIA²which planned the 
operation, trained its participants and helped execute its amphibious landings 
and air strikes²performed more amateurishly than the Cuban invaders. But 
the agency’s senior leaders were so enamored of the plan they ignored its 
obvious flaws. Worse, two presidential administrations, numerous legislators, 
and plenty of smart generals and admirals also signed off on the scheme.
Rebel troops and tanks began landing early on April 1. By the evening of 
April 1 the invasion brigade had been crushed by Castro’s armor, heavy

Spread of Communism  
after 1900
The road after the revolution will be longer, the work greater and more arduous. 
—4ao Aedong, 1949 
Essential Question:   How did communism  and land reform affect China and 
other countries?  
The Cold War provided the context in which many countries wrestled with 
the legacies of their past. The combined heritage of feudalism, capitalism, 
and colonialism often resulted in societies with a small class of powerful 
landowners and a large class of peasants who owned little or no land. When 
socialists or communists sought to make more people into landowners, they 
got caught up in the U.S.-Soviet ideological battle. Land reform  was a vital 
issue in China, Iran, 9ietnam, Ethiopia, India, and a number of Latin American 
countries, including Mexico, Bolivia, and 9enezuela. 
Communism in China
In China, the Communists and the Nationalists began fighting for control of 
the country in 12. However, after the Japanese invaded, the two sides agreed 
to focus on fighting them instead of each other. See Topic .5. 
Victory by the Communists  After the defeat of the Japanese in 15, 
the Chinese Civil War resumed. The Communists, led by Mao Zedong , won 
popular support because they redistributed land to peasants, opened schools 
and hospitals, and punished soldiers who mistreated civilians. Peasants saw 
the Communists as more nationalist and less corrupt than the Nationalists. 
In 1, the Communists defeated the Nationalists and set up the People’s 
Republic of China. Mao ordered the nationalization of Chinese industries 
and created five-year plans based on the Soviet model. Like the Soviets, the 
Chinese plans emphasized heavy industry instead of consumer goods. 
Great Leap Forward  In 158, China went through more land reform 
as part of the policy called the Great Leap Forward . Peasant lands were 
organized into communes , large agricultural communities where the state held 
the land, not private owners. Those who protested this policy could be sent to 
“reeducation camps” or killed.
572 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONEven though failing harvests caused severe food shortages, China 
continued to export grain to Africa and Cuba. Mao sought to convince the 
outside world of the success of his economic plans. Some 20 million Chinese 
died from starvation. By 160, the Great Leap Forward was abandoned.
Source:  Wikimedia Commons.
During the Great Leap Forward, 
China set up small-scale backyard 
steel furnaces. However, they 
produced steel of very poor quality, 
and the effort was dropped.
Cultural Revolution  In 166, Mao attempted to reinvigorate China’s 
commitment to communism, an effort called the Cultural Revolution . In 
practice, the Cultural Revolution silenced critics of Mao and solidified his hold 
on power. Its impact on China was similar to the impact of Stalin’s purges 
in the Soviet Union. Mao ordered the Red Guards , groups of revolutionary 
students, to seize government officials, teachers, and others and send them 
to the countryside for reeducation. Reeducation involved performing hard 
physical labor and attending group meetings where Red Guards pressured 
them to admit they had not been revolutionary enough.
Relations with the Soviets  Although China and the Soviet Union were 
both communist states, they were often hostile to each other. From 161 
onward, the two countries skirmished over their border. They also competed 
for influence around the world. For example, Albania, a Soviet satellite, took 
advantage of the split by allying with China against the Soviet Union, thereby 
receiving more autonomy and additional financial aid from China.
Turmoil in Iran
The modern country of Iran  fell under foreign domination in the late 1th 
century. Britain and Russia fought to control the area. The competition grew 
even keener when oil was discovered in Iran in the early 20th century .
)oreiJn ,nfluence  Early in World War II, the leader of Iran considered 
supporting Hitler’s Nazi regime. Determined not to let that happen, Russia and 
Britain invaded Iran. They forced the leader to abdicate power to his young 
573 SPREAD OF CO MMU NISM AFTER 1900 573son, Shah Muhammad  Reza Pahlavi . They kept their forces in Iran until the 
end of the war.
Iranian nationalists objected to the new shah as a puppet of Western powers. 
In 151, they forced him to flee the country. Two years later, Iran selected 
Mohammad Mosaddegh  as prime minister. He vowed to nationalize the oil 
companies. The United States and Great Britain engineered an overthrow of 
the democratically chosen Mosaddegh and returned the shah to power. The 
shah ran an authoritarian regime that relied on a ruthless secret police force.
Land Reform in the White Revolution  Despite his harsh rule, the 
shah instituted several progressive reforms, known as the White Revolution 
because they came without bloodshed. They included recognizing women’s 
right to vote, creating a social welfare system, and funding literacy programs 
in villages.
The most important reform dealt with land ownership. The shah wanted 
to undercut the power of traditional landowners and increase his popularity 
among peasants. Under his plan, the government bought land from landlords 
and resold it at a lower price to peasants. The program helped many peasants 
become first-time landowners, but it failed to reach a majority of peasants. 
Many Iranians²both landowners who had been forced to sell their land 
and frustrated peasants who received nothing²opposed the land reforms. 
Religious conservatives opposed modernizing the country, particularly 
changing the relationship between men and women. Advocates for greater 
democracy opposed the shah’s harsh rule. 
The Iranian Revolution  In 1, a revolution toppled the shah. Many 
Iranians supported the revolution because they vividly remembered the 
overthrow of the Mosaddegh government in 15. The leaders to emerge from 
the revolution, though, were ones who rejected the shah’s secular worldview 
for one that viewed Islam as a key part of the individual-state relationship. The 
new government was a  theocracy , a form of government in which religion 
is the supreme authority. The new government was headed by a cleric and 
a Guardian Council, a body of civil and religious legal experts who were 
responsible for interpreting the constitution and making sure all laws complied 
with shariah Islamic law. The clergy had the right to approve or disapprove 
anyone who ran for office. Iran opposed Western policies in the Middle East 
and the state of Israel. 
Land Reform in Latin America
Throughout Latin America, leaders saw the concentration of land ownership as 
a barrier to progress. Hence, as countries freed themselves from colonialism, 
they considered land reform. Mexico’s effort dates back to the 10s, but much 
of the land reform in Latin America took place in the 160s or later. 
Venezuela  In 9enezuela, for example, the government redistributed 
some five million acres of land. Some of the land was state-owned and not 
previously under cultivation, while other pieces of land were seized from large 
574 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONlandowners. The land reform, begun with a 2001 law, was not popular with the 
landowners who claimed that the state seized their property while it was under 
cultivation. Additional problems arose from illegal squatters who moved in to 
settle on lands that were not scheduled for land reform. Land reform efforts had 
political repercussions as well those who benefitted were more willing to vote 
for the government instituting the reforms, while those from whom land was 
confiscated tended not to support the states that seized it. Land reform in Latin 
America varied in its details in each country, shaped partly by environmental 
factors, partly by a legacy from colonialism, and partly by the ideology of the 
rulers instituting the reforms. 
Guatemala  A democratically elected government under Jacob Arbenz 
in the Central American country of Guatemala began efforts at land reform. 
Feeling threatened, the United Fruit Company lobbied the U.S. government to 
remove the Arbenz. In 15, he was overthrown. 
Source:  Diego Rivera, Glorious Victory,  15. Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow, Russia. Wikimedia Commons
The U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles called the overthrow of Guatemala’ s government a 
“glorious victory for democracy.” Diego Rivera used this phrase ironically for the title of his mural 
condemning the action. Rivera portrayed Dulles holding a bomb that featured the face of U.S. President 
Dwight Eisenhower.
Land Reform in Asia and Africa
Vietnam  During World War II, Japan occupied 9ietnam, which France 
still claimed as a colony. At the end of the war in 15, 9ietnam declared 
independence from Japanese and French control. 9ietnam was an agricultural 
society. A few people controlled most of the land. Communists vowed to seize 
land from the large landowners and redistribute it among the peasants. This 
pledge won them great support among peasants. When Communists took 
power in the north, they carried out their policies²sometimes violently. In 
South 9ietnam, the government was slow to implement land reform, which 
was one reason it remained unpopular.
575 SPREAD OF CO MMU NISM AFTER 1900 Ethiopia  Other than a short period from 16 to 11 when it was 
under Italian occupation, Ethiopia had remained an independent country, but 
it suffered problems similar to those of many colonies. During World War 
II, exiled Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie  returned to power. He aligned the 
country with the western powers after the war, and Ethiopia enjoyed economic 
success based largely on its coffee trade. This led to western-style political and 
cultural reforms. Selassie was unable to effectively implement land reforms 
in Ethiopia. By the 160s, the country was souring on his leadership. Many 
people saw him as a pawn of U.S. imperialism. 
In 1, a group of military and civilian leaders deposed Selassie. One 
of the primary figures was Mengistu Haile Mariam , an Ethiopian native 
and major in the military. He ordered the assassination of 60 former regime 
officials. The new government declared itself socialist and received aid and 
weapons from the Soviet Union and other communist countries. Famine, failed 
economic policies, and rebellion marred Mengistu’s leadership. By 11, he 
had resigned and fled to =imbabwe.
India  Southern Asia had been under British rule since 1858. That changed 
in 1. Mahatma Gandhi had led the independence movement against England 
since the 120s, but it wasn’t until after World War II that India became 
independent. India was partitioned in 1, creating two countries: Pakistan 
and India. Pakistan was overwhelmingly Muslim, and India was largely Hindu. 
Both countries struggled to establish their new relationship and economies. 
India undertook economic reforms. It instituted land reforms and tried to 
redistribute some land to the landless, abolish the overwhelming power of rent 
collectors, protect land renters, and promote cooperative farming. The results 
were mixed. However, in .erala, a series of policies had some success: 
• 160: The state passed land reform, but they were overturned by courts.
• 16: Tenant won the right to purchase land from landowners.
• 16: New laws allow tenants to become full owners of land.
• 1: Laws provide for fixed hours of work and minimum wages.
Despite the popularity of the land reform program, the Indian central government 
took direct rule of .erala in order to slow down or reverse the program.

Decolonization after 1900
From its inception, South Vietnam was only considered to  
be an outpost in the war against communism. 
—Nguyen  Cao 2y (1930–2011)
Essential Question:  How did people pursue independence after 1900?
In the 20th century, nationalist groups and leaders challenged colonial rule 
not only through land reform but also through political negotiation, as in India,  
and armed struggle, as in Angola See Topic 8.. Struggles for independence 
after World War I and the failure of many independence movements added 
to anticolonial sentiments during World War  II. Empires became politically 
unacceptable. European powers struggled to hold onto their colonies. Notions 
of freedom born of World War II rhetoric helped speed up decolonization. 
That process coincided with the Cold War and the development of the United 
Nations. Nguyen Cao .y, a South 9ietnamese military and political leader, 
noted above that his country’s war was part of the Cold War.
Movements for Autonomy: India and Pakistan
The drive for Indian self-rule began in the 1th century with the foundation of 
the Indian National Congress. Its leader in 120 was Mohandas Gandhi. Hindu 
and Muslim groups, united by their desire to get rid of the British, supported 
the independence movement in South Asia. The National Congress’s tactics 
included mass civil disobedience, and it remained a powerful governmental 
force after Indian independence. The Muslim League , founded in 106, 
advocated a separate nation for Indian Muslims.
Not all Indian leaders agreed with Gandhi’s nonviolent, noncooperation 
movement or his call for unity between Muslims and Hindus. However, 
they put aside their differences until after World War II. Then leaders again 
demanded independence. 
After the war, Britain grew weaker as India’s fighting abilities grew 
stronger. When Britain failed to follow through on promises for more rights 
for Indians, Indian people increased their protests for full independence from 
British rule. The Royal Indian Navy Revolt in 16 was instrumental in 
bringing Britain to the realization it could no longer rule India. As a result of 
580 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONeconomic pressures from India and from its own sluggish postwar recovery, 
Britain was ready to negotiate independence in South Asia. 
'iYision anG Conflict  Muslims feared living in an independent India 
dominated by Hindus. Distrust between Muslims and Hindus dated back 
centuries to the 8th century, when Muslims invaded Hindu kingdoms in 
northern India. Muslims campaigned for an independent Muslim country²
Pakistan. India and Pakistan both gained independence in 1 . 
Decolonization in Ghana and Algeria
Britain agreed to negotiate independence for its West African colony of the Gold 
Coast, just as it had for its colonies in South Asia. The Gold Coast combined 
with the former British Togoland to form Ghana, the first sub-Saharan African 
country to gain independence in the 20th century. The new country of Ghana 
was smaller in area than the historic kingdom of the same name. Negotiations 
led by the United Nations helped bring about Ghana’s independence in 15. 
Its first president, Kwame Nkrumah , took office in 160. 
Ideas from modern nation-states influenced Ghanaian nationalism. 
Nkrumah emulated nationalistic traditions he learned during his time in the 
United States and Britain. For example, Nkrumah constructed a national 
narrative that centered on having a historical past of glory and rich tradition, 
founding fathers, a currency, a flag, an anthem, museums, and monuments. He 
was responsible for numerous public works and development projects, such

581 DECOLONIZATION AFTER 1900 581as hydroelectric plants. However, some critics accused him of running the 
country into debt and allowing widespread corruption²an economic pattern 
that often happened in later African dictatorships. In 16, Nkrumah claimed 
dictatorial powers when the voters agreed to a one-party state , with him as 
party leader.
Nkrumah strongly advocated Pan-Africanism, a term with multiple 
meanings. In the 1th century, American and British abolitionists called their 
plans to return freed men and women to their homes in Africa Pan-Africanism 
or Africa for Africans. The country of Liberia was founded on this vision. In 
the second half of the 20th century, for some Africans, the term Pan-Africanism 
meant a celebration of unity of culture and ideas throughout the continent. 
These Pan-Africanists rejected intervention by former colonial powers. 
In keeping with his vision of Pan-Africanism, Nkrumah founded the 
Organization of African Unity (OAU)  in 16. However, three years later, a 
military coup overthrew Nkrumah’s government and expelled many foreigners 
from the country. Not until 2000 would Ghana witness a peaceful transfer of 
civilian power from one elected president to another.
Algeria  In northern Africa, the French colony of Algeria endured far 
more violence than Ghana before becoming independent. Mounting social, 
political, and economic crises in Algeria resulted in political protests. The 
French government responded with restrictive laws and violence.
Many Algerians, driven by feelings of nationalism, campaigned for 
independence after World War II. The Algerian War for Independence  began 
in 15, and it involved many groups. Because so many French people lived 
in Algeria as settlers, the French government considered Algeria a part of 
France and was adamant that it could not become a separate country. The FLN 
National Liberation Front led the Algerian movement for independence. 
The FLN sought self-determination through guerrilla techniques against half 
a million French forces sent to Algeria. While French military casualties were 
relatively low, hundreds of thousands of Algerians died in the war, often in 
violent street-by-street battles. French historian Pierre 9idal-Naquet confessed 
that there were “hundreds of thousands of instances of torture” by the French 
military in Algeria. 
The Algerian conflict caused sharp divisions in France. The French 
Communist Party, powerful at the time, favored Algerian independence. 
9iolence broke out in cities throughout France. In 158, French President 
Charles de Gaulle  had a new mandate for expanded presidential power under 
the constitution of the new Fifth Republic. De Gaulle planned the steps through 
which Algeria would gain independence. He then went straight to the people 
of France and Algeria to gain approval of his plan in a referendum, thereby 
bypassing the French National Assembly. 
However, with the coming of independence in 162, war broke out again 
in Algeria. Thousands of pro-French Algerians and settlers fled the country. 
The influx of these refugees into France created housing and employment 
582 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONproblems as well as increased anti-immigration sentiment. 9iolence in Algeria 
left between 50,000 and 150,000 dead at the hands of FLN and lynch mobs. 
The first president of the new Algerian Republic was overthrown in 
165 in a military coup led by his former ally. The National Liberation Front 
continued in power under different leadership, making Algeria a single-party 
state for a number of years. The FLN maintained a socialist authoritarian 
government that did not tolerate dissent. Meanwhile, the government led a 
drive for modernization of industry and collectivization of agriculture.
Algerian Civil War  In 11, violence again surfaced in Algeria, this time 
in reaction to one-party rule. The Islamic Salvation Front won the first round 
in an election that was then canceled. A bloody Algerian Civil War  followed 
11±2002, during which the FLN continued in control. The army chose 
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in 1. In his second term, he attempted to 
be more inclusive of insurgents, although suicide bombings continued. In 
2011, the military state of emergency, in place since 12, was finally lifted in 
response to protests in the wake of major uprisings in nearby states, including 
Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.
Comparing Ghana and Algeria  Both Ghana and Algeria experienced 
growing pains under military rule. The main struggles were between those 
who favored multiparty states and those who favored single-party socialism. 
Ghana created a new constitution in 12, easing the transfer of power 
between elected governments. One point of national pride was that a Ghanaian 
leader, .ofi Annan, became UN Secretary General in 1. In Algeria, by 
contrast, religious tensions grew worse. As in other countries in North Africa 
and the Middle East, a growing right-wing Islamist movement that was willing 
to use violence challenged the power of mainstream Muslims. In 12, an 
Islamist assassinated Algeria’s president. As in Egypt and Turkey, the military 
responded by repressing Islamic fundamentalists. In 1, Algeria banned 
political parties that were based on religion.
Negotiated Independence in French West Africa
As Britain negotiated independence with its African colonies, France did the 
same with its colonies in French West Africa. These included Senegal, the 
Ivory Coast, Niger, Upper 9 olta, and other territories. France had controlled 
them since the late 1800s with small military forces. France used indirect rule, 
which relied on local chiefs, existing governments, and other African leaders 
to maintain stability. 
Over the years, France invested in West Africa, building railroads, 
advancing agricultural development, and benefitting in trade revenue that 
grew substantially. But by the mid-150s, various African political parties 
democratic, socialist, and communist and leaders arose in French West 
Africa. By 15, many of the French West African countries had negotiated 
their independence from France.
583 DECOLONIZATION AFTER 1900Nationalism and Division in Vietnam
World War II interrupted France’s long colonial rule in Indochina, but France 
reoccupied the southern portion of 9ietnam when the war ended. A bloody 
struggle began against the forces of Ho Chi Minh , the communist leader of 
North 9ietnam. He appealed to nationalist feelings to unite the country under 
a single communist government. 
France responded by attempting to reestablish its colonial rule, sparking 
a 9ietnamese war of independence that lasted until 15. The peace treaty 
split the country into North and South 9ietnam, with elections planned for 
156 that would reunite the country. However, many in South 9ietnam, along 
with the United States, opposed the Communists and feared Ho would win the 
election. No election took place. 
War broke out between the communist North and the South. U.S. military 
troops supported the South. South 9ietnamese who supported the Communists, 
known as Viet Cong , fought a guerrilla war against U.S. troops.
As the 9ietnam War worsened, American military involvement and 
casualties grew. In response, the antiwar movement became more vocal. 
President Richard Nixon began to withdraw U.S. troops in 11 the last 
troops left in 15. North 9ietnam quickly gained control of South 9ietnam. 
It is estimated that the 9ietnam War resulted in between one million and 
two million deaths, including about 58,000 Americans. It also destabilized 
Southeast Asia. Communists soon won control of Laos and Cambodia, but the 
spread of communism stopped there. 
Beginning in the 180s, 9ietnam introduced some market-based economic 
reforms. In following years, 9ietnam and the United States reestablished trade 
and diplomatic relations. Connect: Write an outline connecting 9ietnam’s

Struggles and Compromise in Egypt
Having long been under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt became 
a nominally independent kingdom in 122. However, the British retained some 
of the same treaty rights there that they had held under their mandate following 
World War I. A 16 Anglo-Egyptian treaty allowed more Egyptian autonomy. 
Still, it also allowed the British to keep soldiers in Egypt to protect the Suez 
Canal. The British army continued to influence Egyptian internal affairs. 
Nasser  Following World War II, Egypt became one of six founding 
members of the Arab League, which grew to 22 member states. In 152, 
General Gamal Abdel Nasser , along with Muhammad Naguib, overthrew 
the king and established the Republic of Egypt. Naguib became its first 
president Nasser its second. Nasser was a great proponent of Pan-Arabism, a 
movement promoting the cultural and political unity of Arab nations. Similar 
transnational movements would attempt to unite all Africans Pan-Africanism 
and all working people communism.
584 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONNasser’s domestic policies blended Islam and socialism. He instituted 
land reform, transforming private farms into socialist cooperatives that would 
maintain the existing irrigation and drainage systems and share profits from 
crops. He nationalized some industries and businesses, including foreign-
owned banks, taking them over and running them as state enterprises. However, 
Nasser touched off an international crisis when he nationalized the Suez Canal.
The Suez Crisis  Built by Egyptian laborers²thousands of whom died 
while working on the project²with money from French investment between 
185 and 186, the Suez Canal had been under lease to the French for 
 years. To the Egyptians, this lease symbolized colonial exploitation, which 
Nasser pledged to fight. In addition, the British owned interests in the canal, 
which they administered jointly with the French. In 156, Nasser seized the 
canal, and Israel invaded Egypt at the behest of Britain and France. The two 
European countries then occupied the area around the canal, claiming they 
were enforcing a UN cease-fire. However, the United States and the Soviet 
Union opposed British and French actions and used the United Nations to 
broker a resolution to the Suez Crisis .
The removal of foreign troops was followed by an agreement for the canal 
to become an international waterway open to traffic of all nations under the 
sovereignty of Egypt. The UN deployed peacekeepers to the Sinai Peninsula 
in Egypt. Britain, France, and Israel were not happy with the interference 
of the United States in the Suez Crisis, but U.S. efforts led to a peaceful 
compromise. The incident also was an example of a nation maintaining a non-
aligned position between the United States and the Soviet Union²the two 
superpowers in the Cold War. 
Independence and Civil War in Nigeria
The western African country of Nigeria, the most populous state on the 
continent, gained independence from Britain in 160. The Biafran Civil War  
began in 16 when the Igbos, a Westernized, predominantly Christian tribe 
in the southeastern oil-rich Niger River Delta area, tried to secede from the 
northern -dominated government. The Igbos sought autonomy because of 
targeted attacks against them by the Hausa-Fulani Islamic group in the north. 
They declared themselves an independent nation called Biafra. 
The Igbos’ secession movement failed, and Biafra ceased to exist when the 
war ended, in 10. Nigeria granted amnesty to a majority of Igbo generals, 
but civilian government did not return. A series of military coups with generals 
in command of the government continued until the 1 election of Olusegun 
Obasanjo, who presided over a democratic civilian government called the 
Fourth Republic of Nigeria.
In an effort to prevent tribalism from destroying the country, the 
government established a federation of 6 states with borders that cut across 
ethnic and religious lines. However, friction continued between Christian 
Yoruba, Igbo groups in the south, and Islamic groups in the northern states. 
585 DECOLONIZATION AFTER 1900The constitution of Nigeria permitted states to vote for a dual legal system of 
secular law and shariah. Eleven states voted for this option. In an additional 
effort to discourage ethnic strife, the constitution encouraged intermarriage 
among the ethnic groups.
Problems remained in the Niger River Delta, which had rich oil deposits. 
Citizens complained that the national government exploited oil resources 
without returning wealth to the region. Also, they contended that the oil 
companies had polluted their lands and rivers. Militants set fire to oil wells and 
pipelines in protest.
Canada and the “Silent Revolution” in Quebec 
Quebec is the largest of Canada’s provinces, and its history is deeply rooted in 
French culture. France’s North American colonial territory in the early 100s 
spanned from Quebec to the Gulf of Mexico. By the late 100s, England 
controlled what was called New France, beginning a cultural and political 
divide in Quebec. People in New France were mainly Catholic, while the 
English-speaking parts of Britain’s Canadian colony were mainly Protestant.
The Quebecois historically aligned themselves with France rather than 
England. Over the centuries, efforts to create a separate independent state have 
flared up²sometimes with violent results. The Quiet Revolution  of the 160s 
involved much political and social change in Quebec, with the Liberal Party 
gaining power and reforming economic policies that led to further desires 
for separation from the rest of British-controlled Canada. French Canadian 
nationalism expanded, and splinter groups adopted extreme tactics, including 
terrorist bombings that began in 16. Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, 
a native of Quebec, was able to preserve the country’s unity. Later, in 15, a 
referendum to make Quebec an independent nation failed by a narrow margin.

NEWLY INDE PENDENT STATE S589

Newly Independent States
0ndia is free but she has not achie]ed unity, only a fissured and broken freedom 
—Sri Aurobindo  (1872–1950)
Essential Question:  What political changes led to territorial,  demographic,  
and nationalist developments and the economic shifts that resulted?
As imperialistic powers handed over governmental control to their former 
colonies, they often created new states. Between 15 and 2000, the number of 
independent states in the world more than doubled, from approximately 5 to 
around 10. The boundaries of the new states often led to conflicts, population 
displacement, and resettlement. In India, as lamented by Sri Aurobindo, an 
Indian nationalist and philosopher, the country was partitioned into Hindu India 
and Muslim Pakistan. Later, Pakistan divided again, creating Bangladesh. In 
the Middle East, the newly created Israel displaced Palestinian residents. 
Newly independent countries often instituted strong policies to promote 
economic development. At the same time, migrants from the newly 
independent countries kept alive cultural and economic ties as they migrated 
to the colonizing countries, usually to the large cities.
Israel’s Founding and Its  
Relationships with  Neighbors
The Zionist movement originated in the 180s from reaction to the Dreyfus 
Affair. See Topic 5.1. Theodore Herzl, a Hungarian Jewish intellectual and 
journalist, used the affair as evidence that assimilation of Jews into European 
society was failing to provide safety and equal opportunity. At the First =ionist 
Congress in 18, he urged the creation of a separate Jewish state. 
Birth of Israel  =ionists hoped that the new state could be established in 
Palestine because that was where their ancestors had lived. In modern times, 
Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, and most of its inhabitants were 
Arabs who practiced Islam. In a new state, =ionists argued, Jews could be free 
of persecution. In 11, during World War I, the British government issued 
the Balfour Declaration, which favored the establishment in Palestine of a 
“national home” for the Jewish people. However, British Foreign Secretary 
Arthur James Balfour wrote that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice 
the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.”
590 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe situation was complicated because British officer T. E. Lawrence, 
known as “Lawrence of Arabia,” promised certain Arabs an independent state 
as well. The British Foreign Office hoped that Arabs would rise up against the 
Ottoman Empire, which would make it easier to defeat during World War  I. 
The Balfour Declaration promised civil and religious rights to non-Jews in 
Palestine, but the supporters of the Arabs did not trust the British. 
In 118, after World War I, Britain was given a mandate over former 
Ottoman lands in the Middle East. Soon =ionists began to immigrate to 
Palestine from Europe and from other Middle Eastern areas. As immigration 
increased, the Arabs in the area protested their loss of land and traditional 
Islamic way of life. 
World War II and the deaths of six million Jews in the Holocaust provided 
another impetus for Jewish immigration. The fate of the European Jews 
brought worldwide sympathy for the survivors. Britain, trying to hold the line 
on Jewish immigration in the face of Arab opposition, turned the matter over 
to the United Nations. As in India, leaders hoped that partition would bring 
peace and stability. In 18, after the UN divided Palestine into Jewish and 
Arab sections, the Jewish section declared itself to be a new country: Israel.
Multiple Wars  War broke out immediately between Israel, which had 
support from the United States, and the Palestinians, who had support from 
neighboring Arab countries. Arab forces from Syria, Jordan then called 
Transjordan, Lebanon, and Iraq invaded Israel. After several cease-fires, the 
Israeli army won, and an armed truce was declared. Immediately after the 
truce, about 00,000 Palestinians became refugees, living in camps near the 
Israeli border. Three other Israeli-Palestinian wars followed:
• In 156, Israel, with support from France and Great Britain, invaded 
Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, in part to liberate the Suez Canal, which the 
Egyptian government had nationalized under Gamal Abdel Nasser’s 
economic programs See Topic 8.5. Following international protests, 
Israel and its allied forces were ordered to withdraw from Egypt. 
• In the Six-Day War  of 16, Israel fought on three fronts at once. 
Israel gained the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank and East 
Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. 
• In the Yom Kippur War of 1, Israel repelled a surprise invasion by 
Egypt and Syria. 
Israeli-Egyptian Peace  After 0 years of conflict between Israel and 
its Arab neighbors, U.S. President Jimmy Carter mediated the Camp David 
Accords , a peace agreement between Prime Minister Menachem Begin of 
Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt. However, the Palestinians and 
several Arab states rejected the 1 peace treaty. The Palestinian Liberation 
Organization (PLO) and its longtime leader Yasser Arafat wanted the return 
of occupied lands and the creation of an independent nation of Palestine. 
591 NEWLY INDE PENDENT STATE S591Ongoing Violence  In the 21st century, the peace process became more 
complicated when the Palestinians split into two factions. The Fatah faction 
controlled the West Bank. The Hamas faction controlled Gaza. Security 
concerns led the Israeli government to implement tighter border controls on 
the West Bank and on Gaza. These controls, amounting to economic sanctions, 
severely restricted normal activity for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians 
and fomented anger. Israel further angered Palestinians by approving new 
settlements on lands it had occupied during previous wars, lands Palestinians 
considered theirs. 
Without a peace process, violence continued. Between 2000 and 201,  
over ,000 Palestinian and over 1,000 Israelis were killed. Many countries in 
the Middle East remained hostile to United States over its support of Israel.  1947UN Plan of Division for Palestine

After World War II, 9ietnam’s neighbor Cambodia pressured France to grant 
it independence in 15. Cambodia’s royal family continued to head the 
government and tried to maintain its status as a non-aligned nation during the 
first two decades of the Cold War. However, Cambodia was eventually drawn 
into the 9ietnam War.
Following the 9ietnam War, a communist guerrilla organization called 
the Khmer Rouge , under the leadership of Pol Pot, overthrew the right-wing 
government of Cambodia. Once in power, Pol Pot and the .hmer Rouge 
imposed a ruthless form of communism, following the Chinese model of 
“cultural revolution” that targeted intellectuals and dissenters. The slaughter 
592 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONand famine that followed took more than two million lives²about one-quarter 
of the country’s population. Mass graves of victims from the “killing fields” 
of Cambodia continued to be discovered in the countryside and jungles for 
decades afterward. Connect: Create a graphic organizer comparing the tactics 
of the .hmer Rouge under Pol Pot with that of Joseph Stalin. See Topic ..
In 1, 9ietnamese troops invaded Cambodia to support opponents of 
Pol Pot and the .hmer Rouge. At the end of the ensuing war, the 9ietnamese 
took control of the government in Cambodia and helped the country to regain 
some stability, even as some fighting continued and hundreds of thousands 
of refugees fled the country. In 18, 9ietnamese forces completed their 
withdrawal from Cambodia. A peace agreement reached in 11 allowed free 
elections, monitored by the United Nations. Prince Norodom Sihanouk became 
a constitutional monarch, and the country developed a democratic government 
with multiple political parties and aspects of a market economy.
India and Pakistan Become Separate Countries
In 1, the British divided colonial India into two independent countries: a 
mostly Hindu India and a mostly Muslim Pakistan. India’s population was 
about 10 times larger than Pakistan’s. In both countries, women had the right 
to vote. 
The partition of the colony was chaotic, and violence broke out along 
religious lines. At least 10 million people moved: Hindus and Sikhs fled their 
homes in Pakistan to resettle in India, and Muslims fled India for Pakistan. In 
the political turmoil, between 500,000 and one million people died.

593 NEWLY INDE PENDENT STATE SAfter partition, Pakistani-India distrust grew. While India became the 
world’s largest democracy, Pakistan had both elected leaders and authoritarian 
military rulers. Moderates in both countries confronted powerful conservative 
religious movements that opposed compromise with the other country . 
.ashPir Conflict  One persistent tension between India and Pakistan 
was over Kashmir , a border region in the mountainous north. At the time of 
partition, most people in .ashmir were Muslims, but its leader was a Hindu. 
Therefore, both Pakistan and India claimed .ashmir. At times the rivalry there 
broke out into armed conflict. The tension between the two countries became 
more significant after each began developing nuclear weapons. Eventually, 
India controlled about 5 percent of the .ashmir region, Pakistan controlled 
about 5 percent, and China controlled about 20 percent. 
Women Gain Power in South Asia
In some newly emerging countries, women became heads of state. Often, they 
replaced their fathers or husbands. In India and Pakistan, women won the right 
to vote in 1.
Sri Lanka  The world’s first female prime minister was Sirimavo 
Bandaranaike . She won that position in 160 in Ceylon later Sri Lanka. Her 
husband was assassinated in office in 15, and Bandaranaike ran for office to 
fill his seat. She continued her husband’s socialist economic policies. But in 
165, with a sagging economy, she was voted out of office. Five years later, 
she returned to power and instituted much more radical policies, including land 
reforms, restrictions on free enterprise, and a new constitution that changed 
the country’s name to Sri Lanka. While some of her reforms succeeded, the 
economy stalled again, and in 1, she was again voted out of office. 
Bandaranaike remained active in Sri Lankan politics. Her children became 
leaders as well. When her daughter Chandrika became the country’s first female 
president in 1, she appointed her mother again to the role of prime minister.  
India  In 166, two years after the death of India’s first prime minister, 
Jawaharlal Nehru, his only child, Indira Gandhi,  became India’s leader. She 
was not related to Mohandas Gandhi. She was underestimated at first but 
proved to be effective, distancing herself in some ways from her father’s old-
guard advisors and making political and economic moves to strengthen India’s 
economy. War with Pakistan took a toll on the economy, though India won the 
conflict with the help of military support from the Soviet Union. 
Indira Gandhi became a revered leader in India, though further economic 
strife would undermine her popularity in the ensuing years. High inflation and 
growing poverty threatened her rule. She declared a national emergency in 15 
and jailed many opposition leaders. Her 20-point economic program proved 
successful, alleviating inflation, reforming corrupt laws, and increasing national 
production. But some of her policies were unpopular with the people of India 
despite the economic gains. In 1, Gandhi lost in the elections. She returned 
to power as prime minister in 180 but was assassinated in 18.
594 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONPakistan  Pakistan elected Benazir Bhutto  prime minister in 188. Her 
father had also served as prime minister. She was the first elected female leader 
of a majority Muslim country. Bhutto struggled to improve Pakistan’s economy 
and reduce its poverty. Corruption charges dogged her and her husband. Bhutto 
won election to two nonconsecutive terms  and then went into exile from 1 
until 200. Shortly after she returned to Pakistan, an assassin killed her .
Tanzania Modernizes
Tanganyika gained its independence from Britain in 161, later becoming the 
United Republic of Tanzania. Its first president, Julius Nyerere , instituted 
African socialist political and economic ideas—summarized in the Arusha 
Declaration of 16. It was an egalitarian approach based on cooperative 
agriculture. Literacy campaigns, free education, and collective farming were 
key components of what Nyerere called ujamaa  Swahili for “familyhood”. 
He also advanced the country’s economic independence away from foreign 
aid. Economic hardships challenged Nyerere’s leadership for years, as did 
conflicts with Uganda and its leader Idi Amin. Though personally popular, 
Nyerere could not pull Tanzania out of poverty. He resigned the presidency in 
185 but remained an important social leader until his death in 1.
Emigration from Newer Countries to Older Ones
People from these newly independent countries sometimes moved to the former 
colonial powers. For example, large numbers of refugees and immigrants from 
Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh moved to London after the chaos of World 
War II and other conflicts. London was a metropole ²a large city of a former 
colonial ruler. Similarly, 9ietnamese, Algerians, and West Africans migrated 
to Paris and other cities in France, and Filipinos migrated to the United States. 
Many migrants found jobs in the medical field. Others worked on railroads, in 
foundries, and in airports. In this way, economic and cultural ties between the 
colonial power and newly independent countries remained strong.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“At the turn of the 160s . . . a state-sponsored agency that recruited workers 
from the French Antilles, and the lack of economic opportunities throughout 
sub-Saharan African nations spurred a large-scale working class labor 
migration to Paris. However, this postwar labor migration occurred in the 
midst of changing mentalité  attitudes. The attributes of colonialism had 
recently been challenged . . . .
However, when Antilleans >people from an archipelago in the Caribbean@ and 
sub-Saharan Africans migrated to France in the 160s, their former colonial 
status still determined their social conditions, especially in the labor and 
housing markets. As the Antillean writer Franooise Ega who lived in France 
during the period observes, µthe French government and society perceive all 
Polish people as agricultural workers, all Algerians as unskilled construction 
workers, and all Antillean women as maids.’ Although race, gender, and 
ethnicity structure the labor landscape, only offering people of African 
descent menial worker, household employee, or lower rank tertiary worker 
positions, Antilleans and sub-Saharan Africans had migrated to France 
with clear-cut professional goals they desired decent wages, congenial and 
respectful treatment, and the possibility of receiving a job promotion related 
to their hard work.”

Global Resistance to Established 
Power Structures
>hat diќerence does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless, 
whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism 
or the holy name of liberty and democracy? 
—4ohandas  .andhi (189–1948)
Essential Question:   What were differing reactions  to e_isting power 
structures after 1900?
The conflicts of the 20th century affected newly independent states and long-
established ones. Some of the most successful challenges to existing order, 
such as the one led by Mohandas Gandhi, used nonviolence. Other movements, 
such as Shining Path in Peru, used violence against civilians to achieve political 
results. Some leaders, such as Francisco Franco in Spain, used the military to 
crush resistance. The military-industrial complex that President Eisenhower 
warned about took hold in other countries, as governments increased arms 
supplies and traded weapons with one another.
Nonviolent Resistance as a Path to Change
Despite the frequent wars and violent protests of the 20th century, movements 
around the world also used nonviolence to bring about political change. Three 
of these movements were particularly large and effective, in part because of 
their visionary leaders.
Mohandas Gandhi  Topic .5 described how Mohandas Gandhi led 
nonviolent marches, boycotts, and fasts to oppose British colonial rule in 
India. In 1, India became independent.
Martin Luther King Jr.   The most prominent of African American 
civil rights leaders in the United States in the 150s and 160s was a Baptist 
minister, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr . The civil rights movement 
used various tactics to achieve its goals:
• Court decisions, such as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 
Kansas , that banned forced racial segregation of schools in the  
United States  
600 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• A year-long boycott of public buses in Montgomery, Alabama  
155±156, which ended segregation in public transit 
• Massive marches, such as the 250,000-person March on Washington 
for Jobs and Freedom in 16 
These efforts provided the foundation for the movement’s biggest 
successes, such as the Civil Rights Act of 165, which is covered in Topic  .5.
Nelson Mandela  In South Africa, the white-minority government codified 
a system of racial segregation, called apartheid, into law in the 20th century. 
Leading the black resistance to apartheid was a socialist lawyer, Nelson 
Mandela  118±201. Though early in his life he sometimes supported 
sabotage and other forms of violence, he was known for leading nonviolent 
protests. The victory over apartheid is described in Topic .5.
Challenges to Soviet Power in Eastern Europe
In the 150s and 160s, reformers in Eastern European satellites of the Soviet 
Union sought to become less dominated by the Soviets. In most cases, the 
Soviets clamped down hard against dissent. 
Poland  In 156, Polish workers demonstrated against Soviet domination 
and demanded better living conditions. As a result, a new secretary of the 
Polish Communist Party, Wladyslaw Gomulka , came to power. He decided to 
pursue an independent domestic policy in Poland but continued to be loyal to 
the Soviet Union, allowing the continued presence of Soviet troops in Poland. 
The Soviet-established forced collectivization of farms ended at this time.
Hungary  In that same year, Hungarian protesters convinced the 
country’s political leader Imre Nagy to declare Hungary’s freedom from 
Soviet control and demand the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country. 
Nagy vowed to support free elections in which non-Communist parties 
would participate. He announced Hungary’s neutrality in the Cold War and 
the withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. Soviet leaders responded by invading 
Hungary, gaining control of Budapest in 156. The Soviets captured Nagy 
and executed him. Many Hungarians fled to the West as refugees.
Czechoslovakia  The reform movement in Czechoslovakia reached a 
peak in the Prague Spring  of 168. Alexander Dubcek , first secretary of the 
Communist Party, acceded to the demands of the Czech people by increasing 
freedom of speech and the press and allowing greater freedom to travel. He 
also agreed to make the political system more democratic.
As with Hungary, Soviet leaders feared the Prague Spring’s independence. 
Soon the armies of four Warsaw Pact nations crushed it. In 168, the Soviet 
Union used the Brezhnev Doctrine , named for then-Soviet leader Leonid 
Brezhnev, to justify its actions. This doctrine stated that the Soviet Union and 
its allies would intervene if an action by one member threatened other socialist 
countries. Connect: Explain the continuity or change between the Eastern 
European resistance movements in the 1th and 20th centuries. See Topic 6..
601 GLOBAL RE SISTANCE TO E STABLISHED POWER STRUCTURES6011968: The Year of Revolt  
Events in Czechoslovakia were just one of many upheavals in 168:
• In Yugoslavia. students marched against authoritarian government. 
• In Poland and Northern Ireland, people protested over religious issues.
• In Brazil, marchers demanded improvements in public education and 
fairer treatment of workers. 
• In Japan, students protested both university financial policies and 
government support for the United States in the war in 9ietnam. 
In many countries, protests took place on university campuses. Tensions 
started building up after World War II, when higher education had opened up 
for more people in Western society and facilities were crowded. As a result, 
discontent was high among the student population by the 160s, resulting 
in a call for university reforms. Student grievances mounted as civil rights, 
women’s rights, workers’ rights, and the war in 9ietnam commanded attention .  
Source:  Wikimedia Commons 
The student movement in Mexico was met by military resistance. Two months before the 
168 Olympics began in Mexico City, armored vehicles entered the city to suppress the social 
movement. 
France  In 168, the student movement reached epic proportions in Paris, 
France. Hundreds of thousands of students took to the streets, resulting in 
violence when police forces moved in. In sympathy, some 10 million French 
workers went on strike. It was the largest general strike in French history. 
President Charles de Gaulle called new elections in France and was able to 
remain in office when his party won. 
602 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe United States  In the United States, students and others demonstrated 
for rights for women and African Americans. However, the largest and most 
heated protests were against the country’s involvement in the war in 9ietnam. 
After members of the Ohio National Guard killed four unarmed students during 
an antiwar demonstration at Kent State University  on May , 10, students 
and faculty at hundreds of U.S. colleges and universities went on strike.
An Age of Terrorism 
In the post-Cold War period, large-scale open conflict between sovereign states 
was rare. Instead, individuals unaffiliated with any government committed 
terrorist acts in Western Europe, South America, the Islamic world, and the 
United States that intimidated and murdered civilians. 
Conflict in 1orthern ,relanG  Most of Ireland, the portion dominated by 
Roman Catholics, gained independence from the United .ingdom in 122. 
However, Northern Ireland, which was dominated by Protestants, remained part 
of the United .ingdom. Northern Ireland Catholics suffered discrimination, 
and many wanted their region to join the rest of the Irish Republic. Northern 
Ireland Protestants fiercely refused. 
The Catholic-Protestant conflict in Northern Ireland became more violent 
in the 160s, with Catholics fighting as part of the Irish Republican Army 
(IRA)  and Protestants with the Ulster Defence Association . Between 16 
and 1, some ,500 people died in the conflict. Some members of the IRA 
took their independence campaign to England by engaging in acts of terrorism, 
the use of violence to achieve political ends. These acts included setting off 
bombs in London and other cities. In 1, the two sides reached a cease-fire. 
Later the IRA renounced violence and turned to politics to achieve its goals.
Separatists in Spain  Another group that used terrorist tactics to 
advance a political agenda was the Basque Homeland and Freedom (ETA) 
organization, founded in 15, which wanted independence for the Basque 
region in northern Spain. ETA actions killed more than 800 people and injured 
many others. In 1, members of ETA killed the hand-picked successor to 
longtime dictator Francisco Franco. See Topic .. Over the years, ETA 
announced several cease-fires. In 2011 it declared an end to violent actions and 
promised to work within the political system to achieve Basque independence. 
Peru’s Shining Path  During the 10s, former philosophy professor 
Abimael Guzmán  built a revolutionary organization called Shining Path  
based on the ideas of Mao =edong and Cambodia’s .hmer Rouge. In 180, 
the Shining Path began decades of bombings and assassinations in Peru in 
order to overthrow the existing government and replace it with a communist 
one. Shining Path’s 20 years of terrorism caused an estimated ,000 deaths. 
Guzmin was arrested and sentenced to life in prison in 12, though the 
Shining Path continued its attacks through the late 10s. In 2011 one of the 
group’s top leaders admitted defeat and began negotiations with the Peruvian 
government. 
603 GLOBAL RE SISTANCE TO E STABLISHED POWER STRUCTURESIslamic Terrorism  Several small groups used a fundamentalist 
interpretation of Islam, one widely condemned by mainstream Muslims, to 
justify terrorism. Among these groups were the Boko Haram in West Africa, 
al-Shabaab in East Africa, the Islamic State of Iraq, the Levant ISIL in the 
Middle East, and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Most victims were Muslims. 
Some high-profile attacks occurred in European cities such as Madrid, London, 
and Paris.
One of the deadliest groups was al-Qaeda . Financed by Saudi billionaire 
Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda carried out attacks in many countries, including 
one in the United States on September 11, 2001. In this attack, terrorists killed 
themselves and more than ,000 people when they hijacked and crashed planes 
in New York City, near Washington, D.C., and in rural Pennsylvania. Most of 
the world, even bitter foes of the United States such as Iran, rallied to support 
the United States. Focused efforts by the United States and its allies severely 
weakened al-Qaeda. Bin Laden was killed in a raid on his home in 201 1.
Terrorism in the United States  While the September 11 attack was the 
deadliest act of terrorism in the United States, it was not the only one. Acts 
of terrorism in the United States come from different sources and groups, 
including domestic groups, some of which are associated with white-nationalist 
or extreme right-wing views. One of the largest of these occurred when two 
anti-government extremists bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City in 
15, killing 168 people. Other attacks targeted Muslims, Jews, and blacks.
Response of Militarized States
States in which military dictators ran the government tended to respond to 
internal conflicts in ways that made the conflicts even worse. Spain under 
Franco and Uganda under Idi Amin are two prominent examples. 
The Franco Dictatorship in Spain  The dictator Francisco Franco 
ruled Spain from 1 to 15. See Topic .. He had come to power by 
overthrowing a popularly elected government that included many leftists. 
Franco’s fervent anti-communism made him an ally of the United States. It also 
led his government to execute, imprison, or send to labor camps hundreds of 
thousands of political dissenters. However, opposition to his authoritarianism 
remained. When Franco died, Spain took the opportunity to move toward 
democracy.
,ntensifieG Conflict in 8JanGa unGer ,Gi $Pin  Few countries in the 
10s suffered as much as Uganda, a small country in eastern Africa ruled 
from 11 to 1 by Idi Amin, a military dictator so brutal he was known as 
the “Butcher of Uganda.” Although he was aligned with Western democracies 
early on, he was later backed by the Soviet Union and East Germany. He 
declared himself president for life and set policies that worsened ethnic 
tensions, denied people basic human rights, and undermined economic 
stability. Amin was unpredictable. He was for a time the chairman of the 
604 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONOrganization of African Unity and even a member of the United Nations 
Commission on Human Rights. But in 12 he forcefully expelled 60,000 
Asians from Uganda, most of whom were of Indian descent, and turned 
over their businesses to his supporters. He is believed to be responsible for 
up to 500,000 deaths among targeted ethnic groups during his reign. When 
he threatened neighboring Tanzania with attack, Ugandan nationalists joined 
forces with Tanzanian troops and forced Amin into exile. 
The Military-Industrial Complex
Conflicts around the world intensified because of fear and economic pressure. 
Countries that felt threatened, including the United States and the Soviet Union, 
built strong militaries to defend themselves. These military forces required 
large factories to build planes, tanks, and other goods. Since many countries 
lacked facilities to make their own weapons, the international weapons trade 
expanded greatly. 
As the defense industries expanded, so did the number of people who 
relied on them for jobs. Cutting back on defense spending, then, became very 
difficult. In 161, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, a highly decorated 
general in World War II, called this combination of government defense 
departments and private businesses supplying their demands the military-
industrial complex. He warned that it could grow powerful enough to threaten 
the country’s democracy.

OF SOURCES
The year 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the year²168²that 
stands out most in the decade of the 160s. At their annual meeting that 
year, members of the American Historical Association considered what 
made that year so remarkable and how historians answer questions like 
that. Dr. Alan Shane Dillingham spoke about using first-hand primary 
sources: “I think the limitations of historical narratives dominated by 
participants tell a kind of romantic story²obstacles overcome, that 
kind of stuff. That’s important, but it can also simplify these moments 
and prevent you from seeing important connections.”

8.8
End of the Cold War
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!
—9onald  9eagan, speech in West Berlin, .ermany,  1une 12, 1987
Essential Question:  What caused the end of the Cold War?
Power structures continued to change in the 180s and 10s. President 
Ronald Reagan’s  appeal to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev  came two 
years before the Berlin Wall fell in 18. Two years after the fall, a coup ousted 
Gorbachev from power. The Soviet Union collapsed and the Cold War was 
over. The U.S.-Soviet Union rivalry that had dominated the world stage for 
nearly five decades ended. Governments in only a few countries, such as China, 
North .orea, Cuba, and 9ietnam, still called themselves communists, Political 
alliances changed, and economic interactions among nations expanded.
The Final Decades of the Cold War Era
Despite the persistent mistrust between the two countries, diplomatic relations 
between the United States and the Soviet Union were maintained²albeit 
inconsistently at times²during the last decades of the conflict. Proxy wars and 
support of opposing sides in international conflicts remained standard for both 
nations. These conflicts reinforced the fundamental disagreement between the 
capitalist United States and the communist Soviet Union. Agreements between 
the superpowers to limit nuclear weapons played a key role in ending the Cold 
War. However, the path to a thaw was not always steady. Connect: Describe 
the similarities in the competition between world powers in the Cold War and 
during the imperial era. See Topics . and .5.
Détente and a Colder War  After resolving the crises of the 160s, which 
included the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis, the relationship between 
the superpowers improved in the following decade. This period of time was 
called détente , a relaxation of strained relations between nations. 
One symbol of dptente was the visit of President Richard Nixon to the 
Soviet Union in 12. Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed the 
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) , designed to freeze the number 
of intercontinental ballistic missiles that each power could keep. To play one 
power against the other, Nixon also visited China that year. It was the first visit 
by an American president in the existence of communist China. 
609 END OF T HE COLD WARDptente served both the U.S. and Soviet needs at the time. The Soviet 
Union faced challenges during the late 160s and the 10s. 
• Economically, the USSR was in a crisis. It was no longer growing. 
Central governmental controls prevented farmers and manufacturers 
from deciding what to grow or make and what to charge for it. Foreign 
trade was extremely limited.
• Eastern European Soviet bloc countries were bucking for reforms and 
freedom from Moscow’s direct control. The Soviet military violently 
put down the Prague Spring, a liberation movement in Czechoslovakia. 
• Russia faced skirmishes with China along their shared border²a 
reflection of the troubled relationship between the two communist 
countries. 
The United States also faced difficulties. President Nixon was mired in 
the 9ietnam War, a costly and unpopular conflict. The American economy 
was suffering as well. The possibility of establishing relations with China 
would, Nixon knew, open potential new markets to the United States and 
at the same time press a bit on the strained Soviet-Chinese relationship. 
Dptente could help the United States maintain its containment policy and 
might ease tensions between the superpowers. 
As a result of dptente, the United States started to sell excess stores of 
American grain to the Soviet Union, where drought had created a shortage. 
This benefitted American farmers, who now had access to a new, large market 
for goods, and the struggling people of the Soviet Union. However, after the 
Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1, U.S. President Jimmy Carter halted the 
grain shipments. This action marked the end of dptente. 
Soviet-Afghan War  The Soviets invaded Afghanistan to prop up that 
country’s communist government against Muslim fighters. Estimates of  
Afghan civilian deaths vary from 562,000 to two million. Millions of Afghans 
fled to Pakistan and Iran, and many within the country became homeless. 
Ultimately, the Soviet army could not conquer the guerrilla groups in the rough  
terrain of Afghanistan. Soviet legitimacy was undermined and new forms of 
political participation in Afghanistan developed. As the Soviet Army withdrew 
in 18, a civil war continued in Afghanistan. While the collapse of the Soviet 
Union would not occur until 12 years after the Afghan War began, the war put 
immense stress on the Soviet Union’s centralized economic system and left 
Soviet leadership vulnerable to reform. 
Reagan and Gorbachev  During the presidency of Ronald Reagan 
181±18, tensions between the Americans and the Soviets increased even 
further. Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as the “evil empire” and sent 
military aid, including weapons, to support the Afghans. The Soviet Union 
resented this overtly militaristic move. 
In addition, by the early 180s, the United States and the Soviet Union 
had more than 12,000 nuclear missiles, each one pointed at the other side. Not 
610 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONonly would the superpowers destroy each other with a nuclear exchange, but 
the rest of the world would also be destroyed²seven times over. 
In light of this growing tension, Reagan declared that the United States 
would create a missile defense program he called the Strategic Defense 
Initiative , or SDI. Dubbed “Star Wars” after the internationally popular 
1 film by critics, the system would supposedly destroy any Soviet nuclear 
missiles that targeted the United States or its allies. Lacking such a system, the 
Soviets would be unable to keep U.S. missiles from hitting targets in the Soviet 
Union. The Soviets saw this move as the beginning of an arms race in space. 
While it was not an immediate threat that required a quick response, it worried 
liberal and moderate Soviets who wanted reforms. They saw it as a long-term 
economic concern and one that strengthened the hand of Soviet conservatives. 
The Soviets objected loudly to Reagan’s plan.
The Thaw  The increase in tensions during the 180s led to other nations 
believing that they must choose sides between the superpowers. Non-aligned 
nations hoped they would not experience a nuclear holocaust that the two 
nations caused. 
In this tense atmosphere, Mikhail Gorbachev, a more progressive Communist 
than previous Soviet leaders, came to power in 185. He favored perestroika , 
attempts to restructure the Soviet economy to allow elements of free enterprise, 
and glasnost , the policy of opening up Soviet society and the political process 
by granting greater freedom. Reagan and Gorbachev met three times in two 
years. The two men liked each other and, despite tough negotiations, created a 
working relationship that ultimately delivered results. 
In 18, the Soviet Union and the United States agreed on a new nuclear 
arms treaty. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces  Treaty (INF)  restricted 
intermediate-range nuclear weapons. Around the world, people could breathe 
a cautious sigh of relief as the world’s two superpowers reduced the risk of 
nuclear war. The INF and other U.S.-Soviet agreements quieted some of the 
more bellicose Cold War supporters in both countries. With less pressure from 
Soviet conservatives, Gorbachev could more easily implement political and 
economic reforms in the Soviet Union.

who looks on sadly at a symbol of 
the Soviet Union, the hammer and 
sickle, broken into pieces.
611 END OF T HE COLD WARThe End of the Soviet Union  
One aspect of Gorbachev’s reform program was an end to economic support for 
the Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe. He also implied that the Soviet Army 
would no longer come to the rescue of communist regimes in Eastern Europe. 
In effect, economic reform in the Soviet Union provided greater freedom to 
other communist countries. Once people in these countries got a small taste of 
freedom, they wanted more. As a result, democratic reform movements swept 
through Eastern European nations in 18. The Berlin Wall was torn down. In 
October 10, East and West Germany reunited as one country.
The Spread of Reforms  With most of the Eastern European nations 
caught up in democratic reforms, it was not long before the Soviet Union was 
also swept into the movement. Lithuania, Georgia, and other Soviet republics 
began to overthrow their rulers and declare independence. The Warsaw Pact 
dissolved. Gorbachev’s reforms ultimately led to his political downfall and 
the end of the Soviet Union in December 11. Among the former Soviet 
republics that became independent countries, Russia emerged as the strongest. 
The Cold War had ended.
New Challenges  The decline of a superpower presented opportunities 
and several challenges. Political alliances changed, and economic interactions 
among nations expanded. With this new openness, particularly with regard 
to trade, the world became more interconnected than ever before. This 
interconnectedness produced greater wealth for some but hardships for others. 
The post-Cold War world had to grapple with new democracies, vast economic 
inequality, ethnic conflict and genocide, terrorism, environmental degradation, 
and global epidemics.

Read the following summary of the beginnings of a process set in 
motion by the introduction of perestroika. Then, in a paragraph, 
explain how the process continued, leading to the breakup of the 
Soviet Union.  
“From modest beginnings at the Twenty-Seventh Party Congress 
in 186, perestroika, Mikhail Gorbachev’s program of economic, 
political, and social restructuring, became the unintended catalyst for 
dismantling what had taken nearly three-quarters of a century to erect: 
the Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist totalitarian state.
The world watched in disbelief but with growing admiration as 
Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan, democratic governments 
overturned Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Germany was 
reunited, the Warsaw Pact withered away, and the Cold War came to 
an abrupt end.
In the Soviet Union itself, however, reactions to the new policies 
were mixed. Reform policies rocked the foundation of entrenched 
traditional power bases in the party, economy, and society but did not 
replace them entirely. Newfound freedoms of assembly, speech, and 
religion, the right to strike, and multicandidate elections undermined 
not only the Soviet Union’s authoritarian structures, but also the 
familiar sense of order and predictability. Long-suppressed, bitter 
inter-ethnic, economic, and social grievances led to clashes, strikes, 
and growing crime rates.
Gorbachev introduced policies designed to begin establishing a 
market economy by encouraging limited private ownership and 
profitability in Soviet industry and agriculture. But the Communist 
control system and over-centralization of power and privilege were 
maintained and new policies produced no economic miracles. Instead, 
lines got longer for scarce goods in the stores, civic unrest mounted, 
and bloody crackdowns claimed lives, particularly in the restive 
nationalist populations of the outlying Caucasus and Baltic states.
. . . Boris Yeltsin, who had become Russia’s first popularly elected 
president in June 11, . . . embarked on even more far-reaching 
reforms as the Soviet Union broke up into its constituent republics 
and formed the Commonwealth of Independent States.”

REFLECT ON THE TOPIC ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. In one to three paragraphs, explain what caused the end of the Cold War.
CAUSATION IN T HE AGE OF T HE  COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION 615
8.9
Causation in the Age of the  
Cold War and Decolonization
Walls in the mind often stand longer than those built of concrete blocks.
—Willy Brandt, December 1991
Essential Question:   Why and to what e_tent were the effects of the Cold 
War similar in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres? 
The end of World War II marked the beginning of a new world order as the 
nations of Western Europe no longer dominated the world stage. The United 
States and the Soviet Union took over as the superpowers. In Western Europe, 
however, countries were free from domination by a superpower and retained 
their political independence and democratic governments. The Marshall Plan 
had helped them rebuild and achieve a level of economic prosperity that was 
unknown among the countries of Eastern Europe. 
However, during this time, Western European colonial empires began 
to crumble as anti-imperialist sentiment fueled independence movements in 
Africa and Asia. Resentment of European and American economic imperialism 
also rose in Latin American countries, leading to revolutionary movements 
that aimed to overturn the political and social status quo in these countries. The 
United States and the Soviet Union regularly supported opposing sides in these 
clashes, projecting their own differences onto regional conflicts. 
The Cold War also influenced economic, social, and cultural aspects of 
global events, providing further evidence that this conflict had far-reaching 
effects that affected the latter half of the 20th century.
Challenges to Existing Social Orders 
The years following World War II were a time of unprecedented conflict as 
people and states challenged the established order. How they carried out their 
challenges, how the existing powers responded, and how the challenges were 
or were not resolved depended in part on the position of the challenging 
people or states in the geopolitical balance of power. 
Toward the end of World War II, a serious ideological and economic 
rift  emerged among the “Big Three” Allied powers²the Soviet Union, the 
United States, and Great Britain. The United States and Great Britain, along 
with France which had recently been liberated from German occupation, 
616 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONoccupied the western half of Germany. The Soviets occupied the eastern half. 
Agreements made at Yalta and Potsdam were supposed to have settled the 
future status of Western and Eastern European countries affected by the war. 
However, after the war officially ended, it became apparent that the Soviet 
Union was not going to relinquish control over the Eastern European territories 
it occupied during the war. The Soviets viewed these states as a buffer against 
future aggression from the West. Even though the countries of Eastern Europe 
were officially independent, the Soviet Union had immense influence over 
their governments and internal affairs. The so-called Soviet bloc was made up 
of East Germany and these satellite nations of the USSR. The United States 
distrusted the motives of the Soviet Union and believed the Soviets were intent 
on bringing about a global communist revolution. 
After China became a communist state in 1 and the United States 
recognized it could not free Eastern Europe from Soviet influence, the United 
States established a policy of containment. The policy used military, economic, 
and political means to stop the spread of communism outside of the areas 
where it was currently practiced. Containment drove the direction of U.S. 
foreign policy throughout the Cold War.
Three Alignments  The Cold War thus caused a division of the world into 
three alignments. The “First World” was the United States and its allies. The 
“Second World” was the Soviet Union, the Soviet bloc countries of Eastern 
Europe, and other communist nations around the world. The third alignment 
was often called the “Third World” but was more accurately described as the 
non-aligned countries that did not have close military or ideological ties with 
any of the First or Second World countries .SOVIET UNION

617 CAUSATION IN T HE AGE OF T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION 617As the map on the previous page shows, the United States was the 
First World superpower situated in the Western Hemisphere. The dominant 
superpower in the Second World, the Soviet Union, was in the Eastern 
Hemisphere. These superpowers represented a geopolitical balance of power. 
Third World countries were mainly those with colonial pasts they were in 
Asia, Africa, and Oceania in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America in the 
Western Hemisphere.
Superpower Rivalries
One result of the superpower rivalry was the division of Europe. The western 
portion had, for the most part, democratic and free-market societies, while 
the eastern portion was autocratic and communist. The dividing line ran 
through Germany, which was divided into the two independent countries of 
West and East Germany. The capital city of Berlin was similarly divided. The 
Iron Curtain, as it was termed, reflected the Western democratic view that 
the Soviet-bloc countries were a threat to the individual freedoms and liberty 
of the people living on both sides of the border. The Soviets believed, based 
on their historical perspective, that the Western democracies were intent on 
invading the Soviet Union. Mistrust on both sides led to a nuclear arms race 
that was an existential threat to Europe and the world. 
The Arms Race  The United States developed an atomic bomb at the end 
of World War II. It used the bomb to end the conflict with Japan by dropping 
two of them²one on the city of Hiroshima and the other on Nagasaki. The 
devastation to the two cities shocked the world. The Soviet Union soon 
developed its own nuclear weapon, and the nuclear arms race was on. The 
number of nuclear weapons and the means to use them increased for both states. 
Relations between the superpowers grew tense, and the fear in Europe, and 
elsewhere, was that any provocation could lead to nuclear annihilation. Both 
the United States and the Soviet Union took defensive actions that resulted in 
Europe becoming what was effectively an armed camp with millions of troops 
and weapons, both conventional and nuclear, facing off against each other. 
During this time, two international military alliances formed. The United 
States and its allies formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO.
The Soviet Union and its allies created the Warsaw Pact. Both groups sought 
to ensure collective security through military cooperation. Part of the “cold” 
factor in the Cold War is that there never was direct, “hot” military conflict 
between the two superpowers. But the brinkmanship and proxy battles that 
characterized this war put most people on Earth on edge whenever the United 
States and the Soviets appeared poised to launch a nuclear atta ck.
Hopes for Greater Self-Government
The high point of empires and colonization was World War I. The British, 
the French, and other Europeans had colonized almost all of Africa, India, 
and Southeast Asia, and they dominated China. The Turkish Ottoman Empire 
618 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONcontrolled the Middle East. But the desire for self-government that had fueled 
colonial rebellions throughout the Americas in the 18th and 1th centuries as 
well as national independence movements in Europe in the 1th century spread 
throughout the world in the 20th century. The two world wars crystallized the 
opposition to the empires. Although most hopes for independence remained 
unfulfilled after World War I, the war did result in the breakup of two large 
multiethnic empires, Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey. 
World War II, however, accelerated the dismantling of global colonial 
empires. Between the end of World War II in 15 and the year 2000, the 
number of independent states more than doubled, going from around 5 to 
around 10. 
As the Cold War established new alignments among both newer and 
established states, it extended far beyond its ideological roots and exerted 
political, economic, social, and cultural influence on nearly all parts of the 
globe.

The Cold War affected the Eastern and Western Hemispheres in similar ways, 
since each was dominated by a superpower and also had former colonies and 
emerging new nations. However, most countries in the Western Hemisphere 
had become independent long before the Cold War. The Eastern Hemisphere 
paid an especially heavy price as a result of the Cold War, since several key 
proxy conflicts were located in Asia and Africa. Nonetheless, rivalries between 
the superpowers played out in both hemispheres. 
Many transitions to independence were largely peaceful and nonviolent 
others involved open armed rebellions. In some cases, these insurgent 
movements were led by communist groups and supported by the Soviet Union, 
such as in 9ietnam and Angola. As a result, the United States would either 
support the colonial power against the communist insurgency or would support 
opposition groups that would establish a non-communist government. Often 
these Western-backed governments proved to be unpopular with the majority 
of the people, which only heightened anti-imperialist feelings.
Political Effects in Asia  The Cold War brought armed conflict and played 
a part in internal revolts and crises in some countries of Asia. The U.S. policy 
of containment led to wars in .orea and 9ietnam. Communist revolutions 
overtook Cambodia and Laos. The Soviets invaded Afghanistan to prop up the 
communist government in that country. Anti-communist crackdowns occurred 
in Indonesia and the Philippines. Communist China had a falling-out with the 
Soviet Union and began to seek better relations with the United States.
Political Effects in Africa  As with Asia, the Cold War brought conflict 
and turmoil to Africa. Communist insurrections supported by the Soviet Union 
were often met by government resistance supported with arms supplied by 
the United States. Communist governments came to power in Ethiopia and 
Angola. In the case of Angola’s war for independence from Portugal, the Soviet 
Union and the United States fought a proxy war. The Soviets supported the use 
619 CAUSATION IN T HE AGE OF T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION of Cuban soldiers and provided arms and military training to help establish a 
communist-style government in the country. The United States provided arms 
and supported anti-communist groups. 
Political Effects in the Western Hemisphere Latin America also 
experienced the results of the Cold War conflict between the superpowers. 
Communist revolutions were successful in Cuba and Nicaragua. Communist 
insurrections, sometimes backed by the Soviet Union or Cuba, occurred in El 
Salvador, Columbia, Peru, and Guatemala. The United States would support 
the government in power²often a dictatorship made up of military officers or 
right-wing politicians²to try to stop the spread of communism. 
&RPSDUinJ(cRnRPic(σecWsRfWKe&RlG:DU
The Cold War divided Europe in economics as well as politics. The Western 
countries, aided by the United States’ Marshall Plan, rebuilt their economies 
after the destruction of World War II with a mixture of free-market principles 
and state-sponsored economic development. The Eastern bloc nations struggled 
in a transition away from communism to free-market economies. Developing 
countries²those in the “Third World”²faced unique challenges.
State Response to Economic Challenges in the West  To promote 
economic security, many Western European governments created public 
health systems, built public housing, provided unemployment insurance, and 
developed state-backed pension plans. The creation of the welfare state, as it 
became known, was to counteract the attraction of the communist system that 
promised to provide many of these benefits. As a result, the Western European 
nations’ economies boomed while the Eastern European economies, under a 
communist system, struggled to recover from the costs and effects of the war.

620 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONState Response to Economic Challenges in the Eastern Bloc  The 
Soviet government quickly transitioned its economy after the war to peacetime 
endeavors. Yet the military-industrial complex was so large in the Soviet Union 
that it employed about 20 percent of the workers, many of whom became 
unemployed during the transition. The Soviet-bloc countries faced a serious 
economic crisis as the government instituted economic reforms to encourage 
free-market practices and move away from a state-controlled economy . 
However, moving from a state-controlled to a free-market economy proved  
to be an extremely complex endeavor. Debates swirled about whether to 
institute reforms gradually or all at once, and party officials resisted the loss 
of their control over the economy. In the end, reformers have succeeded in 
removing state controls over prices, and formerly state-owned businesses have 
been privatized. After a period of decline, the Russian economy is improving. 
China made a more gradual transition to a free-market economy and has 
become a global economic powerhouse. 
State Response to Economic Challenges in Developing Countries  Many 
former colonies still had close economic ties to the countries that had colonized 
them and remained dependent on the extraction and exporting of natural 
resources. The perspective of many people in the former colonies was that the 
industrial countries were using this relationship to exploit and undermine the 
economies of these developing countries. Getting control of their resources 
was a top priority of developing nations. Oil-rich Angola, for example, left in 
disarray after years of civil war, has a government-controlled oil conglomerate 
that accounts for about 0 percent of government revenue and has helped the 
nation rebuild and update infrastructure.
&RPSDUinJ6RciDlDnG&ulWuUDl(σecWs
The tension and turmoil of the Cold War era created social effects for all sides 
involved. For example, the proxy wars cost millions of people their lives, 
especially in Southeast Asia. In the 9ietnam war alone, two million soldiers 
and two million civilians died over 20 years of conflict. Bombs destroyed 
villages, and chemical defoliants killed anything growing on farmlands. 
Families were separated and displaced. Many rural villagers left for the city, 
where they thought they could find safety. Saigon, the capital city, tripled in 
size as refugees from the countryside flooded in. Most of the fighting took 
place in South 9ietnam, so it sustained the most damage, but North 9ietnam 
was also bombed²especially such infrastructure as railroads and highways.
Social Tensions  The Cold War created suspicions as well. Americans 
were afraid of communist infiltration, and some people’s careers were ruined 
when they were unjustly accused of being communists. In the Soviet Union, 
people were afraid to express their beliefs openly if they disagreed with the 
government. They knew they could be sent away to a political prison camp. 
People everywhere lived under the threat of a nuclear attack. Some people built 
bomb shelters where they hoped they could safely weather an atomic attack.
621 CAUSATION IN T HE AGE OF T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION Cultural Effects  With greater personal freedom, and with help from the 
United States, Western Europeans experienced a cultural rebirth after World 
War II. Scientific research, music, art, and architecture flourished. Eastern 
Europe, in contrast, lacked freedom of expression. Because of the Cold War, 
governments actively blocked the spread of Western culture. The people of 
Eastern Europe did not see much in the way of cultural achievements beyond 
those that were government-sponsored or approved.
During the Cold War, many people from former colonies moved to the 
metropole see Topic 8.6, furthering the blending of cultures. At the same 
time, the imperial powers left a legacy of culture in their former colonies, 
including the languages spoken, as the chart below shows.

French 120 million • Senegal
• Democratic Republic of the Congo
Portuguese 14 million • Angola
• Mozambique
Dutch (Afrikaans) 7 million • South Africa
English 7 million • South Africa
Spanish 1 million • Equatorial Guinea
In places where a Cold War superpower had maintained order, such as 
Afghanistan and Yugoslavia, violent culture clashes occurred when the 
superpower retreated. In Yugoslavia, for example, which had been stitched 
together and annexed to Serbia after World War I, ethnic tensions flared as 
Serbia’s ultra-nationalist president, Slobodan Milosevic, pitted one group 
against another to strengthen his own position after the fall of the Soviet Union 
left a power vacuum. Wars in the region took tens of thousands of lives and 
created hundreds of thousands of refugees. Connect: Analyze the changing 
goals for both superpowers during the Cold War. See Topics 8.1, 8., and 8.8. 
Development of Global Institutions
The end of the Cold War and the growth of globalization has reset the 
geopolitical framework. The idea of a balance of power has yielded to a more 
cooperative approach as countries recognize global interdependence. To further 
cooperation, global organizations such as the United Nations and the World 
Trade Association have been established. Others address such transnational 
issues as environmental degradation and global warming, human rights, and 
epidemic diseases.

UNIT 8 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WHY ARE SOME COUNTRIE S WEALT HY?
In 16, Adam Smith published the first modern, in-depth look at why 
some countries are wealthier than others, The Wealth of Nations . Smith 
recognized a need for government, but emphasized the benefits of trade.
Modernization  After World War II, Western Europe and the 
United States grew wealthier rapidly. Scholars in these regions, such 
as American political scientist David Apter, developed modernization 
theory.  The problems of poor, newly emerging countries were seen as 
the natural by-products of the transition from a traditional, agrarian 
society to a modern, developed society. Developed countries could 
provide economic and technological assistance to help in this transition.
Self-Reliance  In the 10s, a new generation of scholars saw 
developed countries as the problem, not the solution. They rejected 
modernization theory, arguing that it placed the blame for poverty 
on poor countries, not on the former colonial powers. According to 
dependency theory , former colonies were victims of the international 
marketplace. In this theory, the way out of poverty was self-reliance. 
Globalization  Recent writers, such as journalist Thomas 
Friedman, focused not on self-reliance but on globalization.  Friedman 
saw the increasing interconnectedness of economies around the world 
as an opportunity for countries to prosper. His “flat world” referred to 
relatively inexpensive technologies that allowed developing nations to 
compete with developed ones for jobs and the creation of innovative 
products. In response, Canadian journalist Linda McQuaig attacked 
Friedman as an “apologist of globalization.” Friedman’s critics charged 
that he looked at the benefits of increased trade and investments without 
seeing the costs incurred in poor countries through these actions.
Trade  Ha-Joon Chang, a British economist who was born and raised 
in South .orea, took a historical view. In Kicking Away the Ladder: 
Development Strategies in Historical Perspective  2002, he evaluated 
the path to prosperity for today’s wealthy countries in Western Europe 
and the United States. All once had high tariffs and other trade barriers 
to protect their growing industries from foreign competition. Only after 
they became wealthy did they advocate for free trade. However, today 
wealthy countries press poor ones to open their borders economically. 
The lesson of history, he argued, was to let poor countries use the same 
protectionist methods that led to prosperity for other countrie s.

evidence supports one of the perspectives on nations’ wealth after 100.
624 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION
WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  WRITE  THE CONCL USION
A strong conclusion helps create unity by circling back to the ideas in 
your introduction and thesis statement. The conclusion is also a good 
opportunity to extend and refine the complex understanding you have 
developed and woven throughout your essay.
Providing Unity  While wrapping up your essay with a return to the 
ideas in your introduction helps provide unity, simply restating your thesis 
is not a strong way to end the essay. Suppose your thesis is that the main 
causes of the end of the Cold War were the decline in communist ideology 
and the weakness of the Soviet economy. Avoid simply restating it “Thus 
we can see that the decline of communist ideology and the weakness of 
the Soviet economy were the main causes of the end of the Cold War”. 
Instead, you might say, “Although many factors led to the end of the Cold 
War, including Gorbachev’s efforts at reform and the development of 
communication technologies that allowed for the rapid spread of liberal 
ideas, most served to feed the two main causes²declining support for 
communism and a faltering Soviet economy.” This change extends the 
thesis statement rather than simply repeating it.
Demonstrating Complexity  An extension of your thesis statement 
such as the one above also helps demonstrate a complex understanding of 
the topic by referring to multiple causes. The College Board identifies the 
following ways to demonstrate a complex understanding: “Corroborate, 
qualify, or modify an argument using diverse and alternative evidence 
in order to develop a complex argument.” You might, for example, 
analyze multiple variables to arrive at a nuanced conclusion: “Economic, 
ideological, political, social, and religious factors all played a role in the 
fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.” You might make 
a connection within or across regions: “A democracy movement was 
building in China as well, but China used military force to put it down, 
while Gorbachev decided not to use military force.”
Other ways you can demonstrate a complex understanding are to 
consider the significance of a source’s credibility and limitations and 
explain why a historical argument is or is not effective. Most of the 
development of your complex understanding must be done within the 
body of your essay for you to earn the point for complexity, but you can 
use the conclusion to summarize or extend that understanding. 
Application:  Review the sample scored essays on the College 
Board website. Evaluate the conclusion of each sample. For any that 
lack a conclusion, draft one that would provide unity to the essay and 
summarize a complex understanding of the historical development that 
is the focus of the prompt.

Perhaps now more than at any other moment in the history of the world, 
society, government, and statesmanship need to be based upon the highest 
code of morality and ethics. And in political terms, what is the highest code 
of morality" It is the subordination >placing in a lower rank@ of everything 
to the well-being of mankind. But today we are faced with a situation 
where the well-being of mankind is not always the primary consideration. 
Many who are in places of high power think, rather, of controlling the 
world. Yes, we are living in a world of fear. The life of man today is 
corroded >destroyed or weakened gradually@ and made bitter by fear. Fear 
of the future, fear of the hydrogen bomb, fear of ideologies. Perhaps this 
fear is a greater danger than the danger itself, because it is fear which 
drives men to act foolishly, to act thoughtlessly, to act dangerously . . . 
All of us, I am certain, are united by more important things than those 
which superficially divide us. We are united, for instance, by a common 
detestation of colonialism in whatever form it appears. We are united 
by a common detestation of racialism. And we are united by a common 
determination to preserve and stabilize peace in the world.

The Middle East has abruptly reached a new and critical stage in its long 
and important history. In past decades, many of the countries in that 
area were not fully self-governing. Other nations exercised considerable 
authority in the area and the security of the region was largely built 
around their power. But since the First World War there has been a steady 
evolution toward self-government and independence. This development 
the United States has welcomed and has encouraged. Our country supports 
without reservation the full sovereignty >supreme power or authority@ and 
independence of each and every nation of the Middle East. The evolution 
to independence has in the main been a peaceful process. But the area 
has been often troubled . . . All this instability has been heightened and, 
at times, manipulated by International Communism. Russia’s rulers have 
long sought to dominate the Middle East . . . The Soviet Union has nothing 
whatsoever to fear from the United States in the Middle East, or anywhere 
else in the world, so long as its rulers do not themselves first resort to 
aggression. That statement I make solemnly and emphatically.

As the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union came to dominate 
U.S. foreign policy concerns in the late 10s and 150s, the Truman 
and Eisenhower Administrations grew increasingly concerned that as 
the European powers lost their colonies or granted them independence, 
Soviet-supported communist parties might achieve power in the new 
states. This might serve to shift the international balance of power in favor 
of the Soviet Union and remove access to economic resources from U.S. 
allies. Events such as the Indonesian struggle for independence from the 
Netherlands 15±50, the 9ietnamese war against France 15±5, 
and the nationalist and professed socialist takeovers of Egypt 152 and 
Iran 151 served to reinforce such fears, even if new governments did 
not directly link themselves to the Soviet Union. Thus, the United States 
used aid packages, technical assistance, and sometimes even military 
intervention to encourage newly independent nations in the Third World to 
adopt governments that aligned with the West. The Soviet Union deployed 
similar tactics in an effort to encourage new nations to join the communist 
bloc. . . . Many of the new nations resisted the pressure to be drawn into 
the Cold War, joined in the “non-aligned movement.”

UNIT 9:   Globalization after 1900
Understand the Context
Unprecedented advancements in science and technology, from airplanes 
to the internet, increased globalization in the 20th century. These changes 
provided the setting for vast political and social change, including the spread 
of democracy and increased international trade. 
Innovation by Necessity  Science and technology exploration changed 
the way people in the 20th century viewed the universe and the natural world. 
Advancements were often a reaction to some sort of large, global problem. 
An increase in diseases that threatened human populations throughout the 
world necessitated medical advancements such as vaccines. Deforestation 
and a decline in the fresh water supply meant that humans had to compete 
over natural resources and develop environmentally friendly practices. Other 
conditions necessitated advancements in communication, transportation, and 
other global industries. 
Reaction to Globalization  Many states employed free-market economic 
policies that paved the way for emerging multinational organizations. 
Access to education and the political process improved as disseminating 
knowledge and information became easy with technology. Classrooms and 
political movements came to include more diverse participants, including 
those from various races, classes, and religions. Communication innovations 
also led to discussions about human rights that challenged previous forms of 
discrimination. 
The globalization of the 20th century also led to changes in the arts and 
humanities, especially in the second half of the century. Arts and entertainment 
increasingly reflected a new, globalized world and consumer culture began to 
transcend borders. Countries also had to learn to work together as they never 
had before. The United Nations formed with stated goals not only to maintain 
world peace but also to facilitate international cooperation.19002000 195020501945

Advances in Technology 
and Exchange
Technology made large populations possible; large populations  
now make technology indispensable.
—Joseph Krutch, writer and naturalist (1893–1970)
Essential Question:   How has the development of new technology changed 
the world since 1900?
While the population of the world grew, globalization made the world feel 
smaller, as did advances in telecommunications technology. Starting in the 
early 1900s, radio  brought news, music, and cultural events to a wide range of 
people. Later in the century, air travel and shipping containers, large standard-
sized units that could be carried on a truck or train or stacked on ship, promoted 
the widespread movement of people and goods. Energy technologies, such as 
the use of oil and nuclear power, made it possible to transport goods faster 
and more cheaply than ever. The internet, first developed for the U.S. Defense 
Department during the Cold War, emerged as a regular tool of communication 
for much of the public by the late 1990s. Knowledge economies, based on 
developing or sharing information, took root in cities around the world.
Communication and Transportation
Decades before the introduction of the internet, communication technologies 
were connecting people around the world. Television and radio ads encouraged 
people to “reach out and touch someone” by making a long-distance phone 
call. By the 1990s, mobile technologies such as cellphones put the tools of 
information creation and dissemination into the hands of individuals around 
the world. Twitter, Facebook, and other social networking sites made the media 
accessible to anyone anywhere. 
The impact of this revolution became apparent quickly. Videos taken 
on phones of police actions in the United States and other countries led to 
inquiries into racial profiling and sparked outrage. Social media also played a 
role in the “Arab Spring,” a series of antigovernment protests that spread from 
country to country in North Africa and the Middle East in the 2010s as people 
shared their protest experiences on social media.
634 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONWhile communication technologies put people in virtual touch, 
transportation advancements move people and goods into actual proximity. 
Every day, about 2 million people fly on an airplane. Cargo planes transport 
commercial shipments around the clock. Giant tankers—up to one-quarter 
mile in length—loaded with thousands of shipping containers ply the seas in 
increasing numbers, some of them too big to fit through the Panama Canal.
The Green Revolution  
In the mid-20th century, the Green Revolution  emerged as a possible long-
term response to hunger. Scientists developed new varieties of wheat, rice, and 
other grains that had higher yields and greater resistance to pests, diseases, 
and drought. The new varieties were first developed by crossbreeding —
breeding two varieties of a plant to create a hybrid. More recently, scientists 
have used genetic engineering —manipulating a cell or organism to change 
its basic characteristics. Farmers also used more irrigation, fertilizers, and 
pesticides. In Brazil and elsewhere, people burned down forests and plowed 
the land for agriculture. Acreage devoted to crops, especially grains, increased 
dramatically worldwide. 
The Green Revolution solutions were not free of problems. Many small 
farmers could not afford the new fertilizers or pesticides. For this reason, they 
were often unable to compete with large landowners. Many small farmers 
were forced to sell their land, increasing the holdings of large landowners even 
more. Also, since some of the techniques developed in the Green Revolution 
involved the use of mechanized equipment, fewer jobs were available for farm 
laborers. Finally, the heavy applications of chemicals damaged the soil and the 
environment. Total Grain Production in China 1945–2010

635 ADVANCE S IN TEC HNOLOG Y AND EXCHANGEGenetic engineering created its own set of concerns as well. Some argued 
that a genetic modification designed to give a plant resistance to insects might 
inadvertently cause a decline in the population of pollinating insects, such as 
bees. Another problem was the loss of old seed varieties as new genetically 
engineered plants were adopted.
Energy Technologies
In 1900, coal accounted for about half of the global energy consumed. As 
extraction, refinement, and transportation technologies allowed for widespread 
use, petroleum, also known as crude oil, and natural gas joined coal in fueling 
industrial output and helped increase productivity. Research in the 1930s and 
10s that led to the atomic bomb also led to the first use of nuclear power 
plants to generate electricity for factories and homes. 
Fossil fuels—coal, petroleum, and natural gas—are nonrenewable 
resources. Once they have been used up, the supply is permanently depleted. 
Fossil fuels have contributed to air pollution and to the cloak of greenhouse 
gases, especially carbon dioxide, that allow sunlight through the Earth’s 
atmosphere but block the escape of Earth’s heat. Nuclear power, while 
considered a clean energy, has its own dangers. Accidents at nuclear plants 
have caused serious problems with leaked radiation, and storing nuclear waste 
has hazardous consequences. 
Technologies continue to be developed to combat the emission of carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases as well as minimize harm from nuclear 
power. The building of nuclear power plants declined starting in the 1980s, and 
nuclear power accounts for only about 5 percent of global energy consumption. 
Renewable resources, such as wind and solar power, are beginning to supply 
energy to both industries and homes, but they too represent only 5 percent 
of global energy output. (Connect: Analyze the role of various energy 
sources in the first and second industrial revolutions and in the 21st century.  
See Topic 5.5.)
Medical Innovations
A number of advances in medicine have had a dramatic effect on the survival 
and longevity of humans. Medical research and advancement benefit from, 
and also inspire, new technologies. 
Antibiotics   In 1928, Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming was working 
in his lab in London when he accidentally discovered that a particular fungus 
produced a substance that killed bacteria. He had discovered penicillin. 
Penicillin became the first antibiotic,  a useful agent in curing bacterial 
infections. During World War II, antibiotics saved the lives of soldiers who 
would have died in any previous war from a minor wound that became 
infected. After the war, antibiotics spread to civilian use, where they fought a 
range of illnesses.
636 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION“I would like to sound one warning,” Fleming said in a speech as he 
accepted the Nobel Prize. He pointed out that the extensive use of antibiotics 
carried a risk. By killing off certain strains of a disease, antibiotics allowed the 
evolution of strains of the disease unaffected by them. These antibiotic-resistant 
strains could be untreatable. This prospect raised fears of renewed epidemics 
of diseases once under control.
Reliable Birth Control  Another groundbreaking medical advance was 
in birth control . In the early 150s, scientist Gregory Pincus developed a 
birth control pill, a more reliable method than the barrier methods then in use. 
Scientists tested the pill on women in the 1950s, and the U.S. government 
approved it for widespread use in 1960. 
As a result of the pill and other forms of birth control, fertility rates  
declined in much of the world. In other words, the average woman began 
having fewer babies than her mother or grandmother had. Birth control 
transformed sexual practices and played a part in reshaping gender roles. By 
2018, more than 300 million women worldwide were using modern forms of 
contraception, including the pill. 
Vaccines  Vaccines have existed since 1796, but governments and 
nonprofit organizations did not begin developing and widely distributing 
vaccines  to prevent deadly diseases until after 1900. Thanks to vaccines, 
polio and measles became rare, and smallpox was eradicated by the 1980s. 
Vaccines are also available to prevent mumps, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, 
and whooping cough, all potentially serious diseases. As of 2019, a malaria 
vaccine is in the trial stage.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccines were 
preventing as many as 3 million deaths each year in the 21st century. However, 
the WHO also said that better vaccination coverage would save another 1.5 
million people annually. Some people were unable to get vaccinated because 
they lived in hard-to-reach areas.

Penicillium fungi are the source of penicillin, which people can take orally 
or by injection. Penicillin works by interfering with bacteria cell walls. 
Scientists began to treat humans with the drug in 1941.

Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“For the underprivileged billions in the forgotten world, hunger has been 
a constant companion, and starvation has all too often lurked in the nearby 
shadows. To millions of these unfortunates, who have long lived in despair, 
the Green Revolution seems like a miracle that has generated new hope for 
the future. . . . 
The Green Revolution has won a temporary success in man’s war 
against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully 
implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during 
the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction 
must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the Green Revolution will be 
ephemeral [temporary] only.”

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“Gender equity is defined by the World Health Organization as, µthe fairness 
and justice in the distribution of benefits and responsibilities between women 
and men,’ (Euro.who.int., 2002). When women can have control over their 
fertility, they have control of their lives which creates a society where 
gender equity can occur with all genders benefiting from the same resources. 
Contraceptive use promotes gender equality by improving the accessibility 
of education, employment and health care to women. If women are using 
contraception to postpone or prevent a pregnancy from occurring, they are 
able to stay in school and seek gainful employment upon completion.
Family planning is deeply influenced by inequality because the caliber of 
medical care between men and women is just not the same across the board. 
These gender differences are greater where women have relatively lower 
socioeconomic status than that of men (WHO, 2011; Nelson, 2011). It stands 
to reason that gender inequality intersects with other social determinants of 
health, such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, to produce health 
disparities between men and women that are similar to social divisions within 
society (WHO, 2008).”

Technological Advancements 
and Limitations—Disease
We live in a world fraught with risk from new pandemics. Fortunately,  
we also now live in an era with the tools to build a global immune system. 
—Nathan Wolfe, virologist (born 1970)
Essential Question:   How have environmental  factors affected human 
populations since 1900?
As virus specialist Nathan Wolfe pointed out, progress in science and 
medicine, combined with government-run public health measures, drastically 
reduced illnesses and deaths from many diseases after 1900. These included 
pandemics , epidemic diseases that spread across national borders.  The disease 
smallpox , for example,  had plagued the ancient Egyptians and devastated the 
native population of the Americas and Australia. As recently as the 1960s, it 
killed millions of people each year. However, the World Health Organization 
(WHO) conducted a global vaccination campaign to wipe out the disease. 
In 1979, scientists declared success. Smallpox had been eliminated from the 
planet, except for the culture kept alive at the Centers for Disease Control in 
the United States. 
Other diseases persisted, especially those related to poverty, including 
malaria, tuberculosis, and cholera. New epidemics also emerged, such as 
deadly strains of flu, HI9AIDS, and Ebola. Other conditions, such as heart 
disease and Alzheimers, became more common as people began living longer. 
Each medical problem spurred even more technological and medical advances 
to try to combat it.
Disease and Poverty
Even when cures exist, some diseases persist because the conditions of poverty 
are contributing factors. Poor housing or working conditions, contaminated 
water, and lack of access to health care are commonplace among populations 
with low incomes, and they all contribute to the spread of disease.
Malaria  A parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes in tropical areas, 
malaria  killed more than 600,000 people each year in the early 21st century. 
Most of these were young African children. The international non-governmental 
642 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONorganization (NGO) Doctors Without Borders  treated about 1.7 million 
people annually. Experts developed preventive approaches, such as distributing 
mosquito nets treated with insecticide as cover during sleep. However, people 
can still become infected during waking hours. A vaccine for malaria has been 
in development for many years, but one that is effective in most cases is still 
in trials. Nonetheless, progress has been made. In 2019, the World Health 
Organization certified Algeria and Argentina as malaria-free. The organization 
cautioned, however, that some types of mosquitoes were becoming resistant 
to insecticides.
Tuberculosis  Another disease associated with poverty is tuberculosis 
(TB), an airborne infection that spreads through coughs and sneezes and 
affects the lungs. Before 1946, no effective drug treatment was available for 
this deadly disease. Then a cure was developed involving antibiotics and a long 
period of rest. In countries where TB is common, vaccines are administered to 
children. In the early 21st century, a strain of tuberculosis resistant to the usual 
antibiotics appeared. The number of infected patients increased, especially in 
prisons, where people live in close quarters. The WHO began a worldwide 
campaign against tuberculosis in the 2010s.
Cholera  A bacterial disease that spreads through contaminated water, 
cholera causes about 95,000 deaths per year. Like tuberculosis and malaria, 
cholera affects mainly poor people in developing countries. Methods to counter 
cholera include boiling or chlorinating drinking water and washing hands. 
Although cholera vaccines are available, they do not reduce the need to follow 
these preventive measures. A severe cholera infection can kill within a few 
hours, but quickly rehydrating an exposed person can effectively eliminate the 
risk of death.

643 TECHNOLOGICAL A DVANCE MENTS AND LIMITATION S—DISEASE643Polio  Another disease caused by water contaminated by a virus 
transmitted in fecal matter, polio  once infected 100,000 new people per year. 
It could result in paralysis and sometimes death. The world cheered when 
an American researcher, Jonas Salk , announced on April 12, 1955, that an 
injectable vaccine against polio had proven effective. Six years later, an oral 
vaccine, developed by Albert Sabin , became available.  
Vaccines became the centerpiece of a global public health campaign to 
eliminate polio. A joint effort by governments, private organizations, and United 
Nations agencies began in 1988. In less than 30 years, polio was eliminated 
in all but a few countries. In places where it still exists, such as Pakistan and 
Afghanistan, war makes administering the vaccine difficult. Political unrest 
and religious fundamentalism make people fearful of programs advocated by 
outsiders. Still, the success of the campaign showed that coordinated global 
efforts could help solve global problems. (Connect: Compare the effects

Emerging Epidemics
Some diseases have emerged that caused major social disruption. In the fall of 
118, as World War I was drawing to a close, a new fight erupted. The issue 
of the Journal of the American Medical Association  published on December 
12, 1918, described the battle this way: “Medical science for four and one-
half years devoted itself to putting men on the firing line and keeping them 
there. Now it must turn with its whole might to combating the greatest enemy 
of all²infectious disease.” In fact, more soldiers died from the flu than from 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160

644 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONbattle. One quarter of all Americans and one-fifth of the world’s population 
became infected with this particularly virulent strain of the flu, which killed 20 
million people worldwide. Its victims tended to be between the ages of 20 and 
0. The effects of the flu were so disastrous that longevity in the United States 
fell by 10 years. More people died from the flu in 118±11 than had died in 
four years of the Bubonic Plague 1±151. Like the plague, the flu spread 
along trade routes and with military troops.
HIV/AIDS  Another disease outbreak causing social disruption occurred 
between 1981 and 2014. $cTuireG iPPunoGeficiency synGroPe $,'S , 
which is caused by the  huPan iPPunoGeficiency Yirus +,9 , killed more 
than 25 million people around the world. HIV weakens the immune system, 
so people more easily succumb to other illnesses. The virus is contracted 
through the exchange of bodily fluids, usually through unprotected sex, blood 
transfusions, or sharing intravenous needles. Funding for the research on the 
disease, which was associated in its early days with homosexual men and drug 
addicts, was difficult to come by, and a high percentage of its first victims died.
By the mid-1990s, however, medical researchers had developed ways to 
treat the disease but not to cure it. Antiretroviral drugs  could stop HIV from 
weakening the immune system, thus allowing a patient to live with the virus for 
many years. However, the drugs were very expensive, so access to treatment 
was difficult, particularly for patients in poor countries. Brazil is a notable 
exception. In 1996 it established a policy of providing free antiretroviral drugs 
to any person who needed them. Deaths have declined dramatically, and the 
program has actually saved the government money by lowering the number of 
hospitalizations, medical leaves, and early retirements.
After 2000, the WHO, the United States government, and private groups 
increased funding for AIDS prevention and treatment, but the disease remains 
a serious problem. In 2018, about 40 million people globally were living 
with HIV , the majority in developing countries or low-income neighborhoods 
of developed countries. Each week, more than 600 young women between 
the ages of 15 and 24 become infected with HIV , and many lack access to 
healthcare. 
Ebola  Another recent and frightening epidemic is Ebola. Discovered in 
the Congo in 1976, Ebola is a deadly disease caused by a virus that infects 
the African fruit bat, humans, and other primates. Humans get the virus from 
exposure to fluids of infected people or animals. The disease causes extensive 
bleeding, organ failure, and, for the majority of infected people, death. 
In 2014, a massive outbreak in West Africa caused fear around the world. 
However, a coordinated, intensive public health effort contained and then 
ended the outbreak. As with polio, countries demonstrated their ability to work 
together to confront a danger. The WHO took a leading role in this public 
health response, issuing emergency warnings and implementing a “road map” 
for handling the outbreaks. 
645 TECHNOLOGICAL A DVANCE MENTS AND LIMITATION S—DISEASEDiseases Associated with Longevity
Heart Disease  As longevity increases, diseases that typically do not 
develop until later in life began to assert themselves. Heart disease,  for 
example, is associated with lifestyle, genetics, and increased longevity. One of 
the major discoveries in fighting heart disease was the  heart transplant , first 
performed by the South African Christiaan Barnard  in 1967. Robert Jarvik  
led a team that designed an artificial heart , used as a temporary device while 
the patient waited for a compatible human heart. Other researchers developed 
less invasive procedures: replacing valves, installing stents in arteries, replacing 
the vessels leading to the heart, and developing medications to reduce blood 
conditions that led to heart disease. In the 2000s, people with heart disease 
lived longer than similarly affected people did in the 1970s.
Alzheimer’s Disease  As people lived longer, a form of dementia known 
as Alzheimer’s disease  that affects elderly and some middle-aged people also 
became an increasing concern. Alzheimer’s patients progressively lose their 
memory, eventually leading to a stage in which they do not recognize their 
loved ones. Since the disease undermines bodily functions, it leads to death. 
Researchers continue to search for a cure.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“The health problems faced by the world’s poorest populations are not caused 
by a lack of drugs specifically related to their problems and diseases. The real 
problem is ensuring that these populations can actually access vital medicines. 
Many governments fail their populations in this respect by imposing punitive 
tariffs and taxes on medicines, and by skewing their spending priorities in 
favour of defense over health. The governments of poor countries hinder the 
creation of wealth, imposing obstacles in the way of owning and transferring 
property, imposing unnecessary regulatory barriers on entrepreneurs and 
businesses, and restricting trade through extortionate tariffs . . . [leaving] 
poor populations without the necessary resources to access the medicines 
that could so easily transform their quality of life.
Emerging health threats, ranging from drug-resistant strains of AIDS and 
tuberculosis to avian flu, remind us of the importance of ensuring that the 
pharmaceutical industry continues to discover and develop new drugs. 
Innovation is a fragile process, and it can be weakened or thwarted by poor 
public policies.”

affected human populations since 1900.
TECHNOLOG Y AND THE ENVIRON MENT 649
9.3
Technology and the Environment
Climate change does not respect border; it does not respect who you  
are—rich and poor, small and big. Therefore this is what we call global 
challenges which require global solidarity. 
—Ban Ki-moon, UN Secretary General, 2007–2016
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of environmental  
changes from 1900 to the present?
During the 20th and 21st centuries, human agricultural, industrial, and other 
commercial activity contributed to many environmental changes that led to 
increased competition for increasingly scarce resources. These problems 
include: 
• Deforestation —the loss of Earth’s trees as a result of cutting down 
trees so the land could be used for agriculture
• Desertification —the removal of the natural vegetation cover through 
expansion and intensive use of agricultural lands in arid and semi-arid 
lands
• A decline in air quality  as a result of increased pollutants in the air
• Increased consumption of the world’s supply of fresh water
Scientists observed that, along with these changes, Earth was getting 
warmer. Ban Ki-moon, a South Korean politician and diplomat, and many 
other world leaders concluded that climate change was a global problem and 
debated the best ways to approach it through global action.
Causes of Environmental Changes
A number of interconnected factors contributed to the environmental changes 
that have taken place since 1900. 
Population Growth  In 1900, the world population was 1.6 billion. By 
1950 it had risen to 2.55 billion, and by 2000 the population was 6.12 billion. 
All of the billions more people that lived on the planet since 1900 needed to be 
fed. Growing populations led to a demand for more croplands. This increase in 
land used for agricultural purposes resulted in deforestation, soil erosion, and 
smaller habitats for many species of plants and animals. 
650 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONGrowing populations affected not only land resources but also water 
resources. Overfishing in the oceans has led to the near disappearance of cod. 
Although fresh water is a renewable resource, growing populations consume 
increasing amounts of it. 
Urbanization  Another cause of environmental change is the increasing 
size and number of cities. By some estimates, by 2025, 5.1 billion people 
will live in cities, which will pressure those who grow food to use intensive 
farming methods that deplete the soil and cause erosion or to clear more forests 
for agricultural use. City dwellers also produce vast amounts of waste, some of 
which pollutes the water they depend on. 
Globalization and Industrialization  The global reach of industrialization 
has also affected the environment. As industry spread to developing countries, 
energy and other natural resources used in manufacturing were in demand, 
drawing further on the reserves of resources. Workers in industry in these 
developing countries are creating a new middle class that increases the market 
for such products as cars that require metals and other resources and that also 
contribute to pollution. 
(σecWsRf(nYiURnPenWDl&KDnJes
While humans have always competed for raw materials and natural resources, 
this competition became more intense as industrialization spread. With an ever-
growing population, humans grappled with hunger, environmental damage, 
and global epidemics.
Resource Depletion  Since the mid-1800s, when petroleum extraction 
began in earnest and oil pumped energy into the Industrial Revolution, about 
half of the earth’s finite resources of this vital resource have been used up. With 
the rapidly growing urban and industrial population, some experts predict the 
remaining half could be used up at a much faster rate, within the next 30 to 40 
years. While supplies of coal will last longer, if coal is used to make up for the 
loss of petroleum, coal reserves could also be depleted in 60 years. (Connect: 
Evaluate the claim that the Industrial Revolutions have created dependency on 
natural resources that will soon lead to their depletion. See Topic 5.5.)
Inequality and Scarce Resources  According to the United Nations, 
31 countries are facing water scarcity and more than 1 billion people lack 
clean, accessible drinking water. As water consumption continues to increase, 
some corporate interests are depleting, polluting, and exploiting water sources. 
The World Health Organization predicts that by 2025, half of the world’s 
population will lack clean and safe drinking water. 
Water scarcity is also linked to other inequalities. Surveys from 45 
developing countries show that women and children bear the primary 
responsibility for water collection in most households. This is time not spent 
working at an income-generating job or attending school. A study in Ghana 
found that a 15-minute reduction in water collection time increases the 
proportion of girls attending school by 8 percent to 12 percent.
651 TECHNOLOG Y AND THE ENVIRON MENT 651In 2015, world leaders agreed to 17 goals for a better world by 2030. Many of 
these global goals address the environmental problems the world faced after 1900 
that relate to extreme poverty, inequalities and injustice, and climate change. 
Changes in the Atmosphere  Factories, automobiles, airplanes, and many 
other products and processes of industrialization have emitted huge amounts 
of pollutants, including carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases —those 
that build up in the atmosphere and let the heat of the sun reach Earth but 
trap it from escaping Earth. At the same time, some of Earth’s natural carbon 
trapping resources, including forests and ground cover for unused farmlands, 
are shrinking. 
Development of Renewable Energy Sources  Concerned about 
unsustainable demands for energy through  fossil fuels (coal, oil, petroleum, 
and natural gas), companies and nations began to invest in renewable energy,  
energy derived from resources that are continuously replenished, such as wind, 
solar, tidal, and geothermal power. At first, high costs slowed development 
of such sources. However, as new techniques and technologies reduced costs, 
these sources became increasingly attractive options. Renewable energy 
provides only about 7 percent of the world’s energy needs. However, a 2018 
study predicted that by 2050, half the world’s electricity will come from wind 
power and solar power.
Increasing Environmental Awareness  In 1968, the “Club of Rome”—
an organization of scientists, industrialists, diplomats, and others—formed in 
Europe to promote solutions to global challenges facing humanity. It called 
attention to concerns that resource depletion would limit economic growth. In 
many countries, people joined a Green Party  that focused on environmental 
issues. Some supported th e Green Belt Movement  to protect wilderness 
areas from urban growth. (See Topic 9.5.) By the 21st century, the Green Belt

Debates About Global Warming
Air pollutants and greenhouse gases prompted debates about rising temperatures. 
Scientists, including those on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change, cited data showing that the emissions of carbon dioxide 
and other greenhouse gases caused by the burning of fossil fuels were causing 
global warming . This is an increase in the average temperature of the world. 
Experts advised governments to reduce their countries’ carbon footprint —the 
amount of carbon dioxide that each person produces. Without a reduced carbon 
footprint, global warming would contribute to catastrophes: more powerful 
hurricanes, more severe droughts, and rising sea levels that could flood islands 
and coastal areas. Some activists argued that the term “global warming” was too 
mild to express the urgency of action. They said that humanity faced a “climate 
emergency” or “climate crisis.” 
Climate-change skeptics, in contrast, questioned whether global warming 
was happening and whether human activities had any influence on the climate. 
In addition, some people in the energy industries resisted the interference of 
government, arguing that market forces would cause consumers to reduce their 
carbon footprint if that became necessary. In contrast, other leaders of energy 
companies began planning for a shift to renewable fuel sources.
Most government leaders, however, agree that global warming requires a 
global response, but countries disagree on how to reduce carbon emissions .

United States as the world’s 
biggest emitter of carbon

carbon dioxide per person  than 
developed countries do. Therefore, 
developed countries must take the lead 
in restricting their use of fossil fuels.
Kyoto  The first major international agreement to reduce carbon emissions 
was the Kyoto Protocol , signed in 1997. Developed nations in Western Europe, 
along with the United States, argued that developing countries, such as China, 
India, Russia, and Brazil, needed to curb their rapidly increasing output of carbon 
dioxide. However, the United States refused to ratify it, and China and India 
were not required to agree to the strictest terms of the protocol. 
653 TECHNOLOG Y AND THE ENVIRON MENTGlobal Action at Paris  In 2015, 195 countries signed a deal, the Paris 
Agreement , that gave new hope for progress against global warming. Leaders 
of both the United States and China supported this new deal. However, in 2017, 
President Donald Trump announced that the United States would withdraw 
from the Paris Agreement.
Climate Activism  Increasing global temperatures led to calls to action. 
“You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their 
future in front of their very eyes,” 15-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg 
raged in a speech at a United Nations climate conference in 2018. Beginning 
with a solo protest in her native Sweden, Thunberg eventually led a global 
climate strike with more than 1.6 million participants in more than 125  countries. 
Extinction Rebellion, a climate activist group formed in 2018, engaged in 
civil disobedience in London, blocking a main bridge and key intersections for 
more than a week, chaining themselves to the headquarters of big companies, 
and interrupting “business as usual” in other ways. About a thousand people 
were arrested, but the group succeeded in having Members of Parliament call 
a citizens’ assembly to discuss ideas for addressing the climate emergency. 
Many other citizen groups are pressuring lawmakers in many countries to 
take necessary steps to avert the worst consequences of continued warming 
predicted in reports from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change.
A New Age?
What should people call the time period we live in? Traditionally, geologists 
have called the current period the Holocene epoch. Holocene  means “entirely 
recent.” This time period started about 11,700 years ago, at the end of the last 
significant ice age. 
However, some scientists believed humans have left the Holocene. They 
wanted to call the present time the Anthropocene . This term means “new 
man.” These scientists wanted to change the name because humans now affect 
almost the entire planet. In 2019, a panel of scientists voted to approve the 
name. Anthropocene  reflects the idea that humans are the strongest influence 
on Earth’s climate and environment—for better and for worse.

656 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   E N V I R O N MENTAL  CHANGE S IN DIFFERENT  
CONTEXT S
The geopolitical context of environmental change provides one lens 
through which to see complex interrelationships. Economic context 
provides another useful lens, as Sean Mcelwee explains below:
“Marx’s ideas about overproduction led him to predict what is now 
called globalization—the spread of capitalism across the planet in 
search of new markets. µThe need of a constantly expanding market 
for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of 
the globe,’ he wrote. µIt must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, 
establish connections everywhere.’ While this may seem like 
an obvious point now, Marx wrote those words in 1848, when 
globalization was over a century away. And he wasn’t just right about 
what ended up happening in the late 20th century—he was right about 
why it happened: The relentless search for new markets and cheap

Economics in the Global Age
A market economy is to economics what democracy is to government: 
a decent,  if flawed, choice among many bad alternati]es
 —Charles Wheelan, Naked Economics:  Undressing the Dismal Science  (2002)
Essential Question:   How did the global economy change and remain the 
same from 1900 to the present?
Global trade exploded with the end of the Cold War. The new global economy 
was part of a renewed emphasis on market-oriented policy advocated by leaders 
such as Ronald Reagan  in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in Great 
Britain. They advocated cutting taxes, regulations, and government assistance 
to the poor as a way to promote economic growth. As Wheeler pointed out, 
this was a flawed choice producing greater wealth for many but hardships 
for others. At the same time, revolutions in information and communications 
technology led to the growth of knowledge economies in some regions, while 
industrial production and manufacturing were increasingly situated in Asia 
and Latin America. 
Acceleration of Free-Market Economies
Globalization is interaction among peoples, governments, and companies 
around the world. The Indian Ocean trade and European imperialism are both 
examples of globalization. However, the term usually refers to the increased 
integration of the global economy since the 1970s. The Eastern Bloc nations 
that had been under Soviet control suddenly could trade freely with capitalist 
democracies. India and other countries that had been nonaligned during the 
Cold War relaxed restrictions on trade in the 1990s. This opening up of a 
country’s economy is called economic liberalization .
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher wanted free markets , which are 
economic systems based on supply and demand, with as little government 
control as possible. While Reagan and Thatcher were strongly nationalistic, 
corporations used the shift in emphasis to move jobs to countries with lower 
wages, lower taxes, and fewer regulations. Critics charged that globalization 
led to labor exploitation and environmental damage.
658 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONEconomic Liberalization in Chile  In Chile in 1973, Augusto Pinochet  
took power in a U.S.-backed coup against a democratically elected socialist 
government led by Salvador Allende. Pinochet ruled from 1 to 10. Then 
a coalition of citizens ousted him because of his violent tactics. Indicted for 
kidnapping, torture, money laundering, and murder, Pinochet died in 2006 
before he could be convicted. “We buried our democracy, and we buried 
freedom,” the Chilean author Isabel Allende said about his rule.
However, during his rule, the Chilean economy took a turn away from 
state control toward a free-market approach. Among the goals of this approach 
were privatizing formerly state-run businesses and taming the serious inflation 
Chile was experiencing. Economists known as the Chicago Boys because they 
studied under free-market economist Milton Friedman at the University of 
Chicago helped design Chile’s economic reforms. The reforms were unpopular 
because they did not address poverty and other social concerns,  and Pinochet 
used repression to enact them. Subsequent administrations, however, guided 
the economy with a balanced approach, using a combination of economic 
growth as a result of free trade and government programs to significantly 
reduce poverty. (Connect : Evaluate the success of the free-market economic 
approach of both Chile and the Soviet Bloc. See Topic 8.9.)
Chinese Economic Reforms  Economic liberalization reached China as 
well. In 1981, Deng Xiaoping  became the Chinese leader. Under him, the 
Communist Party backed away from its commitment to economic equality, 
and more actively promoted economic growth. Deng called his policy “Let 
some people get rich first.” The government took several steps to open up the 
economy, even as it kept overall control:
• It replaced communes with peasant-leased plots of land where the 
peasants could grow their own crops and sell part of them in markets. 
This reform led to agricultural surpluses instead of the famines of the 
past.
• It allowed factories to produce more products for consumers.
• It encouraged foreign companies to set up factories in special 
economic zones. Foreign firms were attracted to China because of low 
wages and lax environmental laws.
• It  reopened the Shanghai stock market and allowed private ownership 
of some businesses.
Some Chinese thought that these economic reforms should be accompanied 
by political reforms, such as freedom of speech and the press and the end 
of the Communist Party’s monopoly on political power. Political discourse 
did become somewhat freer than in the past. In 1989, however, a large but 
peaceful student-led demonstration in Tiananmen Square  in Beijing was met 
by force from the government. Soldiers using guns and tanks broke up the 
demonstrations, killing hundreds of people. (See Topic 9.5.)
659 ECONO MICS IN T HE GLOBAL AGE 659Economic Change: New Knowledge Economies
In the late 1900s, revolutions in information and communications technology 
led some countries to undertake a new kind of economy—the knowledge 
economy . A knowledge economy creates, distributes, and uses knowledge and 
information. Designers, engineers, teachers, and many others have jobs in the 
knowledge economy. In the United States, the knowledge economy is evident 
in the vast stretch of technology companies in Silicon Valley in California, 
where workers use their knowledge to create ways for other people to use 
theirs through technology, communication, innovation, and collaboration. 
Knowledge Economy in Finland  In many cases, knowledge economies 
have evolved with the explosion of information and communication technology. 
In knowledge economies, governments and investors put resources into 
research, education, innovation, and technological infrastructure. 
Finland, for example, had been an agrarian economy in the 1950s but 
followed other European countries in industrializing after World War II. 
When the Soviet Union collapsed, Finland lost one of its main customers 
of manufactured goods and faced an economic crisis. In the 1990s, Finland 
turned a corner by entering the global marketplace, encouraging competition, 
and establishing the Science and Technology Policy Council to set a direction 
of economic growth through technology and innovation. Finland experienced 
great economic growth in this endeavor and led the way in the development 
of mobile phones. By investing in education and communications technology, 
Finland was able to build on its success with mobile phones and establish 
software companies. These industries required highly educated workers, while 
outsourcing hardware production to countries with lower labor costs. 
Japanese Economic Growth  Japan followed a somewhat different 
path. After World War II, Japan implemented economic policies similar to 
18th-century mercantilist policies that were designed to increase exports and 
decrease imports, as well as policies to boost competitiveness: 
• To encourage exports, the government coordinated its finance and 
labor policies with large corporations and gave them subsidies to help 
them keep their costs low. 
• To discourage imports, the government used high tariffs and other trade 
restrictions on goods made abroad. 
• To prepare its citizens to be productive workers, Japan emphasized 
rigorous education. 
These policies, aided by large investments from the United States and other 
countries, turned Japan into a manufacturing powerhouse. 
However, Japan’s impressive growth came at a high cost for its consumers. 
Low-wage workers producing items for foreign markets often could not afford 
to buy what they made. For example, Japanese-made cars were more expensive 
660 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONin Japan than they were in the United States. Over time, Japanese unions 
became strong enough to negotiate higher wages, and international pressure 
forced Japan to relax its trade restrictions. Japan’s economy diversified, and it 
became a knowledge economy and an international center of banking, finance, 
and information technology. Although Japan’s growth slowed after the 1980s, 
Japan remained the third-largest economy in the world in 2014, behind only 
the United States and China.
Closely following Japan’s economic model were four states known as 
the Asian Tigers —Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Like 
Japan, these states prospered through government-business partnerships, high 
exports, intense education, and a low-wage workforce. The success of the 
Asian Tigers and China raised hundreds of millions of people from poverty.
Economic Continuities: Shifting Manufacturing
As the knowledge economy develops in some regions, industrial production 
and manufacturing in those regions, including in the United States, have 
declined. Manufacturing plants are increasingly located in Asia and Latin 
America rather than the United States and Europe. Countries in both Asia and 
Latin America have become known for their contributions to the textile and 
apparel industries, though they manufacture many other products. So while it 
has moved to different regions, manufacturing continues to play a key role in 
the global economy. 
Vietnam and Bangladesh  Importers who once purchased their 
manufactured goods from China have been finding other options in such Asian 
countries as 9ietnam and Bangladesh, where labor costs tend to be significantly 
lower than in China where they are already significantly lower than in the 
United States and Europe). Both Vietnam and Bangladesh have become 
known for their exports of clothing. In compounds the size of small villages 
in some places, garment manufacturers—often funded by foreign investors— 
churn out the clothes that end up on hangers in stores in developed countries. 
Clothing accounts for 80 percent of exports from Bangladesh. Phones are the 
largest export from Vietnam, worth about $45 billion in 2017, with apparel and 
electronic goods each bringing in $25.9 billion. 
Workers in both Vietnam and Bangladesh have mounted strikes in recent 
years, protesting both low wages and poor working conditions. Their pay has 
increased slightly as a result, but not enough to keep up with rising costs of 
living.
Manufacturing in Mexico and Honduras  In 1994, the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico negotiated NAFTA , the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. This agreement encouraged U.S. and Canadian industries to 
build maquiladoras  (factories) in Mexico that used low-wage Mexican labor 
to produce tariff-free goods for foreign export. Many factories hired large 
numbers of young women and exposed them to harsh working conditions. 
661 ECONO MICS IN T HE GLOBAL AGELabor unions in the United States complained that NAFTA led to the export of 
thousands of U.S. jobs to Mexico, where wages and benefits were lower and 
safety and environmental standards were weaker.
Honduras in Central America, the second largest exporter of textiles in the 
Americas, has sought to upgrade its manufacturing using principles of 
sustainability—recycling or treating its waste materials—and fair labor 
practices, including housing and education plans for workers, through business-
government partnerships. As in Vietnam and Bangladesh, considerable 
business investment comes from enterprises in South Korea and Taiwan.
Transnational Free-Trade Organizations
Several organizations contributed to the growth of the global economy in the 
decades following World War II. Some countries joined regional organizations 
such as the European Economic Community, Mercosur  (in South America), 
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) . Many countries 
signed an international accord, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) , which lifted restrictive barriers to trade. Protective tariffs , which are 
taxes on foreign imports, had been at a world average rate of 40 percent before 
GATT. By lowering and eliminating many tariffs, the agreement promoted 
more international trade and helped restore economic prosperity to war-
ravaged Europe. By the 1990s, average tariff rates had sunk below 5  percent, 
easing the movement of goods across national borders and lowering prices for 
consumers.

662 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO)  took over GATT’s 
operations. The WTO made rules that governed more than 90 percent of all 
international trade. In part because of its power, the organization became 
controversial. Its meetings were closed to the public, and its board members 
represented mostly corporate interests. Also, the organization’s rules favored 
trade over consideration of issues of moral concern. For example, through 
strict application of WTO rules, a member nation that refused to buy clothing 
made by sweatshop labor could suffer trade sanctions from the organization.
Multinational Corporations
A multinational corporation  is one that is legally incorporated in one country 
but that makes or sells goods or services in one or more other countries. The 
joint-stock companies of the Commercial Revolution, such as the British 
East India Company and Dutch East India Company (see Topic 4.5) were the 
earliest examples of multinational corporations. Multinational corporations 
were also the business means through which imperialist nations made their 
wealth during the age of imperialism, exploiting the resources and labor of the 
colonized regions for profit in home countries.
Today’s multinational corporations take advantage of both knowledge 
economies and more traditional manufacturing and industrial economies. 
They employ leading edge workers in the knowledge economy—software 
designers, communications specialists, and engineers—and at the same time 
hire low-wage workers abroad to make their products. They also have a global 
market in which to sell their goods and services. 
To free-market supporters, multinational corporations produce the greatest 
gains for both developed and developing countries. For example, in the 
early 1990s, India opened its markets and allowed in more imports. With its 
highly educated, English-speaking workforce, India became a software and 
information technology powerhouse, drawing investments from American 
and European companies that wanted to outsource jobs and lower labor costs. 
Multinational corporations, such as Microsoft  a n d  Google , also invested in 
the Indian economy. The influx of corporate wealth and foreign goods created 
a thriving consumer culture among India’s middle class, the ranks of which 
swelled tremendously after 2000. In 2014, the Indian middle class was estimated 
to be the largest of any country in the world, with more than 350 million people.
The India-based multinational corporation Mahindra & Mahindra , 
which produces cars, farm equipment, military vehicles, and electrical energy, 
is headquartered in Mumbai, India, but has operations not only throughout 
India but also in South Korea, China, Australia, the United States, South 
Africa, and other Africa nations. Some multinational corporations are 
criticized because they lack a strong national identity and therefore do not 
necessarily adhere to the ethical standards of their home country. They are 
also criticized for exploiting workers and establishing their operations in such 
663 ECONO MICS IN T HE GLOBAL AGEa way that they avoid as many taxes as possible. Mahindra & Mahindra, in 
contrast, has received awards for its socially responsible corporate practices 
and is considered one of the most trusted businesses in India.
In contrast, Swiss-based multinational Nestlé  corporation, the largest food 
company in the world, has been the subject of many controversies and 
criticisms, including purchasing cocoa for its chocolate products from suppliers 
who use child labor and engage in cocoa production on protected lands. It has 
also faced criticism for its bottled water business for its attitude toward drinking 
water as a product rather than a human right. At the same time, Nestlé invests 
in a number of research programs aimed at sustainable agriculture and training 
for farmers.

664 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONMULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Questions 1–3 refer to the passage below. 
“[Google] has become famous in India for its program of Saathis—the Hindi 
word for friend—which it launched in 2015 to help draw more women online. 
Women make up a small percentage of internet users in the country. Google 
partnered with Tata Trusts, the philanthropic arm of India’s manufacturing and 
retail conglomerate, and recruited about 60,000 so-called Saathis, all women, 
in more than 200,000 villages across India, to teach other women how to get 
online. Google trained the Saathis and gave them each a smartphone, while 
Tata pays them a stipend of about $40 a month. . . . 
Google claims the Saathis have so far trained about 22 million people, 
mostly women, in basic skills like how to make WhatsApp calls and pay bills 
online. It aims to reach about 300,000 villages by the end of this year. Several 
Saathis and their trainees have seized the chance to start cottage industries 
with their new Internet skills, downloading instructional videos on YouTube 
on how to make homemade honey or embroider shirts, for example. . . .  
µI learned how to decorate bangles with thread and stones on YouTube,’ says 
Parveen Begum, 2, whose husband, a devout Muslim, did not permit her to

“To take advantage of opportunities provided by globalization, 
firms have become multinational, establishing worldwide supply, 
production, and distribution networks. Many workers at firms that 
have successfully adapted to globalization have benefited, but large 
numbers of U.S. jobs have disappeared due to foreign competition 
or to offshoring by domestic firms. In effect, globalization means a

Calls for Reform and Responses
We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage  
of po]erty, depri]ation,  suќering,  gender and other discrimination  
—Nelson Mandela (1918–2013)
Essential Question:   How have social categories, roles, and practices 
changed and stayed the same since 1900?
In the age of global economics, global transportation and communication, and 
global devastation from war, human rights were, for the first time, also elevated 
to the level of global discourse, which challenged long-held assumptions 
about race, class, gender, and religion. Efforts to establish and safeguard 
human rights opened doors of educational and professional opportunity and 
political participation for some who had previously been excluded. People 
sought liberation from the “continuing bondage,” in Nelson Mandela’s terms, 
that had kept them in poverty. People around the globe also began to protest 
the inequalities and environmental damage that globalization had created or 
reinforced. 
An Era of Rights
In December of 1948, the United Nations laid the groundwork for an era of 
rights when it adopted a foundational document, the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights , asserting basic rights and fundamental freedoms for 
all human beings. It stated that everyone is entitled to these rights without 
distinctions based on “race, colour [color], sex, language, religion, political or 
other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.” 
The UN and Human Rights  Since its creation, the United Nations has 
promoted human rights , basic protections that are common to all people. 
As part of its humanitarian work, the UN created the United Nations 
International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF)  in 1946 to provide 
food for children in Europe who were still suffering more than a year after the 
end of World War II. In 1948, the UN formalized its position on human rights 
in the Universal Declaration. Since that time, the UN has investigated abuses 
of human rights, such as genocide, war crimes, government oppression, and 
crimes against women. 
668 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe International Court of Justice is a judicial body set up by the original 
UN charter. It settles disputes over international law that countries bring to it. 
Also called the World Court, it has 15 judges, and each must be a citizen of a 
different country. It often deals with border disputes and treaty violations.
Another main aim of the UN is to protect refugees , people who have fled 
their home countries. In times of war, famine, and natural disasters, people 
often leave their country and seek refuge in a safe location. Working through 
sub-agencies such as NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and the agency 
UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), the UN provides 
food, medicine, and temporary shelter. Among the earliest refugees the UN 
helped were Palestinians who fled the disorder when the UN partitioned 
Palestine to create the state of Israel in 18.
Global Feminism  On January 21, 2017, the day after Donald Trump’s 
inauguration as president, the Women’s March on Washington drew about 
500,000 demonstrators standing up for women’s rights and other concerns. 
However, the march drew even more power from the millions more 
demonstrators who took part in locations on every continent around the 
globe, from Antarctica to  Zagreb, Croatia and from Buenos Aires, Argentina 
to Mumbai, India. As many as five million people stood together that day 
representing a global solidarity for women’s rights. That march was the most 
dramatic sign of global feminism, but other landmark events since 1900 had 
done their part to solidify the movement.

669 CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSES669The 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women outlined many rights and protections that are cornerstones of 
global feminism:
• The right to vote and to hold office
• The right to freely choose a spouse
• The right to access the same education as men
• The right to access family planning resources and birth control. 
Cultural and Religious Movements  Discourse on rights also became 
part of cultural and religious movements. For example, the Negritude 
Movement , which took root primarily in French West Africa, emphasized 
pride in “blackness,” the rejection of French colonial authority, and the right 
to self-determination. Léopold Sédar Senghor  of Senegal wrote poems about 
the beauty and uniqueness of African culture and is now regarded as one of 
the 20th century’s most distinguished French writers. (Senghor later served as 
first president of independent Senegal. During the 120s and 10s, American 
intellectuals such as W.  E. B. Du  Bois, Richard Wright, and Langston Hughes 
wrote movingly about the multiple meanings of “blackness” in the world. What 
many now refer to as “black pride”of the 1960s had its roots in the Negritude 
Movement
Inherent rights became a focus of a religious ideology as well. Liberation 
theology , which combined socialism with Catholicism, spread through Latin 
America in the 1950s and 1960s. It interpreted the teachings of Jesus to include 
freeing people from the abuses of economic, political, and social conditions. 
Part of this liberation included redistributing some wealth from the rich to 
the poor. In many countries, military dictators persecuted and killed religious 
workers who embraced liberation theology.
However, advocates of liberation theology had a few notable successes. 
In Nicaragua, they helped a rebel movement topple a dictator and institute 
a socialist government. In 9enezuela, President Hugo Chivez was deeply 
influenced by the movement. Then, in 201, the Roman Catholic Church 
selected a cardinal from Argentina as pope, the first one from Latin America. 
The new leader, who took the name Pope Francis , reversed the Vatican’s 
opposition to liberation theology.
Steps toward Gender Equality
During the 20th century, men and women made great strides toward securing 
some of their rights and participating more fully in professional and political 
life. In the first part of the century the percentage of women who could read 
and who attended college increased, and in country after country, women won 
the right to vote. However, not all the women in a country won the right to 
vote at the same time. In the United States, for example, white women won 
the right to vote in national elections in 1920. Native American and African 
670 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONAmerican women did not have full voting rights throughout the country until 
the V oting Rights Act of 1965. Britain granted women the right to vote in 
118, but at first only women over 0 who met a property qualification could 
do so. British women did not achieve the same right to vote as men until 1928. 
In Australia, white women gained some voting rights in 1894, but aboriginal 
men and women did not gain the right to vote until 1962.

As of 2018, only the tiny country of Vatican City did not allow women 
to vote. Whether women are able to exercise their vote is another issue. In 
Pakistan, women gained the right to vote in 1. However, in 201, women 
cast only 10 percent of votes there.
Steps toward Racial Equality
In the United States, African Americans won major victories against 
discrimination and segregation. Through the 1965 Civil Rights Act,  which 
outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, 
and the 1965 Voting Rights Act , which banned discrimination in voting, the 
federal government stepped in to protect the rights of all citizens. African 
Americans also sought equality of education through desegregation of schools.
South Africa’s Colonial Legacy  South Africa’s system of apartheid , 
instituted in 1948, enforced the segregation of people based on race. Although 
white South Africans made up only 15 percent of South Africa’s population, 
apartheid reserved good jobs and other privileges for them. So-called pass 
laws  required black South Africans to carry identity documents when entering 
areas set aside for whites, which they often had to do when traveling to their 
jobs. They were banned from living in certain areas of the country. Mixed 
marriages were prohibited. Although South Africa had 11 major languages, 
671 CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSESclasses for blacks were taught only in Afrikaans, the language of many of 
the white South Africans who ruled the nation. These dehumanizing decrees 
marginalized the 85 percent of South Africans who were black, South Asian, 
or mixed race. 
The white-dominated South African government had its basis in European 
colonization of Africa in general and the Dutch and British colonization of 
South Africa in particular. The colonizers pushed the native people off the fertile 
lands and gave them no say in government. South Africans began to demand 
equal treatment. “I am not interested in picking up crumbs of compassion,” 
said Desmond Tutu , Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa, and 
human rights activist. “I want the full menu of rights.”
Challenges to Apartheid  In 1964, Nelson Mandela , a leader of the 
African National Congress (ANC) , was imprisoned for life for agitating 
against apartheid. The ANC’s primary goals were to end white domination 
and create a multiracial South Africa. Mandela’s imprisonment throughout the 
1960s, 1970s, and 1980s inspired a global movement to end apartheid. Black 
protests in South Africa, which were often peaceful, were crushed violently by 
the government’s forces. South Africa’s reputation grew worse in the eyes of 
the global community. Musicians staged concerts calling for Mandela’s release 
from prison, college students urged universities and corporations to divest 
from South Africa, and many countries voted for strict economic sanctions 
against the country. The United Nation expelled South Africa in 1974 because 
of its apartheid,
As South Africa became a pariah state  (undesirable state) in the 1980s, 
its leadership began to take notice. Mandela himself began negotiations with 
the government in 1986 while still in prison. In 1989, F. W. de Klerk  became 
the nation’s acting president. He recognized the need for change. Within six 
months, de Klerk announced Nelson Mandela’s release from prison.
Although euphoria was high in the weeks following Mandela’s release, 
apartheid remained the law of the land. Police violence against protesters 
persisted, which stalled negotiations between Mandela and de Klerk. However, 
a series of reforms in the 1990s ended apartheid. In 1994, South Africa held 
its first free elections and rejoined the United Nations. The African National 
Congress won the majority of the seats in the Parliament. The Government 
of National Unity was established with ANC members in the majority. On 
May 10, 1, Nelson Mandela was sworn in as president, South Africa’s first 
black leader.
Uniting South Africa  Immediately the Government of National Unity set 
up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) . Unlike the Nuremberg 
Trials that sought retribution for crimes against humanity committed by Nazis 
during World War II, the TRC sought to restore and establish an atmosphere 
of trust in the new multiracial South Africa. The TRC organized a series of 
19 public hearings designed to expose the truth of human rights violations that 
had occurred during apartheid, while at the same time granting amnesty to 
members of the apartheid regime who agreed to testify. 
672 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONCaste Reservation in India  The fight for civil rights was also a global 
effort as people from different races and social classes began to demand 
equality. In India, the 1949 Constitution outlawed discrimination against the 
Dalits , also known as untouchables. Pakistan outlawed discrimination against 
Dalits in 1953. Before then, many people believed that being touched by a 
Dalit required the person who was touched to undergo a cleansing ritual. 
People in India and Pakistan continued to discriminate against Dalits until 
well into the 21st century.
To open doors of opportunity to social groups or castes that had faced 
historical discrimination, the government of India established the caste 
reservation system . Through this system, the government guaranteed that a 
certain percentage of government and public sector jobs and enrollment in 
higher education would be set aside for people whose caste had conferred an 
underprivileged life.

Nelson Mandela voted for the first time in 1994, at age 76. In that 
year, he was selected as president of South Africa. 
673 CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSESHuman Rights Repression in China  
After the economic reforms of the late 1980s and 1990s, China quickly 
became an economic powerhouse. The economic liberalization, however, was 
not matched by democratic reforms. The Chinese Communist Party CCP 
ruled the People’s Republic with an iron fist. It censored the news industry 
and controlled what students were taught in primary and secondary schools. 
Such practices limited freedom of speech and thought. The CCP also required 
all nonstate organizations and groups to register with the government. 
International nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were not free to operate 
in China unless they were willing to undergo strict regulation. Opposition 
political parties did not stand a chance in China’s governing system, although 
some debate was allowed in the legislative process. Overall, however, the 
governing system was designed to thwart all challenges to the CCP’s authority. 
How could the CCP have such power" The Communists had controlled 
China since 1949. The government owned and controlled all industries. 
Government officials had killed or imprisoned those who had spoken out 
against previous government actions, such as the Great Leap Forward.
Tiananmen Square  Chinese intellectuals and students had a history of 
protesting against their government based on the May Fourth Movement in 
1919. In the spring of 1989, pro-democracy activists organized a public event 
mourning the death of a sympathetic high official. The protesters demanded 
a chance to speak with Chinese leaders about freedom of the press and other 
reforms. After the Chinese government refused to meet with the activists, 
citizens in more than 400 Chinese cities staged sit-ins, refused to attend classes, 
and began hunger strikes. Hundreds of thousands of students, professors, and 
urban workers staged a massive protest in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. After 
seven weeks of protests, the government declared martial law. It sent troops 
armed with tanks and assault weapons into Beijing. Citizens responded by 
setting up barricades to block the troops.
On June 4, 1989, the army arrived in Tiananmen Square and attacked the 
unarmed protesters. The Chinese government claimed that nobody died in 
Tiananmen Square that day. No mention of the event was included in school 
texts, and the government blocked all Web sites that discussed the Tiananmen 
Square incident and human rights abuses in China. However, estimates by 
Amnesty International, the International Red Cross , and the New York Times 
indicated that anywhere from several hundred to a few thousand civilians were 
killed. As Chinese officials continue to describe the Tiananmen event as a 
western conspiracy, Tiananmen mothers are prohibited from openly mourning 
family members who died in June 1989. The government still imprisons 
those who commemorate June 4. (Connect: Analyze the methods of protest at 
Tiananmen Square and the May 4th Movement. See Topic 7.5.)
Minority Rights in China  The communist government in China 
has struggled with the demands of the nation’s 55 ethnic minorities. Some 
prominent examples were calls by Tibetans for more autonomy or independence 
674 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONand the complaints of the Uighur people concerning religious and political 
discrimination in the northwest province of Xinjiang. 
In 2011, some of the Mongolian people in China protested against the high 
number of Han Chinese who had moved into Inner Mongolia, an autonomous 
region of northern China, and disrupted their pastoral way of life. The Han are 
the largest ethnic group in China and worldwide. The Mongolians protested 
the environmental damage that came with settled agriculture, strip-mining of 
coal, building of highways, damming of rivers, and overgrazing of land.
Steps toward Environmental Repair
People realized that part of securing their rights in a globalized world is to 
claim their environmental rights to clean water and air and a sustainable planet 
with biodiversity. A number of organizations try to identify and achieve goals 
toward guaranteeing those rights.  
Earth Day  Starting in 1970, citizens in the United States designated 
April  22 each year as Earth Day , a day for people to focus on environmental 
awareness. Organizers hoped to highlight recycling, developing alternative 
energy, eating locally grown and organic foods, and passing antipollution 
legislation. Today, about 174 countries observe and participate in Earth Day 
activities with the Earth Day Network, an environmental advocacy group. 
Greenpeace  Founded in 1971 as an organization to advocate for the 
environment, Greenpeace  grew into a multinational agency with offices in more 
than 55 countries. It battles deforestation, 
desertification, global warming, the killing 
of whales, and overfishing. Greenpeace has 
engaged in lobbying and education, but it 
became famous for its direct actions, such 
as confronting whaling boats in the ocean.
Green Belt Movement  In 1977, 
Kenyan activist Wangari Maathai  founded 
the Green Belt Movement , a direct response 
to the environmental degradation resulting 
from the colonial experience. Women in 
rural Kenya were reporting that streams 
were drying up and their food supply was 
unpredictable. The Green Belt Movement 
helped women work together to plant trees 
to improve the soil and collect rainwater. 
More than that, however, Dr. Maathai and 
the Green Belt Movement helped women 
see their capacity for making changes 
through participation in public life rather 
than leaving decisions to others. 
Source:  Wikimedia Commons
In 200, Maathai won the Nobel Prize for 
Peace, becoming the first African woman 
to do so. “We are called to assist the Earth 
to heal her wounds and in the process heal 
our own,” she said. 
675 CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSESSteps toward Economic Fairness
To counterbalance the strictly commercial interests of the powerful World 
Trade Organization (see Topic 9.4), organizations from around the world 
combined resources to create the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) in 
1989. Member organizations subscribe to the following 10 principles of fair 
trade, and the WFTO monitors its members to make sure they follow these 
principles.
World Fair Trade Organization Principles of Fair Trade

Questions 1–3 refer to the following passage. 
“To you and all the Commissioners and staff of the TRC [Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission] we say, on behalf of the nation: Thank you for 
the work you have done so far! If the pain has often been unbearable and 
the revelations shocking to all of us, it is because they indeed bring us the 
beginnings of a common understanding of what happened and a steady 
restoration of the nation’s humanity. The TRC . . . was established by an Act of  
Parliament with overwhelming support. It is composed of individuals from 
all backgrounds and persuasions. It has put the spotlight on all of us. . . .  
>W@e are confident that it has contributed to the work in progress of laying the 
foundation of the edifice of reconciliation. . . .  Reconciliation requires that we 
work together to defend our democracy and the humanity proclaimed by our 
Constitution . . . . The wounds of the period of repression and resistance are too 
deep to have been healed by the TRC alone, however well it has encouraged us 
along that path. Consequently, the Report that today becomes the property of 
our nation should be a call to all of us to celebrate and to strengthen what we 
have done as a nation as we leave our terrible past behind us forever.
Let us celebrate our rich diversity as a people, the knowledge that when 
the TRC in its wisdom apportions blame, it points at previous state structures; 
political organisations [organizations]; at institutions and individuals, but never 
at any community. Nor can any individual so identified claim that their brutal 
deeds were the result of some character inherent in any community or language 
group… Above all, we should remember that it was when South Africans of 
all backgrounds came together for the good of all that we confounded the 
prophets of doom by bringing an end to this terrible period of our history.”
Nelson Mandela, statement on receiving the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission report, October, 1998

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“I think these may be my last words. My name is Chai Ling. I am twenty-
three years old. My home is in Shandong Province. . . . The situation has 
become so dangerous. . . . If we withdraw from the square, the government 
will kill us anyway and purge those who supported us. If we let them win, 
thousands would perish, and seventy years of achievement would be wasted. 
Who knows how long it would be before the movement could rise again? The 
government has so many means of repression—execution, isolation. 
. . . I believe that democracy is a natural desire. It should guarantee human 
rights and independence, and foster self-respect—all of which people are 
entitled to.
Unfortunately, the basic human instinct for independence has been greatly 
inhibited and degraded among the Chinese. . . . The square is our last stand. If 
we lose it, China will retreat into another dark age, the people will once again 
turn against one other, with no real feelings or communication between them. 
If a nation’s own people don’t stay and help it to grow and develop, who will? 
But I will not be there to protect the square because I’m different from the 
others: my name is on the blacklist. I don’t want to die.”
Chai Ling, Interview at Tiananmen Square, 1989
(A) Identify ONE historical event that affected Ling’s argument in  
the passage. 
(B) Explain how ONE historical situation that supports Ling’s 
argument. 
(C) Explain ONE way in which struggles for democracy in China are 
similar to the struggles for democracy in South Africa.
2. Answer all parts of the question that follows. 
(A) Identify ONE way in which access to education affected social 
structures after 1900. 
(B) Explain ONE way in which people challenged old assumptions 
about race, class, gender, or religion after 1900. 
(C) Explain ONE way in which the development of the United Nations 
affected global integration after 1900.
678 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   HUM AN RIGHTS IN A DIGITAL  AGE
This topic has explored an era of human rights in the context of a 
shifting world after World War II and decolonization. The Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights assigns responsibility to each member 
nation to protect and promote the human rights of its people. 
In November 2018, the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, 
Michelle Bachelet, addressed students at the University of Geneva 
in Switzerland, situating human rights in a new context, the digital 
landscape:
“. . . [W]e are seeing increasing reports of the use of bots and 
disinformation campaigns on social media to influence the opinions 
and choices of individual voters. 
Maybe you think this doesn’t apply to us: we are too clever to be 
affected by a bunch of bots. But I am not so sure. It appears the internet 
is increasingly becoming an arena for sometimes very sophisticated 
forces for propaganda—whether by movements of violent extremism, 
or by private actors or even State authorities for political purposes. 
In such a context, can there be any doubt that our freedom to think, 
to believe, to express ideas, to make our own choices and live as we 
wish, is under threat? 
If our thoughts, our ideas and our relationships can be predicted by 
digital tools, and even altered by the action of digital programmes, 
then this poses some very challenging and fundamental questions 
about our future.”
Situate human rights in the broader context of the digital landscape. 
Identify three challenges to promoting and protecting human rights 
in this context.

Globalized Culture
What is interesting is the power and the impact of social media. . . .  
So we must try to use social media in a good way. 
—Malala Yousafzai, Pakistani human rights activist (born 1997)
Essential Question:  How has globalization changed culture since 1900?
At the start of the 20th century, political and social developments led to new 
directions in the arts. Writers, painters, and musicians developed modernism, 
a rejection of tradition in favor of experimentation and uncertainty. World  
War I, a global depression, and World War II had focused attention on survival. 
After World War II, however, citizens of wealthier nations began to develop a 
consumer culture —one in which people tended to focus more on what they 
bought and owned than on where they lived, what they did for a living, or what 
they believed. As trade restrictions loosened and new technology became more 
widely available, people worldwide began sampling arts, popular culture, 
and ideas from faraway countries. However, few could predict the global 
connectedness made possible by social media, nor its power to do both good 
and ill.
Political, Social, and Artistic Changes
Change was everywhere at the start of the 20th century. In just about every main 
field of human endeavor, new perspectives and discoveries were redefining 
the way people thought about their social and physical environments. Key 
political changes also helped shape society.
Political Changes  At the beginning of the 20th century, imperialism 
was creating sometimes fierce competition among nations. Two world wars 
raised the conflict to the level of deadly force, although allies standing together 
developed a good working relationship and understanding of one another. 
The Cold War divided much of the world into camps, stressing differences 
rather than commonalities. After the Cold War, however, both economic and 
cultural barriers fell, bringing countries closer together. In some key ways, 
collaboration gradually replaced competition as nations formed cooperative 
regional organizations such as the European Union and NAFTA as well as 
global associations such as the United Nations for conflict resolution and the 
World Trade Organization to regulate international trade.
680 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONSocial Changes  Along with these changes came social changes. 
International organizations and collaboration brought people of different 
cultures into closer contact with one another, just as international exchanges 
had done in the past. Rights movements—civil rights and women’s rights 
especially—helped bring formerly marginalized voices into the mainstream 
conversation. 
People were also questioning long-held beliefs about humans and their 
environments. Albert Einstein 18±155 and other scientists upended 
people’s understanding of physical reality. Sigmund Freud 1856±1 probed 
the invisible inner workings of the human psyche. Jean-Paul Sartre 105±
1980) philosophized that nothing had meaning. Technological developments 
in communication, transportation, and medical and other scientific knowledge 
brought change after change—from horses to cars, from telegraph to radio, 
from antibiotics to vaccines.
Artistic Changes   These changes were reflected in the visual arts, 
literature, and music of the time. Cubism, a style Picasso used in his famous 
painting “Guernica,” challenged traditional perspective in the visual arts 
(See Topic 7.4.) Stream-of-consciousness writing by such authors as Marcel 
Proust 11±122 and James Joyce 1882±11 rebelled against traditional 
narrative forms, and atonal music such as that composed by Arnold Schoenberg 
18±151 explored musical expression outside of familiar tonalities, to 
name just a few examples. Many scholars suggest these expressions were a 
response to the mechanized, urbanized society widespread in the early 1900s.
An especially vibrant expression of 20th century perspectives was the 
Harlem Renaissance, a “rebirth” of African American culture as it sought to 
distance itself from the stereotyped portrayal of African Americans in literature 
and onstage. During the Harlem Renaissance, writers, poets, musicians, and 
social activists made Harlem a thriving center of energy for black artistic 
expression. Jazz emerged and became an international language.
Global Consumer and Popular Culture 
In the 1920s, popular culture  —the culture of everyday people rather than 
the educated elite—expressed itself through new media: radio and motion 
pictures. Radio, movies, and later television created a culture shared 
throughout a nation, and eventually throughout the world. Radio provided a 
variety of programs, from easy-going comedies to music hours featuring the 
latest in big band entertainment, and during World War II it played a vital 
role in national defense in most industrialized nations. Movies provided relief 
from the anxieties and pressures of the Great Depression while reflecting it 
in its themes. Charlie Chaplin’s “Little Tramp” character of silent movies 
epitomized the down and out. 
Radio and television also ushered in the consumer culture that characterized 
much of the developed world after World War II. The “free” programming 
reaching into the homes of millions of people carried with it commercials 
681 GLOBALIZE D CULTURE681for the products of sponsors. Industry turned from wartime production to the 
manufacture of consumer products, and people around the world were eager to 
buy. In the 1990s, the internet connected people around the globe.

In the early 21st century, the United States remained the world’s most influential 
culture. Through Americanization , people the world over learned more about 
the United States than Americans learned about the rest of the world. This 
dominance of the United States created resentment among those who felt that 
American popular culture diluted their unique cultural identity. In the early 
21st century, many people around the world considered American consumer 
culture to be throwaway culture . They objected to the waste and pollution 
that was part of the focus on newer, cheaper, more disposable products.
English Spreads and Changes  Through the influence of the British 
Empire and through American movies, corporations, and scientific research, 
English became a second language in much of the world. In the early 21st 
century, about 300 million people in China were learning English—which was 
about the same as the population of the United States. 
Many English-speaking corporations moved their call centers to India and 
the Philippines, where there were large numbers of fluent English speakers 
who would work for relatively low wages. As more people from other 
countries learned English, they spoke it in new ways. For example, Indian 
English included the word prepone , which meant the opposite of postpone .
682 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONGlobal Brands and Commerce  As multinational corporations advertised 
and distributed their products, global brands  such as Apple, Nike, and Rolex 
emerged. A company called Interbrand names the top global companies each 
year based on financial performance, ability to influence consumer choice, and 
ability to command a premium price. The 2018 winners included Toyota, which 
sells more cars than any other brand; tech giants Apple, Google, Amazon, 
Microsoft, and Facebook; and the company that famously announced its desire 
to “buy the world a Coke” in its 1971 multicultural commercial, Coca-Cola.
Online commerce  makes shopping a global affair as well. Sites such as 
Amazon (in more than 17 countries) and Alibaba (mostly in Asia) make a 
massive selection of items available. The online auction site eBay operates in 
30 different countries. Although their platform is international, these online 
retailers must pay a variety of sales taxes according to the laws of each country 
or state in which they sell products. (Connect: Write a paragraph comparing 
Americanization in the 21st century with assimilation in the 19th century.  
See Topic 6.3.)
*loEal ,nfluences on 3oSular Culture  Although the United States is still 
the dominant culture internationally, influences from other cultures have been 
welcomed in the United States and elsewhere. For example, Indian musicals 
made in Bollywood , the popular name given to the film industry in Bombay 
Mumbai, enjoy popularity worldwide. Bollywood itself is a blend of film 
styles. India makes more films than any other country. 
A style of Japanese hand-drawn animation known as anime  became hugely 
influential. In 2016, 60 percent of the world’s animated T9 shows were based 
on anime. Anime was introduced to American culture in the 1980s through the 
movie Akira. Television shows in the late 1990s, such as  Pokeman and Dragon 
Ball,  brought anime into the American mainstream.
Reggae music  from Jamaica  is global in both its origins and its popularity. 
It emerged in the 1960s, blending New Orleans jazz and rhythm and blues 
styles with mento, itself a fusion of African rhythms and European elements. 
It is associated with the Rastafari religion which promotes Pan-Africanism, the 
connectedness of all Africans whether they live in Africa or in the diaspora. 
It often blended with musical traditions of other countries as its popularity 
became global in the 1970s through the music of Bob Marley.
Another style of music that fused a variety of traditions and became a 
global hit was the Korean music nicknamed K-pop . Its artists, who sang in a 
mixture of Korean and English, became global stars in the early 21st century. 
Their popularity has also boosted the popularity of other South Korean exports. 
In fact they are considered so valuable that the government has invested 
in .-Pop concerts and tours. Internet-based streaming video  sites such as 
YouTube and 9imeo helped popularize .-Pop and other musical styles with a 
global audience.
Social Media and Censorship  Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and other 
forms of social media  changed communication. They can inspire but also 
manipulate, as attested to by Malala Yousafzai , the Pakistani activist and the 
youngest Nobel Prize laureate. People debated their power for good or ill.
683 GLOBALIZE D CULTUREIn some countries, such as China, the government banned social media 
from outside the country. However, China allowed its own forms of social 
media, including WeChat, Weibo, and YuKu. The government censored any 
criticism of the Communist Party that appeared on these platforms.
Global Culture in Sports  The globalization of popular culture included 
sports as well. The establishment of the modern Olympic Games  in 1896 
reflected an early sense of internationalism. In 2016, the Olympics in Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil, attracted about 3.6 billion viewers worldwide. 
Soccer emerged as the most popular sport in the world, in part because 
it required so little equipment that it could be played almost anywhere. The 
World Cup  soccer competition rivaled the Olympics as a global event. 
Basketball also became a global game, and players such as Michael Jordan and 
LeBron James became internationally known. In 2014, the National Basketball 
Association (NBA) included players from 30 countries or territories. In 2017, 
reporters from 35 countries covered the NBA Finals. In 2018, 27 percent of 
major league baseball players were foreign-born, from 21 different countries.
As sports became more popular globally, they also became more available 
to women. Some Muslim female athletes  —including fencers, weightlifters, 
beach volleyball players, hockey players, and figure skaters²competed while 
wearing hijab, known in English as a headscarf. They adapted athletic wear 
so they could compete while following traditional Muslim practices regarding 
female modesty in clothing. Hajar Abulfazi, a soccer player from Afghanistan, 
explained that she wore the hijab to “show the next generation and their parents 
how Afghan women and girls can maintain respect for religion and culture 
while pursuing sports achievements.”
Source:  Thinkstock
Since Olympic athletes represent their home nations, the games demonstrate the strength of 
nationalism. However, since the Olympics draws people together from nearly every country 
in the world, it is also an example of internationalism. 
684 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONGlobal Culture and Religion
Globalization promoted new religious developments. In the 1970s, former 
Beatles band member George Harrison released a song containing the words 
of a Hindu mantra, or sacred utterance. This launched the popularity of the 
Hari Krishna  movement, which was based on traditional Hindu scriptures. 
It quickly gained popularity in the United States and Europe. In what some 
called New Age  religions, forms of Buddhism, shamanism, Sufism, and other 
religious traditions were revived and adapted for a largely Western audience. 
In China in the 1990s, Falun Gong,  a movement based on Buddhist and 
Daoist traditions, gained popularity. Although the communist government 
allowed the movement at first, Chinese authorities began to restrict it in 1. 
The suppression prompted international protests against the Chinese regime 
for human rights abuses.
In the early 21st century, most people around the world identified with 
some form of religion. However, an increasing number of younger people in 
many countries identified as nonbelievers . They were not necessarily atheists 
(people who do not believe in any god) or agnostics (people who believe that 
it may not be possible to know if God exists. Most were simply not affiliated 
with any religious institution.

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that 
follows.
“Western leaders exploited the lure of their popular culture during the Cold 
War. They created radio and television stations such as Radio Free Europe 
Radio Liberty to broadcast as much popular culture material into the Soviet 
bloc as could be programmed. This programming was done to achieve the 
very purpose the Soviets accused it of: to westernize the values of those who 
watched or listened to it. . . . 
In using American pop culture as a tool of the Cold War, Western policymakers 
were exploiting what political scientist Joseph Nye has referred to as µsoft 
power.’ The notion of soft power refers to cultural, social, intellectual, and 
ideological ideas, values, attitudes, and behaviors that influence human life. 
Nye distinguishes these soft forms of power from µhard power,’ which is 
typically associated with the use of violent, coercive tools of social action like 
armies and economic sanctions. Soft power is a significant factor in global 
politics, Nye argues. . . . As such, it provides a way for one people—in the 
case of the Cold War, people in the political West—to change the attitudes 
and behaviors of other cultures without resorting to war or other forms of 
coercion.”

The globalization that began in about 1960 was actually the second 
wave of globalization. The first occurred between the years 180 and 
1914, engendered by the Industrial Revolution and the search for new 
markets and brought to a halt by the beginning of World War I.

Resistance to Globalization
The whole of the global economy is based on supplying the cravings of two 
percent of the world’s population. 
—Bill Bryson, nonÄction  writer (born 1951)
Essential Question:   What were the various responses to globalization from 
1900 to the present? 
While globalization of culture has in many ways raised awareness and 
appreciation of cultural diversity, the economics of globalization have led to 
serious concerns. Resistance to globalization has come from non-governmental 
and governmental sources. A network of opponents to economic globalization 
promotes equal distribution of economic resources, challenging the lopsided 
economy described above by author Bill Bryson. Participants contend that 
corporations and global financial institutions, such as the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF)  and the World Trade Organization (WTO) work to 
maximize profit and sacrifice safety and labor conditions, environmental 
conservation needs, and national independence. 
Some countries, such as North Korea, have resisted economic and cultural 
globalization. Others, such as Saudi Arabia and China, have resisted cultural 
globalization, particularly through controlling the internet. These countries want 
goods and money to flow freely among nations, but they are more restrictive of 
how people and ideas cross borders.
The Roots of Globalization and Anti-Globalization
Globalization affected the relationships among and within nations. After  
World War II, several organizations contributed to the growth of a global 
economy. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the European 
Economic Union, Mercosur (in South America), and the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) all formed between 1947 and the early 1990s. These 
organizations were meant to help economies and expand prosperity. Falling 
tariff rates eased the movement of goods across national borders. 
In 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO) took over GATT’s operations. 
The WTO makes rules for more than 90 percent of international trade. The 
rules and its closed board meetings led people to believe that the WTO did not 
care for their welfare. (Connect: Compare the economic practices of the 17th 
century to globalization in the 20th and 21st centuries. See Topic 4.5.)
689 RESISTANCE TO GLOBALIZATIONThe “Battle of Seattle”  In 1999, protests erupted at a WTO conference 
in Seattle. The WTO had planned a round of trade negotiations for the new 
millennium. Then more than 40,000 protesters arrived. Special interest groups, 
including labor unions, family farmers, student groups, and environmentalists 
shut down the WTO’s meeting and drew global attention to the issues of the 
new global economy. Anti-WTO demonstrations took place in dozens of other 
countries as well.
Many people consider the Seattle protests to be the beginning of the anti-
globalization movement. They were also one of the first social movements to 
be coordinated through the internet. However, the WTO itself remained 
powerful. China joined in 2001, increasing the group’s territorial and economic 
reach.

Seattle, Washington.  
Why Resist Globalization? 
Why did people protest globalization when it made goods and services more 
freely available? Opponents had different reasons. Many of them centered on 
the idea that consumers who buy products and services with a few clicks often 
have no idea who creates those products and services and what the short-term 
and long-term costs really are. A series of scandals in different parts of the 
world showed some of the hazards of globalization. Working conditions are 
especially problematic
• Much of the chocolate that consumers bought in the early 21st century 
had its origins in child labor  in West Africa. The largest chocolate 
companies missed deadlines in 2005, 2008, and 2010 to make sure 
their suppliers did not use child laborers. In 2015, the U.S. Department 
of Labor estimated that more than 2 million children took part in 
dangerous labor in the cocoa-growing regions of the world.
690 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• Working conditions in Western nations could also be harsh. In 2019, 
employees of Amazon ’s warehouses described such intense pressure 
to fulfill orders that workers risked being fired if they took a bathroom 
break. At the time, Amazon employed more than 600,000 people and 
another 100,000 at holiday time, though not all of them worked in 
warehouses. 
• In 2013, the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory , an eight-story 
building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, shocked the world. More than 1,000 
people died and another 2,500 suffered injuries. Most of the dead and 
injured were female garment workers who made clothing for Western 
companies. Muhammad Yunus , a Bangladeshi who won the Nobel 
Prize for Peace, called the disaster “a symbol of our failure as a 
nation.” He suggested that companies worldwide set an international 
minimum wage.
Source:  Wikimedia Commons
The Rana Plaza collapse is considered the deadliest structural failure accident in modern 
human history, and therefore also the deadliest garment-factory disaster in history.
Environmental Damage  Critics of globalization pointed out that the 
fuel involved in shipping products vast distances increased the amount of 
greenhouse gases in the environment, thus worsening the climate emergency. 
Also, in the early 21st century, Brazil cut down thousands of square miles of 
rainforest each year to make way for cattle farms. The meat was one of the 
country’s most valuable exports.
691 RESISTANCE TO GLOBALIZATIONProponents of globalization argue that it can help the environment. They 
point out that Costa Rica and other nations have developed ecotourism  
industries that make profits while showing off the country’s natural wonders.
Threats to National Sovereignty  Many liberal groups believe that 
globalization often harms children, workers, and the environment. However, 
many conservative groups also distrust globalization.
In 2016, 52 percent of British voters agreed to leave the European Union, 
an international political and economic organization of 28 countries. This 
British exit was nicknamed Brexit . Britain was a founding member of the EU 
in 1993, but conservative British politicians argued that the EU interfered with 
Britain’s right to govern itself. Many Brexit proponents contended that the EU 
required Britain to accept too many immigrants. 
Negotiations to leave the EU broke down when British prime minister 
Theresa May  was unable to craft a deal that was acceptable to her own political 
party, let alone to the other 27 nations in the EU. May resigned in 2019. Brexit 
critics believed that leaving the EU would be economically disastrous for 
Britain, an island nation that depended on imports.
Economic Resistance
Critics of globalization believe that international agreements and institutions 
can destroy small local businesses. Large corporations could use the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the WTO to achieve their goals, 
but local individuals and businesses could not. For example, many small 
businesses and individuals could not cross state lines or national borders. They 
could not extract the natural resources they needed or use the wide variety of 
labor sources that big corporations and transnational businesses used. In an 
attempt to combat globalization, some businesses, especially restaurants, have 
insisted on providing their customers locally grown or made products. 
Globalization critics also distrusted the World Bank, an international 
organization affiliated with the United Nations. The bank’s mission is to 
improve the economic development of member states. In 1988, about 20,000 
people protested meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in West Berlin. 
Protesters insisted that these agencies favored richer nations over poorer ones. 
In 2001 and 2002, anti-IMF and anti-World Bank protests took place in 23 
countries, including many of the world’s poorest nations. In 2014, the World 
Bank made reforms to its structure and governance, but critics maintained that 
the world’s richest nations controlled the bank.
What Measures Do Anti-Globalists Favor?  The anti-globalization 
movement has grown into a social movement as well. Its followers tend to 
focus on these issues:
• Human rights , which are basic freedoms that every person has, such 
as freedom from slavery and freedom to express opinions
692 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• Fair trade , which is a system that ensures the person who provided the 
good or service receives a reasonable payment for it
• Sustainable development , which means business ventures that allow 
people and companies to make a profit without preventing future 
generations from meeting their own needs
• Debt relief  or debt restructuring  so that countries that owe huge sums 
to the IMF do not have to risk economic breakdown
Anti-Globalization and Social Media 
Anti-globalization activists have used the internet to perpetuate and spread 
their ideas in nearly every country on Earth. However, access to global 
communication through social media outlets has met resistance in some 
countries. In 2009, more than 1,000 rioters clashed with police in the city of 
Urumqi, China. The unrest resulted from tensions between members of the Han 
ethnicity and members of the Uighur  ethnicity, most of whom are Muslim. 
Chinese authorities blamed the riots on the growth of social unrest based on 
Twitter and Facebook and banned both platforms. The government introduced 
a new platform called Weibo  as a substitute. It could stream incoming posts 
while tracking and blocking “sensitive” content. Weibo has become a vehicle 
of negotiation between the Chinese government and its citizens.
In some other countries, governments allow social media platforms but 
influence or control their content. For example, critics contend that Saudi 
Arabian officials use Twitter and Facebook to harass and intimidate citizens. 
“If the same tools we joined for our liberation are being used to oppress us 
and undermine us, and used to spread fake news and hate, I’m out of these 
platforms,” explained Manal al-Sharif , a women’s rights activist. 
In some parts of the world, resistance to participating in an interconnected 
society persists. The coming together of economies and cultures threatens 
some people’s and governments’ sense of autonomy and identity.

694 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONSHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that 
follows.
“Critique of, and resistance to, the spread of consumer culture is as old as the 
emergence of consumer culture in the 18th century. Systematic critique of the 
institutional bases of consumer culture have been offered by social theorists 
that highlight the alienating dehumanizing effects of materialism, while 
others have commented on the envy, possessiveness, and non-generosity . . . 
consumer culture sometimes entails. . . .
Religious, environmentalist, nationalist, and anti-corporate critiques have 
emerged with considerable vigor. Many of these forms of resistance appear to 
be motivated by a global sense of anxiety about the risk to life and happiness 
provoked by the globalization of consumer culture itself. In one global 
study of global brands, the authors found µThirteen percent of consumers 
are skeptical that transnational companies deliver higher quality goods. They 
dislike brands that preach American values and don’t trust global companies 
to behave responsibly. Their brand preferences indicate that they try to avoid 
doing business with transnational firms.’”
Jagdish Sheth and Naresh Maholtra, “Global Consumer 
Culture” in Encyclopedia of International Marketing
(A) Identify ONE thinker from the 18th and 19th centuries who might 
have views consumer culture as described in the passage.
(B) Explain ONE reason some consumers avoid transnational firms, 
according to the authors.
(C) Explain ONE way in which globalization increased despite growing 
resistance in the late 20th century. 
2. Answer all parts of the question that follows. 
(A) Identify ONE example of a state government that resisted 
globalization after 1900. 
(B) Explain ONE social reason for resistance to globalization after 
1990.
(C) Explain ONE reason for resistance to global financial institutions 
after 1990.

Institutions Developing in a 
Globalized World
We have actively sought and are actively seeking to make the United Nations 
an eќecti]e instrument  of international  cooperation  
—Dean Acheson, U.S. diplomat, (1893–1971)
Essential Question:   How did globalization change international interactions 
between states after 1900?
In an era of increasing globalization, people formed international organizations 
to promote useful working relationships among nations. Dean Acheson, 
a U.S. secretary of state, described how the mission of the United Nations 
UN fit with this goal of maintaining world peace and making international 
cooperation easier. Working through agencies such as the IMF (International 
Monetary Fund) and the World Bank, the UN provides technical advice and 
loans to developing nations. Other international organizations and treaties, 
such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), promote free trade worldwide. However, the United 
Nations was born of the devastation of world wars and preventing conflict was 
its primary goal.
The United Nations: A Structure for Peace
Despite ideological differences, the Allies shared a commitment to preventing 
conflicts from escalating into war. In 1, representatives of the United 
States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China discussed the idea of the 
United Nations. The UN was born on October 24, 1945, a day still honored as 
United Nations Day. At its founding, there were 51 member states. By 2019, 
that number had grown to 193.
League of Nations vs. United Nations  Countries had tried to create a 
similar international organization previously. In 1920, at the end of World War  I, 
the Allied powers created the League of Nations. (See Topic 7.3.) Its purpose 
was to resolve international disputes and prevent another world war. However, 
the United States never joined the League. Some Americans believed that doing 
so would undercut U.S. authority. The League disbanded after it failed to prevent 
World War II. Countries hoped that a new, more powerful organization would 
697 INSTITUTION S DEVELO PING IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLDhelp keep the peace. This time around, all the major powers realized they would 
need to belong for the organization to have any chance of success. 
Assemblies of the United Nations
Within the UN, six main bodies implement its work.
• The General Assembly  is the only UN body in which all members 
have representation. It decides important questions on peace and 
security, admission of new members, and budget. To make a decision, 
a two-thirds majority of those present and voting must agree. Each 
member nation has one vote. 
• The Security Council acts on issues the General Assembly debates. 
It may even use military force against a country accused of violating 
UN principles. The Security Council has five permanent members, the 
leading Allies of World War II: the United States, France, Great Britain, 
Russia, and China. It elects 10 other members on a rotating basis. Each 
permanent members has veto power in the Security Council. Granting 
veto power to these five nations was controversial in 1945. Other 
nations resented giving them so much power. Conflicts among these 
five often prevented the UN from taking action to confront problems.
• The Secretariat  is the UN’s administrative arm.  The secretary 
general leads and influences the entire organization. He or she usually 
comes from a small, neutral nation so one of the more powerful 
countries cannot have an outsize influence on what the UN does. All 
five permanent members of the Security Council must approve the 
secretary general’s selection. Staffers of the Secretariat must take an 
oath of loyalty to the UN and are not allowed to receive instructions 
from their home countries.
• The International Court of Justice settles disputes countries bring 
to it about international law. The court has no power to enforce its 
decisions, but the Security Council may make recommendations or 
take action in response to a judgment. Most countries obey the court’s 
decisions. 
• The Economic and Social Council is the largest and most complex 
part of the UN. It directs economic, social, humanitarian, and cultural 
activities. In the early 21st century, the council promoted green energy 
and looked for ways to raise people’s wages in poorer countries.
• The Trusteeship Council supervised the governments of trust 
territories, including land that is now Israel, Papua New Guinea, 
and Nauru. The council’s mission was to help those areas become 
self-governing and independent. The last trust territory, Palau, 
became independent in 1994. Since then, the council has suspended 
its operations. Some people have suggested that the council should 
become trustees of the seafloor or of outer space. 
698 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe UN and Human Rights
One of the goals of the United Nations was the promotion of human rights. 
The UN adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  in 1948. It 
included several basic rights and freedoms:
• freedom from slavery, torture, and degrading punishment
• equality before the law
• the right to a nationality
• the right to own property, either individually or with others
• freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion, and expression
• equal pay for equal work
• the right to rest and to enjoy paid holidays
• equal rights for children born within and outside of marriage
• the right to adequate food, clothing, shelter, health care, and education
The declaration was a milestone achievement. Individuals from different 
countries, cultures, and legal traditions came together to draft a document that 
set standards for all governments and all people. People have translated the 
declaration into more than 500 languages. Since 1948, the UN has investigated 
abuses of human rights, such as genocide, war crimes, government oppression, 
and crimes against women.
Keeping the Peace
Since the end of World War II, the United Nations has been well known 
for its peacekeeping  actions. Of primary importance is prevention through 
diplomacy. The UN sends special envoys to help resolve problems peacefully, 
mindful that it was formed to prevent “the scourge of war.”
The organization has also frequently sent peacekeeping forces, consisting 
of civilians, police, and troops from member countries, to try to ease tensions 
in trouble spots. The first peacekeeping mission was related to the 18 Arab-
Israeli conflict in Palestine. After that, UN peacekeepers served in the Congo, 
Lebanon, East Timor, and the Balkans. 
Expansion in the 1990s  In 188, the UN had only five active peacekeeping 
operations. By 1993, it had 28. Individual countries supplied soldiers to form 
UN peacekeeping forces. They came from dozens of countries—including 
Canada, Venezuela, Ukraine, Egypt, and Bangladesh. The soldiers were 
usually lightly armed and instructed to return fire only if attacked.
In the 1990s, the United Nations sent peacekeeping missions to hotspots 
in Africa, Central America, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. In Africa, UN 
troops kept peace while Namibia changed from a South African colony to an 
independent state. Peacekeeping troops helped end devastating civil wars in 
699 INSTITUTION S DEVELO PING IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLDMozambique, El Salvador, and Cambodia. In Haiti, they maintained peace 
while a democratic government replaced a military dictatorship.
Some efforts failed. In 1994, UN peacekeepers could not prevent massacres 
in Rwanda. In 1995, UN forces withdrew from Somalia while a civil war raged 
there. The struggle to bring order to Bosnia in the former Yugoslavia took 
years and had mixed results. As a UN officer in Bosnia observed, “It’s much 
easier to come in and keep peace when there’s some peace around.”
Challenges for Peacekeeping Missions  One problem faced by UN 
peacekeepers has been their slow response. By the time countries agree on 
the UN mission and send forces, the war might have grown and become hard 
to control. A second problem happens when people expect the peacekeeping 
troops to stop the fighting instead of simply monitoring a truce, running 
free elections, and providing supplies to civilian populations. By 2019, the 
United Nations was involved in fewer but larger peacekeeping missions. The 
number of missions had dropped to 15, but the number of troops involved had 
increased .

700 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONOther UN Priorities
In addition to assemblies and peacekeeping, the UN has other missions.
Protecting Refugees  The UN also protects refugees. In times of war, 
famine, and natural disasters, people often flee their country and seek 
refuge in a safer location. Working through partners such as NGOs (non-
governmental organizations) and the agency of UNHCR (United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees), the UN provides food, medicine, and temporary 
shelter. Among the earliest refugees the UN helped were Palestinians who fled 
the disorder following the UN partition of Palestine to create the state of Israel 
in 18. In 201, the UN helped refugees who fled 9enezuela and Myanmar.
Feeding the Hungry  In 1961, the UN established its World Food 
Program (WFP)  to provide food aid. Its first missions were in Iran, Thailand, 
and Algeria in 162. Since its founding, the WFP has fed more than 1. billion 
people, many of whom were affected by natural disasters or political unrest.
Supporting Education, Science, and Culture  Fighting in World War  II 
destroyed schools, libraries, and museums in many European countries. In 
1945, the UN created the 8niteG 1ations (Gucational Scientific anG 
Cultural  Organization (UNESCO) . After repairing war damage, UNESCO 
began to focus on developing literacy, extending free education, and protecting 
cultural and environmental sites by designating them World Heritage Sites. 
The United Kingdom, Singapore, Israel, and the United States have all left 
UNESCO in disputes over politics and priorities. Although the UK and 
Singapore rejoined the organization, as of 2019 the United States had not. 
Other UN Missions  The UN also created the World Health Organization, 
which improves human health by controlling epidemics and providing 
vaccines. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) was created to help 
children after World War II. After that, the fund provided aid to children in 
the developing world and at disaster sites. The UN program Human Rights 
Watch (HRW)  has monitored human rights abuses in 100 countries. HRW 
uses the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as its guide and advocates 
for policies that prevent abuses.
The Global Goals  In 2015, the UN General Assembly set 17 goals to 
accomplish by 2030. These included wiping out hunger and poverty, achieving 
gender equality, ensuring clean water and sanitation for all, and fighting 
climate change. On this project, the UN worked with NGOs, including the 
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (Connect: Evaluate the success of the 
United Nations in handling political crises compared to its success in dealing 
with other priorities. See Topic 8.5.)
International Financial NGOs
Several NGOs have worked closely with the United Nations on economic 
issues. Each NGO was independent and caused controversy. 
701 INSTITUTION S DEVELO PING IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLDThe World Bank  Created in 1944, the World Bank fought poverty by 
providing loans to countries. It first focused on dams and roads. Later it expanded 
its mission to social projects, such as education and disease prevention. Critics 
charged that the World Bank often ignored how its projects damaged the 
environment and local culture. For example, a dam might permanently flood 
many farms. A highway might promote growth, but the resulting profits might 
all go to investors overseas rather than people living in the region.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF)  Created in 1945, the IMF  
was designed to help a country’s economy by promoting stable currency 
exchange rates. It focused on making short-term loans and providing economic 
advice to countries. Some economists argued that conditions on IMF loans 
failed to take into account each country’s individual needs. Large, wealthy 
nations influenced the IMF. It acted on their behalf, critics insisted, even while 
it claimed to help developing nations. 
The IMF and the World Bank worked together to create Pathways for 
Peace in 2018. This report described how countries could work together to 
prevent violent conflicts.
NGOs Separate from the UN
Although the UN is well funded and powerful, other NGOs also help maintain 
world peace and improve communication among countries during a time of 
globalization. For example, the International Peace Bureau  was founded in 
181 and won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 110. It began working for nuclear 
disarmament in the 1980s. It also lobbied governments to reduce military 
spending. By 2019, it had 300 member organizations in 70 countries. The chart 
on the next page lists other international organizations committed to peace and 
cooperation.

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“Whatever the international tensions and the UN shortcomings, the existence 
of the United Nations as an institution for all countries created a sense of being 
part of a world-wide community and helped develop a global consciousness. 
For developing countries, the United Nations provided a political arena and 
spearheaded their struggle for decolonization and political emancipation, 
engendering a feeling of empowerment and importance, and providing a 
means of participating on the world stage as equals. . . . 
The norms and standards set by the United Nations specialized agencies 
have enriched life, both nationally and internationally. The smaller and more 
technical specialized agencies like the International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the International 
Civil Aviation Organization ICAO, the Universal Postal Union UPU, etc. 
have, through their standards and regulatory regimes, helped in maintaining 
international order in such diverse areas as meteorology, communications, 
aviation, etc. Successive global conferences convened by United Nations 
organizations have helped to identify and focus global attention on new 
problems relating to such issues as environment, population, energy, science 
and technology, food and nutrition and women’s place and role in society and 
social development in general.”

705 INSTITUTION S DEVELO PING IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLDTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   C OMPARE TWO ARG UMENTS ON THE 
UNITE D NATION S
Is the United Nations still relevant? That was the question posed in 2006 
by the University of Pennsylvania Law Review as part of its Debate 
series. Two law professors participated in the written debate. Excerpts 
from their conflicting answers to that question appear below.
Read the following two statements on the United Nations. Explain in 
your own words the gist of each one. Then compare the arguments 
and write a few sentences summari]ing the differences Eetween them
“The UN offers . . . the possibility for wide, and sometimes even 
universal, participation in the creation of the legal rules that regulate 
international affairs. Every state is represented at the UN and can 
be included in the processes of international lawmaking. While 
it is true that bilateral or regional agreements may result in deeper 
levels of commitment—greater synergies of interests are likely to 
be found amongst smaller numbers of states—the challenges and 
dangers the global community faces today demand the near universal 
participation in legal regimes made most possible through the UN. 
Whether international law seeks to regulate the Internet, respond to 
global warming, combat international terrorism, or address pandemic 
diseases, the exclusion or defection of only a small number of states 
may well render the broader enterprise of legalization worthless. 
A handful of serious polluters, a few safe havens for terrorists, or 
even one epicenter of disease outbreak may well undermine an 
otherwise global legal regime. The UN, with its broad reach, its all-
encompassing membership, and its agenda-setting potential may well 
be the best (and perhaps the only) hope for developing universal legal 
regimes that can effectively respond to these new challenges.”
William Burke-White, University of Pennsylvania 
Law School2. Answer all parts of the question that follows. 
(A) Identify ONE way in which international interactions affected 
human rights issues in the late 20th century.
(B) Identify ONE way in which globalization changed international 
interactions in the late 20th century. 
(C) Explain ONE way in which an international organization, other 
than the UN, furthered international cooperation in maintaining 
world peace in the late 20th century. 
706 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION“Professor Burke-White points to various global problems²WMD 
[weapons of mass destruction] proliferation, terrorism, infectious 
disease, and the like. He does not claim that perfect solutions may 
be found for these problems . . . He argues only that no international 
institution can take certain kinds of lawmaking steps regarding these 
issues better than the UN. He shows that the UN has taken many 
such lawmaking steps and that proponents hope that such steps will 
lead to reducing the net harm produced by these problems. He thus 
concludes that the UN is “urgently needed.” Nowhere does he actually 
demonstrate that these lawmaking steps actually reduce the net harm 
produced by the problems. Indeed, if one looks at the actual examples 
cited by Professor Burke-White, it seems clear that the UN has not 
had a positive effect at all.
“Despite an impressive outpouring of words, the UN has done little 
effectively to address the problems mentioned by Professor Burke-
White—like terrorism prevention, global climate change, and 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction—and in some ways has 
even exacerbated them. The UN has done nothing to prevent North 
Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons, and it seems highly unlikely 
that the UN will do anything effective to prevent Iran from completing 
its plans to obtain such weapons. The UN has played a useful role in 
collecting some kinds of information about Al Qaeda, but has actually 
undermined other antiterror efforts.”

CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE  IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLD707

Continuity and Change  
in a Globalized World
;oday, no country can e]er truly cut itself oќ from the global media or from 
external sources of information; trends that start in one corner of the world  
are rapidly replicated thousands of miles away . . .
—-rancis  -uRuyama,  political scientist (born 1952)
Essential Question:   How did science, technology, politics, justice, 
transportation, communication, and the environment 
change and stay the same after 1900?
One perspective shared by many scholars is that the 20th and 21st centuries 
were periods of unprecedented change. One factor in bringing about this 
transformation was the pace of discovery in science and the number of 
technological achievements made since the turn of the 20th century. These 
scientific and technological advancements led to changes in society, politics, 
economics, culture, and the environment. While many outcomes of these 
advancements were positive, they also included some unintended consequences 
that had negative impacts. Responses to these outcomes were varied.
Advances in Science and Technology
People made significant advances in understanding the universe and the natural 
world. These included:
The Origin of the Universe  Several scientific theories tried to determine 
how the universe began. One of the best-known and best-supported theories 
was the Big Bang . This theory, that the universe started with one single cosmic 
event, led to a better understanding of the universe as well as atomic and 
subatomic science.
Wave Science  Discoveries extended human knowledge and use of radio, 
light, sound, and microwaves. These breakthroughs led to improvements in 
radio and cellular communications as well as faster internet service. 
Medical Science  Experts made discoveries about germs, viruses, 
diseases, and the human body. These discoveries led to cures or vaccines for 
common diseases such as polio, tuberculosis, and tetanus. Experts pioneered 
708 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONnew treatments for chronic diseases such as cancer and arthritis. The discovery 
of antibiotics, such as penicillin, helped people recover from or prevent 
infections. Reliable methods of birth control allowed women to control the 
size of their families. These and other medical advancements meant that 
people could live longer and better lives.
Energy Technologies  Inventors and entrepreneurs made advancements 
in extracting and producing oil. Nuclear power  became a significant source of 
energy. Renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, and thermal energy, 
became much cheaper to produce. In 2018, the International Renewable Energy 
Agency predicted that renewable energy sources would be consistently cheaper 
than fossil fuels by 2020. The increase in sources of power led to increased 
productivity, greater production of material goods, and faster transportation.
Communication Technologies  In the 20th century, radio and television 
technology was further developed and telephone coverage increased so that 
most people eventually had a telephone in their homes. Internet communication 
and cell phones then replaced the older systems of communication. As a result, 
the amount and extent of mass communications increased, as did the global 
transfer of information.
Source:  Wikimedia Commons (Left), Getty Images (Right). 
Technology advanced from voice communication over wires to massive amounts of data 
available almost anywhere.
709 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLD Transportation Technologies  Airplanes were invented in the first years 
of the 20th century. Later, jet airplanes closed the distance between regions of 
the world. Shipping technology improved, with faster and larger ships carrying 
prefabricated shipping containers. These ships and planes could transport more 
goods farther and faster than ever before. Improved transportation technology 
resulted in the expansion of the global trade network and interactions among 
cultures.
Agricultural Technologies  Scientists produced genetically modified 
crops that were more resistant to drought and disease and had higher yields. 
The most significant effect of these advances, known as the Green Revolution, 
was higher population growth rates, especially within developing countries. 
Another effect was the decline in biodiversity, as these genetically modified 
crops began to be cultivated at the expense of local crop types.
Changes in a Globalized World
Partly as a result of the advances in science and technology, the world 
experienced a number of significant changes to societies, economies, politics, 
cultures, and the environment. 
Social Changes  During this period, the world’s population grew faster 
than at any previous time in history. The increase in population meant increasing 
challenges to existing social orders. The greatest growth rate in population 
occurred in developing countries, while developed countries saw a slowing of 
their population growth. In the developing countries, the population growth 
rate was largest in the lower socioeconomic classes. Improvements in 
communication and transportation made it easier for people to migrate from 
less developed countries to more developed ones. That led to a “brain drain” 
in some countries as more highly educated and skilled people left their home 
countries to find jobs elsewhere. 
Girls and women in this era began to experience an increase in 
socioeconomic status, especially in the more developed countries. Women 
in these societies began to enter careers traditionally reserved for men. 
Their right to vote in elections was finally legalized, and in some cases w 
omen held the highest political offices in their nations. Because birth 
control allowed women to make choices, fertility declined in developed 
countries. Some women chose to put off having children until later in life  
or decided to not have children at all. In some countries, though, women 
saw little improvement in their status as societies resisted the change that 
was happening elsewhere. (Connect: Analyze changes in the practice 
of birth control from the mid-20th century to the early 21st century.  
 See Topic 9.5.)
Economic Changes  The trend toward economic globalization that 
started in the 1th century intensified during the 20th and 21st centuries. More 
developed nations continued to exploit less developed areas of the world, 
harvesting their raw materials and using the less developed areas as markets 
for finished goods. However, significant changes to the world economic 
710 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONorder took place. While the West, and especially the United States, was still 
a dominant economic force in the world economy, its superiority was being 
challenged by new sources of economic strength. Governments in Japan, Hong 
Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore began policies that led to economic 
growth. These policies started the trend of Asian economies, which relied on 
inexpensive labor and high-quality manufacturing, competing against the 
Western economies to make consumer goods and high-tech products. Because 
of the modernization policies established after the death of Mao Zedong, which 
relaxed government control, China eventually became the second-largest 
economy in the world after the United States and a major exporter of goods to 
the rest of the world. India became an economic powerhouse by developing a 
labor force that specialized in software development and engineering.

711 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLD Political Changes  Mass protest movements helped bring about political 
and social change. Demonstrations in India showed how to effectively use 
nonviolent resistance and win social and political change.  Activists championed 
civil rights in the United States, Northern Ireland, Canada, and other countries. 
Anti-war protests erupted in the United States and Western Europe. Women’s 
rights movements emerged in the Western democracies and spread across the 
globe. Protests against the system of apartheid brought an end to racial 
segregation in South Africa. Democracy movements led to political protests 
and revolutions in North Africa and the Middle East called the “Arab Spring.” 
Source:  Wikimedia Commons
Tahrir Square was the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution against former president Hosni 
Mubarak and his policies of police brutality. Over 1 million gathered in Tahrir Square on February 9, 2011, 
demanding the removal of the regime and for Mubarak to resign. 
Governments were sometimes slow to respond to these calls for change. In 
some cases, they persecuted, imprisoned, or attacked the protesters. 
During this time period, governments also began to play a larger role in 
managing or regulating their nations’ economies. This increased government 
intervention in the economy was a change from the free-market, or laissez-
faire, economics practiced in the previous era. 
Cultural Changes  Once information (and people) could quickly spread 
across the globe, the pace of cultural interactions and exchanges intensified. 
People all over the world consumed Western culture, particularly aspects that 
originated in the United States, in the form of movies, television shows, and 
music. Fashion styles that appeared in one area of the world quickly were 
imitated and adopted in other regions. A consumer culture spread.
712 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONOne significant change in the process of cultural exchanges from the 
previous era was that these exchanges were often a two-way street. For 
instance, while global audiences watched Hollywood movies, cuisine from 
China, Japan, India, and Latin America often found its way to the plates of 
Americans and Europeans. Music and art from East Asia found a loyal fan 
base in the United States. The Internet helped increase the rate and scope 
of these transfers, and advances in cellular technology made even the most 
remote areas on Earth accessible to these cultural exchanges.
Environmental Changes  In the 20th and 21st centuries, humans 
attempted to overcome the challenges of their environment in many new ways. 
With jet airplanes, travel between points on the globe was measured in hours 
rather than in days, months, or years. New technologies in petroleum extraction 
meant that sources of energy were cheaper and more abundant than previously 
imagined. The Space Age broke the terrestrial limits placed on humans by 
their environment, and space exploration became possible. 
However, although humans overcame some challenges, they also harmed 
the environment. Airborne pollution increased as factories, automobiles, 
and homes got their power from carbon-based fuels. Water pollution also 
increased as people and companies dumped waste in rivers, lakes, and oceans. 
Debates about the sources and causes of climate change developed as average 
temperatures around the globe increased, polar ice caps began to melt, and 
more intense and catastrophic weather events occurred. 
REFLECT ON THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. Continuity and Change  In 1919, economist John Maynard Keynes 
wrote: 
“What an extraordinary episode in the progress of man that age was 
which came to an end in August 1914! . . . The inhabitant of London 
could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various 
products of the whole earth . . . he could at the same time and by the same 
means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprise 
of any quarter of the world . . . he could secure forthwith, if he wished it, 
cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate . . . .” 
 This review topic emphasizes changes. Use Keynes’s description of life 
in 1914 as a starting point for noting continuities since 1900 as well. 
Consider such areas as technology, globalization, relation of developed 
to developing nations, status of women, and cultural exchange. 
2. In one to three paragraphs, explain how science, technology, politics, 
justice, transportation, communication, and the environment changed 
and stayed the same after 1900.

UNIT 9 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   WHAT HAPPENS TOMORRO W?
One reason people study the past is to provide insight into the future. 
And even though predictions are risky, people continue to make them. 
Optimism After Communism  Inspired by the fall of the Soviet 
Union, some intellectuals felt hopeful. In his provocatively titled 1992 
book, The End of History and the Last Man , Francis Fukuyama posited 
that history as people knew it was over. He argued that democracy was 
the ideal form of government and capitalism was the best economic 
system, and they were spreading throughout the world. Eventually, all 
countries would adopt them, and the political and economic conflicts 
that had driven wars in the past would vanish. Critics of Fukuyama 
argued he was wrong, just as Karl Marx had been in the 19th century 
when he also argued that people were entering the final phase of history. 
Cultural Conflict  One of Fukuyama’s former teachers, Samuel 
Huntington, rejected the entire end-of-history argument. In response, 
he wrote 7he &lash of &ivili]ations and the 5emaNing of :orld 2rder  
16. While Fukuyama was influenced by the end of the rivalry 
between the United States and the Soviet Union, Huntington was struck 
by the increasing tensions around religion and culture. He contended that 
people’s beliefs and affiliations would draw the fault lines for conflicts in 
the post-Cold War world. Huntington cited several examples of cultural 
conflict, including Hindu and Muslim tensions in India and the rise of 
Islamic fundamentalism and its hostility toward Western culture. 
Cultural Understanding  Critics asserted that Huntington’s 
generalizations were oversimplified and reflected a pro-Western 
prejudice. One of these critics is Nobel prize-winning economist 
Amartya Sen. In his 2006 work, Identities and Violence: The Illusion of 
Destiny,  Sen rejected Huntington’s suggestion that people of different 
beliefs and ethnic groups could not get along, pointing to the existence 
of peaceful diverse societies around the world. Further, as globalization 
spread through all parts of life, people found many ways to identify 
themselves in the 21st century besides by religion and ethnicity.
Hope in Technology  Debates over the post-Cold War world 
began before the Internet and smartphones were common. By 2011, 
technology was connecting people around the globe. When physicist 
Michio Kaku published Physics of the Future (2011), he was optimistic 
that technology and trade could break down the cultural barriers. He 
held out hope for material abundance and greater peace.

Historical Background
Developing nations are generally described as countries with a less 
developed industrial base; low levels of safe drinking water, sanitation, 
and hygiene; high levels of pollution; and widespread poverty. Developed 
nations are generally described as countries with advanced technological 
infrastructure and developed economies; better educational opportunities; 
greater wealth of the people; and higher living standards.

Two hundred years after the discovery of vaccine by the English physician 
Edward Jenner, immunization can be credited with saving approximately 
9 million lives a year worldwide.  . . So far only one disease, smallpox, 
has been eradicated by vaccines, saving approximately 5 million lives 
annually.  . . Polio could be next.  . . If the year 2000 goal of eradicating 
polio is achieved, the United States will be able to save the $270 million a 
year that is currently spent on polio vaccination. The savings for Western 
European countries will amount to about $200 million a year.  . .In all, 
vaccines have brought seven major human diseases under some degree 
of control - smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever, whooping cough, 
polio, and measles. Most of the vaccines now in use have been available for 
several decades, but only in the last 15 years has protection been extended 
to the majority of children in the developing world. Only about a quarter 
were being immunized when, in the mid-1980s, UNICEF and WHO called 
for a new commitment to regularly reaching 80% of infants by 1990. In 
most nations, that goal was reached and has since been sustained - saving 
over 3 million young lives each year. As frequent disease is also a major 
cause of malnutrition, immunization is also helping to protect the normal 
growth of millions of children.

the Rich and Poor,” Scientific American, 2016.
Life expectancy worldwide has risen for decades. But more people are 
living more years with debilitating [weakening] ailments, according 
to a new study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in 
Seattle. In developed countries, the trouble comes almost entirely from 
noncommunicable [not transmitted directly from one person to another] 
conditions such as heart and lung disease and back pain—ills typically 
associated with lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise. In developing 
nations, however, the prevalence of these ailments is increasing rapidly, 
even as those countries continue to try to stamp out communicable diseases 
such as diarrhea and malaria that have plagued them for a long time. If 
developing nations are clever, though, they can create health policies that 
impede the new threats and keep reducing the old ones.

on Aging, in the article “We are living longer than ever. But are we living 
better?” 2017.
For the first time in history, residents of high-, middle-, and low-income 
countries are likely to live to 60 years of age and beyond. Longevity [long 
life] is one of the greatest achievements of our modern era—the United 
Nations calls it one of the most significant social transformations of the 
21st century.  . . According to the World Health Organization’s World 
Report on Aging and Health, we still have a way to go. While we may be 
living longer, older individuals are not necessarily living healthier, more 
active lives. The report shines a light on the need for governments around 
the world to develop policies and programs to better meet the health and 
social care needs of citizens throughout their lives.  . . Population aging is a 
major concern for many governments around the world, but perhaps even 
more so for those whose populations are projected to be among the oldest 
in 2050, such as Japan, South Korea, and Germany. According to a global 
study conducted by the Pew Research Center, achieving an adequate 
standard of living in old age is directly influenced by the extent to which 
a country’s population is expected to age healthfully. Improving quality 
of life and functional ability among older people must be geared toward 
helping them effectively manage chronic diseases and complex coexisting 
conditions. By their very nature, these conditions—heart disease, diabetes, 
and chronic obstructive pulmonary [relating to the lungs] disease, to name 
a few—place a burden on individuals, their families, and health systems.

The Conversation , a magazine based on academic research, 2017.
Each year, 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of the illness occurs around the 
world, leading to between 21,000 to 143,000 deaths. About two-thirds 
of these are in developing countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Cholera is.  . . transmitted through contaminated water or food in areas 
with poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water. Cholera is referred 
to as a disease of poverty because of the lack of social development in 
the areas in which it occurs. The constant threat of natural catastrophes 
such as flooding and man-made ones including civil unrest, make the 
management and prevention of cholera a huge challenge in most of 
Africa. Several conditions on the continent make it fertile ground for the 
emergence and rapid spread of cholera. These include: Inadequate access 
to clean water and sanitation facilities, especially in peri-urban slums, 
where basic infrastructure isn’t available. Camps for internally displaced 
persons or refugees, where minimum requirements of clean water and 
sanitation have not been met.  . . Other humanitarian crises including 
flooding and earthquakes, civil unrest or war that causes disruption of 
water and sanitation systems.  . . But generally the lack of comprehensive 
programs for improvement of general public health especially for 
vulnerable populations like refugees and informal settlement residents is a 
challenge.  . . The increase in population, especially in urban.  . . settlements, 
has been exponential over the last two decades posing a major challenge 
for public health as more people flock to the cities in search of jobs.  . . On 
top of this a lack of political maturity in many African countries as well 
as greed for political power has led to civil unrest and chaos which in turn 
has resulted in internal displacements of huge populations.  . . There are 
recommended vaccines that can minimize the spread of cholera. But they 
are rarely used as for most governments this not a priority. Vaccines can 
prevent up to 65% of vulnerable populations from getting cholera.

news and opinion website and blog, 2018.
More than 1 billion people worldwide are infected with diseases of 
poverty. These conditions disproportionately afflict the world’s poorest, 
either in the developing world, or in developed countries with extreme 
inequality. Though well-known conditions such as HI9AIDS and 
malaria are considered diseases of poverty, many of the other illnesses 
that primarily strike the world’s poorest are lesser-known and frequently 
misunderstood. The World Health Organization has designated about 20 
of these conditions as “neglected tropical diseases.” This diverse array 
of conditions—such as leprosy, dengue, Chagas, and elephantiasis, to 
name a few—don’t attract the global media attention or funding that 
certain wide-ranging tropical diseases, such as malaria, have garnered 
in recent years. Neglected diseases cost developing economies billions of 
dollars annually and lock sufferers into a cycle of poverty that is nearly 
impossible to escape.High Income Moderate Income Low IncomeIncome Group

PART A: MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Directions:  Each of the questions or incomplete statements below is  
followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is 
best in each case.
Questions 1 and 2 refer to the passage below.
“I will give you my father’s words just as I received them; royal griots 
[storytellers] do not know what lying is. . . . Fear enters the heart of him 
who does not know his destiny, whereas Sundiata knew that he was striding 
towards a great destiny. . . . There is one that will make a great king. He forgets 
nobody. . . . In the same way as light preceded the sun, so the glory of Sundiata, 
overleaping the mountains, shed itself on all the Niger plain. . . . The arms 
of Sundiata had subdued all the countries of the savanna. . . . With Sundiata 
peace and happiness entered Niani. . . . Every king wants to have a singer to 
perpetuate his memory, for it is the griot who rescues the memories of kings 
from oblivion, as men have short memories. . . . The prophets did not write and 
their words have been all the more vivid as a result. . . . But whoever knows the 
history of a country can read its future. . . . Kings are only men, and whatever 
iron cannot achieve against them, words can.”
Epic of Sundiata, the story of the founding of the Mali Empire
1. Which of the following best describes the most likely purpose of telling

justified
(B) To prove that words matter more than deeds
(C) To compare him to the current ruler of the Mali Empire
(D) To assess his positive qualities and his flaws
2. The best evidence to support the claim in the excerpt that Sundiata 
“was striving towards a great destiny” is that Mali became

(C) a kingdom of prosperous Muslim farmers
(D) wealthy from trans-Saharan trade conducted by Muslims
AP® World History Practice Exam
723 AP® WORLD HISTORY PRACTICE EXAMQuestions 3 and 4 refer to the passage below.
“South-eastern China was also the chief centre [center] of porcelain production, 
although china [Chinese] clay is found also in North China. The use of porcelain 
spread more and more widely. The first translucent porcelain made its appearance, 
and porcelain became an important article of commerce both within the country and 
for export. Already the Muslim rulers of Baghdad around 800 used imported Chinese 
porcelain, and by the end of the fourteenth century porcelain was known in Eastern 
Africa. Exports to South-East Asia and Indonesia, and also to Japan gained more and 
more importance in later centuries. Manufacture of high-quality porcelain calls for 
considerable amounts of capital investment and working capital; small manufacturers 
produce too many second-rate pieces thus we have here the first beginnings of an 
industry that developed industrial towns such as Ching-te, in which the majority of the 
population were workers and merchants, with some 10,000 families alone producing 
porcelain. Yet, for many centuries to come, the state controlled the production and 
even the design of porcelain and appropriated most of the production for use at court 
or as gifts.”
Wolfram Eberhard, A History of China , 1969
3. Which of the following conclusions about porcelain is best supported 
by the passage?
(A) People in the Middle East preferred luxury items made in Persia.
(B) Proto-industrialization in the manufacture of luxury goods led to 
urbanization in China.
(C) Much of the porcelain manufacturing industry in China was 
controlled by foreign merchants.
(D) Japan was a leading consumer of Chinese porcelain in the 1300s.
4. What development most aided the growth in the labor supply needed 
for the increasing production of porcelain and other manufactured 
goods?
(A) The use of the magnetic compass and other transportation 
improvements enabled peasants to travel to Chinese cities more 
easily.
(B) The invention of inexpensive paper created an easier way to 
communicate and to advertise for job openings in the porcelain 
factories.
(C) The spread of gunpowder weapons allowed landlords to force 
rebellious peasants to end their revolts and move into the cities to 
work in porcelain factories.
(D) The changes in agriculture, including the introduction of a 
fast-growing variety of rice known as champa, increased food 
production.

“Apart from his navigational skills, what most set Columbus apart from other 
Europeans of his day were not the things that he believed, but the intensity 
with which he believed in them and the determination with which he acted 
upon those beliefs. . . . Columbus was, in most respects, merely an especially 
active and dramatic embodiment of the European—and especially the Medi -
terranean—mind and soul of his time: a religious fanatic obsessed with the 
conversion, conquest, or liquidation of all non-Christians; a latter-day crusader 
in search of personal wealth and fame, who expected the enormous and mys -

forests, and with golden people living in Eden.”

“Montezuma, who with one of his sons and many other chiefs who had been 
captured at the beginning, was still a prisoner, asked to be carried to the roof of 
the fort where he could speak to the captains and the [Aztec] people, and cause 
the war to cease. I had him taken there, and when he reached the parapet on the 
top of the fort, intending to speak to the people who were fighting there, one 
of his own subjects struck him on the head with a stone with such force that 
within three days he died. I then had him taken out, dead as he was, by two of 
the Indian prisoners, who bore him away to his people; but I do not know what 
they did with him.”

right do they then use the poisonous drug to injure the Chinese people? Even 
though the barbarians may not necessarily intend to do us harm, yet in coveting 
profit to an extreme, they have no regard for injuring others. Let us ask, where 
is your conscience? I have heard that the smoking of opium is very strictly 
forbidden by your country; that is because the harm caused by opium is clearly 
understood. Since it is not permitted to do harm to your own country, then even 
less should you let it be passed on to the harm of other countries—how much

“Even in interpreting the psychology of the worker of the transitional period, 
Marx exhibited a rationalistic bias. The worker’s opposition to the capital -
ist order is a total opposition to its laws, its factories, and its government. 
But this revolutionary consciousness of the worker is to take him next to  
Marxist socialism, where he will accept the factory system and the state, the only 
difference being the abolition of capitalism. Why shouldn’t the revolutionary 
protest of the worker flow into other channels: into rejection of industrialism as

“It is widely stated that . . . if only the [government would] permit trade there

“The absolute equality of races, physical, political and social, is the founding stone 
of World Peace and human advancement. . . . The beginning of Wisdom in interracial 
contact is the establishment of political institutions among suppressed Peoples. The 
habit of democracy must be made to encircle the earth. . . . Surely . . . there can be found 
in the civilized world enough of altruism, learning and benevolence to develop native 
institutions for the native’s good rather than continuing to allow the majority of mankind 
to be brutalized and enslaved. . . .
It is to the shame of the world that today the relations between the main groups of 
mankind and their mutual estimate and respect is determined chiefly by the degree in 
which one can subject the other to its service,—enslaving labor, making ignorance 
compulsory, uprooting ruthlessly religion and custom and destroying government so 
that the favored few may luxuriate in the toil of the tortured many. . . . It is shameful, 
irreligious, unscientific and undemocratic that the estimate that half the peoples of the 
earth put on the other half, depends mainly on their ability to squeeze money out of 
them.”

739 AP® WORLD HISTORY PRACTICE EXAMQuestions 41 to 43 refer to the passage below.
“We are making out a full and detailed report but it takes time to collate the enormous 
amount of information which we have collected. The trouble started early on the 
morning of the 16th and both sides were equally responsible. The Hindus started 
putting up barricades at Tala Bridge and Belgachia Bridge and other places to prevent 
Muslims processions coming into the town and Muslims goondas [gang members] 
went round forcing Hindus to close their shops. As previously mentioned in my D.O. 
[daily orders]  of the 15th the air was electric and this caused crowds to gather, lathis 
[heavy stick used as a weapon by Indian police] were produced and in no time North 
Calcutta was a scene of mob riot. By 1100 hours there were brick bat fights all over 
North Calcutta. . . .
Soon after midnight on the 16/17th these gangs fought out the most desperate battles, 
murder and butchery of a worst type were carried on in the side lanes and byways of 
North Calcutta. Round Vivekananda Road/ Central Ave., crossing, about 50 Hindu 
Behari rickshaw pullers were caught in a cul-de-sac and butchered. Further up Central 
Ave., round the temple which stands in the middle, a party of some 30 Mohamedans 
[Muslims] were killed. It was during the period midnight 16/17th and 0700 hours on 
the 17th that most of the casualties occurred. All the roads in the affected areas were 
red with bricks. . . . The result of this riot has been complete mistrust between the two 
communities.”

“The ruling circles of the U.S.A., striving for world supremacy, openly 
declared that they could achieve their aims only from ‘positions of strength.’ 
The American imperialists unleashed the so-called cold war, and sought to 
kindle the flames of a third world war. In 1, the U.S.A. set up an aggressive 
military bloc known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). As 
early as 1946, the Western States began to pursue a policy of splitting Germany, 
which was essentially completed in 1949 with the creation of a West German 
State. Subsequently they set out to militarize West Germany. This further 
deepened the division of Germany and made her reunification exceptionally 
difficult. A dangerous hotbed of war began to form in Europe. In the Far East 
the United States strove to create a hotbed of war in Japan, stationing its armed 
forces and building military bases on her territory.”

743 AP® WORLD HISTORY PRACTICE EXAMQuestions 53 to 55 refer to the passage below.
“The beauty of globalization is that it can free people from the tyranny of 
geography. Just because someone was born in France does not mean they can 
only aspire to speak French, eat French food, read French books, visit museums 
in France, and so on. . . . Globalization not only increases individual freedom, 
but also revitalizes cultures. . . . Thriving cultures are not set in stone. . . . 
It is a myth that globalization involves the imposition of Americanized 
uniformity, rather than an explosion of cultural exchange. For a start, many 
archetypal ‘American’ products are not as all-American as they seem. Levi 
Strauss, a German immigrant, invented jeans by combining denim cloth . . . 
with Genes, a style of trousers worn by Genoese sailors. So Levi’s jeans are in 
fact an American twist on a European hybrid. Even quintessentially American 
exports are often tailored to local tastes. MTV in Asia promotes Thai pop 
stars and plays rock music sung in Mandarin. CNN en Español offers a Latin 
American take on world news. . . . Britain’s favorite takeaway is a curry, not a 
burger: Indian restaurants there outnumber McDonald’s six to one. . . . Trendy 
Americans wear Gucci, Armani, Versace, Chanel. . . . Nike shoes are given a 
run for their money by Germany’s Adidas, Britain’s Reebok, and Italy’s Fila.”
Philippe Legrain, “Cultural Globalization is Not Americanization,” 
Chronicle of Higher Education, 2003
53. The author’s most likely purpose is to show that the spread of 
American culture is 
(A) a form of imperialism spreading under the label of globalization

(D) one influence among many leading to globalized syncretic cultures
54. Which of the following statements provides the strongest evidence to

Historical Background:  In the late 18th century, Europeans who wanted to 
trade with China were limited to the city of Canton (Guangzhou). In 1792, 
Lord Macartney, a British statesman and foreign diplomat, became the first 
British envoy to China and met briefly with Chinese Emperor Qianlong. At 
the time, opium was grown in great quantities in British India and the Ottoman 
Empire. The British East India Company, a joint-stock company chartered in 
1600, represented the interests of the British government in Asia.

We find that your country is sixty or seventy thousand li from China. Yet there

a great profit. The wealth of China is used to profit the barbarians . . . .  By what 
right do they use this poisonous drug to injure the Chinese people?
I have heard that the smoking of opium is very strictly forbidden by your 
country; that is because the harm caused by opium is very clearly understood. 
Since it is not permitted to do harm in your country, then even less should you 
allow it to be passed on to do harm in other countries. Of all that China exports 
to other countries, there is not a single thing that is not beneficial to people:  
they are of benefit when eaten, or of benefit when used, or of benefit when 
resold:  all are beneficial. This is for no other reason than to share the benefits

It appeared that the Laws of the Chinese Empire forbid the importation of Opium 
into China, and declare that all Opium which may be brought into the Country 
is liable to confiscation. The Queen of England desires that Her Subjects who 
may go into Foreign Countries should obey the Laws of those Countries; and 
Her Majesty does not wish to protect them from the just consequences of any 
offenses which they may commit in foreign parts. But, on the other hand, Her 
Majesty cannot permit that Her Subjects residing abroad should be treated with 
violence, and be exposed to insult and injustice; and when wrong is done to 
them,  Her Majesty will see that they obtain redress.

The course which I hope and believe Her Majesty’s Government 
are about to take, is to make rational proposals to China—such 
proposals as China may accept without national dishonour [dishonor]
or disgrace. But, considering the character of its Government, and 
all the events that have already taken place, no man can doubt the 
necessity of accompanying and supporting such propositions with 
a competent physical force (hear). The armament destined for this 
service has been condemned on account of its being supposed to 
be intended to support the trade in opium. On the contrary, I call 
on all those who would wish to see that detestable traffic really 
and effectually put down, to support a measure by which, alone, 
I am convinced, such a wished-for consummation can ever be 
accomplished. Without a national treaty between the Governments 
of England and China, such as this armament may be hoped to lead 
to, and which it would be hopeless to expect otherwise, providing 
a plan of cordial co-operation between them for this end, it is but 
too certain that this detestable opium traffic must, in spite of every 
effort, not only flourish, but become every day more and more 
piratical and buccaneering in its character.
