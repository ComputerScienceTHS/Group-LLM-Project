 What Are Geographic Questions? 9
Globalizing processes occur at the world scale; these 
processes bypass country borders and include global 
ﬁ nancial markets and global environmental change. 
However, the processes of globalization do not magically appear at the global scale: what happens at other scales (indi-vidual, local, regional, national) helps create the processes of glo-balization and shape the outcomes of globalization.
Some argue that the impacts of globalization are exag-
gerated, but as geographers Ron Johnston, Peter T aylor, and Michael Watts explain, “Whatever your opinion may be, any intellectual engagement with social change in the twenty ﬁ  rst century has to address this concept seriously, 
and assess its capacity to explain the world we currently inhabit.” We integrate the concept of globalization into this textbook because processes at the global scale, processes that are not conﬁ  ned to local places or national borders, are clearly changing the human geography of the planet. At the same time, as we travel the world and continue to engage in ﬁ eldwork and research, we are constantly reminded of how 
different places and people are from one another—processes at the individual, local, regional, and national scales con-tinue to change human geography and shape globalization.
No place on Earth is untouched by people. As people 
explore, travel, migrate, interact, play, live, and work, they make places. People organize themselves into communi-ties, nations, and broader societal networks, establishing political, economic, religious, linguistic, and cultural sys-tems that enable them to function in space. People adapt to, alter, manipulate, and cope with their physical geo-graphic environment. No environment stands apart from human action. Each place we see is affected by and created by people, and each place reﬂ  ects the culture of the people in that place over time.
Imagine and describe the most remote place on Earth you can think of 100 years ago. Now, describe how globalization has changed that place and how the people there continue to shape it and make it the place it is today.
WHAT ARE GEOGRAPHIC QUESTIONS?
Geographers study human phenomena such as lan-
guage, religion, and identity, as well as physical phenom-ena such as landforms, climate, and environmental change. Geographers also examine the interactions between humans and environment. Human geography is the study of the spatial and material characteristics of the human-made places and people found on Earth’s surface; physical geography asks similar questions about the natural envi-ronment. Human and physical geographers adopt a similar perspective but focus on different phenomena.
Geographer Marvin Mikesell once gave a shorthand 
deﬁ nition of geography as the “why of where.” Why and how 
do things come together in certain places to produce particu-lar outcomes? Why are some things found in certain places but not in others? How do the characteristics of particular places shape what happens? T o what extent do things in one place inﬂ  uence those in other places? T o these questions, we add “so what?” Why do differences across geographic space matter? What role does a place play in its region and in the world, and what does that mean for people there and else-
where? Questions such as these are at the core of geographic inquiry—whether human or physical-and they are of critical importance in any effort to make sense of our world.
If geography deals with so many aspects of our world, 
ranging from people and places to coastlines and climates, what do the various facets of this wide-ranging discipline have in common? The answer lies in a perspective that both human and physical geographers bring to their stud-ies: a spatial  perspective. Whether they are human geog-
raphers or physical geographers, virtually all geographers are interested in the spatial arrangement of places and phe-nomena, how they are laid out, organized, and arranged on the Earth, and how they appear on the landscape.
Mapping the spatial distribution of a phenomenon 
can be the ﬁ  rst step to understanding it. By looking at a map of how something is distributed across space, a geog-rapher can raise questions about how the arrangement came about, what processes create and sustain the particu-lar distributions or patterns, and what relationships exist between different places and things.
Maps in the Time of Cholera Pandemics
In medical geography, mapping the distribution of a dis-
ease is the ﬁ  rst step to ﬁ  nding its cause. In 1854, Dr. John Snow, a noted anesthesiologist in London, mapped cases of cholera in London’s Soho District.
Cholera is an ancient disease associated with diarrhea 
and dehydration. It was conﬁ  ned to India until the beginning of the nineteenth century. In 1816 it spread to China, Japan, East Africa, and Mediterranean Europe in the ﬁ  rst of several pandemics, worldwide outbreaks of the disease. This initial wave abated by 1823, but by then cholera was feared throughout the world, for it had killed people everywhere by the hundreds, even thousands. Death was horribly convul-sive and would come in a matter of days, perhaps a week, and no one knew what caused the disease or how to avoid it.
Soon a second cholera pandemic struck. It lasted 
from 1826 to 1837, when cholera crossed the Atlantic and attacked North America. During the third pandemic, from 1842 to 1862, England was severely hit, and cholera again spread into North America.c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 9  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 9  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Home of
Cholera VictimWhen the pandemic that began in 1842 reached 
England in the 1850s, cholera swept through the Soho 
District of London. Dr. Snow mapped the Soho District, marking all the area’s water pumps—from which people got their water supply for home use—with a P and marking the residence of each person who died from cholera with a dot (Fig. 1.5). Approximately 500 deaths occurred in Soho, and as the map took shape, Snow noticed that an especially large number of those deaths clustered around the water pump on Broad Street. At the doctor’s request, city author-ities removed the handle from the Broad Street pump, making it impossible to get water from that pump. The result was dramatic: almost immediately the number of reported new cases fell to nearly zero, conﬁ  rming Snow’s 
theory about the role of water in the spread of cholera.
Dr. Snow and his colleagues advised people to boil 
their water, but it would be a long time before his advice reached all those who might be affected, and in any case many people simply did not have the ability to boil water or to wash hands with soap.
Cholera has not been defeated completely, however, 
and in some ways the risks have been rising in recent years rather than falling (Fig. 1.6). People contract cholera by eating food or water contaminated with cholera bacteria.

Cholera bacteria diffuse to broader areas because once 
one person has cholera it can be spread through his or her feces. In an impoverished area with no sanitary sewer sys-tem, the person’s feces can easily contaminate the water supply. Even in places with sanitary sewer systems, chol-era contamination occurs when rivers, which are typically the water supply, ﬂ  ood the sanitary sewer system.
We expect to ﬁ  nd cholera in places that lack sanitary 
sewer systems and in places that are ﬂ  ood prone. In many of the teeming shantytowns of the growing cities of the developing world, and in some of the refugee camps of Africa and Asia, cholera remains a threat. Until the 1990s, major outbreaks remained few and limited. After remain-ing cholera-free for a half century, Europe had its ﬁ  rst 
reappearance of cholera in Naples in 1972. In 2006, a cholera outbreak in Angola, in southern Africa, spread quickly throughout the country. When heavy rains came to West Africa in 2010, an outbreak of cholera killed 1500 peo-ple in Nigeria alone.
A cholera outbreak in the slums of Lima, Peru, in 
January 1991 became a fast-spreading epidemic (regional outbreak of a disease) that touched every country in the Americas, infected more than 1 million people, and killed over 10,000 in the region. The outbreak in Peru began when the ocean waters warmed off the coast of Peru. Cholera bacteria live on plankton in the ocean, and the warming of the ocean allowed the plankton and cholera to multiply. Fish ate the plankton, and people ate raw ﬁ  sh, 
thus bringing cholera to Peru.
In the slums of Peru, the disease diffused quickly. The 
slums are densely populated and lack a sanitary sewer system large enough to handle the waste of the population. An esti-mated 14 million Peruvians were infected with cholera, 350,000 were hospitalized, and 3500 Peruvians died during the outbreak in the 1990s. Peruvians who accessed health care received clean water, salts, and antibiotics, which com-bat the disease.
In January 2010, an earthquake that registered 7.0 on 
the Richter scale hit Haiti, near the capital of Port au Prince. Months later a cholera outbreak started in the Artibonite region of Haiti (Fig. 1.6). Health ofﬁ  cials are not certain whether the outbreak began in the multiple refugee camps or elsewhere. The disease diffused quickly through the refugee camps and by October 2010 reached the capital city of Port au Prince. Scientists worry that the cholera outbreak in Haiti will be long lasting because the bacteria have contaminated the Artibonite River, the water supply for a large region. Although purifying water through boiling and thoroughly washing hands prevent the spread of cholera, water contam-inated with cholera and a lack of access to soap abound in many neighborhoods of world cities. A vaccine exists, but its effectiveness is limited, and it is costly. Dr. Snow achieved a victory through the application of geographical reasoning, but the war against cholera is not yet won.
The fruits of geographical inquiry were life-saving in 
Snow's case, and the example illustrates the general advan-tage that comes from looking at the geographic context of events and circumstances. Geographers want to understand how and why places are similar or different, why people do different things in different places, and how the relationship between people and the physical world varies across space.
The Spatial Perspective
Geography, and being geographically literate, involves much more than memorizing places on a map. Place loca-tions are to geography what dates are to history. History is not merely about memorizing dates. T o understand his-tory is to appreciate how events, circumstances, and ideas came together at particular times to produce certain out-comes. Knowledge of how events have developed over time is thought to be critical to understanding who we are and where we are going.
Understanding change over time is critically impor-
tant, and understanding change across space is equally as important. The great German philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that we need disciplines focused not only on particular phenomena (such as economics and sociology), but also on the perspectives of time (history) and space (geography). The disciplines of history and geography have intellectual cores deﬁ  ned by these perspectives 
rather than by subject matter.
Human geographers employ a spatial perspective  
as they study a multitude of phenomena ranging from political elections and urban shantytowns to gay neigh-borhoods and folk music. T o bring together the many subﬁ elds of human geography and to explain to non-
geographers what geographers do, four major geograph-ical organizations in the United States formed the Geography Educational National Implementation Project in the 1980s. The National Geographic Society published their ﬁ  ndings in 1986, introducing the five themes of geography. The ﬁ  ve themes are derived from geography’s spatial concerns.
The Five Themes
The ﬁ  rst theme, location, highlights how the geographical 
position of people and things on Earth’s surface affects what happens and why. A concern with location underlies almost all geographical work, for location helps to establish the context within which events and processes are situated.
Some geographers develop elaborate (often quantita-
tive) models describing the locational properties of particular phenomena—even predicting where things are likely to occur. Such undertakings have fostered an interest in loca-
tion theory , an element of contemporary human geography 
that seeks answers to a wide range of questions-some of them theoretical, others highly practical: Why are villages, towns, and cities spaced the way they are? A geographer versed in location theory might assess where a SuperT arget should be c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 11  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 11  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

built (downtown or in a suburb), given the characteristics of 
existing neighborhoods and new developments, the median income of people, the locations of other shopping areas, and the existing and future road system. Similarly, a geographer could determine the best location for a wildlife refuge, given existing wildlife habitats and migration patterns, human set-tlement patterns, and road networks.
A spatial perspective invites consideration of the rela-
tionship among phenomena in individual places—including the relationship between humans and the physical world. Thus, the second of the ﬁ  ve themes concerns human-environment interactions. Why did the Army Corps of Engineers alter Florida’s physical environment so drastically when it drained part of the Everglades? Have the changes in Florida’s environment created an easier path of destruction for hurricanes? Why is the Army Corps of Engineers again changing the course of the Kissimmee River, and what does that mean for farmers around the river and residential devel-opments in the south of Florida? Asking locational ques-tions often means looking at the reciprocal relationship between humans and environments.The third theme of geography is the region. 
Phenomena are not evenly distributed on Earth’s surface. Instead, features tend to be concentrated in particular areas, which we call regions. Geographers use ﬁ  eldwork 
and both quantitative and qualitative methods to develop insightful descriptions of different regions of the world. Novelist James Michener once wrote that whenever he started writing a new book, he ﬁ  rst prepared himself by 
turning to books written by regional geographers about the area where the action was to occur. Understanding the regional geography of a place allows us to make sense of much of the information we have about places and digest new place-based information as well.
The fourth theme is represented by the seemingly 
simple word place. All places on the surface of Earth have unique human and physical characteristics, and one 
of the purposes of geography is to study the special char-acter and meaning of places. People develop a sense of place by infusing a place with meaning and emotion, by remembering important events that occurred in a place, or by labeling a place with a certain character.

experience and give meaning to places, we can have a feel-
ing of “home” when we are in a certain place.
We also develop perceptions of places where we 
have never been through books, movies, stories, and pic-tures. Geographers Peter Gould and Rodney White asked college students in California and Pennsylvania: “If you could move to any place of your choice, without any of the usual ﬁ  nancial and other obstacles, where would you like to live?” Their responses showed a strong bias for their home region and revealed that students from both regions had negative perceptions of the South, Appalachia, the Great Plains, and Utah (Fig. 1.7). What we know shapes our perceptions of places.
The ﬁ  fth theme, movement, refers to the mobility of 
people, goods, and ideas across the surface of the planet. Movement is an expression of the interconnectedness of places. Spatial interaction between places depends on the 
distances (the measured physical space between two places) among places, the accessibility (the ease of reaching one loca-tion from another) of places, and the transportation and com-munication connectivity (the degree of linkage between loca-
tions in a network) among places. Interactions of many kinds shape Earth’s human geography, and understanding these interactions is an important aspect of the global spatial order.Cultural Landscape
In addition to the ﬁ  ve themes, location, human-
environment, region, place, and movement, landscape is a 
core element of geography. Geographers use the term landscape to refer to the material character of a place, the complex of natural features, human structures, and other tangible objects that give a place a particular form. Human geographers are particularly concerned with the cultural landscape, the visible imprint of human 
activity on the landscape. The geographer whose name is most closely identiﬁ  ed with this concept is former University of California at Berkeley professor Carl Sauer. In Sauer’s words, cultural landscapes are com-prised of the “forms superimposed on the physical land-scape” by human activity.
No place on Earth is in a “pristine” condition;  
humans have made an imprint on every place on the planet (Fig. 1.8). The cultural landscape is the visible imprint of human activity and culture on the land-scape. We can see the cultural landscape in the layers of buildings, roads, memorials, churches, fields, and homes that human activities over time have stamped on the landscape.c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 13  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 13  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Glacier National Park, United States.  © Alexander B. Murphy.Field Note
“Hiking to the famed Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National 
Park brings one close to nature, but even in this remote part of the United States the work of humans is inscribed in the landscape. The parking lot at the start of the six-mile trail, the trail itself, and the small signs en route are only part of the human story. When I hiked around the turn in this valley and arrived at the foot of the glacier, I found myself looking at a sheet of ice and snow that was less than a third the size of what it had been in 1850. The likely reason for the shrink-age is human-induced climate change. If the melt continues at present rates, scientists predict that the glacier will be gone by 2030.”
Any cultural landscape has layers of impressions from 
years of human activity. As each group of people arrives and occupies a place, they bring their own technological and cultural traditions and transform the landscape accordingly. Each new group of residents can also be inﬂ uenced by what they ﬁ  nd when they arrive and leave 
some of it in place. In 1929, Derwent Whittlesey pro-posed the term sequent occupance to refer to these sequential imprints of occupants, whose impacts are lay-ered one on top of the other, each layer having some impacts on the next
The T anzanian city of Dar es Salaam provides an 
interesting urban example of sequent occupance. Arabs from Zanzibar ﬁ  rst chose the African site in 1866 as a summer retreat. Next, German colonizers imprinted a new layout and architectural style (wood-beamed T eutonic) when they chose the city as the center of their East African colonies in 1891. After World War I, when c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 14  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 14  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

the Germans were ousted, a British administration took 
over the city and began yet another period of transfor-mation. The British encouraged immigration from their colony in India to T anzania. The new migrant Asian population created a zone of three- and four-story apart-ment houses, which look as if they were transplanted from Bombay, India (Fig. 1.9 left and right). Then, in the early 1960s, Dar es Salaam became the capital of newly independent T anzania. Thus, the city experienced four stages of cultural dominance in less than one century, and each stage of the sequence remains imprinted in the cultural landscape.
The cultural landscape can be seen as a kind of book 
offering clues into each chapter of the cultural practices, values, and priorities of its various occupiers. As geogra-pher Peirce Lewis explained in Axioms for Reading the 
Landscape  (1979), “Our human landscape is our unwitting 
autobiography, reﬂ  ecting our tastes, our values, our aspi-rations, and even our fears, in tangible, visible form.” Like Whittlesey, Lewis recommended looking for layers of history and cultural practice in cultural landscapes, adding that most major changes in the cultural landscape occur after a major event, such as war, an invention, or an economic depression.
Geographers who practice ﬁ  eldwork keep their eyes open to 
the world around them and through practice become adept at reading cultural landscapes. Take a walk around your cam-pus or town and try reading the cultural landscape. Choose one thing in the landscape and ask yourself, “What is that and why is it there?” How might the existence of that thing inﬂ  u-
ence the future development of the neighborhood? Take the time to ﬁ  nd out the answers!
WHY DO GEOGRAPHERS USE MAPS, 
AND WHAT DO MAPS TELL US?
Maps are an incredibly powerful geographic tool, and 
cartography, the art and science of making maps, is as old as 
geography itself. (For details on cartography, see Appendix A at the end of this book.) Maps are used for countless pur-poses, waging war, promoting political positions, solving  Figures 1.9, left and right
Mumbai, India (left) and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania (right). Apartment buildings through-
out Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India, are typically four stories with balconies. In Dar-es-Salaam, T anzania, this four-story walkup with balconies (right) stands where single-family African dwellings once stood, reﬂ  ecting the sequential occupance of the city.

medical problems, locating shopping centers, bringing 
relief to refugees, and warning of natural hazards, to name just a few. Reference maps show locations of places and geographic features. Thematic maps tell stories, typically showing the degree of some attribute or the movement of a geographic phenomenon.
Reference maps focus on accuracy in showing the 
absolute locations  of places, using a coordinate system that 
allows for the precise plotting of where on Earth something is. Imagine taking an orange, drawing a dot on it with a marker, and then trying to describe the exact location of that dot to someone who is holding another orange so she can mark the same spot on her orange. If you draw and number the same coordinate system on both oranges, the task of drawing the absolute location on each orange is not only doable but simple. The coordinate system most frequently used on maps is based on latitude and longitude. For example, the absolute location of Chicago is 41 degrees, 53 minutes North Latitude and 87 degrees, 38 minutes West Longitude. Using these coordinates, you can plot Chicago on any globe or map that is marked with latitude and longitude lines.
The establishment of a satellite-based global posi-
tioning system (GPS) allows us to locate things on the sur-face of Earth with extraordinary accuracy. Researchers col-lect data quickly and easily in the ﬁ  eld, and low-priced units are encouraging ﬁ  shers, hunters, and hikers to use GPS in 
their activities. New cars are equipped with GPS units, and dashboard map displays help commuters navigate trafﬁ  c and 
travelers ﬁ  nd their way. Geocaching is an increasingly pop-ular hobby based on the use of GPS. Geocachers use their GPS units to play a treasure hunt game all over the world. People leave the treasures (“caches”) somewhere, mark the coordinates on their GPS, and post clues on the Internet. If you ﬁ  nd the cache, you take the treasure and leave a new one. Many mobile phones and “smart” devices are also equipped with GPS units, and applications such as Google Maps have helped to spread the use of GPS even further.
Relative location describes the location of a place in 
relation to other human and physical features. Descriptors such as “Chicago is on Lake Michigan, south of Milwaukee” or “Chicago is located where the cross-coun-try railroads met in the 1800s” or “Chicago is the hub of the corn and soybean markets in the Midwest” are all descriptors of Chicago relative to other features. In the southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and western Indiana region, all major roads lead to Chicago (Fig. 1.10).

 Why Do Geographers Use Maps, and What Do Maps Tell Us?  17
Within this region, people deﬁ  ne much of their lives rela-
tive to Chicago because of the tight interconnectedness between Chicago and the region. Northwestern Indiana is so connected to Chicago that it has a time zone separate from the rest of Indiana, allowing people in northwestern Indiana to stay in the same time zone as Chicago.
Absolute locations do not change, but relative loca-
tions are constantly modiﬁ  ed and change over time. 
Fredericksburg, Virginia, is located halfway between Washington, D.C. and Richmond, Virginia. T oday, it is a suburb of Washington, D.C. with commuter trains, van pools, buses, and cars moving commuters between their homes in Fredericksburg and their workplaces in metro-politan Washington, D.C. During the Civil War, several bloody battles took place in Fredericksburg as the North and South fought over the land halfway between their wartime capitals. The absolute location of Fredericksburg has not changed, but its place in the world around it, its relative location, certainly has.
Mental Maps
We all carry maps in our minds of places we have been and places we have merely heard of; these are called mental 
maps. Even if you have never been to the Great Plains of the United States, you may have studied wall maps and atlases or come across the region in books, magazines, and newspapers frequently enough to envision the states of the region (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and T exas) in your mind. Regardless of whether you have visited the Great Plains, you will use your mental map of the region. If you hear on the news that a tornado destroyed a town in Oklahoma, you use your mental map of the Great Plains region and Oklahoma to make sense of where the tornado occurred and who was affected by it.
Our mental maps of the places within our activity 
spaces, those places we travel to routinely in our rounds of daily activity, are more accurate and detailed than places where we have never been. If your friend calls and asks you to meet her at the movie theater you go to all the time, your mental map will engage automatically. Y ou will envision the hallway, the front door, the walk to your car, the lane to choose in order to be prepared for the left turn you must make, where you will park your car, and your path into the theater and up to the pop-corn stand.
Geographers who study human-environment behav-
ior have made extensive studies of how people develop their mental maps. The earliest humans, who were nomadic, had incredibly accurate mental maps of where to ﬁ nd food and seek shelter. T oday, people need mental maps 
to ﬁ  nd their way through the concrete jungles of cities and suburbs.Geographers have studied the mental map forma-
tion of children, the blind, new residents to cities, men, and women, all of whom exhibit differences in the forma-tion of mental maps. T o learn new places, women, for example, tend to use landmarks, whereas men tend to use paths. Activity spaces vary by age, and the extent of peo-ples’ mental maps depends in part on their ages. Mental maps include terra incognita, unknown lands that are off-limits. If your path to the movie theater includes driving past a school that you do not go to, your map on paper will likely label the school, but no details will be shown regard-ing the place. However, if you have access to the school and you are instead drawing a mental map of how to get to the school’s cafeteria, your mental map of the school will be quite detailed. Thus, mental maps reﬂ  ect a person’s 
activity space, what is accessible to the person in his or her rounds of daily activity and what is not.
Generalization in Maps
All maps simplify the world. A reference map of the world cannot show every place in the world, and a thematic map of hurricane tracks in the Atlantic Ocean cannot pinpoint every hurricane and its precise path for the last 50 years. When mapping data, whether human or physical, cartog-raphers, the geographers who make maps, generalize the 
information they present on maps. Many of the maps in this book are thematic maps of the world. Shadings show how much or how little of some phenomena can be found on a part of the Earth’s surface, and symbols show where speciﬁ  c phenomena are located.
Generalized maps help us see general trends, but 
we cannot see all cases of a given phenomenon. The map of world precipitation (Fig. 1.11) is a generalized map

The areas shaded in burgundy, dark blue, and vibrant green are places that receive the most rain, and those shaded in orange receive the least rain on average. T ake a pen and trace along the equator on the map. Notice how many of the high-precipitation areas on the map are along the equator. The consistent heating of the equator over the course of the entire year brings consistent pre-cipitation to the equatorial region. At the scale of the world, we can see general trends in precipitation, such as this, but it is difﬁ  cult to see the microscale climates of intense precipitation areas that are found throughout the world.
Remote Sensing and GIS
Geographic studies include both long- and short-term environmental change. Geographers monitor Earth from a distance, using remote sensing technology that gathers data at a distance from Earth’s surface. c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 17  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 17  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Remotely sensed data are collected by satellites and air-
craft and are often almost instantaneously available. After a major weather or hazard event, such as the 2011 ﬂ oods in the Mississippi River Valley, the unprece-
dented hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 (which included Hurricane Katrina), or the 2010 earth-quakes in Haiti and Chile, remotely sensed data show us the major areas of impact (Fig. 1.12). A remotely sensed image surveys the damage of the earthquake, and photos taken on the ground show the impact and destruction (Fig. 1.13).
In states that restrict foreign access or that do not 
reliably allow foreign aid to enter the country, remote sensing can help geographers understand the physical and human geography of the place. Google Earth is a free, web-based user-friendly set of remotely sensed images from around the world woven together and acces-sible to anyone with Internet access. Y ou can think of  Figure 1.11

 Why Do Geographers Use Maps, and What Do Maps Tell Us?  19
Google Earth as a quilt of remotely sensed images, taken 
all over the world, coming from several sources, and sewn together. As a result, the resolution (the measure of the smallest object that can be resolved by the sensor, the degree of detail) of the images (each piece of the quilt) differs from place to place.
Remotely sensed images can be incorporated in a map, 
and absolute locations can be studied over time by plotting change in remotely sensed imagery over time. Advances in computer technology and data storage, increasing accessibil-ity to locationally based data and GPS technology, and soft-ware corporations that tailor products to speciﬁ  c uses have all 
driven incredible advances in geographic analysis based on geographic information systems (GIS) over the last two decades. Geographers use GIS to compare a variety of spatial data by creating digitized representations of the environment (Fig. 1.14), combining layers of spatial data, and creating maps in which patterns and processes are superimposed. 40°60° 60°

Geographers also use GIS to analyze data, which can give us 
new insights into geographic patterns and relationships.
Geographers use GIS in both human and physical 
geographic research. For example, political geographers use GIS to map layers showing voters, their party registra-tion, their race, their likelihood of voting, and their income in order to determine how to draw voting districts in con-gressional and state legislative elections. In this case, a geographer can draw a line around a group of people and ask the computer program to tally how many voters are inside the region, determine what the racial composition is of the district, and show how many of the current political representatives live within the new district’s boundaries.
Geographers trained in GIS employ the technol-
ogy in countless undertakings. Students who earn undergraduate degrees in geography are employed by software companies, government agencies, and busi-nesses to use GIS to survey wildlife, map soils, analyze natural disasters, track diseases, assist ﬁ  rst responders, 
plan cities, plot transportation improvements, and fol-low weather systems. For example, a group of geogra-phers working for one GIS company tailors the GIS software to serve the branches of the military and the defense intelligence community. The vast amounts of intelligence data gathered by the various intelligence agencies can be integrated into a GIS and then analyzed spatially. Geographers working in the defense intelli-gence community can use GIS to query a vast amount of intelligence, interpret spatial data, and make recom-mendations on issues of security and defense.
The amount of data digestible in a GIS, the power of 
the location analysis that can be undertaken on a computer platform, and the ease of analysis that is possible using GIS software applications allow geographers to answer compli-cated questions. For example, geographer Korine Kolivras analyzed the probability of dengue fever outbreaks in Hawaii using GIS (Fig. 1.15). The maps Kolivras pro-duced may look as simple and straightforward as the chol-era maps produced by Dr. John Snow in the 1800s, but the amount of data that went into Kolivras’s analysis is stagger-ing in comparison. Dengue fever is carried by a particular kind of mosquito called the Aedes mosquito. Kolivras ana-lyzed the breeding conditions needed for the Aedes mos-quito, including precipitation, topography, and several other variables, to predict what places in Hawaii are most likely to experience an outbreak of dengue fever.
A new term of art used in geography is GISci. 
Geographic information science (GISci) is an emerging research ﬁ  eld concerned with studying the development and use of geospatial concepts and techniques to examine geographic patterns and processes. Y our school may have a program in GISci that draws across disciplines, bringing together the computer scientists who write the programs, the engineers who create sensors that gather data about the Earth, and the geographers who combine layers of data and interpret them to make sense of our world.
Use Google Earth to ﬁ  nd a place where a humanitarian cri-sis is occurring today (such as Haiti or Pakistan) and study the physical and human geography overlaid on Google Earth in this place. How does studying this place on Google Earth change your mental map of the place and/ or your under-standing of the crisis?c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 21  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 21  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
GuestField Note
The diffusion of diseases carried by vectors, such as the Aedes 
mosquito that transmits dengue, is not solely a result of the envi-
ronmental factors in a place. I use disease ecology to understand the ways in which environmental, social, and cultural factors interact to produce disease in a place. Through a combination of ﬁ eldwork and geographic information systems (GIS) modeling, I 
studied the environmental habitat of the Aedes mosquito in 
Hawaii and the social and cultural factors that stimulated the outbreak of dengue in Hawaii.
When I went into the ﬁ  eld in Hawaii, I observed the diver-
sity of the physical geography of Hawaii, from deserts to rain-forests. I saw the speciﬁ  c local environments of the dengue 
outbreak area, and I examined the puddles in streams (Fig. 1.15A) in which the mosquitoes likely bred during the 2001–2002 dengue outbreak. I talked to public health ofﬁ  cials who worked 
so hard to control the dengue outbreak so that I better understood the local environmental factors contributing to the disease. I visited a family that had been heavily affected by dengue, and I saw their home, which, by their choice, lacked walls or screens on all sides. In talking with the family, I came to understand the social and cultural factors that affected the outbreak of dengue in Hawaii.
I created a GIS model of mosquito habitat that considered not only total precipitation in Hawaii (Fig. 1.15B), but also 
seasonal variations in precipitation (Fig. 1.15C) and temperature (Fig. 1.15D), to help explain where the Aedes mosquito is able 
to breed and survive on the islands. I also studied seasonal ﬂ  uctuations in streams and population distributions in creating my model of dengue potential areas (Fig. 1.15E).
The GIS model I created can now be altered by public ofﬁ  cials in Hawaii to reﬂ  ect precipitation and temperature 
variations each year or to incorporate new layers of environmental, social, and cultural data. Ofﬁ  cials will be able to better predict locations of dengue outbreaks so they can focus their efforts to combat the spread of the disease.

 Why Are Geographers Concerned with Scale and Connectedness? 23
WHY ARE GEOGRAPHERS CONCERNED 
WITH SCALE AND CONNECTEDNESS?
Geographers study places and patterns at a variety of 
scales, including local, regional, national, and global. 
Scale has two meanings in geography: the ﬁ  rst is the dis-tance on a map compared to the distance on the Earth, and the second is the spatial extent of something. Throughout the book, when we refer to scale we are using the second of these deﬁ  nitions. Geographers’ interest in 
this type of scale derives from the fact that phenomena found at one scale are usually inﬂ  uenced by what is hap-pening at other scales; to explain a geographic pattern or process, then, requires looking across scales. Moreover, the scale of our research or analysis matters because we can make different observations at different scales. We can study a single phenomenon across different scales in order to see how what is happening at the global scale affects localities and how what is happening at a local scale affects the globe. Or we can study a phenomenon at a par-ticular scale and then ask how processes at other scales affect what we are studying.
The scale at which we study a geographic phenom-
enon tells us what level of detail we can expect to see. We also see different patterns at different scales. For example, when we study the distribution of material wealth at the scale of the globe (see Fig. 1.3), we see that the countries in western Europe, Canada, the United States, Japan, and Australia are the wealthiest, and the countries of Subsaharan Africa and Southeast Asia are the poorest. Does that mean everyone in the United States is wealthy and everyone in Indonesia is poor? Certainly not, but on a global-scale map of states, that is how the data appear.
When you shift scales to North America and 
examine the data for States of the United States and the provinces of Canada (Fig. 1.16), you see that the wealthiest areas are on the coasts and the poorest are in the interior and in the extreme northeast and south. The State of Alaska and the province of the Northwest T erritories have high gross per capita incomes that stem largely from oil revenues that are shared among the residents.
By shifting scales again to just one city, for example, 
metropolitan Washington, D.C. (Fig. 1.17), you observe that suburbs west, northwest, and southwest of the city are the wealthiest and that suburbs to the east and southeast have lower income levels. In the city itself, a clear dichot-omy of wealth divides the northwest neighborhoods from the rest of the city. Shifting scales again to the individual, if we conducted ﬁ  eldwork in Washington, D.C., and 
interviewed people who live below the poverty line, we would quickly ﬁ  nd that each person’s experience of pov-
erty and reasons for being in poverty vary-making it difﬁ  -cult to generalize. We would ﬁ  nd some trends, such as 
how women in poverty who have children cope differently than single men or how illegal immigrants cope differ-ently from legal immigrants, but no two individual cases are the same.
Because the level of detail and the patterns observed 
change as the scale changes, geographers must be sensitive to their scale of analysis and also be wary of researchers who make generalizations about a people or a place at a particu-lar scale without considering other scales of analysis.
Geographers’ concern with scale goes beyond an 
interest in the scale of individual phenomena to a concern with how processes operating at different scales inﬂ  uence 
one another. If you want to understand the conﬂ  ict 
between the T utsi and the Hutu people in Rwanda, for example, you cannot look solely at this African country. The Rwandan conﬂ  ict was inﬂ  uenced by developments at a variety of different scales, including patterns of migration and interaction in Central Africa, the economic and polit-ical relations between Rwanda and parts of Europe, and the variable impacts of globalization-economic, political, and cultural.
Geographers are also interested in how people use 
scale politically. Locally based political movements, such as the Zapatistas in southern Mexico, have learned to rescale  
their actions-to involve players at other scales and create a global outcry of support for their position. By taking their political campaign from the local scale to the national scale through, for example, protests against the North American Free T rade Agreement (NAFTA), and then effectively using the Internet to wage a global campaign, the Zapatistas gained attention from the world media, a feat relatively few local political movements achieve.
Geographer Victoria Lawson uses the term jumping 
scale to describe such rescaling activities. She compares the ways in which Western countries, multinational cor-porations, and the World T rade Organization take prod-ucts and ideas created in Western places and by Western corporations and globalize all rights to proﬁ  ts from them 
through intellectual property law. Efforts to push European and American views of intellectual property on the globe negate other local and regional views of products and ideas. T o the West, rice is a product that can be owned, privatized, and bought and sold. T o East Asians, rice is integral to culture, and new rice strains and new ideas about growing rice can help build com-munity, not just proﬁ  t. Lawson explains that taking a single regional view and jumping scale to globalize it can serve to legitimate that view and negates other regional and local views.
Regions
Geographers often divide the world into regions for analysis. Many colleges offer a course in world regional c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 23  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 23  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
24 Chapter 1   Introduction to Human Geography
geography that compares and contrasts major regions of 
the world. In this book, we use examples from all over the world, but our focus throughout is on a thematic approach to human geography. Nongeographers use some form of the regional idea all the time, even in everyday conversation. When you plan or dream of a vacation in the Rockies, or a hiking trip in New England, or a cruise in the Caribbean, you are using regional notions to convey what you have in mind. Used this way, regions serve as informal frames of reference.In geography, a region constitutes an area that shares 
similar characteristics. T o identify and delimit regions, we must establish criteria for them. The criteria we choose to deﬁ ne a region can be physical, cultural, functional, or 
perceptual.
When geographers choose one or more physical 
or cultural criteria to define a region, they are looking for formal regions. A formal region is marked by homogeneity in one or more circumstance or phenom-enon. A formal physical region is based on a shared  Figure 1.16

physical geographic criterion, such as the karst region 
of China (Fig. 1.18).
A formal region has a shared trait, it can be a shared 
cultural trait or a physical trait. In a formal cultural region, people share one or more cultural traits. For example, the region of Europe where French is spoken by a majority of the people can be thought of as a French-speaking region. When the scale of analysis shifts, the formal region changes. If we shift scales to the world, the French-speaking formal region expands beyond France into former French colonies of Africa and into the overseas departments that are still associ-ated politically with France.
A functional region is deﬁ  ned by a particular set 
of activities or interactions that occur within it. Places that are part of the same functional region interact to create connections. Functional regions have a shared political, social, or economic purpose. For example, a  Figure 1.17

city has a surrounding region within which workers 
commute, either to the downtown area or to subsidiary centers such as ofﬁ  ce parks and shopping malls. That entire urban area, deﬁ  ned by people moving toward and within it, is a functional region. Thus a functional region is a spatial system; its boundaries are deﬁ  ned by 
the limits of that system. Functional regions are not necessarily culturally homogeneous; instead, the people within the region function together politically, socially, or economically. The city of Chicago is a functional region, and the city itself is part of hundreds of func-tional regions-from the State of Illinois to the seventh federal reserve district.
Finally, regions may be primarily in the minds of 
people. Perceptual regions are intellectual constructs 
designed to help us understand the nature and distribu-tion of phenomena in human geography. Geographers do not agree entirely on their properties, but we do con-cur that we all have impressions and images of various regions and cultures. These perceptions are based on our accumulated knowledge about such regions and cultures. Perceptual regions are not just curiosities. How people think about regions has inﬂ  uenced everything from daily activity patterns to large-scale international conﬂ  ict. A 
perceptual region can include people, their cultural traits, such as dress, food, and religion; places and their physical traits, such as mountains, plains, or coasts; and built environments, such as windmills, barns, skyscrap-ers, or beach houses.
But where is this Mid-Atlantic region? If Maryland 
and Delaware are part of it, then eastern Pennsylvania is, too. But where across Pennsylvania lies the boundary of this partly cultural, partly physical region, and on what basis can it be drawn? There is no single best answer (Fig. 1.19).
Major news events help us create our perceptual 
regions by deﬁ  ning certain countries or areas of countries 
as part of a region. Before September 11, 2001, we all had perceptions of the Middle East region. For most of us, that region included Iraq and Iran but stretched no farther east. As the hunt for Osama bin Laden began and the media focused attention on the harsh rule of the T aliban in Afghanistan, our regional perceptions of the Middle East changed; for many, the region stretched to encom-pass Afghanistan and Pakistan. Scholars who specialize in this part of the globe had long studied the relationship between parts of Southwest Asia and the traditional “Middle East,” but the connections between Afghanistan and Pakistan and the rest of the Middle East were almost invisible to the general population.

The problem of deﬁ  ning and delimiting perceptual 
regions can be approached in several ways. One is to con-
duct interviews in which people residing within as well as outside a region are asked to respond to questions about their home and cultural environment. Zelinsky used a dif-ferent technique; he analyzed the telephone directories of 276 metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada, noting the frequency with which businesses and other enterprises use regional or locational terms (such as “Southern Printing Company” or “Western Printing”) in their listings. The resulting maps show a close similarity between these perceptual regions and culture regions identiﬁ  ed by geographers.
Among the perceptual regions shown in Figure 1.20, 
one, the South, is unlike any of the others. Even today, ﬁ  ve 
generations after the Civil War, the Confederate ﬂ  ag still 
evokes strong sentiments from both those who revere the ﬂ ag and those who revile it.
A “New South” has emerged over the past several 
decades, forged by Hispanic immigration, urbanization, movement of people from other parts of the United States to the South, and other processes. But the South, espe-cially the rural South, continues to carry imprints of a cul-ture with deep historical roots. Its legacy is preserved in language, religion, music, food preferences, and other tra-ditions and customs.
If you drive southward from, say, Pittsburgh or 
Detroit, you will not pass a speciﬁ  c place where you enter this perceptual region. Y ou will note features in the cultural landscape that you perceive to be associated with the South (such as Wafﬂ  e House restaurants), and at some stage of the trip these features will begin to dominate the area to such a degree that you will say, “I am really in the South now.” This may result from a combination of features in the culture: the style of 
Perceptual Regions in the United States
Cultural geographer Wilbur Zelinsky tackled the com-plex task of deﬁ  ning and delimiting the perceptual regions of the United States and southern Canada. In an article titled “North America’s Vernacular Regions,” he identi-ﬁ ed 12 major perceptual regions on a series of maps (sum-
marized in Fig. 1.20). When you examine the map, you will notice some of the regions overlap in certain places. For example, the more general term the West actually incorporates more speciﬁ  c regions, such as the Paciﬁ  c 
Region and part of the Northwest.

houses and their porches, items on a roadside restaurant 
menu (grits, for example), a local radio station’s music, the sound of accents that you perceive to be Southern, a succession of Baptist churches in a town along the way. These combined impressions become part of your over-all perception of the South as a region.
Such cultural attributes give a certain social atmo-
sphere to the region, an atmosphere that is appreciated by many of its residents and is sometimes advertised as an attraction for potential visitors. “Experience the South’s warmth, courtesy, and pace of life,” said one such com-mercial, which portrayed a sun-drenched seaside land-scape, a bowing host, and a couple strolling along a palm-lined path.
The South has its vigorous supporters and defend-
ers, and occasionally a politician uses its embattled history to arouse racial antagonism. But today the South is so multifaceted, diverse, vigorous, and interconnected with the rest of the United States that its regional identity is much more complicated than traditional images suggest (Fig. 1.21). This serves as an important reminder that per-ceptual regions are not static. Images of the South are rap-idly changing, and perceptions of the South as a region will change over time.
Regions, whether formal, functional, or percep-
tual, are ways of organizing humans geographically. They are a form of spatial classiﬁ  cation, a means of 
handling large amounts of information so we can make sense of it.Culture
Location decisions, patterns, and landscapes are funda-mentally inﬂ  uenced by cultural attitudes and practices. 
Culture refers not only to the music, literature, and arts of a society but to all the other features of its way of life: pre-vailing modes of dress; routine living habits; food prefer-ences; the architecture of houses and public buildings; the layout of ﬁ  elds and farms; and systems of education, gov-ernment, and law. Culture is an all-encompassing term that identiﬁ  es not only the whole tangible lifestyle of peo-ples, but also their prevailing values and beliefs. Culture lies at the heart of human geography.
The concept of culture is closely identiﬁ  ed with the 
discipline of anthropology, and over the course of more than a century anthropologists have deﬁ  ned it in many 
different ways. Some have stressed the contributions of humans to the environment, whereas others have empha-sized learned behaviors and ways of thinking. Several decades ago the noted anthropologist E. Adamson Hoebel deﬁ ned culture as:
[the] integrated system of learned behavior patterns which are characteristic of the members of a society and which are not the result of biological inheritance . . . cul-ture is not genetically predetermined; it is noninstinc-tive . . . [culture] is wholly the result of social invention and is transmitted and maintained solely through com-munication and learning.GuestField Note
Montgomery, Alabama
Located in a predominately African American neighborhood in Montgom-
ery, Alabama, the street intersection of Jeff Davis and Rosa Parks is sym-bolic of the debates and disputes in the American South over how the past is to be commemorated on the region’s landscape. The Civil War and civil rights movement are the two most important events in the history of the region. The street names commemorate Montgomery’s central role in both eras, and they do so in the same public space. Montgomery was the site of the ﬁ  rst capital of the Confederacy in 1861 while Jefferson Davis was president. The Alabama capital was also the site of the 1955–1956 Montgomery bus boycott that launched the civil rights movement. The boycott was sparked by Rosa Parks’s arrest after she refused to give up her seat on a city bus when ordered to do so by a white person. Most of my research examines the politics of how the region’s white and African Americans portray these separate heroic eras within the region’s public spaces, ranging from support for and against ﬂ  ying 
the Confederate ﬂ  ag to disputes over placing statues and murals honoring the Civil War and the civil rights movement on the South’s landscape.

 Why Are Geographers Concerned with Scale and Connectedness? 29
Hoebel’s emphasis on communication and learning antic-
ipated the current view of culture as a system of meaning, not just a set of acts, customs, or material products. Clifford Geertz advanced this view in his classic work, The 
Interpretation of Cultures (1973), which has inﬂ  uenced 
much recent work in human geography. Hence, human geographers are interested not just in the different pat-terns and landscapes associated with different culture groups, but in the ways in which cultural understandings affect both the creation and signiﬁ  cance of those patterns and landscapes.
Cultural geographers identify a single attribute of a 
culture as a culture trait. For example, wearing a turban is a culture trait in certain societies. Many men in the semiarid and desert areas of North Africa, Southwest Asia, and South Asia wore turbans before the birth of Islam. The turbans protected the wearers from sunlight and also helped distinguish tribes.
Not all Muslim men wear turbans, but in some 
Muslim countries, including Afghanistan, wearing tur-bans is popular because either religious or political lead-ers (in the case of Afghanistan, the T aliban) prescribe it for men. T oday, turbans often distinguish a man’s status in society or are worn as a sign of faithfulness to God. In many Muslim countries, including Egypt and T urkey, men rarely wear turbans. The appearance of turbans in other Muslim countries varies a great deal. For instance, in Y emen men who cover their heads typically wear kalansuwa, which are caps wrapped in fabric. In Palestine, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, men who cover their heads typically wear kafﬁ  yeh, which are rectangular pieces of cloth draped and secured on the head.
Wearing turbans is not a cultural trait limited to 
Muslims. In the United States, most men who cover their heads with a turban are Sikhs, which is a separate religion from Islam. In the Sikh religion, men are required to keep their hair uncut. The common practice is to twist the hair and knot it on top of one’s head and then cover it with a turban. The Sikh religion began in the 1500s, and in the late 1600s, the tenth guru of the religion taught that wearing a turban was a way to demonstrate one’s faithful-ness to God. As the turban example exhibits, culture traits are not necessarily conﬁ  ned to a single culture. More than one culture may exhibit a particular culture trait, but each will consist of a discrete combination of traits. Such a combination is referred to as a culture complex. In many cultures, the herding of cattle is a trait. However, cattle are regarded and used in different ways by different cul-tures. The Maasai of East Africa, for example, follow their herds along seasonal migration paths, consuming blood and milk as important ingredients of a unique diet. Cattle occupy a central place in Maasai existence; they are the essence of survival, security, and prestige. Although the Maasai culture complex is only one of many cattle-keep-ing complexes, no other culture complex exhibits exactly the same combination of traits. In Europe, cattle are milked, and dairy products, such as butter, yogurt, and cheese, are consumed as part of a diet very different from that of the Maasai.
A cultural hearth is an area where cultural traits 
develop and from which cultural traits diffuse. Often a cultural trait, for example the religion of Islam, can be traced to a single place and time. Muhammad founded Islam in the 500s c.e. (current era) in and around the cities of Mecca and Medina on the Arabian Peninsula. Other culture traits, such as agriculture, can be traced to several hearths thousands of years apart. When such a trait devel-ops in more than one hearth without being inﬂ  uenced by 
its development elsewhere, each hearth operates as a case of independent invention.
Connectedness through Diffusion
Geographer Carl Sauer focused attention on how ideas, speciﬁ  cally the innovation of agriculture, spread in 
Agricultural Origins and Dispersals . Based on geography and 
archaeological evidence, Sauer established that MesoAmerica independently invented agriculture, adding it to the hearths of agriculture in Europe, Africa, and Asia. When ideas, people, or goods move across space, this process of dissemination is called cultural diffusion .
In 1970, Swedish geographer T orsten Hägerstrand 
published pioneering research on the role of time in the dif-fusion process. Hägerstrand’s research revealed how time, as well as distance, affects individual human behavior and the diffusion of people and ideas. Sauer and Hägerstrand’s fascinating research attracted many geographers to the study of diffusion processes. Geographers are still using principles of diffusion to model movement and diffusion through GIS and other geographic techniques.
Whether diffusion of a cultural trait occurs depends, 
in part, on time and distance from the hearth. The farther a place is from the hearth, the less likely an innovation will be adopted. Similarly, the acceptance of an innovation becomes less likely the longer it takes to reach its potential adopters. In combination, time and distance cause time-
distance decay in the diffusion process.
Not all cultural traits or innovations diffuse. 
Prevailing attitudes or cultural taboos can mean that cer-tain innovations, ideas, or practices are not acceptable or adoptable in particular cultures. Religious teachings may prohibit certain practices or ideas, such as divorce, abor-tions, or contraceptive use, on the grounds of theology or morality. Some cultures or religions prohibit consump-tion of alcoholic beverages, and others prohibit consum-ing certain kinds of meat or other foods. Prescriptions cultures make about behavior act as cultural barriers  
and can pose powerful obstacles to the spread of ideas or innovations.c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 29  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 29  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
30 Chapter 1   Introduction to Human Geography
Expansion Diffusion
When a cultural trait, such as a religion, spreads, it typi-
cally does so from a hearth. Islam’s hearth was on the Arabian Peninsula, and from there, Islam diffused to Egypt and North Africa, through Southwest Asia, and into West Africa. This is a case of expansion diffusion, 
when an innovation or idea develops in a hearth and remains strong there while also spreading outward. Geographers classify diffusion processes into two broad categories: expansion diffusion and relocation diffusion. In the case of expansion diffusion, an innovation or idea develops in a hearth and remains strong there while also spreading outward (Fig. 1.22).
Expansion diffusion takes several forms. The sili-
con bands that are different shapes and colors, like an animal, a football, or a continent, and that stretch into bracelets are called Silly Bandz. Robert Croak, a busi-nessman from T oledo, Ohio, invented the bands in 2008 after seeing similar rubber bands produced by a Japanese company when he was at a trade show in China. The vast majority of Croak’s marketing came from contagious 
diffusion, a form of expansion diffusion in which nearly all adjacent individuals and places are affected. One child had Silly Bandz, and the next day, many more children in his classroom would have the bracelets.
Croak already had a company, Brainchild Products, 
that sold silicon awareness bracelets, and he worked with his Chinese supplier to create Silly Bandz. Croak trade-marked the name and launched a website in the summer of 2008. Without spending any money on marketing, Croak started a Facebook page. Between the website and the Facebook page, the demand for Silly Bandz diffused conta-giously and quickly. Business Week reports the company that once shipped 24 boxes a day out of its T oledo headquarters now ships 1500 boxes a day. Croak reports Silly Bandz are “carried in approximately 18,000 stores in 25 states.”
Although several other competitors quickly entered 
the market, the demand for Croak’s Silly Bandz increased in stores. Croak now offers Silly Bandz in partnership 
with celebrities and companies, including Justin Bieber.

 Why Are Geographers Concerned with Scale and Connectedness? 31
In addition to the contagious diffusion on the play-
ground and in the classrooms, the diffusion of Silly Bandz, 
as opposed to a competing brand, is going to be greatest around the 18,000 stores in 25 states that sell this particu-lar product. The stores create a hierarchy, a structure to the diffusion of the innovation, in this case a particular brand of bracelets.
Instead of Silly Bandz on their wrists, many Major 
League Baseball players now wear necklaces. The colorful necklaces are not made of silicon. They are made of a nylon fabric that matches their uniform and is imbued with titanium. The baseball players, including Justin Morneau of the Minnesota T wins, Joba Chamberlain of the New Y ork Yankees, and Josh Beckett of the Boston Red Sox, wear titanium necklaces sold by Phiten. Phiten is a Japanese company with corporate stores in Honolulu, Hawaii, T orrance, California, and Seattle, Washington.
Formed in 1983, the Phiten Company uses what it 
calls aqua technology to disperse titanium throughout the nylon fabric it uses to make necklaces and bracelets. Phiten supporters believe the titanium helps restore bal-ance and allows the ﬂ  ow of energy through fatigued mus-cles. The company’s website states that wearing a Phiten will “restore normal relaxation” for customers. Phiten not only sells necklaces and bracelets, but also compression sleeves and shorts, athletic tape, patches, and even bed-ding infused with aqua metals, typically titanium.
The diffusion of Phitens from its hearth in Japan to 
the United States began with a sport the two countries share: baseball. In 2001, New Y ork Yankee Randy Johnson traveled to Japan and saw baseball players wear-ing titanium necklaces. He started wearing a Phiten, and other Major League players in the United States soon followed. The custom caught on hierarchically, from team to team and contagiously from player to player. In an article published by CBS News, a regional sales man-ager for Phiten in Seattle is quoted as saying “I’d say about three-fourths of the Detroit Tigers and Minnesota T wins players use them.” Baseball players adopted the custom because they believe the titanium helped allevi-ate muscle pain.
An idea such as a new fashion or new genre of 
music may not always spread throughout a contiguous population. For example, the spread of Crocs footwear is a case of hierarchical diffusion, a pattern in which the main channel of diffusion is some segment of those who are susceptible to (or adopting) what is being dif-fused. In the case of Crocs, founder Scott Seamans found a clog manufactured by a Canadian company that was created out of the unique croc resin material. Seamans, an avid sailor, put a strap on the back and holes for drainage. He and two co-founders of the crocs company based the company in Boulder, Colorado, had the shoes manufactured, and sold them at boat shows in 2002 and 2003. Crocs footware diffused from boating enthusiasts to gardeners to the American public-becoming especially popular among children, who adorned their crocs with Jibbitz, or charms designed for crocs. The hierarchy of boaters, gardeners, and then the contagious diffusion that followed helps explain the rapid growth of the crocs brand, which had revenues of over $800 million in 2007.
A third form of expansion diffusion is stimulus dif-
fusion. Not all ideas can be readily and directly adopted by a receiving population; some are simply too vague, too unattainable, too different, or too impractical for immedi-ate adoption. Y et, these ideas can still have an impact. They may indirectly promote local experimentation and even-tual changes in ways of doing things. For example, the dif-fusion of fast, mass-produced food in the late twentieth century led to the introduction of the hamburger to India. Y et the Hindu religion in India prohibits consumption of beef, which is a major cultural obstacle to the adoption of the hamburger (Fig. 1.23). Instead, retailers began selling burgers made of vegetable products. The diffusion of the hamburger took on a new form in the cultural context of India. With expansion diffusion, whether contagious or hierarchical, the people stay in place and the innovation, idea, trait, or disease does the moving.
Relocation Diffusion
Relocation diffusion occurs most frequently through migration. When migrants move from their homeland, they take their cultural traits with them. Developing an ethnic neighborhood in a new country helps immigrants maintain their culture in the midst of an unfamiliar one. Relocation diffusion , in contrast, involves the actual 
movement of individuals who have already adopted the idea or innovation, and who carry it to a new, perhaps dis-tant, locale, where they proceed to disseminate it (Fig. 1.22). If the homeland of the immigrants loses enough of its population, the cultural customs may fade in the hearth while gaining strength in the ethnic neighbor-hoods abroad.
Once you think about different types of diffusion, you will be tempted to ﬁ  gure out what kinds of diffusion are tak-ing place for all sorts of goods, ideas, or diseases. Please remember that any good, idea, or disease can diffuse in more than one way. Choose a good, idea, or disease as an example and describe how it diffused from its hearth across the globe, referring to at least three different types of diffusion.c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 31  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 31  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

WHAT ARE GEOGRAPHIC CONCEPTS, 
AND HOW ARE THEY USED IN ANSWERING GEOGRAPHIC QUESTIONS?
Geographic concepts include most of the boldfaced 
words in this chapter, such as place, relative location, men-
tal map, perceptual region, diffusion, and cultural land-scape. In doing geographic research, a geographer thinks of a geographic question, one that has a spatial or landscape component, chooses the scale(s) of analysis, and then applies one or more geographic concepts to conduct research and answer the question. Geographers use ﬁ  eld-
work, remote sensing, GIS, GPS, and qualitative and quan-titative techniques to explore linkages among people and places and to explain differences across people, places, scales, and times.
Research in human geography today stems from a 
variety of theories and philosophies. T o understand what geographers do and how they do it, it is easiest to start by deﬁ ning what geography is not. T oday’s geography is not 
environmental determinism.
Rejection of Environmental Determinism
The ancient Greeks, ﬁ  nding that some of the peoples sub-
jugated by their expanding empire were relatively docile while others were rebellious, attributed such differences to variations in climate. Over 2000 years ago, Aristotle described northern European people as “full of spirit... but incapable of ruling others,” and he characterized Asian people (by which he meant modern-day T urkey) as “intelligent and inventive... [but] always in a state of sub-jection and slavery.” Aristotle attributed these traits to the respective climates of the regions-the cold north versus the more tropical Mediterranean.
Aristotle’s views on this topic were long-lasting. As 
recently as the ﬁ  rst half of the twentieth century, similar notions still had strong support. In 1940, in the Principles 
of Human Geography, Ellsworth Huntington and C.W. Cushing wrote:
The well-known contrast between the energetic people of the most progressive parts of the temperate zone and the inert inhabitants of the tropics and even of intermediate regions, such as Persia, is largely due to climate. . . the people of the cyclonic regions rank so far above those of the other parts of the world that they are the natural leaders.
Huntington and Cushing suggest climate is the critical factor in how humans behave. Y et what constitutes an “ideal” climate lies in the eyes of the beholder. For Aristotle, it was the climate of Greece. Through the eyes of more recent commentators from western Europe and North America, the climates most suited to prog-ress and productiveness in culture, politics, and tech-nology are (you guessed it) those of western Europe and c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 32  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401c01IntroductiontoHumanGeography.indd Page 32  9/15/11  7:18 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 What Are Geographic Concepts, and How Are They Used in Answering Geographic Questions?  33
the northeastern United States. Each of these theories 
can be classiﬁ  ed as environmental determinism, 
which holds that human behavior, individually and col-
lectively, is strongly affected by, even controlled or determined by, the physical environment.
For a time, some geographers attempted to explain 
the location of major cultural hearths as solely a func-tion of environment. Quite soon, however, certain geographers doubted whether these sweeping general-izations were valid. They recognized exceptions to the environmental determinists’ theories. For example, the Maya civilization in the Americas arose in a tropical cli-mate that most assumed was incapable of complex cul-tures. They argued that humanity was capable of much more than merely adapting to the natural environment. The many environmentally determinist theories that explain Europe as “superior” to the rest of the world because of the climate and location of the region ignore the fact that for thousands of years, the most techno-logically advanced civilizations were found outside of Europe in North Africa, Southwest Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia.
Chipping away at deterministic explanations helped 
move the geographic study of the relationships between human society and the environment in different direc-tions. Everyone agrees that the natural environment affects human activity in some ways, but people are the decision makers and the modiﬁ  ers-not just the slaves of 
environmental forces. People and their cultures shape environments, constantly altering the landscape and affecting environmental systems.
Possibilism
In response to environmental determinism, geographers argued that the natural environment merely serves to limit the range of choices available to a culture. The choices that a society makes depend on what its members need and on what technology is available to them. Geographers called this doctrine  possibilism .
Even possibilism has its limitations, partly because it 
encourages a line of inquiry that starts with the physical environment and asks what it allows. Human cultures, however, frequently push the boundaries of what is “envi-ronmentally possible” through their own ideas and inge-nuity, and advances in technology. In the interconnected, technologically dependent world we live in today, it is possible to transcend many of the limitations imposed by the natural environment.
T oday, much research in human geography focuses 
on how and why humans have altered environment, and on the sustainability of their practices. In the process, the interest in cultural ecology—an area of inquiry concerned with culture as a system of adaptation to and alteration of environment, has been supplemented by interest in polit-ical ecology, an area of inquiry fundamentally concerned with the environmental consequences of dominant political-economic arrangements and understandings (see Chapter 13). The fundamental point is that human societies are diverse and the human will is too powerful to be deter-mined by environment.
Today’s Human Geography
Human geography today seeks to make sense of the spa-tial organization of humanity and human institutions on Earth’s surface, the character of the places and regions created by people, and the relationships between humans and the physical environment. Human geography encom-passes many subdisciplines, including political geography, economic geography, population geography, and urban geography. Human geography also encompasses cultural geography, which incorporates a concern with cultural traits such as religion, language, and ethnicity.
Cultural geography is both part of human geogra-
phy and also its own approach to all aspects of human geography. Cultural geography looks at the ways culture is implicated in the full spectrum of topics addressed in human geography. As such, cultural geography can be seen as a perspective on human geography as much as a component of it.
T o appreciate more fully the vast topics researched 
by human geographers, we can examine the multitude of careers human geographers pursue. Human geographers have titles such as location analyst, urban planner, diplo-mat, remote sensing analyst, geographic information sci-entist, area specialist, travel consultant, political analyst, intelligence ofﬁ  cer, cartographer, educator, soil scientist, 
transportation planner, park ranger, and environmental consultant. All of these careers and more are open to geographers because each of these ﬁ  elds is grounded in 
the understanding of places and is advanced through spa-tial analysis.
Choose a geographic concept introduced in this chapter. Think about something that is of personal interest to you (music, literature, politics, science, sports), and consider how whatever you have chosen could be studied from a geographical perspective. Think about space and location, landscape, and place. Write a geographic question that could be the foundation of a geographic study of the item you have chosen.

34 Chapter 1   Introduction to Human Geography
Summary
Our study of human geography will analyze people and places and explain how they 
interact across space and time to create our world. Chapters 2 and 3 lay the basis for our study of human geography by looking at where people live. Chapters 4–7 focus on aspects of culture and how people use culture and identity to make sense of themselves in their world. The remaining chapters examine how people have created a world in which they function economically, politically, and socially, and how their activities in those realms re-create themselves and their world.

Field Note Basic Infrastructure
The words wafted in the air as my colleague and I took a minute to process them. 
We were in Shanghai, China, visiting with a Chinese student who had spent a semester at our small college in a town of 26,000 in rural South Dakota. My col-league had asked the student what he missed most about our small town of Aberdeen. He replied without hesitating, “Basic infrastructure.”
I thought about brand-new subway lines in Shanghai and Beijing, new airports 
throughout China, and high-speed trains being built to connect China’s cities. I visualized the miles of gleaming new concrete we had driven on that afternoon on the ring highway on the outskirts of Shanghai (Fig. 2.1) and the empty ﬁ  elds where 
houses or other buildings had been leveled to make room for new high-density housing, more concrete, and more infrastructure. Shanghai’s metro system only

 Basic Infrastructure 37
dates to 1995. Shanghai now has the longest metro system on Earth—a system 
capable of transporting 5 million people a day. I thought about the lack of public transportation in my small town. I remembered that in 2010, China committed to spend an additional $1 trillion on urban infrastructure by 2015. I considered the words United States President Barack Obama used as he described, enviously, the infrastructure in China, “their ports, their train systems their airports are all vastly superior to us now.”
I looked at the student and said, “Basic infrastructure? But you have better 
subway lines, high-speed railroads, roads, and airports than we do in the States.” “Yes,” he said, “But I don’t have hot water.”
A 2010 report in Foreign Policy agreed, “China’s biggest urban challenge may 
be water; already, it has little to spare. Some 70 percent of water use today traces back to agriculture, but demand from urban consumers and commercial enter-prise is on the rise. Even if the sheer amount of water isn’t the problem, location will be; the country will need to spend more than $120 billion on water systems in the coming years to transport, store, and manage supplies.” A graduate student in Beijing reiterated the water problem in China’s cities. Her dormitory houses about 1000 students, but they all must walk out of the building to a central facility to shower, and she reported that they are only allowed to shower between 2 and 4 
PM or between 9 and 11 PM.
China’s population of 1.34 billion people has been migrating to cities in d roves 
since economic reforms began in 1978. In 2011, the population of the world hit 7 billion people, with rising populations in China and India accounting for 40 per-cent of the population growth. China has undergone incredibly rapid expansion in its mining and manufacturing sectors, resulting in economic growth rates that are often at 10 percent a year. But rapid economic growth took its toll on water quality in China, which exacerbates water shortages in the country.
Providing services for 1.34 billion people is no small feat. Even though 
demographers now predict China’s population will stabilize at 1.4 billion by 2025 and begin to decline after that, shifts in the composition of China’s population will continue to challenge the provision of basic infrastructure to the country’s people.
Southern, coastal China has a moist climate, much like the southeastern 
United States, but the climate in northern China is drier. With only 7% of the world’s fresh water supply, China has an uphill battle in providing water resources to 1.34 billion people. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that southern China has 80% of the country’s water (Foreign Policy, 2011). To remedy the imbalance, China is now building a $60 billion canal system called the South-North Water Transfer Project that will include three different routes to divert water from the Yangtze River in southern China to the cities in the north (Fig. 2.2).
In this chapter, we examine the distribution of the world’s population at sev-
eral scales in order to understand where people live and why they live where they do. We also look into the continued growth of global population, noting that growth rates vary quite widely across our planet. Even as population growth in the wealthier core slows down to near (or below!) zero, it continues in the less wealthy periphery, in some countries at rates far above the global average. No such discus-sion would be complete without consideration of the health conditions prevailing across the world: health, well-being, and population growth tend to be closely related. And we will study the role of governments in their efforts to control the process.c02Population.indd Page 37  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 37  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

WHERE IN THE WORLD DO PEOPLE LIVE 
AND WHY?
When geographers study population, they focus on the 
variability of demographic features and factors across space. 
Demography is the study of population in general perspective, and population geographers work in tandem with demogra-phers, seeking answers to the problems posed by these varia-tions. The concept of scale is crucial in this research because such variability occurs from region to region, country to country, and within individual countries themselves.
Demographers report the population density of a 
country as a measure of total population relative to land size (Fig. 2.3). Population density assumes an even distri-bution of the population over the land. The United States, for example, with a territory of 3,717,796 square miles or 9,629,047 square kilometers (including the surfaces of lakes and ponds and coastal waters up to three nautical miles from shore) had a population of 308.2 million in 2010. This yields an average population density for the United States of just over 82 per square mile (32 per sq km). This density ﬁ  gure is also known as the country’s 
arithmetic population density, and in a very general way it emphasizes the contrasts between the United States and such countries as Bangladesh (2741 per sq mi or 1058 per sq km), the Netherlands (1046 per sq mile or 404 per sq km), and Japan (875 per sq mile or 338 per sq km).c02Population.indd Page 38  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 38  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Field Note
“An overpass across one of Yangon’s busy streets provides a 
good perspective on the press of humanity in lowland South-east Asia. Whether in urban areas or on small back roads in the countryside, people are everywhere—young and old, ﬁ  t 
and inﬁ  rm. When population densities are high in areas of poverty and unsophisticated infrastructure, vulnerabilities to natural hazards can be particularly great. This became stun-ningly evident in 2008 when a tropical cyclone devastated a signiﬁ  cant swath of the Irrawaddy Delta south of Yangon, killing some 100,000 people and leaving millions homeless.”
No country has an evenly distributed population, and 
arithmetic population ﬁ  gures do not reﬂ  ect the emptiness 
of most of Alaska and the sparseness of population in much of the West. In other cases, it is actually quite misleading. Egypt, with a population of 78.1 million in 2010, has a seemingly moderate arithmetic population density of 78 per square kilometer (201 per sq mi). Egypt’s territory of 1,000,445 square kilometers (386,660 sq mi) however, is mostly desert, and the vast majority of the population is crowded into the valley and delta of the Nile River. An estimated 98 percent of all Egyptians live on just 3 percent of the country’s land, so, the arithmetic population density ﬁ gure is meaningless in this case (Fig. 2.4 top, bottom).Physiologic Population Density
A superior index of population density relates the total population of a country or region to the area of arable  
(farmable) land it contains. This is called the physio-logic population density, defined as the number of people per unit area of agriculturally productive land. T ake again the case of Egypt. Although millions of people live in its great cities (Cairo and Alexandria) and smaller urban centers, the irrigated farmland is densely peopled as well. When we measure the entire population of Egypt relative to the arable land in the country, the resulting physiologic density figure for c02Population.indd Page 39  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 39  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

 Figure 2.4 bottom
Luxor, Egypt. © Alexander B. Murphy.Egypt in the year 2010 is 2599 per square kilometer 
(5717 per sq mi). This number is far more reflective of Egypt’s population pressure, and it continues to rise rapidly despite Egypt’s efforts to expand its irrigated farmlands.
Appendix B (at the end of this book) provides 
complete data on both arithmetic and physiologic pop-ulation densities, and some of the data stand out mark-edly. Mountainous Switzerland’s physiologic density is 10 times as high as its arithmetic density because only 1 out of every 10 acres in Switzerland is arable. Ukraine’s population is 45,600,000 and its arithmetic density (population per sq km) is 76. Ukraine has vast farm-lands which make its physiologic density 128 people per sq km of arable land. When comparing arithmetic density and physiologic density, the total number of people stays the same, and the only number that changes in calculating each is the amount of land. The difference in arithmetic density and physiologic den-sity for a single country reveals the proportion of arable 
land to all land. In the case of Ukraine, the physiologic density is 1.68 times as high as the arithmetic density because 1 out of every 1.68 acres of land in Ukraine is arable.
In Appendix B, the countries and territories of 
Middle America and the Caribbean stand out as having high physiologic densities compared to the moderate physiologic densities for South America. India’s physi-olog density is the lowest in South Asia despite its huge population. Both China and India have populations well 
over 1 billion, but according to the physiologic density, 
India has much more arable land per person than China.
Population Distribution
People are not distributed evenly across the world or within a country. One-third of the world’s population lives in China and India. Y et, each country has large expanses of land (the Himalayas in India and a vast inte-rior desert in China) where people are absent or sparsely distributed. In addition to studying population densi-ties, geographers study population distributions—descriptions of locations on the Earth’s surface where individuals or groups (depending on the scale) live. Geographers often represent population distributions on dot maps, in which one dot represents a certain 
number of a population. At the local scale, a dot map of population can show each individual farm in a sparsely populated rural area. At the global scale, the data are much more generalized. In the following sec-tion of this chapter, we study world population distri-bution and density.Field Note
“The contrasting character of the Egyptian landscape could not be more striking. Along the Nile River, the landscape is one of green ﬁ  elds, scattered trees, and modest houses, as along this stretch of the river’s west bank near Luxor (Fig. 2.4 top). But anytime I wander away from the river, brown, wind-sculpted sand dominates the scene as far as the eye can see (Fig. 2.4 bottom). Where people live and what they do is not just a product of culture; it is shaped by the physical envi-ronment as well.”c02Population.indd Page 40  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 40  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 Where in the World Do People Live and Why? 41
World Population Distribution and Density
From the beginning of humanity, people have been 
unevenly distributed over the land. T oday, contrasts between crowded countrysides and bustling cities on the one hand and empty reaches on the other hand have only intensiﬁ  ed. Historically, people tended to congregate in 
places where they could grow food—making for a high correlation between arable land and population density. Cities began in agricultural areas, and for most of history, people lived closest to the most agriculturally productive areas. In recent history, advances in agricultural technol-ogy and in transportation of agricultural goods have begun to change this pattern.
At the global scale, where one dot on a map repre-
sents 100,000 people, three major clusters of population jump out (Fig. 2.5). Each of the three largest population clusters is on the Eurasian (Europe and Asia combined) landmass. The fourth largest is in North America.
East Asia
Although the distribution map (Fig. 2.5) requires no color contrasts, Figure 2.6 depicts population density through shading: the darker the color, the larger the number of people per unit area. The most extensive area of dark shading lies in East Asia, primarily in China but also in Korea and Japan. Almost one-quarter of the world’s popu-lation is concentrated here—over 1.34 billion people in China alone.
In addition to high population density in China’s 
large cities, ribbons of high population density extend into the interior along the Yangtze and Y ellow River val-leys. Farmers along China’s major river valleys produce crops of wheat and rice to feed not only themselves but also the population of major Chinese cities such as Shang-hai and Beijing.
South Asia
The second major population concentration also lies in Asia and is similar in many ways to that of East Asia. At the heart of this cluster of more than 1.5 billion people lies India. The concentration extends into Pakistan and Ban-gladesh and onto the island of Sri Lanka. Here, people again cluster in major cities, on the coasts, and along rivers, such as the Ganges and Indus. The South Asia population cluster is growing more rapidly than the others as a result of China’s declining total fertility rate (TFR). Demogra-phers predict that by 2030, 1 out of 6 people in the world will live in India.
T wo physical geography barriers create the bound-
aries of the South Asia population cluster: the Himalaya Mountains to the north and the mountains west of the Indus River Valley in Pakistan. This is a conﬁ  ned region with a rapidly growing population. As in East Asia, the overwhelming majority of the people here are farmers, but in South Asia the pressure on the land is even greater. In Bangladesh, over 152 million people, almost all of them farmers, are crowded into an area about the size of Iowa. Over large parts of Bangladesh the rural population den-sity is between 3000 and 5000 people per square mile. By comparison, in 2010 the population of Iowa was just about 3 million people, and the rural population density was 53 people per square mile.
Europe
An axis of dense population extends from Ireland and the United Kingdom into Russia and includes large parts of Germany, Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus. It also includes the Netherlands and Belgium, parts of France, and north-ern Italy. This European cluster contains over 715 million inhabitants, less than half the population of the South Asia cluster. A comparison of the population and physical maps indicates that in Europe terrain and environment are not as closely related to population distribution as they are in East and South Asia. For example, note the lengthy exten-sion in Figure 2.5, which protrudes far into Russia. Unlike the Asian extensions, which reﬂ  ect fertile river valleys, the 
European extension reﬂ  ects the orientation of Europe’s 
coal ﬁ  elds. If you look closely at the physical map, you will note that comparatively dense population occurs even in mountainous, rugged country, such as the boundary zone between Poland and its neighbors to the south. A much greater correspondence exists between coastal and river lowlands and high population density in Asia than in Europe generally.
Another contrast can be seen in the number of Euro-
peans who live in cities and towns. The European popula-tion cluster includes numerous cities and towns, many of which developed as a result of the Industrial Revolution. In Germany, 88 percent of the people live in urban places; in the United Kingdom, 89 percent; and in France, 
74 percent. With so many people concentrated in the cities, the rural countryside is more open and sparsely populated than in East and South Asia (where only about 40 percent of the people reside in cities and towns).
The three major population concentrations we have 
discussed—East Asia, South Asia, and Europe—account for over 4 billion of the total world population of 7 billion people. Nowhere else on the globe is there a population cluster even half as great as any of these. The populations of South America and Africa combined barely exceed the population of India alone.
North America
North America has one quite densely populated region, stretching along the urban areas of the East Coast, from c02Population.indd Page 41  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 41  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Washington, D.C. in the south to Boston, Massachusetts 
in the north. On Figure 2.5, the cities in this region agglomerate into one large urban area that includes Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New Y ork City, and Boston. Urban geographers use the term mega-lopolis to refer to such huge urban agglomerations. The cities of megalopolis account for more than 20 percent of the U.S. population.
Look at the global-scale map in Figure 2.6 and 
notice that the dense population concentration of meg-alopolis is stretched west into the nearby Canadian cit-ies of T oronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City. Adding these Canadian cities to the population of meg-alopolis creates a population cluster that is about one quarter the size of Europe’s population cluster. If you have lived or traveled in megalopolis, you can think about trafﬁ  c and comprehend what dense population means. However, recognize that the total population of megalopolis is 2.8 percent of the East Asian population cluster and that the 5,309 people per square mile density of New Y ork City does not rival the density in world cit-ies such as Mumbai, India, with a population density of  Figure 2.5

Reliability of Population Data
When the United States planned and conducted its 2010 population census, the government ran adver-tisements on television and sent mailings encouraging every person in the country to be counted. State and city governments also recognized the importance of having their citizens counted in order to gain more fed-eral dollars in per capita outlays because much federal government funding depends on population data. If the population of a disadvantaged group is undercounted, it translates into a loss of dollars for city governments that rely on federal government funding to pay for social services to disadvantaged groups. In addition to governments that provide services, advocates for disad-vantaged groups encourage people to ﬁ  ll out their cen-sus forms: they are concerned that the people already in disadvantaged groups suffer when they are under-counted in the census. Being undercounted also trans-lates into less government representation, for the SOUTHERNATLANTIC

number of congressional seats allotted to each state is 
based on the census counts.
Advocacy groups urged the census in 2000 and again 
in 2010 to sample the population and derive population sta-tistics from the samples. They argued that this would more accurately represent the true number of people in the United States. The United States Census Bureau contin-ued to conduct its census as it always has, trying to count each individual in its borders.
If a prosperous country such as the United States has 
problems conducting an accurate census, imagine the dif-ﬁ culties that must be overcome in less well-off countries. The cost, organization, and reporting of a census go beyond what many countries can afford or handle.
Several agencies collect data on world population. The 
United Nations records ofﬁ  cial statistics that national govern-ments assemble and report. The World Bank and the Popula-tion Reference Bureau also gather and generate data and report on the population of the world and of individual countries.
If you compare the population data reported by each 
of these sources, you will ﬁ  nd inconsistencies in the data. 
Data on population, growth rates, food availability, health conditions, and incomes are often informed estimates rather than actual counts. Figure 2.6

As we discussed in the ﬁ  eld note at the beginning of this 
chapter, the populations of China and India account for 40 percent of the world currently, and India is predicted to outpace China’s population in the 2030s. How will Figure 2.5 look different 50 years from now? If you were updating this textbook in 50 years, where would the largest population clusters in the world be?WHY DO POPULATIONS RISE OR FALL 
IN PARTICULAR PLACES?
In the late 1960s, alarms sounded throughout the 
world with the publication of Paul Ehrlich’s The Popula-
tion Bomb. Ehrlich and others warned that the world’s 
population was increasing too quickly—and was outpac-ing our food production! We can trace alarms over the burgeoning world population back to 1798, when British economist Thomas Malthus published An Essay on the Principles of Population. In this work Malthus warned that  Why Do Populations Rise or Fall in Particular Places?  45

the world’s population was increasing faster than the food 
supplies needed to sustain it. His reasoning was that food supplies grew linearly, adding acreage and crops incre-mentally by year, whereas population grew exponentially, compounding on the year before. From 1803 to 1826, Malthus issued revised editions of his essay and responded vigorously to a barrage of criticism.
The predictions Malthus made assumed food produc-
tion is conﬁ  ned spatially, that what people can eat within a country depends on what is grown in the country. We now know his assumption does not hold true; countries are not closed systems. Malthus did not foresee how globalization would aid the exchange of agricultural goods across the world. Mercantilism, colonialism, and capitalism brought interaction among the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Paciﬁ  c. Through global interaction, new agricultural methods developed, and commodities and livestock dif-fused across oceans. In the 1700s, farmers in Ireland grew dependent on a South American crop that was well suited for its rocky soils, the potato. T oday, wealthier countries that lack arable land, such as Norway, can import the major-ity of its foodstuffs, circumventing the limitations of their

lands. Each of these examples demonstrates that food pro-
duction is not conﬁ  ned spatially, as Malthus assumed.
Malthus assumed the growth of food production was 
linear, but food production has grown exponentially as the acreage under cultivation expands, mechanization of agri-cultural production diffuses, improved strains of seed are developed, and more fertilizers are used. In the twenty-ﬁ rst century, bioengineering continues to bring new 
hybrids, genetically modiﬁ  ed organisms, and countless 
herbicides and pesticides that enabled exponential growth in food production.Nonetheless, Malthus’s ideas continue to attract fol-
lowers. Neo-Malthusian scholars continue to share Mal-thus’s concerns, even if they do not agree with every detail of his argument, and continue to be alarmed at the con-tinuing rise in the world’s population. Neo-Malthusians point out that human suffering is now occurring on a scale unimagined even by Malthus. Although many demogra-phers predict the world population will stabilize later in the twenty-ﬁ  rst century, neo-Malthusians argue that over-population is a real problem that must be addressed now.

Population Growth at World, Regional, 
National, and Local Scales
Analysis of population growth and change requires 
attention to scale. In this section, we examine popula-tion growth at different scales, but we must be mindful that what happens at one scale can be affected by what is happening at other scales and in other places at the same time.
Keeping in mind that population change in one 
place can be affected rapidly by what is going on in a neighboring country or at the regional scale, one can gain some insights by looking at population change within the conﬁ ned territory of a country (or other administrative 
unit, such as a province or city). T o calculate the natural increase in a country’s population, simply subtract deaths from births. This is a simple statistic to calculate and comprehend. However, calculating the natural increase misses two other key components in a country’s popula-tion: immigration, which along with births adds to the total population, and emigration (outmigration), which along with deaths, subtracts from the total population. Using these four components, we can calculate demo-graphic change within a territory.
When we mapped population growth in Figure 2.7, 
we did not take into account emigration and immigra-tion. Other maps and tables of population growth you see may consider emigration and immigration. Statis-tics for each population trait can be calculated globally, by region, by country, or even by smaller locale. When studying population data across scales and across the world, we must constantly remind ourselves of exactly what is being calculated and for where. Otherwise, many of the statistics we read will seemingly be contradictory.
Population Growth at the Regional 
and National Scales
The world map of population growth rates (Fig. 2.7), dis-
played by country, conﬁ  rms the wide range of natural 
increases in different geographic regions. These variations have existed as long as records have been kept: countries and regions go through stages of expansion and decline at varying times. In the mid-twentieth century, the popula-tion of the former Soviet Union was growing vigorously. Thirty years ago, India’s population was growing at nearly 3.0 percent, more than most African countries; then India’s growth rate fell below that of Subsaharan Africa. T oday, Africa’s rate of natural increase still is higher than India’s (2.4 percent to 1.3 percent), but now Subsaharan Africa faces the impact of the AIDS epidemic, which is killing millions, orphaning children, reducing life expectancies, and curtailing growth rates.The map also reveals continuing high growth rates 
in Muslim countries of North Africa and Southwest Asia. Saudi Arabia has one of the highest growth rates in the world, but some smaller countries in this region are increasing even faster. For some time during the second half of the twentieth century, countries in this region saw their growth rates increase even as those in most of the rest of the world were declining. But more recently several of the fast-growing populations, for example, those of Iran and Morocco, have shown signiﬁ  cant 
declines. Demographers point to the correlation between high growth rates and the low standing of women: where cultural traditions restrict educational and professional opportunities for women, and men dominate as a matter of custom, rates of natural increase tend to be high.
South Asia is the most important geographic region 
in the population growth rate picture. The region includes the country that appears destined to overtake China as the world’s most populous: India. Only one country in this region has a growth rate lower than the world average: Sri Lanka. But Sri Lanka’s total popula-tion is only 20.8 million, whereas the fast-growing coun-tries, Pakistan and Bangladesh, have a combined population exceeding 333 million. India, as the map shows, is still growing well above the world average. The situation in East Asia, the world’s most populous region, is different. China’s ofﬁ  cial rate of natural growth has 
fallen well below 1.0 percent (0.5 in 2010), and Japan’s population is no longer growing. Southeast Asia’s natural growth rates remain higher, but this region’s total popu-lation is much lower than either East or South Asia; key countries, such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, have declining growth rates.
South America is experiencing signiﬁ  cant reductions 
in natural population growth rates, where those rates were alarmingly high just a generation ago. The region as a whole is still growing at 1.4 percent, but Brazil’s popula-tion, for example, has declined from 2.9 percent in the mid-1960s to 1.4 percent today. And the populations of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay are growing at rates well below the world average.
As Figure 2.7 shows, the slowest growing countries—
including those with declining rates of natural popula-tion increase—lie in the economically wealthier areas of the world extending from the United States and Canada across Europe and Japan. In the Southern Hemisphere, Australia, New Zealand, and Uruguay are in this category. Wealth is not the only reason for nega-tive population growth rates. Russia’s population is declining because of social dislocation in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union: deteriorating health conditions, high rates of alcoholism and drug use, and economic problems combine to shorten life expectancies c02Population.indd Page 48  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 48  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

(especially among males) and to lower birth rates. In 
recent years, Russia’s economy has improved, but its birth rate has remained low. Similar problems afﬂ  ict 
Ukraine and Kazakhstan, two of Russia’s neighbors, which also show slow or negative growth.
Between 1900 and 2000, the world population rose 
from 1.6 billion people to 6.1 billion, and in 2011, the world population reached 7 billion. The growth in world population is not a result of women having more children. Instead, the last century of population growth stems largely from longer life expectancies. In 1900, global life expectancy was 30 years, and by 2000, it was 65 years. Demographers now predict world population will stabi-lize at around 10 billion people by 2100.
Predictions of a stabilized global population are 
based on a combination of longer life expectancies coupled with lower fertility rates. Demographers measure whether a population can replace its deaths with births by looking at total fertility rates (TFRs). T o reach replacement 
levels—to keep a population stable over time without immigration—the women of childbearing age in a country need a TFR of 2.1. The TFR reports the average number of children born to a woman of childbearing age. In 2000, more than 60 countries, containing 45 percent of the world’s population, had fallen below replacement level (Fig. 2.8).
Demographers at the United Nations predict the 
TFR of the combined world will fall to 2.1 by 2030. The world TFR combines regions including Europe, where fertility levels are low (Fig. 2.9), and regions including Africa, where fertility levels are high. Predicting popula-tion growth is difﬁ  cult because so much depends on the decisions made by women of childbearing age. Demogra-phers and population geographers agree that two major trends are happening now that will inﬂ  uence how much the world population continues to grow. First is the aging population of Europe, China, and Japan, and second is the declining fertility rate in many developing countries including Brazil and Iran.
Both the aging population of developed countries 
and the declining fertility rates in developing countries lead to predictions that the global population will con-tinue to grow but at a lower rate. The United Nations reports the proportion of older to younger people in a country with the aging index, which is the number of people age 65 and older per 100 children ages 0–14. The aging index reveals an older Europe with 263 older people for every 100 children and a younger Africa with 37 older people for every 100 children.
Why are women having fewer children? In wealthier 
countries, more women are choosing to stay in school, work on careers, and marry later, delaying childbirth. The impact of the aging population of Europe can be seen in the number of elderly people each person in the working-age population supports through taxes.An aging population requires substantial social 
adjustments. Older people retire and eventually suffer health problems, so they need pensions and medical care. The younger workers in the population must work in order to provide the tax revenues that enable the state to pay for these services. As the proportion of older people in a country increases, the proportion of younger people decreases. Thus, fewer young workers are providing tax revenues to support programs providing services for more retired people. T o change the age distribution of an aging country and provide more taxpayers, the only answer is immigration: inﬂ  uxes of younger workers to do the work 
locals are unable or unwilling to do.
What will happen when a country resists immigra-
tion despite an aging population? Over the next half-century, Japan will be an interesting case study. Japan’s population is no longer growing, and projections indi-cate the Japanese population will decline as it ages. The population fell from a peak of 127.84 million in 2004 to 127.51 million in 2009. Japan predicts its population will fall below 100 million to 95.15 million by 2050. Japan was a closed society for hundreds of years, and even today, the Japanese government discourages immigra-tion and encourages homogeneity of the population. More than 98 percent of the country’s population is Japa-nese, according to government statistics. In August 
1999, the British newspaper The Guardian reported that the Japanese government’s efforts to maintain the homo-geneity of the population are often “lauded domestically as a reason for the country’s low crime rate” and strong industrial economy.
In developing countries, a combination of govern-
ment and nongovernment organizational programs encourage women to have fewer children. Some women are also choosing to have fewer children because of eco-nomic and social uncertainty in the developing world. T oday, TFRs are falling almost everywhere on Earth, in large part because of family planning. In some countries fertility rates are declining dramatically. Kenya’s TFR is now down to 4.6; China’s fell from 6.1 to 1.75 in just 35 years, and in 2010 dropped to 1.5. Once the government of Iran began to allow family planning, the TFR fell from 6.8 in 1980 to 1.8 in 2010.
There was a time when a low TFR seemed to be a 
desirable national objective, something that all govern-ments would surely want. However, long-term eco-nomic implications and demographic projections gave many governments pause. Countries need a young, vig-orous, working-age population in order to work and pay taxes to support the long-term needs of an aging popu-lation. When governments saw their population growth rates decline sharply, many took countermeasures. China softened its One-Child Only policy, Sweden, Russia, and other European countries provided ﬁ  nancial

TFRs and population decline? Despite declining popu-
lation growth rates and even negative growth rates (growth rates below 0.0) in a number of the world’s countries, the global population continues to rise. The worldwide TFR was 2.6 in 2007, above the replacement level of 2.1. Although the population bomb Ehrlich warned of is no longer ticking at the same rapid pace, the worldwide population continues to grow. The low TFRs incentives like long maternity leaves and state-paid day-care to prospective mothers, and even the Japanese found themselves in a national debate over family size and immigration. Still, such programs and debates have so far had limited success in encouraging sustained pop-ulation growth.
How can the worldwide population continue to 
increase when so many countries are experiencing low  Figure 2.8

and low population growth rates enumerated in this 
chapter are dwarfed by continued additions to the popu-lation in countries where growth rates are still relatively high, such as India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nigeria.
One way to easily grasp the growth rate in world 
population is to compare the population’ s rate of growth 
to its doubling time. Every rate of growth has a dou-bling time; for example, if you invest $100 at 10 per-cent, compounded annually (exponentially), it would take about seven years to double to $200, and then another seven years to become $400, and then another seven years to become $800. When the growth rate is 10 percent, therefore, the doubling time is around seven years.
T wo thousand years ago, the world’s population was 
an estimated 250 million. More than 16 centuries passed before this total had doubled to 500 million, the estimated Tropic of CancerArctic Circle

falling in many places, fears of global population doubling 
quickly are deﬁ  nitely subsiding. Many indicators, such as 
the slowing of the doubling time, suggest that the worst may be over, that the explosive population growth of the twentieth century will be followed by a marked and accel-erating slowdown during the twenty-ﬁ  rst century. The 
global growth rate is now down to 1.4 percent, perhaps slightly lower. But today the world’s population is 7 bil-lion, yielding an increase in world population that still exceeds 80 million annually at this growth rate.
As a result of falling TFRs in both the developing 
and developed world, demographers no longer caution about doubling time. With women having fewer chil-dren, many demographers are predicting the world may reach zero population growth in the next 50 years. In population in 1650. Just 170 years later, in 1820 (when Malthus was still writing), the population had doubled again, to 1 billion (Fig. 2.10). And barely more than a cen-tury after this, in 1930, it reached 2 billion. The doubling time was down to 100 years and dropping fast; the popu-lation explosion was in full gear. Only 45 years elapsed during the next doubling, to 4 billion (1975). During the mid-1980s, when the rate declined to 1.8 percent, the doubling slowed to 39 years. T oday, world population is doubling in 54 years, and the continuing slowdown in the estimated doubling rate is one of the bright spots in the problematic demographic picture.
For demographers and population geographers who 
study global population growth today, the concept of dou-bling time is losing much of its punch. With populations  Figure 2.9

Field Note
“My mind was on wine. I was in Bordeaux, France, walking down the street to the Bordeaux Wines Museum (Musée des Vins de Bordeaux) with a friend from the city. Hav-ing just ﬂ  own from Dakar, Senegal, after spending several 
weeks in Subsaharan Africa, I found my current surround-ings strikingly different. Observing the buildings and the people around me, I noticed that after having been among so many young children in Subsaharan Africa, the majority of the inhabitants I encountered in Bordeaux were adults. I turned to my friend and asked, ‘Where are all the children?’ He looked around, pointed, and replied, ‘There goes one now!’ In Bordeaux, in Paris, in all of France and the rest of Europe, there are fewer children and populations are aging (Fig. 2.9).”c02Population.indd Page 52  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 52  9/12/11  7:48 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 Why Do Populations Rise or Fall in Particular Places?  53
Population Growth within Countries
The information provided in Figure 2.7 is based on 
countrywide statistics. Signiﬁ  cant demographic varia-tions also occur within countries. Political geographers call countries states. State governments partition their countries into administrative units called States (United States), provinces (Canada), departments (France) or the like. In India, for example, States in the north record population growth rates far above the national average (Fig. 2.11). But other States, in the west and southwest region, have populations that are growing much more slowly. Women in southern India have higher female lit-eracy, greater land ownership rates, better access to health care, and more access to birth control methods. All of these factors keep the growth rates lower in the south than the north of India.
In the 1950s, India became the ﬁ  rst country in the 
world to institute a population planning program, before the fear of worldwide overpopulation and a global popula-tion bomb spread. In the 1960s, when census numbers revealed the extreme growth rates in the north, the Indian government instituted a national population planning program, encouraging States to join.
Despite the federal effort, rapid population growth 
continues, especially in the northern and eastern States. India is a federation of 28 States and 7 union territories, and the individual States differ greatly both culturally and politically. Social problems arose in some of the States where governments pursued the population planning campaign vigorously. During the 1970s, the Indian gov-ernment began a policy of forced sterilization of any man with three or more children. The State of Maharashtra sterilized 3.7 million people before public opposition led to rioting, and the government abandoned the program (Fig. 2.12). Other States also engaged in compulsory ster-ilization programs, with heavy social and political costs—eventually, 22.5 million people were sterilized.
The horrors of the forced sterilization program of 
the 1970s are haunting India again. In 2004, three dis-tricts in the State of Uttar Pradesh (India’s most popu-lous State with over 170 million people) instituted a policy of exchanging gun licenses for sterilization. The policy allowed for a shotgun license in exchange for the sterilization of two people and a revolver license in exchange for the sterilization of ﬁ  ve people. Abuse 
began almost immediately, with wealthy landowners sterilizing their laborers in exchange for gun licenses. Before the “guns for sterilization” policy, districts in Uttar Pradesh encouraged sterilization by providing access to housing and extra food for people who agreed to be sterilized.
T oday, most Indian State governments are using 
advertising and persuasion—not guns for sterilization—to encourage families to have fewer children. Posters urging fact, current predictions point to zero population growth globally by the end of the century, with population rising to 9.3 billion by 2050 and then leveling off around 10 billion people.
No single factor can explain the variations shown 
in Figure 2.7. Economic prosperity as well as social dis-location reduce natural population growth rates. Eco-nomic well-being, associated with urbanization, higher levels of education, later marriage, family planning, and other factors, lowers population growth. In the table presented in Appendix B, compare the indices for natu-ral population increase and the percentage of the popu-lation that is urbanized. In general, the higher the population’s level of urbanization, the lower its natural increase. Cultural traditions also inﬂ  uence rates of pop-ulation growth, Religion, for example, has a powerful impact on family planning and thus on growth rates, not only in Islamic countries but also in traditional Chris-tian societies (note the Roman Catholic Philippines’ growth rate) and in Hindu-dominated communities (such as India).

ernment supports a network of family planning clinics even in the remotest villages. The southern States con-tinue to report the lowest growth rates, correlating with higher wealth and higher education levels and literacy rates of females in these States. The eastern and northern States, the poorer regions of India, continue to report the highest growth rates.
Our world map of growth rates is a global overview, a 
mere introduction to the complexities of the geography of population. The example of India demonstrates that what we see at the scale of a world map does not give us the complete story of what is happening within each country or region of the world. Both India and China have over 1 billion people, but as a result of the higher growth rates in India (1.64) and declining growth rates in China (.5), demographers predict India will become the most popu-lated country in the world in 2030.
The Demographic Transition
The high population growth rates now occurring in many poorer countries are not necessarily permanent. In Europe, population growth changed several times in the last three centuries. Demographers used data on baptisms and funerals from churches in Great Britain to study changes in birth and death rates of the population. They expected the rate of natural increase of the population—the difference between the number of births and the num-ber of deaths—to vary over different periods of time. Demographers calculated the crude birth rate (CBR), 
the number of live births per year per thousand people in the population (Fig. 2.13), and the crude death rate 
(CDR), the number of deaths per year per thousand peo-ple (Fig. 2.14).
The church data revealed that before the Industrial 
Revolution began in Great Britain in the 1750s, the coun-try experienced high birth rates and high death rates, with small differences between the two. The result was low population growth. After industrialization began, the death rates in Great Britain began to fall as a result of bet-ter and more stable access to food and improved access to increasingly effective medicines. With a rapidly falling death rate and a birth rate that remained high, Britain’s population explosion took place. From the late 1800s through two world wars in the 1900s, death rates contin-ued to fall and birth rates began to fall, but stayed higher than death rates, resulting in continued population growth but at a slower rate. Finally, in recent history, both the birth rate and death rate in Great Britain declined to low levels, resulting in slow or stabilized pop-ulation growth.
Demographers call the shift in population growth 
the demographic transition. The transition is typically 
modeled as shown in Figure 2.15. The model is based on the kind of shift that Britain experienced, but other places either have gone through a similar shift or are in the pro-cess of doing so. The initial low-growth phase, which in all places endured for most of human history, is marked by high birth rates and equally high death rates. In this phase, epidemics and plagues keep the death rates high among all sectors of the population—in some cases so high that they exceed birth rates. For Great Britain and the rest of Europe, death rates exceeded birth rates during the bubonic plague (the Black Death) of the 1300s, which hit in waves beginning in Crimea on the Black Sea, diffusing through trade to Sicily and other Mediterranean islands, and moving through contagious diffusion and the travel of rats (which hosted the vector, the ﬂ  ea, that spread the plague) north from the Mediterranean.
Once the plague hit a region, it was likely to return 
within a few years time, creating another wave of human suf-fering. Estimates of plague deaths vary between one-quarter and one-half of the population, with the highest death rates recorded in the West (where trade among regions was the greatest) and the lowest in the East (where cooler climates and less connected populations delayed diffusion). Across Europe, many cities and towns were left decimated. Histo-rians estimate the population of Great Britain fell from nearly 4 million when the plague began to just over 2 mil-lion when it ended.
Famines also limited population growth. A famine in 
Europe just prior to the plague likely facilitated the diffu-sion of the disease by weakening the people. Records of famines in India and China during the eighteenth and nine-teenth centuries document millions of people perishing. At other times, destructive wars largely wiped out population gains. Charts of world population growth show an increase in the world’s population from 250 million people 2000 years ago to 500 million people in 1650 and 1 billion people in 1820. However, the lines connecting these points in time should not trend steadily upward. Rather, they turn up and down frequently, reﬂ  ecting the impacts of disease, crop 
failures, and wars.
The beginning of the Industrial Revolution ush-
ered in a period of accelerating population growth in Europe. Before workers could move from farms to facto-ries, a revolution in agriculture had to occur. The eigh-teenth century marked the Second Agricultural Revolution, so named because the ﬁ  rst occurred thou-sands of years earlier (see Chapter 11). During the Sec-ond Agricultural Revolution, farmers improved seed selection, practiced new methods of crop rotation, selec-tively bred livestock to increase production and quality, employed new technology such as the seed drill, expanded storage capacities, and consolidated landhold-ings for greater efﬁ  ciencies. With more efﬁ  cient farming 
methods, the number of people needed in farming decreased and the food supply increased, thereby sup-porting a higher population overall.

In the 1800s, as the Industrial Revolution diffused 
through continental Europe, other advances also helped 
lower death rates. Sanitation facilities made towns and cities safer from epidemics, and modern medical prac-tices diffused. Disease prevention through vaccination introduced a new era in public health. The combined improvements in food supply and medical practice resulted in a drastic reduction in death rates. Before 1750 death rates in Europe probably averaged 35 per 1000 (birth rates averaged under 40), but by 1850 the death rate was down to about 16 per 1000.Birth rates fell at a slower rate, leading to a popula-
tion explosion. The increase in the rate of population growth in Europe spurred waves of migration. Millions of people left the squalid, crowded industrial cities (and farms as well) to emigrate to other parts of the world. They were not the ﬁ  rst to make this journey. Adventurers, explorers, merchants, and colonists had gone before them. In a major wave of colonization from 1500 through the 1700s, Euro-pean migrants decimated native populations through con-quest, slavery, and the introduction of diseases against which the local people had no natural immunity.c02Population.indd Page 56  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 56  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 Why Do Populations Rise or Fall in Particular Places?  57
When a second wave of European colonization began 
in Africa and Asia during the late 1800s, the Europeans 
brought with them their newfound methods of sanitation and medical techniques, and these had the opposite effect. By the mid-1900s, declining death rates in Africa, India, and South America brought rapid population increases to these regions. At this point, new alarms and cautions of worldwide overpopulation rang.
Although the global alarms continued to ring, they 
subsided for populations in Europe and North America when population growth rates began to decline in the ﬁ rst half of the 1900s. The cause was a signiﬁ  cant 
decline in birth rates. Populations continued to grow, but at a much slower rate. Many countries in Latin America and Asia experienced falling birth rates later in the twentieth century, which helped slow the global population growth rate.
Why have birth rates declined? Throughout the 
1900s, lower birth rates arrived ﬁ  rst in countries with 
greater urbanization, wealth, and medical advances. As more and more people moved to cities, both the econom-ics and the culture of large families changed. Instead of Tropic of Cancer

decisions by many women to have fewer or no children or 
to start having children at a later age have all lowered birth rates within a country.
In some parts of the world, countries are now experi-
encing exceptionally low TFRs. Low birth rates along with low death rates put the countries in a position of neg-ligible, or even negative, population growth. Birth rates are lowest in the countries where women are the most educated and most involved in the labor force.lending a hand on the family farm, children in urban areas were often seen as a drain on the family ﬁ  nances. At 
the same time, new opportunities—especially for women—were not always compatible with large families. Hence, many women delayed marriage and childbearing. Medical advances lowered infant and child mortality rates, lessen-ing the sense that multiple children were necessary to sustain a family.

Future Population Growth
It may be unwise to assume that the demographic cycles of 
all countries will follow the sequence that occurred in industrializing Europe or to believe that the still-signiﬁ  cant 
population growth currently taking place in Bangladesh, Mexico, and numerous other countries will simply sub-side. Nonetheless, many agencies monitoring global pop-ulation suggest that the populations of most (if not all) countries will stop growing at some time during the twenty-ﬁ  rst century, reaching a so-called stationary pop-
ulation level (SPL). This would mean that the world’s population would stabilize and that the major problems to be faced would involve the aged rather than the young.
Such predictions require frequent revision, how-
ever, and anticipated dates for population stabilization are often moved back. Only a few years ago, the United Nations predicted world population would stabilize at c02Population.indd Page 59  10/21/11  12:06 PM user f-400c02Population.indd Page 59  10/21/11  12:06 PM user f-400 F-400F-400
60 Chapter 2   Population
WHY DOES POPULATION COMPOSITION 
MATTER?
Maps showing the regional distribution and density 
of populations tell us about the number of people in coun-
tries or regions, but they cannot reveal two other aspects of those populations: the number of men and women and their ages. These aspects of population, the population 
composition, are important because a populous country where half the population is very young has quite different problems than a populous country where a large propor-tion of the population is elderly. When geographers study populations, therefore, they are concerned not only with spatial distribution and growth rates but also with popula-tion composition.
The composition is the structure of a population in 
terms of age, sex, and other properties such as marital status and education. Age and sex are key indicators of population composition, and demographers and geogra-phers use population pyramids to represent these traits visually.
The population pyramid displays the percentages of 
each age group in the total population (normally ﬁ  ve-year 
increments) by a horizontal bar whose length represents its share. Males in the group are to the left of the center line, females to the right.
A population pyramid can instantly convey the 
demographic situation in a country. In poorer coun-tries, where birth and death rates generally remain high, the pyramid looks like an evergreen tree, with wide branches at the base and short ones near the top 10 billion in 200 years. The United Nations changed its predictions based on lower fertility rates in many coun-tries. All agencies reporting population predictions have to revise their predictions periodically. In the late 1980s, for example, the World Bank predicted that the United States would reach SPL in 2035 with 276 mil-lion inhabitants. Brazil’s population would stabilize at 353 million in 2070, Mexico’s at 254 million in 2075, and China’s at 1.4 billion in 2090. India, destined to become the world’s most populous country, would reach SPL at 1.6 billion in 2150.
T oday these ﬁ  gures are unrealistic. China’s popula-
tion passed the 1.2 billion mark in 1994, and India’s reached 1 billion in 1998. If we were to project an optimis-tic decline in growth rates for both countries, China’s population would “stabilize” at 1.4 billion in 2025 and India’s at 1.7 billion in 2060, according to a 2011 United Nations report. But population increase is a cyclical phe-nomenon, and overall declines mask lags and spurts as well as regional disparities.
Examine Appendix B at the end of the book. Study the growth rate column. Which countries have the highest growth rates? Determine what stage of the demographic transition these countries are in, and hypothesize what may lead them to the next stage. Figure 2.15

 Why Does Population Composition Matter?  61
In countries with economic wealth, pyramid shapes 
change. Families become smaller, children fewer. A 
composite population pyramid for wealthier countries looks like a slightly lopsided vase, with the largest com-ponents of the population not at the bottom but in the middle. The middle-age bulge is moving upward, reﬂ ecting the aging of the population (Fig. 2.17) and the 
declining TFR. Countries with low TFR and high wealth, such as Italy, France, and Sweden, ﬁ  t into this pyramid model.(Fig. 2.16). The youngest age groups have the largest share of the population; in the composite pyramid shown here, the three groups up to age 14 account for more than 30 percent of the population. Older people, in the three highest age groups, represent only about 4 percent of the total. Slight variations of this pyramidal shape mark the population structure of such countries as Pakistan, Y emen, Guatemala, The Congo, and Laos. From age group 15 to 19 upward, each group is smaller than the one below it. Figure 2.16

INFLUENCE POPULATION DYNAMICS?
The condition of a country’s population requires much 
more than simply knowing the total population or the growth 
rate. Also of signiﬁ  cance is the welfare of the country’s people across regions, ethnicities, or social classes. Among the most important inﬂ  uences on population dynamics are geographical differences in sanitation, the prevalence of diseases, and the availability of health care.Infant Mortality
One of the leading measures of the condition of a coun-try’s population is the infant mortality rate (IMR). Infant mortality is recorded as a baby’s death during the ﬁ  rst year 
following its birth (unlike child mortality, which records death between ages 1 and 5). Infant mortality is normally given as the number of cases per thousand, that is, per thousand live births.
Infant and child mortality reﬂ  ect the overall health 
of a society. High infant mortality has a variety of causes, c02Population.indd Page 62  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 62  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

the physical health of the mother being a key factor. In 
societies where most women bear a large number of babies, the women also tend to be inadequately nourished, exhausted from overwork, suffering from disease, and poorly educated. Often, infants die because they are improperly weaned. Demographers report that many children die because their parents do not know how to cope with the routine childhood problem of diarrhea. This condition, together with malnutrition, is the leading killer of children throughout the world. Poor sanitation is yet another threat to infants and children. Estimates are that more than one-ﬁ  fth of the world’s population lacks ready access to clean drinking water or hygienic human waste-disposal facilities.
The map showing the world distribution of infant mor-
tality (Fig. 2.18) reveals high rates in many poorer countries. The map shows infant mortality patterns at ﬁ  ve levels ranging from 100 or more per thousand (one death for every eight live births) to fewer than 15. Compare this map to that of overall crude death rate (CDR) in Figure 2.14, and the role of infant mortality in societies with high death rates is evident.
The lowest infant mortality rate among larger popu-
lations has long been reported by Japan, with 3.0 deaths per 1000 live births in a country of over 127 million people.

64 Chapter 2   Population
Some less populated countries show even lower IMRs. Sin-
gapore has over 4.5 million people and an incredibly low IMR of just under 3, and Sweden’s nearly 9 million people record an IMR of 2.8.
In 2008, 22 countries still reported an IMR of 100 or 
more, and several had rates of 125 or higher—that is, one death or more among every eight newborns. Sierra Leone and Afghanistan had the highest IMR: 165. Dreadful as these ﬁ  gures are, they are a substantial improvement over the situation 20 years ago (although they are not much improved since 1997). Globally, infant mortality has been declining, even in the poverty-stricken regions of the world.
Each of these observations about infant mortality 
rates considers what is happening within an entire coun-try. The IMR varies within countries and gives us a lens into variations in access to health care and health educa-tion within a country. A statistic typically varies by region, ethnicity, social class, or other criteria. The IMR of South Africa is 48 per 1000, an average of all the people within the country’s borders. The IMR for South African whites is near the European average; for black Africans it is nearer the African average; and for the Coloured and Asian population sectors it lies between these two ﬁ  gures. 
The reported average for South Africa does not tell ethnic and class differences within South Africa.
In the United States, in 2004, the IMR for African 
Americans was 13.6, above the countrywide average of 6.8 and the IMR of 5.7 for non-Hispanic whites. The risk fac-tors that lead to a high IMR afﬂ  ict African Americans at a 
much higher rate than non-Hispanic whites in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 88.9 percent of non-Hispanic whites but only 76.5 percent of African Americans received prenatal care starting in the ﬁ rst trimester of their pregnancy. Lower education levels 
for African American women also contributed to the higher IMR. One risk factor that contributes to high IMR, smok-ing during pregnancy, was higher for non-Hispanic whites. The Centers for Disease Control found that 13.8 percent of non-Hispanic whites smoked cigarettes during preg-nancy in 2004, and 8.4 percent of African American women smoked during pregnancy.
The IMR in the United States also varies by 
region, with the highest IMR in the South and the low-est in the Northeast (Fig. 2.19). Race, ethnicity, social

ries, causes the deaths of millions more. In some coun-
tries, more than one in ﬁ  ve children still die between their ﬁ  rst and ﬁ  fth birthdays, a terrible record in the twenty-ﬁ  rst century.
Life Expectancy
Another indicator of a society’s well-being lies in the life expectancy of its members at birth, the number of years, on average, someone may expect to remain alive. Figure 2.21 shows the average life expectancies of popu-lations by country and thus does not take into account gender differences. Women outlive men by about four years in Europe and East Asia, three years in Subsaharan Africa, six years in North America, and seven years in South America. In Russia today, the difference is approximately 12 years.
The map does reveal huge regional contrasts. At 
the start of the century, world average life expectancy was 68 for women and 64 for men. Not only are these levels exceeded in the wealthy countries of the West-ern world, but great progress has also been made in East Asia, where Japan’s life expectancies are the high-est in the world. With its low infant and child mortal-ity rates and low fertility rates, Japan’s life expectancy is predicted to rise to 106 by the year 2300. By con-trast, tropical Subsaharan African countries have the lowest life expectancies. In Subsaharan Africa, the spread of AIDS over the past three decades has low-ered life expectancies in some countries below 40, a level not seen for centuries.
Life expectancies can change in relatively short 
order. In the former Soviet Union, and especially in Rus-sia, the life expectancies of males dropped quite precipi-tously following the collapse of communism, from 68 to 62 years. In 2010, the United Nations estimated the life expectancy for males in Russia was 63. A 2010 report in Foreign Affairs credited “poor diet, smoking, sedentary lifestyles” and alcoholism as the main reasons why men in Russia have lower life expectancies than women.” In 2011, the United Nations estimated Russia’s life expectancy for females was 75, twelve years longer than the life expec-tancy of Russian men.
Life expectancy ﬁ  gures do not mean everyone lives 
to a certain age. The ﬁ  gure is an average that takes account of the children who die young and the people who survive well beyond the average. The dramatically lower ﬁ  gures 
for the world’s poorer countries primarily reﬂ  ect high 
infant mortality. A person who has survived beyond child-hood can survive well beyond the recorded life expec-tancy. The low life expectancy ﬁ  gures for the malnourished countries remind us again how hard hit children are in poorer parts of the world.class, education levels, and access to health care also vary by region in the United States, and these correla-tions are found for many health problems from diabetes to heart disease.
According to the Ofﬁ  ce of Minority Health and 
Health Disparities at the Centers for Disease Control in the United States, “The leading causes of infant death include congenital abnormalities, pre-term/low birth weight, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), prob-lems related to complications of pregnancy, and respira-tory distress syndrome. SIDS deaths among American Indian and Alaska Natives is 2.3 times the rate for non-Hispanic white mothers.”
Another measurement of the health of children 
early in life is the newborn death rate, a measurement of the number of children who die in the ﬁ  rst month of life 
out of every 1000 live births. Surprisingly, the United States has the second highest newborn death rate  in the 
world. The annual State of the World’s Mothers report explains that the high newborn death rate in the United States and in other wealthy countries is typically from premature births and low-birth-rate babies. In the poorer countries of the world, diarrhea and infections cause half of newborn deaths.
Figure 2.20 maps the Mother’s Index from the State 
of the World’s Mothers report. The Mother’s Index mea-sures 10 barometers of well-being for mothers and chil-dren. Although the United States has a high newborn death rate, its position on the Mother’s Index is high. The overwhelmingly low measurements for Subsaharan Africa on the Mother’s Index conﬁ  rms that poverty is a huge fac-tor in the health of women and children. Speciﬁ  cally, 
99 percent of newborn deaths and 98 percent of maternal deaths (deaths from giving birth) occur in the poorer countries of the world.
In the countries in the world experiencing violent 
conﬂ ict, the Mother’s Index plunges, and the chances of 
newborn survival fall. Examine Figure 2.20 again and note the position of countries that have violent conﬂ  ict or a 
recent history of conﬂ  ict: Iraq, Afghanistan, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Angola.
Child Mortality
Infants who survive their ﬁ  rst year of life still do not have a long life expectancy in the poorer areas of the world. The child mortality rate, which records the deaths of children between the ages of 1 and 5, remains staggeringly high in much of Africa and Asia, notably in the protein-deﬁ  cient tropical and subtropical zones. Kwashiorkor (also known as protein malnutrition), a malady resulting from a lack of protein early in life, afﬂ icts millions of children; marasmus, a condition that 
results from inadequate protein and insufﬁ  cient calo-c02Population.indd Page 65  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 65  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Inﬂ  uence on Health and Well-Being
Health and well-being are closely related to location and 
environment. People who live in Iceland (where mosqui-toes are rare) do not need to worry about contracting malaria, unless they travel to parts of the tropics where malaria prevails. People who live in close proximity to animals, including livestock, run a greater risk of catching certain diseases than do people who live in cities. When an outbreak of a particular disease occurs (for example “bird ﬂ u” in East Asia), its source and diffusion are studied by 
specialists in medical geography.Medical geographers study diseases, and they also 
use locational analysis to predict diffusion and prescribe prevention strategies. A medical geographer can answer questions such as: Where is the bird ﬂ  u most likely to dif-
fuse and under what time line if an outbreak occurs in New Y ork City? If a country receives enough funding to build 25 clinics for people in rural areas, where should these clinics be located so as to allow a maximum of patients to be able to reach them?
Diseases can be grouped into categories to make it 
easier to understand the risks they pose. About 65 per-cent of all diseases are known as infectious diseases ,  Figure 2.20

resulting from an invasion of parasites and their multipli-
cation in the body. Malaria is an infectious disease. The remainder can be divided into the chronic or degenera-tive diseases, the maladies of longevity and old age such as heart disease, and the genetic or inherited diseases  
we can trace to our ancestry, that is, the chromosomes and genes that deﬁ  ne our makeup. Sickle-cell anemia, 
hemophilia, and lactose intolerance are among these genetic diseases. These can be of special geographic interest because they tend to appear in certain areas and in particular populations, suggesting the need for special, local treatment.Three geographic terms are used to describe the spa-
tial extent of a disease. A disease is endemic when it pre-vails over a small area. A disease is epidemic when it spreads over a large region. A pandemic disease is global in scope.
Infectious Diseases

that erupted in Africa only about 30 years ago, has killed 
about 25 million people since that time. These two mala-dies illustrate two kinds of infectious disease: vectored and nonvectored.
A vectored infectious disease such as malaria is trans-
mitted by a intermediary vector—in malaria’s case a mos-quito. What happens is that the mosquito stings an already-infected person or animal, called a host, and sucks up some blood carrying the parasites. These parasites then reproduce and multiply in the mosquito’s body and reach its saliva. The next time that mosquito stings someone, some of the parasites are injected into that person’s blood-stream. Now that person develops malaria as the parasites multiply in his or her body, and he or she is a host.Mosquitoes are especially effective vectors of 
infectious diseases ranging from yellow fever (another historic illness) to dengue fever (a newer disease that is fast spreading—see Chapter 1). But mosquitoes are only one kind of vector. Fleas, flies, worms, snails, and other vectors transmit such terrible diseases as sleep-ing sickness, river blindness, guinea worm, elephantia-sis, and numerous others. T ropical climates, where warm, moist conditions allow vectors to thrive, are the worst-afflicted areas of the world, but infectious dis-eases are a global phenomenon.
No disease in human history has taken more lives 
than malaria, and the battle against this scourge still is not won. On the day you read this, about 3000 people will die c02Population.indd Page 68  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 68  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

from malaria, the great majority of them in Africa and 
most of them children. What these numbers do not tell you is that an estimated 3 to 5 million people live lives that are shortened and weakened by malaria infection. If you do not die from malaria as a youngster, you are likely to be incapacitated or struggle in exhaustion with chronically severe anemia throughout your life (see Chapter 10 for a longer discussion of malaria).
Nonvectored infectious diseases, such as inﬂ  uenza, 
are transmitted by direct contact between host and victim. A kiss, a handshake, or even the slightest brush can trans-mit inﬂ  uenza, a cold, or some other familiar malady. Even standing close to another person who exhales and spreads tiny moisture particles can transmit the disease to you. HIV/AIDS (discussed below) is a nonvectored infectious disease that is transmitted primarily through sexual con-tact and secondarily through needle sharing in intrave-nous drug use.
Chronic and Genetic Diseases
Chronic diseases (also called degenerative diseases) are the afﬂ ictions of middle and old age, reﬂ  ecting higher life 
expectancies. Among the chronic diseases, heart disease, cancers, and strokes rank as the leading diseases in this cat-egory, but pneumonia, diabetes, and liver diseases also take their toll. In the United States 100 years ago, tuberculosis, Tropic of Cancer

the result can be serious metabolic malfunction. For 
example, some people suffer from a malady called primary lactose intolerance. If you suffer from this disorder, you do not have an adequate supply of one (or a set) of enzymes that you need to break down the milk sugar lactose.
AIDS
Low life expectancies in some parts of the world are caused by the ravages of diseases such as AIDS (Acquired Immune Deﬁ  ciency Syndrome)—a disease identiﬁ  ed in 
Africa in the early 1980s. Undoubtedly, AIDS had taken hold in Africa years earlier, perhaps decades earlier. But its rapid diffusion worldwide began in the 1980s, creat-ing one of the greatest health catastrophes of the past century. Nowhere has its impact been greater than in Africa itself.
Medical geographers estimate that in 1980 about 
200,000 people were infected with HIV (Human Immu-nodeﬁ  ciency Virus, which causes AIDS), all of them 
Africans. By 2007, the number worldwide exceeded 33.2 million according to the United Nations AIDS Program, with 68 percent (22.5 million) of all cases in Subsaharan Africa! The infection rate has been slowing, and some regions have experienced a downturn, but eastern Europe and Central Asia have recently seen a surge in HIV infection.
AIDS is a debilitating disease that weakens the body 
and reduces its capacity to combat other infections. It is spread through bodily contact that involves the exchange of bodily ﬂ  uids such as blood or semen. Sexual activity and shared needles can transmit it, but so can blood transfu-sions. Over a period of years, a person’s immune system is impaired, weight loss and weakness set in, and other afﬂ  ic-
tions, such as cancer or pneumonia, may hasten an infected person’s demise.
Over the past two decades, the AIDS pandemic has 
reached virtually all parts of the world, but its full dimen-sions are unknown. People infected by HIV do not imme-diately display visible symptoms of the disease; they can carry the virus for years without being aware of it, and during that period they can unwittingly transmit it to oth-ers. In its earliest stages a blood test is needed to conﬁ  rm 
HIV’s presence, but millions go untested. Add to this the social stigma many people attach to this malady, and it is evident that ofﬁ  cial statistics on AIDS lag behind the real numbers.
That is true not only in Africa but in other parts of 
the world as well; both India and China, for example, long denied that AIDS presents a serious health threat to their populations. Now China is reporting at least 650,000 infected, and the number in India may well exceed 5 million. Estimates of the number of cases in the United States surpass 1 million; in Middle and South pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, and heart diseases (in that order) were the chief killers. T oday, heart disease and cancer head the list, with stroke (cerebral hemorrhage) next and accidents also high on the list (T able 2.1). In the early 1900s, tuberculosis and pneumonia caused 20 per-cent of all deaths; today, they cause fewer than 5 percent. The diarrheal diseases, which were so high on the old list, are now primarily children’s maladies. T oday, the diar-rheal diseases are not even on the list of the 10 leading 
causes of death.
At the global scale, diseases of infancy have been 
largely defeated, and such infectious diseases as tuberculosis and pneumonia are less serious threats than they were. The battles against cancer and heart disease, however, are far from won. Recent decades have brought new lifestyles, new pressures, new consumption patterns, and exposure to new chemicals, and we do not know how these affect our health. In order to distribute adequate food supplies to populations in huge urban areas, we add various kinds of preservatives to foods without knowing exactly how they will affect our health in the long run. We substitute artiﬁ  cial ﬂ  avoring for 
sugar and other calorie-rich substances, but some of those substitutes have been proven to be dangerous. Despite all the sugar substitutes, obesity plagues a signiﬁ  cant percent-
age of the U.S. population, bringing with it heart disease and diabetes. Even the treatment of drinking water with chemicals is rather recent in the scheme of global popula-tion change, and we do not know its long-term effects. Future chronic diseases may come from practices we take for granted as normal now.
Genetic diseases are of particular interest to medical 
geographers because they are disorders that tend to be transferred from one generation to the next and display clustering that raises questions about environment and long-term adaptation. Prominent among these are meta-bolic diseases—the body’s inability to process all elements of the diet—in which enzymes play a key role. If the body fails to produce enough (or any) of a particular enzyme, TABLE 2.1

America, nearly 2 million are infected. Southeast Asia 
now has as many as 6 million cases.
Nowhere is AIDS having the impact that it has had 
on Subsaharan Africa, however. In 2006, some 24 percent of people aged 15 to 49 were infected in Botswana, 20 per-cent in Zimbabwe, almost 19 percent in South Africa, and 17 percent in Zambia. These are the ofﬁ  cial data; medical geographers estimate that 20 to 25 percent of the entire population of several tropical African countries is infected. The United Nations AIDS program reports that more than 1.6 million people died of AIDS in Subsaharan Africa in 2007 alone. Geographer Peter Gould, in his book The 
Slow Plague (1993), called Africa a “continent in catastro-phe,” and the demographic statistics support his view-point. Life expectancy in Botswana and Swaziland has declined to 34 (and is projected to fall farther), and in Zimbabwe it is 36. In a continent already ravaged by other diseases, AIDS is the leading cause of death.
AIDS is reshaping the population structure of the 
countries hardest hit by the disease. Demographers look at the projected population pyramids for countries with high rates of infection and no longer see population pyramids—they see population chimneys. The shape of the projected population pyramid is altered to look more like a chimney than a pyramid, reﬂ  ecting the 
major impact AIDS plays on the younger population in the country and its future generations (Fig. 2.22). The United States Census Bureau projects that AIDS will cause higher rates of death among young women than young men. In countries with population chimneys, men will take younger and younger brides, thus increas-ing the rate of AIDS in younger females.
Geographers are engaging in ﬁ  eldwork to under-
stand the human toll of AIDS locally and within families. Geographer Elsbeth Robson studied the impact of AIDS in hard-hit Zimbabwe. She found that global processes such as the diffusion of AIDS and reductions in spending on health care (often mandated by structural adjustment programs) “shape young people’s home lives and structure their wider experiences.” In Subsaharan Africa, the num-ber of children orphaned when parents die from AIDS is growing rapidly (Fig. 2.23). In 2004, UNICEF reported that in just two years, between 2001 and 2003, the number of global AIDS orphans (children who have lost a parent to AIDS) rose from 11.5 million to 15 million. Robson found that in addition to the rising number of AIDS orphans, many young children, especially girls, are taken out of school to serve as caregivers for their relatives with AIDS (Figure 2.24). Robson found in her interviews with young caregivers that “more children are becoming young carers as households struggle to cope with income and labor losses through illness and mortality.”
There are few positives to report. The number of 
AIDS-related deaths is declining globally from a peak of 2.1 million in 2004 to 1.8 million in 2009. The greatest decline in AIDS-related deaths was in South Africa between 2004 and 2009, when AIDS-related deaths in Subsahran Africa diminished by 20 percent. The declin-ing death rate from AIDS is due to increased access to anti-retro viral drugs (ARVs) that slow the progression of the disease), better health-care access for people living with HIV , and a decline in the number of new infections since the late 1990s.
Uganda, once Africa’s worst afﬂ  icted country, has 
slowed the growth of AIDS through an intensive, govern-ment-sponsored campaign of propaganda and action—notably the distribution of condoms in even the remotest part of the country. Access to ARVs in Africa has increased markedly over the last decade. As a result of pressure from HIV/AIDS activists and governments, pharmaceutical companies have decreased prices of ARVs. T oday, over 5 million people in developing countries are being treated with ARVs. Nonetheless, the impact of AIDS will be felt in African economies and in African demographics for gener-ations to come. HIV/AIDS will constrain African economic development (see Chapter 10) and require world interven-tion to overcome.

HOW DO GOVERNMENTS AFFECT 
POPULATION CHANGE?
Over the past century, many of the world’s govern-
ments have instituted policies designed to inﬂ  uence the 
overall growth rate or ethnic ratios within the popula-
tion. Certain policies directly affect the birth rate via laws ranging from subsidized abortions to forced sterilization. Others inﬂ  uence family size through taxation or subven-
tion. These policies fall into three groups: expansive, eugenic, and restrictive.

Zedong led other communist societies in expansive

“The day was so beautiful and the children’s faces so expres-sive I could hardly believe I was visiting an AIDS hospice village set up for children. The Sparrow Rainbow Village on the edges of Johannesburg, South Africa, is the product of an internationally funded effort to provide children with HIV / AIDS the opportunity to live in a clean, safe environ-ment. Playing with the children brought home the fragility of human life and the extraordinary impacts of a modern plague that has spread relentlessly across signiﬁ  cant parts 
of Subsaharan Africa.”

Marich Village, KenyaThis drawing was done by a Pokot boy in a remote primary school in northwestern Kenya. He 
agreed to take part in my ﬁ  eldwork some years after I had started researching young carers in Subsaharan Africa. Since those early interviews in Zimbabwe I have been acutely aware of young carers’ invisibility—you can’t tell who is a young carer just by looking at them. Indeed, invisibility is a characteristic of many aspects of the social impacts of HIV / AIDS. This young person drew himself working in the ﬁ  elds and taking care of cattle. African young people help with farming and herding for many reasons, but for young caregivers, assisting their sick family members in this way is especially important.

73population policies, which encourage large families and raise the rate of natural increase. Ideological, anticapital-ist motives drove those policies, since abandoned in China. T oday, some countries are again pursuing expansive pop-ulation policies—because their populations are aging and declining. The aging population in Europe has encour-aged some countries to embark on policies to encourage (through tax incentives and other ﬁ  scal means) families to 
have more children.
Birth rates in Russia plummeted after the 1991 col-
lapse of the Soviet Union. The TFR in Russia in 1980 was 2.04, and now it is only 1.34. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin calls the demographic crisis Russia’s great-est current problem. The Russian government offers cash subsidies of $10,000 to women who give birth to a second or third child.
In response to concerns over Russia’s aging popula-
tion, the government of Ulyanovsk Province has held a National Day of Conception each September 12 since 2005. In 2007, government and businesses in Ulyanovsk Province offered the afternoon off for people to participate in the National Day of Conception. The government planned to award a free car to the proud parents of one of the children born 9 months later, on June 12—the Russian National Day. On June 12, 2008 in the Ulyanovsk Prov-ince, 87 children were born, about 4 times the average daily birth rate in the province. Russia experienced an increase in TFR in the ﬁ  rst half of 2008, but the ability to sustain a high TFR in the country will depend on many factors, including alleviating social problems, stabilizing incomes, and con-tinued government support.
In the past, some governments engaged in eugenic 
population policies, which were designed to favor one racial or cultural sector of the population over others. Nazi Germany was a drastic example of eugenics, but other countries also have pursued eugenic strategies, though in more subtle ways. Until the time of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, some observers accused the United States of pursuing social policies tinged with eugenics that worked against the interests of African Americans. Some argue that Japan’s nearly homogeneous culture is the result of deliberately eugenic social policies. Eugenic population policies can be practiced covertly through discriminatory taxation, biased allocation of resources, and other forms of racial favoritism.
T oday many of the world’s governments seek to 
reduce the rate of natural increase through various forms of restrictive population policies. These policies 
range from toleration of ofﬁ  cially unapproved means of 
birth control to outright prohibition of large families. c02Population.indd Page 73  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 73  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

today, China’s growth rate is 0.5 percent. The main goal 
of the one-child policy was achieved, but the policy also had several unintended consequences, including an increased abortion rate, an increase in female infanticide, and a high rate of orphaned girls (many of whom were adopted in the United States and Canada).
During the 1990s, under pressure to improve its 
human rights records and also with the realization that the population was quickly becoming gender (Fig. 2.26) and age imbalanced (Fig. 2.27), China relaxed its one-child policy. Several caveats allow families to have more China’s one-child policy, instituted after the end of the 
Maoist period in the 1970s, drastically reduced China’s growth rate from one of the world’s fastest to one of the world’s slowest (Fig. 2.25). Under the one-child policy, families that had more than one child were penalized ﬁ nancially, and educational opportunities and housing 
privileges were kept from families who broke the one-child mandate.
Population growth rates in China fell quickly under 
the one-child policy. In the 1970s, China’s growth rate was 3 percent; in the mid-1980s it was 1.2 percent; and,  Figure 2.25

With these changes, the National Bureau of Statistics of China now estimates that the population growth rate in China will climb again over the next 10 years.
Limitations
Population policies are not independent of circumstances that can inﬂ  uence growth and decline. In the 1980s, the government of Sweden adopted family-friendly policies designed to promote gender equality and boost fertility rates. The programs focused on alleviating much of the cost of having and raising children. In Sweden, couples who work and have small children receive cash payments, tax incentives, job leaves, and work ﬂ  exibility that last up to eight years after the birth of a child. The policies led to a mini-birth-rate-boom by the early 1990s.
When the Swedish economy slowed shortly thereaf-
ter, however, so did the birth rate. The children born in 1991 made up a class of 130,000 students in the Swedish education system. But the children born three years later, in 1994, made up a class of only 75,000 students. The govern-ment had to build new classrooms for the temporary popu-lation boom, but then faced excess capacity when the boom subsided. Sweden’s population policies have helped to pro-duce a natural rate of increase that is a little higher than that in many other European countries, but these policies can achieve only so much. With a TFR still well below 2, the Swedish government continues to think about new ways to support families and promote birth rates. One imaginative, but not evidently successful, approach was suggested by a spokeswoman for the Christian Democrat Party, who urged Swedish television to show racier programming at night in hopes of returning the population to a higher birth rate!c02Population.indd Page 75  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 75  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

the government began a nationwide family planning 
program in 1970. When fundamentalist Muslim lead-ers objected, the government used a combination of coercion and inducement to negate their inﬂ  uence. By 
2000, Indonesia’s family planning program had lowered the growth rate to 1.6 percent, and today it stands at 1.4 percent.
When studying government policies on population, one of the most important things to remember is unintended conse-quences. Choose one country in the world where women have little access to education and are disempowered. Consider the previous section of this chapter on age composition, and determine how restrictive population policies in this country would alter the population composition of the country.Contradictions
Some areas of the world with low population growth rates (Fig. 2.9) are in the very heart of the Roman Cath-olic world. Roman Catholic doctrine opposes birth control and abortion. Adherence to this doctrine appears to be stronger in areas remote from the Vatican (headquarters of the Catholic Church). For example, the Philippines, thousands of miles from the Vatican, is Asia’s only Roman Catholic country. The Church and the Philippine State agree on abortion, as the Philip-pine constitution prohibits abortion. However, on the issue of artiﬁ  cial contraceptives, which the still power-ful Church opposes, the Philippine government dis-agrees with the Catholic Church. Instead, the Philippine government supports birth control in order to stem population growth.
Among Islamic countries, the geographic pattern 
is the opposite. Saudi Arabia, home to Mecca—the hearth of Islam—has one of the world’s fastest popula-tion growth rates (2.7 percent). But in Indonesia, thou-sands of miles from Mecca and near the Philippines, 
Summary
In the late 1700s, Thomas Malthus sounded warning bells about the rapidly growing population in Great Britain. He feared a massive famine would soon “check” the grow-ing population, bringing widespread suffering. Although the famine in Great Britain did not take place as he predicted, the rapidly growing worldwide population made many more follow Malthus’s trajectory, issuing similar warnings about the population explosion over the last two centuries.
The growth rate of the world population has certainly slowed, but human suffer-
ing is not over yet. Dozens of countries still face high death rates and high birth rates. Even in countries where the death rate is low, slowed population growth is often a result of horrid sanitary and medical conditions that lead to high infant and child mortality, diseases such as AIDS that ravage the population and orphan the young, or famines that governments deny and that global organizations cannot ameliorate.
Population pyramids illustrate that as wealthier countries worry about support-
ing their aging populations, poorer countries have problems of their own. A high birth rate in a poor country does not necessarily mean overpopulation—some of the highest population densities in the world are found in wealthy countries. Even poor countries that have lowered their birth rates and their death rates are constantly negotiating what is morally acceptable to their people and their cultures.
Geography offers much to the study of population. Through geography we can 
see differences in population problems across space, how what happens at one scale affects what goes on at other scales, and how different cultures and countries approach population questions.c02Population.indd Page 76  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401c02Population.indd Page 76  9/12/11  7:49 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

78In 1994, I was on my way to 
Rosenstiel Marine Center on Virginia Key, off the coast of Miami, Florida. I noticed an overcrowded boat, with about 70 people on board. The Haitians were ﬂ  eeing 
the most impoverished country in the Western Hemisphere. Most of the would-be illegal immigrants were men with perhaps half a dozen women and as many chil-dren. They jumped overboard prematurely when the Coast Guard approached, and some undoubtedly lost their lives; others made it to the beach and ran forthe road.
The Haitians the Coast Guard caught were sent 
home to Haiti with other illegal Haitian immigrants. The chance of getting caught is high, the travel is treacherous, and hundreds die off the coast of Florida each year. The hope of a job in the United States and the lack of hope in their lives and homes in Haiti compel them to try. The immigrants know that if they make it to shore and can ﬁ  nd their way to the homes of friends and family, they have a chance to ﬁ nd employment and live under the radar of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service (Fig. 3.1).Migration3CHAPTER

 Risking Lives for Remittances  79
Across the world, hundreds of thousands of migrants have ﬂ  ed their home-
lands by boat, train, car, or foot for opportunities in North America, Australia, 
China, and Europe. Immigrants are sometimes welcomed and sometimes turned away. In the 1970s, the United States government welcomed Haitian immigrants because most were educated and able to afford travel to the United States. In 1980, 25,000 Haitian and 125,000 Cuban immigrants reached south Florida by boat. The U.S. government considered this massive ﬂ  ow of migrants a humanitarian cri-sis because of the repressiveness of the governments in Haiti and Cuba at the time. President Carter admitted the Haitians and Cubans into the United States using the discretionary parole authority of the attorney general. Later, Congress passed legislation that allowed the 150,000 asylum-seekers who arrived from Haiti and Cuba to gain legal permanent residence and later apply for citizenship.
In 1981, President Reagan established an interdiction program through an 
agreement with the Haitian government. Since 1981, the United States Coast Guard is authorized to board any Haitian vessel, even those on the high seas out-side of the territorial sea of the United States. Once on board, the Coast Guard can interrogate passengers to see if they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Haiti. If so, the United States sends the immigrant to a third country in Latin America to seek asylum; if not, the United States returns the migrant to Haiti by Coast Guard vessel.
Governments greatly impact migration ﬂ  ows by opening and closing doors to 
migrants. In some cases, the policy is not as simple as the door being open or shut. In addition, governments can choose to treat two groups with similar claims dif-ferently. The United States returns the vast majority of interdicted Haitians. In 2005, it interdicted 1850 Haitians and considered refugee status for 9 of them through “credible fear hearings” at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. The United States granted refugee status to only 1 of the 9. Only 54 miles separate Haiti from Cuba, but since the Clinton administration the U.S. government has had a “wet foot, dry foot” policy toward Cuban immigrants that does not apply to Haitians. If Cuban immigrants are intercepted at sea, they are deported (wet foot), but if Cuban immigrants make it to land (dry foot), they have the right to stay.
Why are immigrants willing to risk their lives on overcrowded boats or by 
crossing treacherous deserts across parts of the U.S.-Mexican border? Economics provides part of the answer, but it does not explain the whole story. The Pew Hispanic Center found in a 2005 survey that the vast majority of undocumented (illegal) migrants from Mexico “were gainfully employed” in Mexico before they left for the United States. Perception is an overwhelming factor in migration: as long as migrants perceive a better life abroad, they will continue to migrate.
Migration ﬂ  ows vary by region, hometown (rural versus urban), gender, socio-
economic class, age, race, and ethnicity. Geographers who study gender and migration realize that the dynamics of individual households in the sending coun-tries determine who migrates, when they migrate, and where they go.
In 2007, the number of undocumented migrants in the United States peaked at 
12 million. In 2010, the number fell to 11.2 million as a result of the economic reces-sion in the United States. The goal of most undocumented migrants is to work in the United States and send money home to family. Monies migrants send home to family are called remittances. Haitians living in the United States, Canada, and the 
Caribbean sent home over $1 billion in remittances in 2007, a ﬁ  gure equivalent to 30 percent of Haiti’s gross domestic product and far outpacing the value of Haitian exports. A 2006 census in Haiti estimated that half the country’s population is younger than 20 and less than half of the children of school age attend elementary c03Migration.indd Page 79  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 79  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
80 Chapter 3   Migration
school. In addition, among the working-age population, the unemployment rate in 
2006 was 33 percent according to the Haitian census. One of ﬁ  ve Haitian house-holds receives remittances from abroad.
The economies of many poorer countries in the Caribbean, Africa, Central 
and South America, and Eurasia depend in part on remittances sent to their citi-zens. In 2007, Mexican immigrants sent $23.98 billion in remittances home, up from $23.05 billion in 2006. Remittances to Mexico make up 19 percent of household incomes in urban areas and 27 percent of household incomes in rural areas of Mexico. Since 2007, the downturn in the American economy has gener-ated a new ﬂ  ow of money called reverse remittances: from Mexico to the United States. Unemployed, undocumented migrants in the United States asked families in Mexico for ﬁ  nancial support. Despite the economic downturn in the United States and reverse remittances, the Pew Center for Hispanic Research has not noted a return ﬂ  ow of migrants from the United States to Mexico. The likely reason is the high cost associated with migrating illegally from Mexico to the United States.
Not all immigrants are undocumented or illegal. Of the estimated 31.2 mil-
lion immigrants in the United States today, 20.4 million are legal immigrants (Fig. 3.2). C ountries recognize the need for immigrant labor, and many have policies 
allowing, indeed encouraging, legal immigrants to work under temporary visas to ﬁ ll a need. Thousands of people who work in the United States and Canada are

there on temporary visas to ﬁ  ll seasonal jobs in agriculture and forestry. In the 
United States, over 45,000 agricultural laborers legally enter the country each year under a program that allows unskilled laborers into the country, as long as no Americans want the jobs. Canada began to allow agricultural laborers into the country in 1966. In both Canada and the United States, the vast majority of legal agricultural laborers come from Mexico. Canadian companies travel to Mexico to recruit agricultural laborers from rural Mexico and laborers for the hotel industry from urban areas of Mexico.
Since September 11, 2001, many countries have cracked down on immigra-
tion, making legal and illegal immigration more difﬁ  cult. The United States has 
earmarked more money for building fences along its border with Mexico, hiring additional border patrols, and installing new technology to intercept would-be terrorists. The cultural landscape of the border region is changing. The govern-ment is erecting specially designed fences that are difﬁ  cult to climb, while at the 
same time ensuring the fences have spaces where people across the border can speak with each other. The new fences and security south of San Diego, California, are pushing illegal immigration farther east into the desert. The fences in the des-ert are marked by empty water bottles and memorials to Mexicans who have died trying to cross the border (Fig. 3.3).
Even though globalization has promoted a freer ﬂ  ow of goods across the 
world, and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) established freer trade among Mexico, the United States, and Canada, the free ﬂ  ow of people

is far from realized. In 1997, the U.S. government commissioned a barrier divid-
ing Nogales, Arizona, from Nogales, Mexico. The New Y ork Times reported that 
the architecture ﬁ  rm that designed the wall followed government require-
ments that it be aesthetically pleasing to “evoke the friendship” between the two countries while also making it “resistant to physical assault by means such as welding torches, chisels, hammers, ﬁ  rearms, climbing over or penetration with vehicles.” Illegal immigrants go to great lengths to ﬁ  nd their way into the 
United States; and similarly, the U.S. government goes to great lengths to deter illegal immigration.
In this chapter, we examine various types of migration and question why 
migrants choose to leave a particular place and why they go to another. We also examine the barriers governments erect to slow human migration, questioning why government policies shift and how policies affect migration ﬂ  ows. By employ-ing geographic concepts such as scale in our analysis of human migration, we seek to shed light on the nature and meaning of migration ﬂ  ows and to gain an appre-ciation for why people migrate, where they migrate, and how people, places, and landscapes change as a result of movement.
Key Questions  For Chapter 3
 1. What is migration?
 2. Why do people migrate?
 3. Where do people migrate?
 4. How do governments affect migration?
WHAT IS MIGRATION?
Movement is inherently geographical. Movement 
changes people, as well as the way they see themselves 
in the world. Movement changes places, including the places the people left and the places where they go. Human movement speeds the diffusion of ideas and innovations; it intensiﬁ  es spatial interaction and trans-forms regions; and it is often closely linked to environ-mental conditions.
The movement of humans takes several forms. 
Mobility ranges from local to global—from the daily to once in a lifetime. Mobility has increased markedly over the last century. With greater mobility, people broaden their perspectives and widen the horizons of others, thus encouraging further mobility. All movement involves leaving home. The three types of movement we discuss in this section vary based on time away from home. Cyclic 
movement involves shorter periods away from home; periodic movement involves longer periods away from home; and migration involves a degree of permanence the other two do not: with migration, the mover may never return “home.”Cyclic Movement
Cyclic movement involves journeys that begin at our home base and bring us back to it. The great majority of people have a daily routine that takes them through a reg-ular sequence of short moves within a local area. These moves create what geographers call activity spaces. The scale of activity space varies across societies. Y ou may go to classes every weekday and perhaps to a job as well, cre-ating a relatively conﬁ  ned and stable activity space, diver-siﬁ ed by shopping trips and social activities.
Commuting is also a cyclic movement. Commuting— 
the journey from home to work and home again—takes from minutes to hours and can involve several modes of transportation. The average North American com-muter travels a greater distance each day than the average Chinese villager does in a year. Advances in transporta-tion technology have expanded daily activity spaces. Cars and vast infrastructure enable people to commute over long distances. In Washington, D.C., commuters com-bine use of their cars, commuter trains, and the metro to travel upwards of 100 miles each way, each day, commut-ing not only from the surrounding suburbs, but also from c03Migration.indd Page 82  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 82  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 What Is Migration? 83
Delaware, West Virginia, and central Virginia. By airplane, 
commuters arrive at work in Washington, D.C. from New Y ork City. Others, such as members of Congress, com-mute from their home state, keeping houses there and apartments in the Washington, D.C. area.
Another form of cyclic movement is seasonal move-
ment. Every autumn, hundreds of thousands of travelers leave their homes in Canada and the northern parts of the United States and seek the winter sun in Florida and other “Sunbelt” States, returning in the spring. This seasonal transfer has huge economic consequences (and electoral signiﬁ  cance) in depopulated Northern towns and bur-
geoning tourist centers in the South.
This kind of seasonal movement is a luxury. Another 
type of cyclic movement, nomadism, is a matter of survival, culture, and tradition. Nomadism is dwindling across the world, but it can still be found in parts of Asia and Africa. Westerners often envision nomadism as an aimless wan-dering across steppe and desert by small groups of rootless roamers, people who claim no territory and do not behave territorially. In reality, nomads need to know their territory well in order to ﬁ  nd water, food, and shelter in their cyclic movements. Nomadic movement is purposeful and takes place along long-familiar routes repeated time and again. The nomads move their animals to visit water sources and pastures that have served their ancestors for centuries. Weather conditions may affect the timing of their route, but barring obstacles such as fenced international borders or the privatization of long-used open country, nomads engage in cyclic movement.
Periodic Movement
Periodic movement, like cyclic movement, involves return-ing home. Periodic movement involves a longer period of time away from the home base than cyclic movement. One common type of periodic movement is migrant labor, which involves millions of workers in the United States and tens of millions worldwide. The need for migrant labor in the farm ﬁ  elds of California, Florida, and other parts of the United States creates a large ﬂ  ow of cross-border movers, many of whom eventually become immigrants.
A specialized form of periodic movement is trans-
humance, which is a system of pastoral farming where ranchers move livestock according to the seasonal avail-ability of pastures. This is a periodic form of movement because, unlike classic nomadism, it involves a long period of residential relocation. In Switzerland, for example, farmers drive cattle up mountain slopes to high, fresh pastures during the summer, and farm families follow the herds, taking up residence in cottages that are abandoned during the cold winter. In the “Horn” of Northeast Africa, hundreds of thousands of people follow their livestock from highland to lowland and back in search of pastures renewed by seasonal rainfall.Periodic movement takes on other forms as well. If 
you leave home to attend a college far away, you are liv-ing away from home for four (or more) years. Although you may retain a home address in your place of origin, you now spend the great majority of your time in your new abode (traveling home only for breaks), and your mobility cannot be categorized as cyclic.
Military service is another form of periodic move-
ment. In a given year, as many as 10 million U.S. citizens, including military personnel and their families, are moved to new locations where they will spend tours of duty that can last several years.
Migration
When movement results in permanent relocation across signiﬁ  cant distances, it is classiﬁ  ed as migration. The pro-
cess of migration involves the long-term relocation of an individual, a household, or larger group to a new locale outside the community of origin.
International migration, movement across coun-
try borders, is also called transnational migration. When a migrant leaves the home country, he or she is classiﬁ  ed as an emigrant (one who migrates out) of the home country. When the same migrant enters a new country, he or she is classiﬁ  ed 
as an immigrant (one who migrates in) of the new country. Emigration subtracts from the total population of a country, and immigration adds to the total population of a country.
Countries also experience internal migration—
migration that occurs within a single country’s borders. Mapping internal migration routes reveals patterns of well-deﬁ  ned streams of migrants that change over time. 
Early in the twentieth century, a major migration stream took tens of thousands of African American families from the South of the United States to the industrializing cit-ies of the Northeast and Midwest (Fig. 3.4). The advent and diffusion of mechanical cotton pickers resulted in fewer employment opportunities in the South. Southern states, where slavery was legal before the Civil War, enacted Jim Crow laws separating blacks and whites in schools, hospi-tals, public spaces, public transportation, and even cem-eteries. It is estimated that 5 million to 8 million African Americans migrated from the South to industrialized Northern cities between 1900 and 1970. Newly emanci-pated African Americans ﬂ  ed the segregated South and 
headed north to the growing industrial cities of Chicago, Detroit, and Baltimore.
Internal migration varies according to the mobility 
of the population. In mobile societies, internal migra-tion over long distances is common. In the United States, the ﬂ  ow of internal migration is not as simple as rural to urban. Rather, in the past few decades, inter-nal migrants have ﬂ  ocked to the economically dynamic regions of the Sunbelt and Far West (Fig. 3.5).

 Why Do People Migrate? 85
migrants have escaped from large cities and rural areas 
to move to medium-sized cities for retirement or fam-ily-friendly lifestyles; and wealthy individuals who seek solace and space have moved into environmentally attractive rural areas, trying to keep the area “rural,” while pushing out farmers.
Mobility within the U.S. depends on the country’s 
economy. After decades of increasing levels of mobil-ity, the U.S. population had the “least mobile period in postwar American society” following the downturn in the economy between 2007 and 2008. The mortgage cri-sis and higher unemployment rates led to a pronounced reduction in the long-distance moves, according to a study by the Brookings Institute. Would-be movers “were unable to ﬁ  nd ﬁ  nancing to buy a new home, buy-
ers for their existing homes, or a new job in more desir-able areas.”
International migrants also migrate internally 
within their destination country. Since the 1940s, mil-lions of migrants from Latin America have migrated to the American Southwest and Florida. Most migrants have stayed in these same basic regions, perhaps migrating part of the year to work in agricultural ﬁ  elds. 
In 1986, the U.S. government passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), legislation that gave amnesty and permanent residence to 2.6 million migrants who had been living in the United States for a long period of time. The newly legal migrants under IRCA could move anywhere, and during the 1990s, many moved to the Great Plains and Midwest and also to the South (Fig. 3.5). Migrants found the South attractive for the same reasons other Americans did. The warm climate and available jobs in the Sunbelt attracted migrants during the 1990s.
In Peru, which is a less mobile society than the 
U.S. society, the pattern of internal migration is gener-ally from rural to urban. Migrants have left rural areas and moved to Lima, the capital. Global and national investment capital is concentrated in Lima. The capi-tal represents the major focus of economic opportunity for the rural population. Lima receives the vast major-ity of Peru’s migrants, regardless of age, gender, or marital status.
Choose one type of cyclic or periodic movement and then think of a speciﬁ  c example of the kind of movement you 
chose. Now, determine how this movement changes both the home and the destination as a result of this cyclic or period movement.WHY DO PEOPLE MIGRATE?
Migration can be the result of a voluntary action, 
a conscious decision to move from one place to the next. It can also be the result of an involuntary action, a forced movement chosen by one group of people for another group of people. Forced migration involves the imposition of authority or power, producing invol-untary migration movements that cannot be understood based on theories of choice. Voluntary migration  
occurs after a migrant weighs options and choices, even if desperately or not so rationally, and can be analyzed and understood as a series of options or choices that result in movement.
The distinction between forced and volun-
tary migration is not always clear-cut. The enormous European migration to the United States during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is often cited as a prime example of voluntary migration. However, some European migration can be construed as forced. The British treatment of the Irish during their colonial rule over Ireland can be seen as political persecution, which is a cause for forced migration. During British colonial-ism in Ireland, the British took control of nearly all of the Irish Catholic lands and discouraged the operation of the Catholic Church in Ireland. Until 1829, the British enforced penal laws preventing Irish Catholics from buying land, voting, or carrying weapons. The mass exo-dus of migrants from Ireland to North America in the mid-1800s can be seen as forced, both because of the British treatment of the Irish and because of the potato famine, but it can also be seen as voluntary in that the Irish chose to go to North America.
At the scale of an individual region or country, we 
can question whether a decision to migrate is forced or voluntary. At the scale of the household, the decision to migrate is all the more complex. For certain members of a migrating household, the move may be under duress, and for others, the move may be a preferred choice. The neutral title “migrant” veils the complexities of decision making at the household scale. Geographic studies of gender in migration demonstrate that at the household scale, power relationships, divisions of labor, and gender identities all factor into migration flows. At the household scale, decisions are made, in geographer Victoria Lawson’s terms, in a “cooperative conflict bargaining process.” Who has a say in this pro-cess and how much of a say each individual has depend on gendered power relationships and responsibilities in the household.
Studies of gender and migration ﬁ  nd that, in 
many regions, men are more mobile than women and men migrate farther than women. Generally, men have more choices of employment than women, and women c03Migration.indd Page 85  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 85  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

earn less than men in the jobs they ﬁ  nd at the destina-
tion. One study of migration in Mexican households found that strongly patriarchal households shield young women from migration, sending young men out to work. Mexican households without a strong patriarchy send young, unmarried women to the city or another country to gain employment.
Thus, geographers cannot easily describe migration 
ﬂ ows in terms of men and women or forced and voluntary. 
Ultimately, the decision or directive to migrate happens to an individual migrant within a household, place, country, region, and world, each of which has its own dynamics. The key difference between voluntary and forced migra-tion, however, is that voluntary migrants have an option—at the very least, where to go or what to do once there; forced migrants do not.
Forced Migration
The largest and most devastating forced migration in the history of humanity was the Atlantic slave trade, which carried tens of millions of Africans from their homes to South America, the Caribbean, and North America, with huge loss of life. The number of Africans sold into slavery will never be known, but estimates range from 12 million to 30 million. Figure 3.6 shows an approximation of the numbers involved, as well as the destinations of the trans-Atlantic African deportees.
Because slavery plays a major role in U.S. history, 
many students in the United States assume the vast major-ity of African slaves were forced across the Atlantic and into the southeastern United States. However, as the map shows, a considerable majority of Africans were forced across the Atlantic to the Caribbean region, to coastal Central America, and to Brazil.
The Atlantic slave trade began early in the sixteenth 
century, when Spain and Portugal brought Africans to the Caribbean. In the early decades of the seventeenth century, African slaves arrived in small numbers on plantations in coastal eastern North America. Wealth promised through plantation agriculture from the southeastern United States to Brazil created a demand for slaves by plantation owners, who paid European shippers for slaves, who in turn paid African raiders for slaves.

 Why Do People Migrate? 87
Of all crops produced on plantations in the Americas 
and Caribbean during the 1700s, sugar was the most 
important economically. Figure 3.6 reﬂ  ects the scram-
ble for sugar islands in the Caribbean, as the map names Spanish, British, Danish, French, and Dutch colonies in the Caribbean as destinations for slaves. Add the coffee, fruit, and sugar plantations in Brazil and the cotton plan-tations of the southeastern United States, and the destina-tions of slaves on the map make sense.
The terror and destruction of slave raiding afﬂ  icted 
large areas of Africa. Europeans and African raiders exploited much of West Africa from Liberia to Nigeria and inland to the margins of the Sahara. So many Africans were taken from the area that is now Benin in West Africa to Bahia in Brazil that signiﬁ  cant elements of the local cul-ture remained intact in the transition. T oday Bahia and Benin have strong ties, and cultural exchanges are growing stronger. The entire Equatorial African coastal region fell victim to the slave trade as well, when Portuguese slave trad-ers raided freely in the Portuguese domains of Angola and Mozambique. Arab slave raiders were active in East Africa and the Horn of Africa (present-day Somalia), penetrating Equatorial Africa and often cooperating with Europeans. Zanzibar, off the coast of mainland T anzania, long was a major slave market.
We know proportionately where slaves ended up, 
but we can never gauge the full impact of this horriﬁ  c 
period. In A Colonizer’s Model of the World, geographer James Blaut discussed the sheer loss to African civiliza-tions that occurred when Europeans and African raiders enslaved signiﬁ  cant populations. The Atlantic slave trade 
also changed the Caribbean, where on many islands the vast majority of people are of African-Caribbean descent, and few, if any, indigenous peoples remain. In combina-tion, the slave trade inﬂ  icted incalculable damage on 
African societies and communities, and changed the cul-tural and ethnic geography of Brazil, Central America, and the United States.
Although no forced migration in human history 
compares in magnitude to the Atlantic slave trade, other forced migrations have changed the world’s demographic map. For 50 years beginning in 1788, Great Britain shipped tens of thousands of convicts from Britain to Australia, where they had a lasting impact on the conti-nent’s population geography. In the 1800s, the U.S. gov-ernment took lands from thousands of Native Americans and forcibly moved tribes to other areas of the country, many far from their traditional homelands. In the Soviet Union during Stalin’s ruthless rule between the late 1920s and 1953, the government forcibly moved millions of non-Russians from their homes to remote parts of Central Asia and Siberia for political reasons. During the 1930s in Germany, the Nazis were responsible for a signiﬁ  cant 
forced migration of Jews from portions of western Europe that fell under their control.
Forced migration still happens today. It continues to 
occur, for example, in the form of countermigration, in which governments detain migrants who enter or attempt to enter their countries illegally and return the migrants to their home countries (Fig. 3.7). In 1957, Papa Doc

Duvalier controlled Haiti, pilfering wealth for his family 
and ruling with a private militia. Papa Doc died in 1971, and his son Jean-Claude Duvalier, called Baby Doc, took control. He continued to rule and steal from Haiti until his exile in 1986. Under these brutal dictators and in the turmoil since, thousands of Haitians have sought refuge in the United States.
Since 1981, the United States has interdicted, 
detained, and returned illegal Haitian migrants. The spike in 1991–1992 of over 37,000 Haitians interdicted followed a 1991 military coup d’etat, which overthrew democrati-cally elected President Aristide with military rule. Haiti remained unstable, and the second spike in the graph in 1994 marks the turmoil leading up to the reinstatement of Aristide as president in 1994, under U.S. pressure. Governance of the country ﬂ  ipped back to military rule in 2004. Before the January 2010 earthquake, Haiti was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Since the death of 250,000 people in the devastating earthquake, the situation in Haiti has only worsened. In response, the Department of Homeland Security granted all Haitian nationals who were in the United States as of January 12, 2010 an 18-month temporary protected status, which allowed them to remain in the United States while Haiti tries to recover from the tragedy of the earthquake and cope with a cholera outbreak.
Across the world from Haiti, for more than 30 years, 
people from Afghanistan have left the country in search of safety ﬁ  rst from civil war, then the T aliban, and cur-rently the instability of the Afghan War. Approximately 10 million Afghans have been refugees since 1979, ﬂ  eeing 
mainly to Pakistan and Iran. Policies toward Afghan refu-gees have shifted over time. The international commu-nity sends substantial aid to Pakistan to help the Pakistani government serve the Afghan refugee population within their borders.
After the T aliban took control of Afghanistan in 
1994, support for Pakistan waned and the Pakistan gov-ernment forced the repatriation of thousands of Afghans. Since September 11, 2001, the international commu-nity, led by the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR), has helped Pakistan and Iran repa-triate nearly 5 million refugees to Afghanistan. Currently, 3 million Afghans are registered refugees in Iran and Pakistan, and approximately 1 million more Afghans in Pakistan are not registered as refugees. The repatriation of Afghans continues and is complicated by the current war and the fact that over half the Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran were born there . . . not in Afghanistan.
Push and Pull Factors in Voluntary Migration
Why do people choose to migrate? Researchers have been intrigued by this question for more than a century. Studies of voluntary migration ﬂ  ows indicate that the intensity 
of a migration ﬂ  ow varies with such factors as similarities between the source and the destination, the effectiveness of the ﬂ  ow of information from the destination back to the source, and the physical distance between the source and the destination.
Over a century ago, British demographer Ernst 
Ravenstein sought an answer to the question of why people voluntarily migrate. He studied internal migra-tion in England, and on the basis of his data he proposed several laws of migration, many of which are still rel-
evant today including:
 1. Every migration ﬂ  ow generates a return or countermi-
gration.
 2. The majority of migrants move a short distance.
 3. Migrants who move longer distances tend to choose 
big-city destinations.
 4. Urban residents are less migratory than inhabitants of 
rural areas.
 5. Families are less likely to make international moves 
than young adults.
Ravenstein also posited an inverse relationship between 
the volume of migration and the distance between source and destination; that is, the number of migrants to a destination declines as the distance they must travel increases. Ravenstein’s idea is an early observation of the gravity model, which predicts interaction between 
places on the basis of their population size and distance between them. The gravity model assumes that spatial interaction (such as migration) is directly related to the populations and inversely related to the distance between them—an assumption that had more meaning in an age before airplane travel and the Internet. In mathematical terms, the equation for the gravity model is the multi-plication of the two populations divided by the distance between them.
Although the gravity model gives us a guide to 
expected migration, migration is not as simple as a math-ematical equation. When an individual, family, or group of people makes a voluntary decision to migrate, push and pull factors come into play. Push factors are the conditions and perceptions that help the migrant decide to leave a place. Pull factors are the circumstances that effectively attract the migrant to certain locales from other places, the decision of where to go. A migrant’s deci-sion to emigrate from the home country and migrate to a new country results from a combination of push and pull factors, and these factors play out differently depending on the circumstance and scale of the migration. Because a migrant is likely to be more familiar with his or her place of residence (source) than with the locale to which he or she is moving (destination), a migrant will likely perceive c03Migration.indd Page 88  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 88  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 Why Do People Migrate? 89
push factors more accurately than pull factors. Push fac-
tors include individual considerations such as work or retirement conditions, cost of living, personal safety and security, and, for many, environmental catastrophes or even issues like weather and climate. Pull factors tend to be vaguer and may depend solely on perceptions con-strued from things heard and read rather than on experi-ences in the destination place. Often, migrants move on the basis of excessively positive images and expectations regarding their destinations.
When considering pull factors, the principle of 
distance decay comes into play (Fig. 3.8). Prospective migrants are likely to have more complete perceptions of nearer places than of farther ones, which conﬁ  rms the 
notion that the intensity of human activity, process, or function declines as distance from its source increases. Since interaction with faraway places generally decreases as distance increases, prospective migrants are likely to feel much less certain about distant destina-tions than about nearer ones. This leads many migrants to move to a locale closer to home than they originally contemplated.
Migration streams may appear on maps as long, 
unbroken routes, but in fact they often consist of a series of stages, a phenomenon known as step migration. A peasant family in rural Brazil, for example, is likely to move ﬁ  rst to a village, then to a nearby town, later to a city, and ﬁ  nally to a metropolis such as São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro. At each stage a new set of pull factors comes into play.Not all migrants from one place follow the same 
steps. When 1000 people leave a village and migrate to a town in a given year, most, if not all, of them may dream of making it to, and in, the “big city.” But only about 500 may actually move from town to city, and of these, only 200 eventually reach the metropolis that impelled them to move in the ﬁ  rst place. Along the way the majority are captured by intervening opportunity. This happened during the Great Migration when African Americans by the tens of thousands migrated northward after World War I to seek work in growing cities like Chicago and Cleveland. Many found employment in St. Louis and Cincinnati; that is, they encountered intervening oppor-tunities along their northbound routes.
Along any route of migration, whether direct, in 
steps, or interrupted by intervening opportunity, a volun-tary migrant weighs push and pull factors.
Types of Push and Pull Factors
What speciﬁ  c factors impel people to pull up stakes and 
leave the familiar for the uncertain? What speciﬁ  c factors 
help migrants choose a destination? Research has shown that typically a combination of factors, not just one, leads to deciding it is time to move and deciding where to go. Any single factor can be either a push for the migrant to leave the home country or a pull to the new country, and which factor matters most depends on the migrant and the circumstances surrounding the decision to migrate.
Legal Status
Migrants can arrive in a country with (legally) or without (illegally) the consent of the host country. Each country around the world determines who is allowed to migrate to their country and under what circumstances. If you apply for and receive a work visa from another country, you are legally allowed to live in the country and work there for the time allotted on the visa, which is usually a period of months or years. Having a visa makes you a legal migrant because you have your documents, your visa, to show your legal right to be in the place. If you do not have a visa, you are an illegal, or undocumented, migrant in the country. Undocumented or illegal migrants choose quite different options for ﬁ  nding their way into the country than legal 
migrants do, simply because they do not want to be caught for fear of deportation, being sent back home.
Economic Conditions
Poverty has driven countless millions from their home-lands and continues to do so. Perceived opportunities in destinations such as western Europe and North America impel numerous migrants, both legal and illegal, to cross the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, and the Rio Grande  Figure 3.8

in search of a better life. Lower economic positions of 
migrants in their host countries can lead to exploitation by employers and others. The United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families recognizes the precari-ous position of migrant workers: they need to work and do not want to be deported. The convention establishes stan-dards of treatment for migrant workers. Fifty-eight states, most of which are countries that send more migrants than they receive, have ratiﬁ  ed or signed the convention. Even though no member of the European Union and only 4 of 19 states in the G-20 states have signed it (the 20 largest economies in the world including the European Union, which primarily receive migrants), the convention’s state-ments on human trafﬁ  cking and the right of migrant 
workers to equal wages are inﬂ  uencing the migration pol-
icies of some states.
Power Relationships
Gender, ethnicity, race, and money are all factors in the decision to migrate. Power relationships already embed-ded in society enable the ﬂ  ow of migrants around the 
world. Employers who hire migrant workers often have perceptions of what kinds of migrants would work best for them.
Women in the Middle East hire Southeast Asian 
women to work as domestic servants, housekeepers, and nannies. Geographer Paul Boyle points out that by hir-ing women from abroad, the female head of household establishes a relationship in which the employee’s “ethnic-ity and citizenship status differentiates them from their female employer and this inﬂ  uences the power relation-
ships that underpin the working arrangements.” In their study of placement agencies that help people hire domes-tic workers, Stiell and England found that in T oronto, Canada, placement agencies portrayed certain ethnicities according to scripted stereotypes. For instance, workers from the Caribbean went from being portrayed as “docile, jolly and good with children” to being depicted as “difﬁ  -
cult, aggressive and selﬁ  sh.” Soon after, employers sought 
to hire women from the Philippines whom, at the time, placement agencies portrayed as “‘naturally’ docile, sub-servient, hard-working, good natured, domesticated, and willing to endure long hours of housework and child-care with little complaint.”
Race is also a factor in the hiring of migrant work-
ers. For example, carpet companies in Dalton, Georgia, the carpet capital of the world, began hiring Mexican workers after the 1986 passage of IRCA because they saw them as hard workers who were loyal to one com-pany. In the same time frame, North and South Carolina also experienced surges in the Mexican migrant popula-tion. Geographer Jamie Winders cites the work of sev-eral researchers in the South whose research “raises 
the issue of displacement of black workers by Mexican migration—a topic hinted at by many studies but addressed by few.” Issues of race and migrant status in hiring can spill over into neighborhoods as they have recently in Raleigh, North Carolina. In the last 10 years conﬂ icts have arisen over affordable housing between 
the African Americans who lived in the neighborhoods and Mexican migrants who moved into the neighbor-hoods for the same affordable housing.
Geographer Paul Boyle also cites power relation-
ships based on money in the growing migration industry, whereby migration ﬂ  ows are contractually arranged in 
order to ﬁ  ll labor needs for particular economic sectors 
throughout the world. Contractors give migrants advances on their income, help them migrate to the new country or region within a country, and then take migrants’ wages in order to pay for advances and other needs the contractor supplies to the migrants.
Political Circumstances
Throughout history oppressive regimes have engendered migration streams. Desperate migrants ﬂ  ed Vietnam by 
the hundreds of thousands after the communists took control of the country in 1975. In 1972 Uganda’s dictator, Idi Amin, expelled 50,000 Asians and Ugandans of Asian descent from his country. The Cuban communist dicta-torship expelled more than 125,000 Cubans in 1980 in the “Mariel Boatlift.” Politically driven migration ﬂ  ows are 
marked by both escape and expulsion.
Armed Conﬂ  ict and Civil War
The dreadful conﬂ  ict that engulfed the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s drove as many as 3 million people from their homes, mostly into western Europe. Many people became permanent emigrants, unable to return home. During the mid-1990s, a civil war engulfed Rwanda in Equatorial Africa, a conﬂ  ict that pitted militant Hutu against the minority T utsi and “moderate” Hutu. The car-nage claimed an estimated 800,000 to 1 million lives and produced huge migration ﬂ  ows into neighboring Zaïre (now Congo) and T anzania. More than 2 million Rwandans ﬂ ed their homeland.
Environmental Conditions
A major example of migration induced by environmental conditions is the movement of hundreds of thousands of Irish citizens from Ireland to the New World during the c03Migration.indd Page 90  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 90  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

1840s. The potato blight destroyed the potato crop, cre-
ating famine. Under colonial control of Great Britain at the time, Irish farmers had no recourse to British political policies that only served to worsen the loss of the potato crop. For example, in 1847, the British enacted the Poor Laws in Ireland, which placed the burden of providing for the Irish poor (who had lost their potato crops) on landlords and small farmers. Starving workers and small farmers could not pay the taxes the landlords demanded, and the Poor Laws only served to exacerbate the famine. Understanding Great Britain’s colonial role in Ireland before, during, and after the potato famine reminds us that environmental conditions rarely operate in a social vacuum. The potato famine and the migration ﬂ  ow of 
Irish to their chief destinations, the United States and Canada, altered the demographics of both Ireland (the source) and the United States and Canada.
Environmental crises including earthquakes, hurri-
canes, and volcanic eruptions also stimulate migrations. For example, a surge of migration follows major earth-quakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters. Because many migrants return, the net outﬂ  ow gener-
ated by such momentary crises is usually small, but not always. Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses, the popu-lation of New Orleans fell by 11 percent as a result of the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the economic recession since. The proportion of children in New Orleans’ population also fell, from 27 percent in 2000 to 23 percent in 2007. Mapping where children live in New Orleans reﬂ  ects another trend in post-Katrina New Orleans: families with children in the New Orleans region are moving out of the city center and close-in sub-urbs and into the farther suburbs and exurbs, including Belle Chasse (Fig. 3.9).
Some environmental crises, such as volcanic erup-
tions, bring long-term environmental changes to the landscape, making return migration difﬁ  cult, if not impos-sible. For example, the Caribbean island of Montserrat had a small population of about 10,000 prior to a volcanic eruption that began in 1995. The volcano has been active since then, prompting a migration ﬂ  ow. Geographer Jason 
Dittmer studied how drastically the physical and cultural landscapes of Montserrat have changed since the onset of volcanic activity. Dittmer explains that roughly half the island has been proclaimed an Exclusion Zone, a region that includes the capital city of Plymouth (Fig. 3.10). People are not allowed in this zone of active volcanic activ-ity. The people who remained must now live in the north-ern part of the island where the soils are thin, the land is rocky, and making a living is difﬁ  cult. Over 7000 people 
migrated off the island, and the remaining 3000 migrated to the northern coast of the island, where the effects of the volcano are less felt.
Culture and Traditions
People who fear that their culture and traditions will not survive a major political transition, and who are able to migrate to places they perceive as safer, will often do so. When the British partitioned South Asia into a mainly Hindu India and an almost exclusively Muslim Pakistan, millions of Muslim residents of India migrated across the border to the new Islamic state, and millions  Why Do People Migrate? 91c03Migration.indd Page 91  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 91  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
Guest Field Note
Plymouth, Montserrat
 Figure 3.10This photo shows the damage caused by the 1995 eruption of the Sourfriere Hills volcano on the 
Caribbean Island of Montserrat. In the foreground you can see the gray volcanic ash clogging the roadbed, and in the background the abandoned capital city of Plymouth. Many buildings cannot even be entered because the ash has buried their ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oors or caved in their ceilings. This scene 
illustrated for me the complexities of migration in the face of natural disasters. Many Montser-ratians ﬂ  ed to the United States when Plymouth was destroyed and were given “temporary pro-
tected” immigration status. The U.S. government told Montserratian refugees to leave in 2005—not because the volcanic crisis was over or because the housing crisis caused by the volcano was solved. Rather, the U.S. government expected the volcanic crisis to last at least 10 more years; so, the Monsterratians no longer qualiﬁ  ed as “temporary” refugees.

of Hindus migrated from Pakistan to secular India—an estimated 8 million in all. In the 1990s after decades of Soviet obstruction, more than 2 million Jews left the former Soviet Union for Israel and other destinations. The decline in minority white power and uncertain political conditions in South Africa during the mid-1990s impelled many whites to emigrate to Australia, Europe, and North America. Technological Advances
For some migrants, emigration is no longer the dif-ﬁ cult and hazardous journey it used to be. Although 
most migrants, especially refugees, still move by foot, some use modern forms of transportation and commu-nication, the availability of which can itself encourage migration.

 Where Do People Migrate? 93
Gone is the time when would-be emigrants waited 
months, even years, for information about distant 
places. News today travels faster than ever, including news of job opportunities and ways to reach desired destinations. T elevision, radio, cellular phone, and tele-phone stimulate millions of people to migrate by relay-ing information about relatives, opportunities, and already established communities in destination lands. Advances in communication technology strengthen the role of kinship links as push or pull factors. When deciding where to go, a migrant is often pulled to places where family and friends have already found suc-cess. Thus, T urks quickly heard about Germany’s need for migrant labor after World War II. Algerians knew where the most favorable destinations were in France in the same time period.
When a migrant chooses a destination and writes, 
calls, or communicates through others to tell family and friends at home about the new place, the migrant helps create a positive perception of the destination for family and friends, and may promise help with migra-tion by providing housing and assistance obtaining a job. Geographers call flows along and through kinship links chain migration. When a migrant reassures fam-
ily and friends that a new community has been formed, a place where they can feel home, this encourages fur-ther migration along the same chain. Chains of migra-tion built upon each other create immigration waves  
or swells in migration from one origin to the same  destination.
Think about a migration ﬂ  ow within your family, whether 
internal, international, voluntary, or forced. The ﬂ  ow can 
be one you experienced or one you only heard about through family. List the push and pull factors. Then, write a letter in the ﬁ  rst person (if you were not involved, pretend you were your grandmother or whomever) to another family member at “home” describing how you came to migrate to the destination.
WHERE DO PEOPLE MIGRATE?
It is tempting to reduce the ﬂ  ow of migration to 
simple economics: a chance for a job in another place trumps the lack of a job at home. However, migration is much more complicated than that. Migration depends on various push and pull factors, ranging from persecution in civil war to environmental disaster, from disempower-ment in the home to discrimination in the country, and each migration ﬂ  ow is helped or hampered by existing 
networks and governmental actions.
In this section of the chapter, we examine where 
people migrate, that is, the destinations they choose. At the global, regional, and national scales, we can see sev-eral major migration ﬂ  ows over the past 500 years, ﬂ  ows 
where hundreds of thousands of people migrated along the same general path. We focus on the destinations in these major migration ﬂ  ows. As we discuss migration 
ﬂ ows at the global, regional, and national scales in this 
chapter, remember that these ﬂ  ows give only an overview of migration. At the local and household scales, each indi-vidual or family migration required life-altering decisions, and those decisions fostered global change.
Global Migration Flows
Before 1500, long-distance, global-scale migration occurred haphazardly, typically in pursuit of spices, fame, or exploration. T o put exploration in perspective, note that a complete map of the world’s continents did not exist until the early 1800s. European explorers, who included surveyors and cartographers, played a major role in ﬁ  nally 
mapping the world. On the heels of exploration came European colonization, a physical process whereby the 
colonizer takes over another place, putting its own gov-ernment in charge and either moving its own people into the place or bringing in indentured outsiders to gain con-trol of the people and the land. First, Europeans colonized the Americas and the coasts of Africa and parts of Asia from the 1500s to the 1800s. Then, Europeans colonized interior Africa and Asia starting in the late 1800s and into the 1900s.
The past ﬁ  ve centuries have witnessed human 
migration on an unprecedented scale, much of it gener-ated by European colonization. The major ﬂ  ows of global 
migration from 1500 on are shown in Figure 3.11. The migration ﬂ  ows include movements from Europe to North America (1); from Southern Europe to South and Central America (2); from Britain and Ireland to Africa and Australia (3); from Africa to the Americas during the period of slavery (4); and from India to eastern Africa, Southeast Asia, and Caribbean America (5).
Among the greatest human migrations in recent 
centuries was the ﬂ  ow from Europe to the Americas. 
Emigration from Europe (1 and 2 in Fig. 3.11) began slowly. Before the 1830s, perhaps 2.75 million Europeans left to settle overseas. The British went to North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa (3). From Spain and Portugal, many hundreds of thousands of Europeans emigrated to Middle and South America.

colonial settlements grew, even in coastal areas of present-
day Angola, Kenya, and Indonesia. The rate of European emigration increased sharply between 1835 and 1935, with perhaps as many as 75 million departing for colo-nies in Africa and Asia, and for economic opportunities in the Americas. Although millions of Europeans even-tually returned to their homelands, the net outﬂ  ow from 
Europe was enormous, as evidenced by the sheer number of Canadians and Americans who identify themselves as being of European ancestry.
As already discussed, the Americas were the des-
tination of another mass of immigrants: African slaves. African slaves were among the very ﬁ  rst non-American Indian settlers in this country (4). Although this migra-tion is mapped as just one of the eight major migration streams, its immense and lasting impact on both sides of the Atlantic sets it apart from all the others.
Even as the Atlantic slave trade was in progress, 
European colonialism generated major migrations in other places in the world. The British, who took control over South Asia, transported tens of thousands of “indentured” workers from present-day India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to East and South Africa (see symbol (5) on Fig. 3.11). T oday, people of South Asian ancestry are substantial minorities in South Africa, Kenya, and T anzania. South Asian immigrants in eastern and southern Africa became c03Migration.indd Page 94  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 94  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

business leaders in the region. T oday, South Asians con-
trol a disproportionate share of commerce and hold much of the wealth in the region, which has become a major source of ethnic friction.
Long before the British arrived in India, Hindu 
inﬂ uences radiated into Southeast Asia, reaching the 
Indonesian islands of Java and Bali. Later, the British renewed the Indian migration stream, bringing South Asians to the Malay Peninsula (including Singapore) and to their Paciﬁ  c holdings including Fiji (Fig. 3.11).
The British were also instrumental in relocating 
Asians, mainly from India, to such Caribbean countries as T rinidad and T obago and Guyana, the trans-Paciﬁ  c stream labeled 5 in Fig. 3.11. The Dutch were pivotal in the migration of many Javanese from what is today Indonesia to the former Dutch dependency of Suriname along the same route.
Regional Migration Flows
The stories of huge ﬂ  ows of migrants mapped in Figure 3.11 were unprecedented and meet few rivals in terms of sheer numbers today. Although some global migra-tion ﬂ  ows already discussed were forced and some were voluntary, each occurred at a global scale and across 5

continents. Migration also occurs at a regional scale  
with migrants going to a neighboring country to take 
advantage of short-term economic opportunities, to reconnect with their cultural group across borders, or to ﬂ  ee political conﬂ  ict or war.
Economic Opportunities
T o understand migration ﬂ  ows from one poor country to another, it is not sufﬁ  cient to analyze the ﬂ  ow at the global scale. We need to understand where the region ﬁ  ts into 
the global interaction picture and to see how different locations within the region ﬁ  t into interaction patterns at both the global and regional scales. Cities in the devel-oping world are typically where most foreign investment goes, where the vast majority of paying jobs are located, and where infrastructure is concentrated. These port cities become islands of economic development within larger undeveloped regions. Geographers call these cities islands of development (Fig. 3.12).
Within the region of West Africa, the oil-pro-
ducing areas of Nigeria are islands of development. In the mid-1970s, poorer people in T ogo, Benin, Ghana, and the northern regions of Nigeria, perceiving that economic life was better in coastal Nigeria, were lured to the coast for short-term jobs while the oil economy was good. The migrants, usually young men, worked as much as they could and sent almost all of the money they earned home as remittances to support their fami-lies. They worked until the oil economy took a fall in the early 1980s, and at that point, the Nigerian government decided the foreign workers were no longer needed. The Nigerian government forcibly pushed out 2 million foreign workers.
Global economic processes and the lasting effects of 
European colonialism certainly played a role in this West African migration ﬂ  ow. If we study such a ﬂ  ow only at 
the global scale, we see migrants moving from one poor country to another poor country. But if we use both the global and regional scales to study this ﬂ  ow, we under-stand regional economic inﬂ  uences and the pull of islands 
of development in Nigeria.
European colonialism also had an impact on 
regional migration ﬂ  ows in Southeast Asia. Europe’s colonial occupation of Southeast Asia presented eco-nomic opportunities for the Chinese. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, millions of Chinese laborers ﬂ ed famine and political strife in southern China to

work as contract laborers in Southeast Asia (Fig. 3.13). 
Many remained, and today their descendants consti-tute a Chinese minority in Southeast Asian countries that accounts for substantial portions of the popula-tion: 14 percent in Thailand, 32 percent in Malaysia, and 76 percent in Singapore. The Chinese minority in Indonesia accounts for only about 3 percent of the total population, but Indonesia has more than 200 mil-lion people, so its Chinese minority is one of Southeast Asia’s largest clusters. Over time, the Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia became leaders in trade, commerce, and ﬁ  nance in Southeast Asia, taking an economic posi-tion much like that of Southern Asians in eastern and southern Africa.
Reconnection of Cultural Groups
Regional migration flows also center on reconnecting cultural groups across borders. A migration stream with enormous consequences is the flow of Jewish immigrants to Israel. At the turn of the twentieth cen-tury, fewer than 50,000 Jewish residents lived in what was then Palestine. From 1919 to 1948, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland held control over Palestine, and Britain encouraged Jews, whose ancestors had fled more than a thousand years earlier from the Middle East to Europe, to return to the region. By 1948, as many as 750,000 Jews resided in Palestine, when the United Nations intervened to partition the area and establish the independent state of Israel. The original boundaries of the new state are shown in orange in Figure 3.14. Following the division of the land between the newly created Israeli state and the state of Palestine, another migration stream began when 600,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were pushed out of Israeli territories. Palestinians sought refuge in neighboring Jordan, Egypt, Syria, and beyond.
Through a series of wars, Israel expanded its area 
of territorial control (Fig. 3.14) and actively built settle-ments for new Jewish immigrants in Palestinian territories  Where Do People Migrate? 97c03Migration.indd Page 97  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 97  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
98 Chapter 3   Migration
Before the East German government built the Berlin 
Wall and the Iron Curtain divided Western and Eastern Europe, several million Germans ﬂ  ed Soviet-controlled 
East Germany into what was then West Germany. And millions of migrants left Europe altogether to go to the United States (1.8 million), Canada (1.1 million), Australia (1 million), Israel (750,000), Argentina (750,000), Brazil (500,000), Venezuela (500,000), and other countries. As many as 8 million Europeans emigrated from Europe in the postwar stream.
Even before Cuba became a communist state, thou-
sands of Cuban citizens applied annually for residency in the United States. Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba in 1959. During the 1960s, while the Cuban government was establishing the Communist Party of Cuba and for-malizing a communist state, the number of Cuban immi-grants in the United States swelled. The U.S. government formalized the ﬂ  ow as the Cuban Airlift, an authorized 
movement of persons desiring to escape from a commu-nist government. The vast majority of Cuban immigrants arrived and remained in the greater Miami area. In south-ern Florida Cubans developed a core of Hispanic culture, and in 1973, Dade County, Florida declared itself bicul-tural and bilingual.
In 1980 another massive, organized exodus of Cubans 
occurred, which brought more than 125,000 Cubans to U.S. shores. Special legislation allowed the large group to become naturalized citizens over time. The Cuban inﬂ  ux 
persisted throughout the 1980s, and then in 1994, over 30,000 Cubans ﬂ  ed for the United States. By that point, the 
Soviet Union had collapsed, and the Soviet Union’s ﬁ  nan-
cial support for the Cuban government had dwindled. The 1994 exodus pushed diplomats in both the United States and Cuba to come to an agreement on Cuban migration. In 1995, the U.S. government established the wet foot–dry foot policy, which stemmed the ﬂ  ow of Cuban migrants to 
the United States.
National Migration Flows
National migration ﬂ  ows can also be thought of as internal migration ﬂ  ows. Historically, two of the major migration ﬂ  ows before 1950 occurred internally, that is, within a single country rather than across interna-tional borders. In the United States, a massive migra-tion stream carried the center of population west and more recently also south, as Figure 3.16 shows. As the American populace migrates westward, it is also shift-ing from north to south, to reﬂ  ect migration ﬂ  ows from 
south to north and back again. After the American Civil War, and gaining momentum during World War I, mil-lions of African Americans migrated north to work in the industrial Northeast and Midwest. This internal migra-tion ﬂ  ow continued during the 1920s, declined during (Fig. 3.15). Jewish immigrants from the Eurasian region continue to migrate to Israel. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, thousands of Jews who had been unable to practice their religion in the Soviet Union migrated to Israel. T oday Israel’s popu-lation of 7.4 million, including about 1 million Arab Israelis, continues to grow through immigration as well as substantial natural increase.
Conﬂ  ict and War
At the end of World War II, as many as 15 million Germans migrated westward from their homes in Eastern Europe, either voluntarily or because they were forced to leave.

Field Note
“Just a few miles into the West Bank, not far from Jerusalem, 
the expanding Israeli presence could not be missed. New settlements dot the landscape, often occupying strategic sites that are also easily defensible. These ‘facts on the ground’ will certainly complicate the effort to carve out a stable territorial order in this much-contested region. That, of course, is the goal of the settlers and their supporters, but it is salt on the wound for those who contest the Israeli right to be there in the ﬁ  rst place.”c03Migration.indd Page 99  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 99  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

the depression years of the 1930s, and then resumed its 
upward climb.
In the 1970s, the trend began to reverse itself: African 
Americans began leaving the North and returning to the South. The reversal had several causes. Although the civil rights movement in the 1960s did not change conditions in the South overnight, it undoubtedly played a role in the reverse migration. Disillusionment with deteriorating living conditions in the Rustbelt of the urban North and West, coupled with growing economic opportunities in Southern cities, also drew African Americans southward. African Americans who lived in Northern cities migrated to Southern cities, not to rural areas, as the urban econo-mies of the Sunbelt began to grow.
Russia also experienced a major internal migration, 
but in Russia, people migrated east, from the heartland of the Russian state (near Moscow and St. Petersburg) to the shores of the Paciﬁ  c. This eastward migration signiﬁ  cantly altered the cultural mosaic of Eurasia, 
and understanding this migration ﬂ  ow helps us under-stand the modern map of Eurasia. During the tsarist (1800s–1910s) and communist periods (1920s–1980s), Russian and Soviet rulers tried to occupy and consoli-date the country’s far eastern frontier, moving indus-tries eastward, building railroads and feeder lines, and establishing Vladivostok on the Paciﬁ  c Coast as one of the world’s best equipped naval bases. As Russia and then the Soviet Union expanded outward and to the east, the country incorporated numerous ethnic minorities into the country.
During the communist period, the Soviet govern-
ment also employed a policy of Russification, which sought to assimilate all the people in the Soviet territory into the Russian culture. One way the Soviets pushed for Russiﬁ  cation was by encouraging people of Russian heri-
tage to move out of Moscow and St. Petersburg and ﬁ  ll 
in the country. By 1980, as many as 30 million Russians had moved out toward the borders. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, some people moved back to their original homelands, but the map will long carry the impact of Russia’s eastward expansion.
Mexico offers a more recent example of internal 
migration. As many as 1 million Mexicans successfully cross into the United States each year, both legally and ille-gally. Many Mexicans emigrate from the northern areas of Mexico into the southern areas of the United States. In the northern Mexican State of Zacatecas, an estimated one out of every two people is currently living in the United States. As a result, the northern areas of Mexico are experiencing a labor shortage. In response, Mexican workers from areas farther south in the country are migrating northward to ﬁ ll the labor shortage, especially in Mexico’s agricultural 
sector. Many Mexicans migrating north within the country are Huichol Indians, one of Mexico’s indigenous popula-tions. Ironically, the Huichol in northern Mexico are expe-riencing the same kind of substandard living conditions, lack of acceptance by locals, and exploitation by employers that the Mexicans from the north are experiencing in the United States.
Guest Workers
The countries of Europe that were major participants in World War II lost millions of young men in the long con-ﬂ ict. After the war, European countries, rebuilding their 
economies with the help of the U.S.-sponsored Marshall Plan, found themselves in need of laborers. T wo ﬂ  ows of 
migration into Western European countries began: ﬁ  rst 
within the European region, as workers from poorer European countries and regions migrated to economically growing areas, and second from outside of Europe, as mil-lions of foreign workers immigrated from North Africa (the majority to France) and T urkey (mostly to Germany) as well as from the Caribbean region, India, and Africa (many to the United Kingdom).
Western European governments called the labor 
migrants guest workers. The laws allowing guest work-
ers into Europe assumed the workers would ﬁ  ll the void left by those who died during World War II, and then they would return to their home countries. Instead, the guest workers stayed both because they wanted to and because they were needed. T wo to three generations of T urks have now been born in Germany, making them far more than “guests.” The German government, which had for decades deﬁ  ned German citizens as those of German descent, allowed T urks to become citizens of the country in 2005.
Not only in Germany, but in countries around the 
world, millions of guest workers live outside of their home country and send remittances from their jobs home. Guest workers often work as agricultural laborers or in service industries, including hotels, restaurants, and tourist attractions. The home states of these workers are fully aware that their citizens have visas and are working abroad. In many instances, the economies of the home countries come to rely on the remittances, and the home governments work with destination countries and with the international labor organization to protect the rights of the guest workers.
Despite the legal status of guest workers and the 
work of governments and international organizations to protect them, many employers abuse them because guest workers are often unaware of their rights. Long hours and low pay are common, but guest workers continue to work because the money is better than they would ordi-narily receive and because they are supporting families at home.c03Migration.indd Page 100  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 100  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 Where Do People Migrate? 101
When the need for labor declines, destination 
governments can squeeze out guest workers. Nigeria, 
as noted earlier, did exactly that in the early 1980s when the government sent foreign workers from other areas of West Africa home, often by force. Similarly, the government of the home country can pull out its guest workers, bringing them home when conditions in the destination region become perilous. For example, over 30,000 Indonesians were working in the Middle East before the 2003 Iraq War; the Indonesian govern-ment decided to pull its workers home just before the war began.
Guest workers are legal, documented migrants 
who have work visas, usually short term. Often the des-tination governments extend the visas if certain sec-tors of the economy still need laborers. Whether short or long term, the international ﬂ  ow of guest workers changes the ethnic, linguistic, and religious mosaic of the places where they go. In Europe, for example, guest workers from T urkey, North Africa, South Asia, and other former colonial holdings have altered the cul-tural landscape of the region. New temples, mosques, restaurants, grocery stores, shops, and service industries geared toward migrants have taken root in Europe’s cul-tural landscape.
Refugees
Y ou may have seen a story on the televised news show-ing thousands upon thousands of poor people ﬂ  eeing a 
crisis in their home region or country by walking. They put their few earthly possessions and their babies on their backs and walk. They walk to another town. They walk beyond their country’s border. They walk to a ref-ugee camp without adequate food, water, or amenities. International agencies attempt desperate relief efforts while disease spreads, dooming infants and children and emaciating adults. As they walk, they remember all they are leaving behind: the only life they have known. But in the midst of war and persecution, it is too hard to hold onto this life. So, they walk.
The vast majority of refugees do not make it far 
from home. The United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that 83 percent of refugees ﬂ ee to a country in the same region as their home coun-
try. The world’s refugee population has grown steadily since the 1951 establishment of the Refugee Convention, which established an international law specifying who is a refugee and what legal rights they have. The main goal of the 1951 Refugee Convention was to help European refu-gees following the end of World War II. The UNHCR helped to repatriate (return to their homeland) most of the refugees from World War II.In 1970, the United Nations reported 2.9 million 
persons were refugees; the majority were Palestinian Arabs dislocated by the creation of the state of Israel and the armed conﬂ  icts that followed. In 1980, the global ref-ugee total had nearly tripled, to over 8 million. By 2010, the UNHCR reported 15.2 million refugees (not count-ing Palestinian refugees in Jordan and Syria), ﬂ  eeing from 
their homes and across country borders.
The United Nations agency that monitors the refu-
gee problem is the key organization supporting refugees. It organizes and funds international relief efforts and negotiates with governments and regimes on behalf of the refugees. But UNHCR is not alone in tracking this global problem; other ofﬁ  ces often contradict UNHCR’s data, 
arguing that the situation is even worse than the United Nations suggests.
The 1951 Refugee Convention deﬁ  nes a refugee  
as “a person who has a wellfounded fear of being perse-cuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, member-ship of a particular social group, or political opinion.” Countries interpret this deﬁ  nition in different ways, especially since the phrase “wellfounded” leaves much room for judgment.
Perhaps the biggest problem with the UN deﬁ  ni-
tion has to do with internally displaced persons (called IDPs, sometimes called internal refugees). Internally displaced persons are people who have been displaced within their own countries, such as the victims of Hurricane Katrina, but they do not cross international borders as they ﬂ  ee. IDPs tend to remain undercounted, if not almost invisible. In 2010, UNHCR estimated that 27 million people (in addition to the 15.2 million inter-national refugees) are IDPs—forced to abandon their homes. The United Nations and international law dis-tinguish between refugees , who have crossed one or more 
international borders during their move and encamped in a country other than their own, and internally displaced 
persons  (IDPs), who abandon their homes but remain in 
their own countries.
Because the status of a refugee is internationally 
deﬁ ned and recognized and comes with legal rights, the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and states in the world must distinguish between refugees and migrants who may be just as poor or desperate but who do not qualify for refugee status. When a refugee meets the ofﬁ cial criteria, he or she becomes eligible for assistance, 
including possible asylum, which is the right to protec-tion in the ﬁ  rst country in which the refugee arrives. Other migrants do not have the right to asylum. Refugee status can extend over decades and become the very basis for a way of life, as has happened in the Middle East. In Jordan, Palestinian refugees have become so integrated into the host country’s national life that they are regarded as permanent refugees, but in Lebanon other Palestinians c03Migration.indd Page 101  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 101  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

wait in refugee camps for resettlement and still qualify as 
temporary refugees.
The United Nations helps ensure that refugees and 
internally displaced persons are not forcibly returned to a homeland where persecution is still continuing. Once the violence subsides in a place and the conditions improve, the UNHCR helps return refugees to their homelands, a process called repatriation.
In the 1990s, hostilities broke out between the Hutu 
and T utsi ethnic groups in Rwanda that led to a genocide killing hundreds of thousands and a disastrous exodus of more than one million refugees who ﬂ  ed to neighboring 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (then called Zaire), T anzania, and Uganda. The T utsi–Hutu strife in Rwanda spread to neighboring Burundi and dislocated tens of thousands. After the civil war in Rwanda calmed down in 1996, the UNHCR and the World Health Organization watched and aided as 500,000 Rwandans returned from across the border in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Fig. 3.17).
Regions of Dislocation
The refugee situation changes frequently as some refu-gees return home, conditions permitting, and as other new streams suddenly form. Y et we can make certain general-izations about the overall geography of refugees. T oday, the region of North Africa and Southwest Asia, including Iraq and Afghanistan, generates more than half of the refu-gees worldwide. Subsaharan Africa comes in second with about 20 percent of the world’s refugees (Fig. 3.18).

 Where Do People Migrate? 103
In 2010 the United Nations reported that festering 
war and conﬂ  ict in the world was diminishing the num-
ber of refugees who were repatriated (returned home) each year. The High Commissioner on Refugees stated that a majority of the world’s refugees had been refugees (and not repatriated) for more than ﬁ  ve years. Most refugees move 
without any more goods than they can carry with them. When the United States and its allies began their retalia-tory bombing in Afghanistan following the terrorist attack on New Y ork and Washington in September 2001, tens of thousands of Afghan refugees climbed across mountain passes to reach the relative safety of Pakistan, able only to bring a few personal belongings. Most refugees make their ﬁ  rst “step” on foot, by bicycle, wagon, or open boat. 
Refugees are suddenly displaced, limiting their options, and most have few resources to invest in their journey. As a result, the vast majority of the world’s refugees come from relatively poor countries and travel to neighboring coun-tries that are also poor. The impact of refugee ﬂ  ows is cer-tainly felt most in the poorest countries of the world.
North Africa and Southwest Asia
This geographic region, extending from Morocco in the west to Afghanistan in the east, contains some of the world’s longest-lasting and most deeply entrenched conﬂ  icts that 
generate refugees. A particularly signiﬁ  cant set of refugee 
problems center on Israel and the displaced Arab popula-tions that surround it. Conﬂ  ict in Afghanistan has lasted 
more than 30 years, generating the largest refugee ﬂ  ow in 
the world today. Instability in the Persian Gulf in 1991 and again since 2001 accounts for the second largest refugee ﬂ ow in the world. In sum, over half of the refugees world-
wide today come from Afghanistan and Iraq alone.
The Gulf War of 1991 and the current war in Iraq 
have generated millions of refugees in the region. In 1991, in the aftermath of the Gulf War that followed Iraq’s inva-sion of Kuwait, a signiﬁ  cant percentage of the Kurdish population of northern Iraq, threatened by the surviving military apparatus and under Baghdad’s control, aban-doned their villages and towns and streamed toward and across the T urkish and Iranian borders. The refugee move-ment of Iraq’s Kurds involved as many as 2.5 million people and riveted world attention to the plight of people who are condemned to such status through the actions of others. It led the United States and its allies to create a secure zone for Kurds in northern Iraq in the hope of persuading dis-placed Kurds in T urkey and Iran to return to their coun-try. But this effort was only partially successful. The events surrounding the Gulf War severely dislocated the Kurdish people of Iraq; as Figure 3.18 shows, many remain refugees in T urkey as well as Iran. The current war in Iraq has gen-erated over 2 million refugees, most of whom are living in neighboring Syria and Jordan, and over 1.5 million IDPs.
During the 1980s, Afghanistan was caught in the 
Soviets’ last imperialist campaign and paid an enormous price for it. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan at the end of 1979, in support of a puppet regime, as well as Afghan resistance, generated a double migration stream that carried millions westward into Iran and eastward into 
Pakistan. At the height of the exodus, 2.5 million Afghans were  estimated to be living in camps in Iran, and some 
3.7 million gathered in tent camps in Pakistan’s northwest-
ern province and in southern Baluchistan. The Soviet inva-sion seemed destined to succeed quickly, but the Russian generals underestimated the strength of Afghan opposition. U.S. support for the Muslim forces in the form of weapons supplies helped produce a stalemate and eventual Soviet withdrawal, but this was followed by a power struggle among Afghan factions. As a result, most of the more than 6 million refugees in Iran and Pakistan, about one-quarter of the country’s population, stayed where they were.
In 1996, the T aliban, an Islamic Fundamentalist 
movement that began in northwest Pakistan, emerged in Afghanistan and took control of most of the country, imposing strict Islamic rule and suppressing the factional conﬂ icts that had prevailed since the Soviet withdrawal. 
Although several hundred thousand refugees moved back to Afghanistan from Pakistan, the harsh T aliban rule cre-ated a countermigration and led to further refugee move-ment into neighboring Iran, where their number reached 2.5 million. Eventually, Afghanistan became a base for anti-Western terrorist operations, which reached a climax in the attack on the United States on September 11, 2001. Even before the inevitable military retaliation began, and despite efforts by both Pakistan and Iran to close their borders, tens of thousands of Afghan refugees ﬂ  ooded across, intensify-
ing a refugee crisis that is now nearly a quarter-century old.
Amidst the crises in Israel/Palestine, Iraq, and 
Afghanistan, nearly every country in Southwest Asia is currently experiencing the impact of refugees.
Africa
Africa’s people are severely afﬂ  icted by dislocation, not just 
in terms of the 2 million refugees accounted for by interna-tional relief agencies, but also millions more are internally displaced persons. The impact of refugee and IDP ﬂ  ows 
in Subsaharan Africa is exacerbated by extreme poverty, corruption, and disease in many parts of the region. For Africans who live in countries experiencing civil war or brutal dictatorships, each day is a humanitarian crisis.
During the last decade of the twentieth century and 
the ﬁ  rst years of the twenty-ﬁ  rst, several of the world’s largest refugee crises occurred in Subsaharan Africa. In the 1990s and early 2000s, refugee ﬂ  ows in West, Central, and East Africa combined to put Subsaharan Africa at the head of the world’s refugee ﬂ  ows. In 2011, the number of refugees in Subsaharan Africa pales in comparison to the number in North Africa and Southwest Asia.
Although Subsaharan Africa is not politically stable, 
most refugees from the crises in West Africa were repatriated. c03Migration.indd Page 103  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 103  9/15/11  7:35 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
104 Chapter 3   Migration
In 1997, civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone sent columns 
of hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming into Guinea and Ivory Coast. The UNHCR reported more than 1.5 mil-lion refugees in West Africa in 1997. In 2011, the number of refugees in West Africa declined to under 200,000 as a result of improved political stability and repatriation. The largest refugee ﬂ  ows in Subsaharan Africa now come out of Central and East Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan, and Somalia.
Sudan, which began a second civil war in 1983, dem-
onstrates the complexities of refugee crises in Subsaharan Africa today. The conﬂ  ict in Sudan was originally between the north, which is largely Arab and Muslim, and the south, which is majority black African and Christian or animist (the south has since seceded and is now South Sudan). Sudan, a country drawn by European colonialism, was home to traditional religions in the south, Christianity brought by Western missionaries in the south, and Islam brought by North African traders in the north.
The government in Khartoum, located in the Muslim 
north, waged a campaign of genocide toward ethnic groups in the Christian and animist south during the  Figure 3.18

north-south civil war, which lasted from 1983 to 2005. 
The government of Sudan funded the Janjaweed militia, which practiced a scorched earth campaign, burning vil-lages throughout the south. 
The civil war between north and south in Sudan 
caused immense damage. Over 2.2 million people died in the ﬁ  ghting or starved as a result of the war. More than 
5 million people were displaced, with over 1.6 million ﬂ eeing to neighboring Uganda alone. Both sides of the 
Sudanese civil war interfered with the efforts of interna-tional agencies to help the refugees.In 1999, Sudan began exporting oil, which is extracted 
from southern Sudan. Global attention to the humanitar-ian crisis of the Sudanese civil war prompted the northern government to agree to a compromise. In 2002, the north and south brokered a temporary peace deal, but shortly thereafter, violence began in the Darfur region in western Sudan. The entire north of Sudan is largely Muslim, but only two-thirds of the northerners speak Arabic as their native language. The other one-third are Muslim but are not ethnically Arab. The non-Arab Muslims are part of at least 30 different ethnic groups in the Darfur region of Tropic of CancerArctic Circle

western Sudan. The Arab Muslim government (located in 
the north) began a campaign of genocide early in this cen-tury against the non-Arab Muslims in Darfur. The govern-ment of Sudan funds the militia known as the Janjaweed. The Janjaweed is waging a genocide campaign against the non-Arab, Muslim, darker-skinned Africans in Darfur—a campaign that includes killing over 400,000, raping women and girls, taking lands and homes from Africans, and displacing 2.5 million people (Fig. 3.19).
In 2004, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell 
labeled the Janjaweed’s actions in Darfur genocide. The 
1948 Convention on Genocide deﬁ  nes genocide as “acts 
committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.” The inter-national community is trying to negotiate an end to the government-backed campaign in Darfur. The United Nations Security Council met in Kenya in 2004 trying to ﬁ  nd a solution and eventually passed a resolution con-demning the Sudanese government and threatening puni-tive damages against the government for their actions in Darfur. T wo members of the Security Council, China and Pakistan, abstained from the vote because each of these countries relies on oil imports from Sudan.
In 2005, northern and southern Sudan signed the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which called for the south to hold a referendum, a vote of all the people, on whether to break off from the north and form a new coun-try. Conﬂ  ict continued in Darfur. Under international pressure in 2008, China began to pressure the Sudanese government to end the violence in Darfur, but the Chinese government also refuses to recognize the Janjaweed’s rela-tionship with the Sudanese government.
In 2011, South Sudan voted in a referendum to 
secede from Sudan. In July 2011 the north and south formally separated. Ironically, the new border, which was created as a solution to a civil war and refugee crisis has already generated new refugee ﬂ  ows in the region. 
The long-lasting refugee and IDP crisis in Sudan help us understand the complexity of political conﬂ  ict and 
migration ﬂ  ows in Subsaharan Africa. The Muslim  Figure 3.19

against Muslim conﬂ  ict in Darfur demonstrates that 
political conﬂ  ict is not just religious; it is also ethnic and political.
Mixed into this extremely local conﬂ  ict are regional 
and global-scale debates about what to do. Regionally, the African Union, an organization committed to ﬁ  nd-
ing African solutions to African problems, has com-mitted Nigerian and Rwandan troops to Darfur to try to solve the crisis. The African Union is supported with American and European monies and military strategiz-ing. Regionally, neighboring countries have not helped create stability for the country. Since 1998, over 5.4 million people have died in violence in neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. Violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was partially spurred by the instability created as a result of refugee ﬂ  ows from 
the 1994 war in neighboring Rwanda. The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is certainly bleak. In 2009, attacks by the rebel group Lord’s Resistance Army in the northeastern portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have generated over 1 million refugees. The refugees have ﬂ  ed to South Sudan, a new country that recently experienced civil war and humani-tarian crisis, to escape their own oppressive government.
South Asia
In terms of refugee numbers, South Asia is the third-rank-ing geographic realm, mainly because of Pakistan’s role in accommodating Afghanistan’s refugees. During the Soviet intrusion in the 1980s, the UNHCR counted more than 3 million refugees; during the 1990s, the total aver-aged between 1.2 and 1.5 million. That number rose when Allied retaliation against terrorist bases began in October 2001. T oday, Afghanistan has an enormous refugee cri-sis with 3 million refugees living outside of Afghanistan, mostly in Pakistan and Iran.
The other major refugee problem in South Asia 
stems from a civil war in Sri Lanka. This conﬂ  ict, aris-
ing from demands by minority T amils for an indepen-dent state on the Sinhalese-dominated and -controlled island, has cost tens of thousands of lives and has severely damaged the economy. The United Nations reports that about 200,000 people are internally displaced. The United Nations, European Union, and the Canadian government are working to repatriate the IDPs, particu-larly in the northern provinces of Sri Lanka. An estimated 100,000 internally displaced persons are uprooted in Sri Lanka today.
Southeast Asia
Southeast Asia is a reminder that refugee problems can change quickly. Indochina was the scene of one of the twentieth century’s most desperate refugee crises when a stream of between 1 and 2 million people ﬂ  ed Vietnam in the aftermath of the long war that ended in 1975. In the early 1990s, Cambodia produced an exodus of 300,000 refugees escaping from their country’s seem-ingly endless cycle of violence, ending up in refugee camps on the Thailand side of the border. T oday, the largest camps in this realm are for IDPs in Myanmar (formerly Burma). Victims of the 2004 tsunami, the 2008 cyclone, and the repressive rule of generals who are seeking to subjugate the country’s minorities seek refuge in the camps. The UNHCR explains that esti-mating the number of IDPs in Myanmar is difﬁ  cult 
because securing information from Myanmar’s closed society is difﬁ  cult.
Europe
In the 1990s, the collapse of Yugoslavia and its associated conﬂ icts created the largest refugee crisis in Europe since 
the end of World War II. In 1995, the UNHCR reported the staggering total of 6,056,600 refugees, a number that some observers felt was inﬂ  ated by the Europeans’ unusu-ally liberal interpretations of the United Nations’ rules for refugee recognition. Nevertheless, even after the cessa-tion of armed conﬂ  ict and the implementation of a peace 
agreement known as the Dayton Accords, the UNHCR still reports over 100,000 IDPs in the area.
Other Regions
The number of refugees and internally displaced per-sons in other geographic realms is much smaller. In the Western Hemisphere, only Colombia has a serious inter-nally displaced person problem, numbering between 3.4 and 4.9 million people, caused by the country’s chronic instability associated with its struggle against narcotics. Large areas of Colombia’s countryside are vulnerable to armed attack by “narcoterrorists” and paramilitary units; these rural areas are essentially beyond government con-trol, and thousands of villagers have died in the crossﬁ  re. 
Hundreds of thousands more have left their homes to seek protection.
People who abandon their familiar surroundings 
because conditions have become unlivable perform an ultimate act of desperation. In the process, the habits of civilization vanish as survival becomes the sole imperative. Refugee and internally displaced person populations are a barometer of the world’s future.

migrant. You look at your access to transportation and the 
opportunities you have to go elsewhere. Be realistic, and describe how you determine where you will go, how you get there, and what you do once you get there.
HOW DO GOVERNMENTS 
AFFECT MIGRATION?
The control of immigration, legal and illegal, the 
granting of asylum to asylum-seeking refugees, and the 
fate of cross-border refugees, permanent and temporary, have become hot issues around the world. In Europe, right-wing political parties whip up anti-immigrant senti-ment. In California, the state government demands fed-eral monies to provide services for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants; if the federal government cannot control its borders, they argue, states should not have to foot the bill. In Cuba, the Castro regime has used migra-tion as a threat: in August 1994, Castro threatened to open Cuba’s doors to a ﬂ  ood of emigrants who would invari-ably all ﬂ  ee to the United States. And in the United States today, the federal government faces reproach both from those who want to stop the ﬂ  ow of migration from Mexico and those who argue for opening the United States’ doors for migrants from humanitarian crises, including Haiti.
Efforts to restrict migration ﬂ  ows are nothing new. 
Media coverage, political debates, and political wrangling only make it seem so. In the fourteenth century, China built the Great Wall in part as a defensive measure but also as a barrier to emigration (by Chinese beyond the sphere of their authorities) and immigration (mainly by Mongol “barbarians” from the northern plains). The Berlin Wall, the Korean DMZ (demilitarized zone), the fences along the Rio Grande—all are evidence of governments’ desire to control the movement of people across their borders.
Legal Restrictions
T ypically, the obstacles placed in the way of potential immigrants are legal, not physical. Restrictive legisla-tion on immigration appeared in the United States in 1882, when Congress approved the Oriental Exclusion Acts (1882–1907). Congress designed immigration 
laws to prevent the immigration of Chinese people to California. In 1901, the Australian government approved the Immigration Restriction Act, which ended all non-white immigration into the newly united country. In particular, the Australian government was targeting Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian immigrants. The act also prohibited immigration by South Paciﬁ  c Islanders 
who worked on Australia’s large sugar plantations. The Australian government furthered action against the plan-tation workers (the Kanakas) by deporting the South Paciﬁ  c Islanders by the end of 1906. These immigration 
policies created what is known as the White Australia 
Policy, which remained in effect until modiﬁ  cation in 1972 and again in 1979.
Waves of Immigration 
in the United States
Changes in a country’s migration policies are reﬂ  ected in 
the number of people entering the country and the origin 
of the immigrants (see Fig. 3.20). The United States expe-rienced two major waves of immigration before 1930 and is in the midst of another great wave of immigration today. Major changes in the government’s migration policies are reﬂ ected in this graph. Push factors are also reﬂ  ected in 
Figure 3.20, as people in different regions found reasons to leave their home and migrate to the United States.
During the 1800s, the United States opened its 
doors to immigration. Most of the immigrants arrived from Europe, especially Northern Europe (Scandinavia) and western Europe (including Ireland, Great Britain, Germany, and France). In the later part of the 1800s, a greater proportion of Europeans who immigrated to the United States came from Southern and eastern Europe (including Italy, Spain, Portugal, Russia, and Poland).
Following World War I, political tides in the 
United States turned toward isolationism—staying out of entanglements abroad. In addition, Congress feared growing migration from eastern and Southern Europe. Many whites in the United States at the time saw migrants from eastern and southern Europe as darker skinned and as an inferior race of whites. In this context, Congress passed restrictive legislation in 1921, deter-ring immigration from southern and eastern Europe. Congress set immigration quotas, whereby each year, European countries could permit the emigration to the United States of 3 percent of the number of its nationals living in the United States in 1910. In 1910, the great-est proportion of immigrants in the United States came from northern and western Europe, thus the quotas allowed migration from northern and western Europe and severely restricted immigration from southern and eastern Europe (Fig. 3.20).
In 1924, Congress altered the Immigration Act by 
lowering the quota to 2 percent and making 1890 the base year, further reducing the annual total to 150,000 immi-grants and further discouraging eastern and southern European migration.
The rapid fall in total immigration to the United States 
is clear in Figure 3.20. Just prior to the Great Depression, Congress passed the National Origins Law in 1929, whereby Congress continued to limit immigration to 150,000 per year. Congress also tied immigration quotas to the national c03Migration.indd Page 108  9/15/11  7:36 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 108  9/15/11  7:36 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
origins of the U.S. population in 1920. As a result of this 
provision, Congress in effect prevented the immigration of Asians. With these laws in effect and the Great Depression in full swing, immigration slowed to a trickle during the 1930s. In some years emigration actually exceeded immigration in the United States.
After 1940, Congress modiﬁ  ed the restrictions on 
immigration to the United States. In 1943, Congress gave China equal status to that of European countries and in 1952 granted Japan a similar status. In 1952, immigration began to rise again (Fig. 3.20) after Congress passed a new Immigration and Nationality Act. Congress designed the act to incorporate all preceding legislation, establishing quotas for all countries and limiting total immigration to 160,000. However, far more than 160,000 immigrants entered the country as refugees, thereby ﬁ  lling quotas 
for years ahead. Estimates vary, but more than 7 million immigrants may have entered the United States as refu-gees between 1945 and 1970.
By 1965, Congress recognized the 1952 act as a fail-
ure and abolished the quota system. Congress set new limits, which are also reﬂ  ected in Figure 3.20. The United 
States allowed 170,000 immigrants per year from coun-tries outside of the Western Hemisphere and 120,000 from countries in the Americas. Refugee policies and guest worker policies over the last three decades allowed many more immigrants than these limitations.
The United States and Australia are not the only 
countries that have restricted immigration. Many coun-tries practice selective immigration, in which individuals with certain backgrounds (criminal records, poor health, subversive activities) are barred from entering.
Other countries have speciﬁ  c requirements. For 
example, South Africa long demanded “pure” European descent; New Zealand favored persons of British birth and parentage; Australia’s assisted passage program favored immigrants from Britain, the Netherlands, Malta, and Italy; Brazil preferred people with a farming background; and Singapore courts ﬁ  nancially secure persons of Chinese 
ancestry. T oday South American countries place limits on the number of immigrants who may cross their borders, and several countries are instituting quota systems. Figure 3.20

110 Chapter 3   Migration
Post–September 11
Since September 11, 2001, government immigration 
policies have incorporated security concerns. Prior to that date, the U.S. border patrol was concerned primarily with drug trafﬁ  cking and human smuggling. The new govern-ment policies affect asylum-seekers, illegal immigrants, and legal immigrants.
After September 11, the George W. Bush admin-
istration cracked down on asylum-seekers (a refugee requests entry into the U.S. from his or her home country, and an asylum seeker requests protection from a port of entry in the U.S.). In the aftermath of 9/11, on March 15, 2003,the U.S. government marked 33 countries as coun-tries where al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups operate, and the government automatically detained anyone from one of these 33 countries who entered the United States looking for asylum under a policy called “Operation Liberty Shield.” On March 25, Human Rights Watch argued against the policy, stating that it created “a blan-ket suspicion of links to terrorism based on nationality alone.” On April 17, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security quietly terminated “Operation Liberty Shield.”
Post-September 11 government security poli-
cies have also affected illegal immigrants. The Justice Department currently has a policy that allows it to detain any illegal immigrant, even if the person has no known ties to terrorist organizations. This policy stems from the department’s concern that terrorists may use Haiti as a “staging point.” The idea behind this law is that terror-ists could travel to Haiti temporarily and then illegally migrate from Haiti to the United States to commit ter-rorist attacks. Similarly, the government fence-building along the United States–Mexican border (discussed at the beginning of this chapter) is a response in part to the con-cern that terrorists will use Mexico as a staging ground to immigrate illegally and commit terrorist attacks.
In addition to focusing on asylum-seekers and illegal 
immigration, the post–September 11 world is concerned with legal immigration. The 9/11 Commission Report, released in 2004, discusses the issue of terrorists using fab-ricated or altered papers to migrate to the United States. The 9/11 terrorists entered the United States using visas. The Commission reported that the Federal Aviation Administration ﬂ  agged more than half of the 9/11 hijackers with the proﬁ  ling system they had in place. However, the policy at the time was to check the bags of those ﬂ  agged, 
not the people themselves. The Commission explains, “For terrorists, travel documents are as important as weapons.” It therefore recommends stepping up inspections and ques-tioning at travel checkpoints, seeing these checkpoints as “a chance to establish that people are who they say they are and are seeking access for their stated purpose, to intercept identiﬁ  able suspects, and to take effective action.”
People and organizations opposed to the post–
September 11 policies counter that raising fences and detaining people will not combat terrorism; rather, it will intensify hatred of the U.S. government, thus promoting terrorism. Organizations such as Human Rights First, Amnesty International, and the Migration Policy Institute claim that the new government crackdowns have violated civil liberties and have done nothing to make Americans safer. Others opposed to the new border regulations argue that the crackdown has only slowed trafﬁ  c and the ﬂ  ow of 
business and tourism, and has utterly failed to slow illegal immigration.
Regardless of which side of this debate you choose, 
we can all agree that concern about migration will con-tinue to shape security policy in the United States, Europe, and beyond in the decades to come.
One goal of international organizations involved in aiding refugees is repatriation—return of the refugees to their home countries once the threat against them has passed. Take the example of refugees from the Darfur region of Sudan. Think about how their land and their lives have changed since they became refugees. You are assigned the daunting task of repatriating refugees from Darfur to Sudan once a peace solution is reached. What steps would you have to take to rediscover a home for these refugees?
Summary
In the last 500 years, humans have traveled the globe, mapped it, connected it through globalization, and migrated across it. In this chapter, we discussed major global, regional, and national migration ﬂ  ows. Migration can occur as a result of a conscious decision, resulting in a voluntary migration ﬂ  ow, or migration can occur under duress, resulting in forced migration. Both kinds of migration have left an indelible mark on c03Migration.indd Page 110  9/15/11  7:36 AM user-f401c03Migration.indd Page 110  9/15/11  7:36 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

increasingly open and interconnected world, neither physical barriers nor politically motivated legislation will hold back tides that are as old as human history.

Field Note Preserving Culture
The signs with the Tata Corpor-
ation’s logo were everywhere on the landscape of the city of Hyderabad in India (Fig. 4.1): a Tata corporate building across the street from our ﬂ  at; Tata emblazoned 
on the grill of trucks through out the city; Tata sky satellite dishes bring-ing television into homes; Tata International consulting buildings in the high-tech district of the city.
I asked my host what the Tata Corporation was 
and where the name came from. He explained, “Tata is a family name. The Tata family are members of the Parsi religion, and they own many businesses through-out India and the world.”
I was surprised I had not heard of the Tata family 
before, but I had heard about the Parsi. The Parsi are an ethnic group and a religion. The Parsi are followers of the Zoroastrian religion and came to India from Persia (present-day Iran) sometime between the eighth and tenth centuries.
According to Indian folklore, the Parsi were 
looking for a place of refuge as they ﬂ  ed from Persia (present day Iran). They sent word to a Hindu ruler in western India that they wanted to settle there. The Hindu ruler sent the Parsi a bowl full of milk to sym-bolize that they should not come to India because the western states were already full. Legend has it that the Parsi leader placed a gold ring in the bowl of milk and returned it to symbolize they would bring wealth to the region without displacing the people.

Around 1500 years ago, the Parsi soon settled in western India, primarily in the 
city of Mumbai (historically Bombay).
India is overwhelmingly Hindu (85 percent), but the followers of the Parsi reli-
gion, who make up 0.00046 percent of the Indian population because there are fewer than 60,000 Parsi in the Indian population of 1.3 billion people, control a large share of the Indian economy. The Tata Group recorded revenues of $67 bil-lion in 2010. In addition to the Tata family, the Godrej Group, which produces soap, appliances, and ofﬁ  ce equipment, and the Wadias Company, which produces textiles and owns an airline, are both companies Parsi families in India established and lead.
How did such a small group of families become major players ﬁ  rst in the 
Indian economy and now in the global economy? Some Indian economists point to a positive relationship the Parsi had with the British when India was a colony of Great Britain. Others point to the tight-knit Parsi community that beneﬁ  ted ﬁ  nan-
cially early on through the establishment of India’s cotton industry and then grew that wealth into many other sectors over time.
The ﬁ  nancial success of the Parsi in India cannot be ascribed to a single cause. 
The cohesive community of the Parsi and the maintenance of cultural practices that keep the Parsi together and culturally separate from the dominant Hindu cul-ture were deﬁ  nitely factors in the Parsi success. These same traits now threaten to 
destroy the Parsi culture because the number of Parsi people is dwindling.
A local culture such as the Parsi is maintained through the preservation of 
cultural traits and practices. Today, however, one core cultural practice among the Parsi threatens the existence of the culture itself. According to an edict set down by Parsi religious leaders in 1918, the Parsi religion recognizes as members only the children who are born of two Parsi parents. Although some Parsi do accept the children who are born to a Parsi father and non-Parsi mother as a member of the Parsi community, children born of Parsi women who are married to non-Parsi (called “outsiders” by the Parsi) are not accepted as members of the community.
This is signiﬁ  cant today because the Parsi have a very high literacy rate of 98 
percent in India, and many Parsi women are highly educated, have good jobs, and choose either not to marry or to have children late, thus reducing fertility rates, or to marry outside of the Parsi community. In addition, thousands of Parsi, both women and men, have migrated to the United States and Europe over the past few decades.
One Parsi high priest sees the historical lack of intermarriage as a major rea-
son the Parsi were able to keep their culture and religion in a world surrounded by Hindu followers. Parsi in India today question whether to count the women married to “outsiders” and the children born to them. Not counting these women and children, the Parsi population in India has declined since 1980 from 100,000 to 56,000.
The local culture of the Parsi is highly engaged in the global economy, and 
today the Parsi are struggling to maintain their culture and sustain their sense of community in a changing world.
In an era of globalization, popular culture diffuses around the globe, being 
embraced by some and rejected by others, all the while inﬁ  ltrating every corner of 
the globe. Local cultures persist, and in many places the communities thrive, but they face constant pressure from larger cultural groups and from the enveloping popular culture. In the face of these pressures, some members of local cultures have clung more tightly to their customs, some have let go, and others have forged a balance between the two.

Key Questions For Chapter 4
 1. What are local and popular cultures?
 2. How are local cultures sustained?
 3. How is popular culture diffused?
 4. How can local and popular cultures be seen in the cultural 
landscape?
WHAT ARE LOCAL AND POPULAR 
CULTURES?
A culture is a group of belief systems, norms, and val-
ues practiced by a people. Although this deﬁ  nition of cul-
ture sounds simple, the concept of culture is actually quite 
complex. A group of people who share common beliefs can be recognized as a culture in one of two ways: (1) the people call themselves a culture or (2) other people (including aca-demics) can label a certain group of people as a culture. T raditionally, academics label cultural groups as folk cul-tures or as part of popular culture. The idea is that the folk 
culture is small, incorporates a homogeneous population, is typically rural, and is cohesive in cultural traits, whereas popular culture is large, incorporates heterogeneous pop-ulations, is typically urban, and experiences quickly chang-ing cultural traits. Instead of using this polarity of folk and popular cultures, some academics now see folk and popular cultures as ends of a continuum, deﬁ  ning most cultures as ﬁ tting somewhere between folk and popular.
We ﬁ  nd folk culture to be a limiting concept because 
it requires us to create a list of characteristics and look for cultures that meet the list. This methodology of deﬁ  ning 
folk cultures leaves much to be desired. Once we have our list of characteristics, we must ask ourselves, are the Amish a folk culture? Are the Navajo a folk culture? And it is in this very process that we get frustrated with the concept of folk culture. It is not how we academics deﬁ  ne a culture 
that matters, it is how the people deﬁ  ne themselves that counts.
We are interested in questions such as: do the Amish 
have a group identity, and what cultural practices do they share? How do the Amish navigate through popular culture and defend their local customs? Why do a group of Americans in a small town identify themselves as Swedish Americans and hold festivals to commemorate important Swedish holidays, while other Swedish Americans in other parts of the country function completely unaware of the Swedish holidays? Why do certain ethnic holidays such as St. Patrick’s Day transcend ethnicity to be celebrated as a part of popular culture?
In this chapter, we chose to use the concept of local cul-
ture rather than folk culture. A local culture is a group of peo-ple in a particular place who see themselves as a collective or a community, who share experiences, customs, and traits, and who work to preserve those traits and customs in order to claim uniqueness and to distinguish themselves from others.The variety of ways people choose to accept, reject, 
or alter the diffusion of popular cultural practices is remarkable. Some local cultures rely primarily on religion to maintain their belief systems, others rely on commu-nity celebrations or on family structures, and still others on a lack of interaction with other cultures.
Local cultures are constantly redeﬁ  ning or reﬁ  ning 
themselves based on interactions with other cultures (local and popular) and diffusion of cultural practices (local and popular). Local cultures also affect places by establishing neighborhoods, building churches or community centers to celebrate important days, and expressing their material and nonmaterial cultures in certain places.
The material culture of a group of people includes 
things they construct, such as art, houses, clothing, sports, dance, and foods. Nonmaterial culture includes beliefs, practices, aesthetics (what they see as attractive), and val-ues of a group of people. What members of a local culture produce in their material culture reﬂ  ects the beliefs and 
values of their nonmaterial culture.
Unlike local cultures, which are found in relatively 
small areas, popular culture is ubiquitous and can change in a matter of days or hours. Popular culture is practiced by a het-erogeneous group of people: people across identities and across the world. Like local culture, popular culture encom-passes music, dance, clothing, food preferences, religious practices, and aesthetic values. The main paths of diffusion of popular culture are the transportation, marketing, and com-munication networks that interlink vast parts of the world (see Chapter 14 for further discussion of these networks).
Fashions diffuse incredibly quickly today. When Kate 
Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, graced Westminster Abbey in a lace wedding gown designed by Sarah Burton for the House of Alexander McQueen at an estimated cost of $65,000, dress designers around the world interpreted or copied the gown within hours (Fig. 4.2). Fewer than ten hours after the wedding aired at 5:30 a .m. Eastern Time, 
dress designers at Kleinfeld Bridal Salon in New Y ork had replicated Middleton’s dress, and they started selling it for $3500 within 48 hours.
In popular culture, fashion trends spread quite quickly 
through the interconnected world; it is a classic case of hierarchical diffusion. Hierarchical diffusion can occur through a hierarchy of places. The hierarchy in the fashion world typically begins with the runways of major fashion houses in world cities, including London, Milan, Paris, and 
c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 114  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 114  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
New Y ork, which act as the hearth, the point of origin. The 
next tier of places includes ﬂ  agship stores for the fashion house and editorial headquarters of fashion magazines, also located in global cities. Department store brands interpret the runway fashions for consumption by a larger audience, and the suburban mall receives the innovation. Hierarchical  What Are Local and Popular Cultures? 115
diffusion can also occur through a hierarchy of people. In this case, a designer is the hearth, models are the next tier, celebrities and editors and writers of major magazines fol-low, and subscribers to fashion magazines follow in close order. Finally, anyone walking through a shopping mall can become a “knower” in the diffusion of a fashion innovation.
We do not see local and popular cultures as being ends 
of a continuum; rather, we see both operating on the same plane, affecting people and places in different ways across different scales. For example, you may go to a major depart-ment store, such as T arget or Wal-Mart and see Hutterites or Mennonites dressed in distinctive local clothing in the midst of the ultimate in popular culture: a major interna-tional department store. T raditions, such as painting henna on one’s hands or practicing mystical Kabbalah beliefs, are carried from centuries-old customs of local cultures to the global popular culture through a popular culture icon or through the corporations (such as the media industry) that work to construct popular culture (Fig. 4.3).

116 Chapter 4  Local Culture, Popular Culture, and Cultural Landscapes
Both local cultures and popular cultures are con-
stantly navigating through a barrage of customs diffused 
from each other and across scales, through a complex of political and economic forces that shape and limit their practices, and through global communications and trans-portation networks that intricately link certain parts of the world and distance others.
In this chapter, we focus on how local cultures are 
sustained despite the onslaught of popular culture, how popular culture diffuses and is practiced in unique ways in localities of the world, and how local and popular cultures are imprinted on the cultural landscape.
Employing the concept of hierarchical diffusion, describe how you became a “knower” of your favorite kind of music—where is its hearth, and how did it reach you?
HOW ARE LOCAL CULTURES SUSTAINED?
During the 1800s and into the 1900s, the U.S. gov-
ernment had an ofﬁ  cial policy of assimilation. It wanted to assimilate indigenous peoples into the dominant cul-ture in order to make American Indians into “Americans” rather than “Indians.” Canadians, Australians, Russians, and other colonial powers adopted similar policies toward indigenous peoples, using schools, churches, and govern-ment agents to discourage native practices. In the United States, the federal government forced tribal members to settle in one place and to farm rather than hunt or ﬁ  sh. 
Public and missionary school teachers punished tribal members for using their native language.
Government agents rewarded the Indians they 
deemed most “American” with citizenship and paid jobs. The federal government even employed East Coast women from 1888 until 1938 to live on reservations and show the native women how to be “good housewives” by teaching them Victorian ways of cooking, cleaning, and sewing.
T oday, several churches and governments have apol-
ogized for assimilation policies. In 2008, the governments of Australia and Canada each ofﬁ  cially apologized to their 
indigenous populations: Aboriginals in Australia and First Nations and Inuit in Canada.
The Australian Parliament unanimously passed a 
motion stating, “We apologize for the laws and policies of successive parliaments and governments that have inﬂ icted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our 
fellow Australians.” Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologized speciﬁ  cally for the government’s 
policy of taking Aboriginal children from their homes and placing them in residential schools—a policy that lasted from the 1800s until the late 1960s.
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper likewise 
cited the disastrous outcomes of the assimilation policies in his apology to Canada’s 1.3 million indigenous people. Prime Minister Harper apologized for the abuse and the lasting negative effects of Canada’s residential schools, stating: “We now recognize that it was wrong to separate children from rich and vibrant cultures and traditions, that it created a void in many lives and communities, and we apologize for having done this. We now recognize that, in separating children from their families, we undermined the ability of many to adequately parent their own children and sowed the seeds for generations to follow.” Speaking to the indigenous people seated in the House of Commons, he continued, “Not only did you suffer these abuses as children, but as you became parents, you were powerless to protect your own children from suffering the same experi-ence, and for this we are sorry.”
The United States government has not formally apol-
ogized to American Indians for the policy of assimilation. American Indians in the United States are working to push back assimilation and popular culture by reviving the cus-toms of their local cultures. Many tribes are teaching younger generations their language, reviving their tradi-tional religion, and eating the foods and herbs of their lands, the foods and herbs on which their ancestors depended.
Local cultures are sustained through customs. A cus-
tom is a practice that a group of people routinely follows. People have customs regarding all parts of their lives, from eating and drinking to dancing and sports. T o sustain a local culture, the people must retain their customs. The customs change in small ways over time, but they are main-tained despite the onslaught of popular culture.
Researcher Simon Harrison recognizes that local 
cultural groups purposefully and often fervently deﬁ  ne 
themselves as unique, creating boundaries around their culture and distinguishing themselves from other local cultures. In the age of globalization, where popular cul-ture changes quickly and diffuses rapidly, Harrison ﬁ  nds 
that local cultures typically have two goals: keeping other cultures out and keeping their own culture in.
For example, a local culture can create a boundary 
around itself and try to keep other cultures out in order to avoid “contamination and extinction.” Harrison uses the example of the Notting Hill carnival in London to describe how Londoners from the West Indies (the Caribbean) claimed the festival as their own, in conjunc-tion with an increasing sense of collective West Indies cul-tural identity. The festival did not begin as a West Indies celebration, but as people from the West Indies shared experiences of “unemployment, police harassment and poor housing conditions” during the 1970s, they began to deﬁ ne themselves as a local culture and redeﬁ  ned the fes-
tival as a West Indian celebration.c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 116  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 116  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
A local culture can also work to avoid cultural 
appropriation, the process by which other cultures adopt 
customs and knowledge and use them for their own bene-ﬁ t. Harrison explains that cultural appropriation is a 
major concern for local cultures because people outside the local culture often privatize the cultural knowledge of a local culture, such as natural pharmaceuticals or musical expression, to accumulate wealth or prestige. Local cul-tures can thus work to keep their customs and knowledge to themselves, to avoid cultural appropriation.
Around the world, local cultures desire to keep popular 
culture out, keep their culture intact, and maintain control over customs and knowledge. Geographers also recognize that through these actions, places become increasingly important. When deﬁ  ning a place (such as a town or neighborhood) or a space for a short amount of time (such as an annual festival) as quintessentially representing the local culture’s values, mem-bers of a local culture reinforce their culture and their beliefs.
Rural Local Cultures
Members of local cultures in rural areas often have an eas-ier time maintaining their cultures because of their isola-tion. By living together in a rural area, members of a local culture can more easily keep external inﬂ  uences on the 
outside. It is no accident that we ﬁ  nd Anabaptist groups, 
such as the Hutterites, the Amish, and the Mennonites, living in rural areas of South Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, respectively.
 Figure 4.4

boy who lives in the Hutterville Farm colony near Stratford, South Dakota. 
© Erin H. Fouberg.For the past ﬁ  ve centuries, many Anabaptist groups 
have migrated to rural areas beyond these three states (often 
ﬂ eeing persecution) with the expressed purpose of living apart 
and staying together. During the Protestant Reformation, Anabaptists broke from both the Catholic Church and the new Protestant churches. Followers of the new religion were called Anabaptists, meaning baptized again, because of their belief in adult baptism, despite having been baptized as infants in the Protestant or Catholic religions.
Anabaptists broke from the state as well as the church; 
they stressed paciﬁ  sm and soon suffered persecution. Fleeing persecution, Anabaptists migrated east to Moravia and Austria, and then to Russia and the Ukraine. Continually moving to rural areas to live apart, alone, and avoid persecu-tion, a group of Anabaptists called the Hutterites, named for leader Jacob Hutter, eventually migrated to North America in the second half of the 1800s.
Old Order Anabaptist groups are shown in stereo-
typical ways in the popular media, but major differences exist across Old Order Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites, and Brethren. The Hutterites are the only Anabaptist group who live communally (Fig. 4.4). Rather than living with immediate family on a farmstead, Hutterites live in colonies of about 100 people, with individuals ranging in age from infant to elderly. More than 425 colonies are located in Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Saskatchewan, Montana, and Alberta (Fig. 4.5). In their book On the Backroad to Heaven, Donald Kraybill and Carl 
Bowman explain that the lynchpin of each colony is the  How Are Local Cultures Sustained? 117c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 117  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 117  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401

Hutterite religion. Members of the colony join together 
every night for a 30-minute service as well as on Sundays. The most prominent position in a colony is held by the minister, who speaks in archaic German, reading sermons written in the sixteenth century.
Unlike the Amish, Hutterites readily accept tech-
nologies that help them in their agricultural pursuits. Hutterite colonies were generally slow to accept technol-ogies such as cameras and cell phones out of concern that they would encourage individualistic behaviors or under-mine the Hutterite religion. T oday, it is relatively com-mon for young adult Hutterites to use Internet dating sites designed for their local culture to ﬁ  nd suitable mar-
riage partners in colonies in other states or countries.Colonies assign separate jobs and tasks to men and 
women, which reinforces a patriarchal social structure. Kraybill and Bowman explain that marriages happen across colonies, and women move to their husband’s colony after marrying. If a Hutterite woman from Alberta meets a Hutterite man from North Dakota through an Internet dating site, and they eventually decide to marry, the Canadian woman will move to the United States. As a result, a single colony is usually composed of only one or two surnames. Moving to their husband’s colony perpetu-ates women’s weak political position in the colony. Women are expected to rear many children, averaging ﬁ  ve or six currently, but the colony as a whole is responsible for rais-ing and disciplining the child.HUDSON

Hutterite Colonies in North America.  Data from: www.hutterites.org, last accessed 16 August 2011. c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 118  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 118  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
Hutterite colonies specialize in diversiﬁ  ed agricul-
ture, raising feed, food, and livestock on up to 10,000 acres. 
Hutterite men often barter with neighboring farmers to ﬁ  x 
machinery, trade goods, and lend help. The minister and other male leaders in the colony work with lawyers and bankers to keep the colony corporation operating smoothly and proﬁ  tably. The most economically successful colonies have created products used in agriculture that they produce in their shops and sell to other farmers. One colony pro-duces stainless steel animal feeders, and another markets its own animal feed. Some colonies also invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in computerized milking systems for their dairy operations, computerized systems for feeding and raising hogs, or even in livestock processing plants.
Groups of Mennonites migrated from the East Coast 
of the United States in search of rural farmland. Geographer Dawn Bowen traced the migration of Mennonites, ﬁ  nding 
their desire to farm in rural areas leading them to the north-ern reaches of Alberta, Canada, to turn forestlands into farmlands and as far away as Bolivia to ﬁ  nd a place where they can farm, form their own schools, and practice their religion without pervasive pressures from popular culture. Rurality enables local cultures to deﬁ  ne their own space, to create a place, town, or rural landscape that reﬂ  ects their 
values, and to practice customs relatively unfettered.
Historically, the economic activities of American 
Indian tribes, such as whale or bison hunting, salmon ﬁ  sh-
ing, or growing wild rice, were the focal point of daily life, and numerous customs and festivals revolved around it. In the early 1800s in North America, Plains Indians tribes migrated during the year based on the bison; they made tools, shelter, and clothing out of the bison, and held dances and ceremonies that surrounded the bison hunt. When a local culture discontinues its major economic activity, it faces the challenge of maintaining the customs that depended on the economic activity and, in turn, sustaining its culture. T oday, when a local culture decides to reengage in a traditional economic activity or other cultural custom, it can no longer decide in isolation. The tribe must navigate through varying opinions among its members, limitations imposed by governments, and perceptions of other cultures.
The Makah American Indians
In the late 1990s, the Makah American Indians of Neah Bay, Washington, did what environmentalists considered unthinkable: they reinstated the whale hunt. The Makah hunted whales for 1500 years, but the United States gov-ernment stopped them in the 1920s because the gray whale had become endangered. In 1994, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) removed the east-ern North Paciﬁ  c gray whale from the endangered list.
In 1999, when the Makah reinstated the whale hunt, 
tribal members interviewed by journalists spoke to their traditional culture as their reason for returning to the whale hunt (Fig. 4.6). They needed to return to their past,  How Are Local Cultures Sustained? 119

they said, to understand their ancestors, to re-create and 
solidify their local culture. In the midst of a popular cul-ture onslaught, the Makah sought refuge in their past.
Although the Makah wanted to hunt whales as their 
ancestors did, their 1999 hunts took place in a completely different context than that of a century before. This time, the Makah hunted whales under the watchful eye of the International Whaling Commission; they faced numer-ous protests by Green Peace and local environmentalists; and they found themselves in federal court with the George W. Bush administration on their side supporting the reinstatement of the whale hunt.
The Makah wanted to hunt with their traditional 
canoes and harpoons because they wanted to hunt as the tribe’s elders and ancestors did. However, in the context of the twentieth and twenty-ﬁ  rst centuries, the choice of tools for the Makah’s hunt was not up to them alone. Actors at the regional, national, and global scale inﬂ  uenced not only 
whether the Makah could hunt whales but also the methods they used in their hunt. The International Whaling Commission dictated that the Makah hunt gray whales with a.50 caliber riﬂ  e, arguing the riﬂ  e would kill the whale more quickly and humanely than the harpoons their ancestors used. In May 1999 the Makah hunted and killed a gray whale, using a.50 caliber riﬂ  e. Soon after, the Makah whale hunt was put on hold, as cases calling for a cessation of the hunt made their way through the courts. In 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court decided the Makah must submit a waiver request of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and in 2005 the Makah did so. As of April 2011, the Makah’s request was still under review by the Northwest Regional Ofﬁ  ce of NOAA.
American Indians are not the only Americans look-
ing to the customs of their ancestors to reinvigorate their local cultures. Throughout the rural United States, small towns were built by immigrants from Europe, and many local cultures have deﬁ  ned entire small towns as places to maintain their culture and to teach others about their cus-toms and beliefs.
Little Sweden, U.S.A.
The residents of Lindsborg, Kansas, proclaim their town Little Sweden, U.S.A. Geographer Steven Schnell asked why a town of 3300, which a few decades ago had little or no sign of Swedishness on its landscape, transformed itself into a place where Swedish culture is celebrated every day in gift stores on Main Street and in buffets in restaurants (Fig. 4.7).
Cynics would argue the reason is purely economic, but 
there is more to it than that. Certainly, Lindsborg beneﬁ  ts 
economically from tourists who ﬂ  ock to buy Swedish trinkets and celebrate Swedish festivals. Nonetheless, as Schnell found on a daily basis the people of Lindsborg beneﬁ  t from 
promoting a sense of a shared history and a common place in this world. In the 1930s, the townspeople shared stories about the roles of Swedes in American history and the importance of their Swedishness to Lindsborg. From that base, the townspeople began to celebrate their Swedish heritage in the 1950s, highlighting the “everyday existence” (the local cul-ture) of the Swedes who immigrated to Lindsborg. During festivals today, the townspeople, whether Swedish or not, dress up in the peasant clothes Swedish immigrants wore in the 1800s. Geographer James Shortridge refers to this as neolocalism, seeking out the regional culture and reinvigo-rating it in response to the uncertainty of the modern world.
The Makah, the Hutterites, and the people of 
Lindsborg have something in common: each is inundated with a pulsating popular culture that challenges their place in the world. Each has chosen to maintain or reconnect with its local culture. For the Hutterites, the goal is to maintain what they have, to adopt only those technologies that advance their agricultural pursuits and ban those that chal-lenge their religion. Central concerns for the Makah include thinking in their own language, embracing their history, and coming to know who they are despite what others have done to subvert their identity. The people of Lindsborg seek to celebrate the Swedish immigrants who made the place unique and connect with others around them.
Urban Local Cultures
Some local cultures have successfully built a world apart, a place to practice their customs, within a major city by con-structing tight-knit ethnic neighborhoods. Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn, New Y ork, and Italian Americans in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts, maintain their dis-tinct local cultures in urban environments.
Runners of the New Y ork City Marathon can see the 
ethnic neighborhoods of New Y ork City’s boroughs ﬁ  rst-
hand. Running through Brooklyn, they pass through a predominantly Mexican neighborhood full of Mexican ﬂ ags and mariachi bands, followed in sharp contrast by a 
Hasidic Jewish neighborhood with streets lined with men and boys on one side and women and girls on another all dressed in clothes modeled after eighteenth-century Russian and Polish fashions (Fig. 4.8).
In the North End of Boston, the Italian community 
still celebrates the feast days of Italian saints. T welve reli-gious societies, each focusing on an Italian saint, hold festi-vals between June and September. Members of the society march through the North End holding a statue of their saint, collecting money and adorning the saint with it. The Romaband, an Italian band that has been in existence since 1919, leads each society through the streets of the North End. The march ends with a street celebration, including vendors selling everything from fried calamari to hot dogs.
Having their own ethnic neighborhood enables mem-
bers of a local culture in an urban area to set themselves apart and practice their customs. Schools, houses of wor-ship, food stores, and clothing stores all support the aesthet-ics and desires of members of the local culture. The greatest 120 Chapter 4  Local Culture, Popular Culture, and Cultural Landscapesc04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 120  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 120  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
challenge to local cultures in cities is the migration of mem-
bers of the popular culture or another local culture or ethnic group into their neighborhood. The local cultures in Brooklyn and the North End work to maintain their culture and customs as young artists and professionals move into their respective neighborhoods. Rents and housing costs are climbing in each neighborhood, and the cultural landscapes are starting to reﬂ  ect the neighborhood’s new residents. A new arts community is inundating the Hasidic neighbor-hood of Brooklyn called Williamsburg. T oday, you will ﬁ  nd 
art galleries, artistically painted old warehouses converted into residences, and even a new brewery. In Boston’s North End, young professionals are taking advantage of the neigh-borhood’s favorable location, choosing apartments in the North End so they can walk to their jobs in the city center. T oday, you will ﬁ  nd apartments being renovated to appeal to the North End’s newest residents.Local Cultures and Cultural Appropriation
Local cultures, whether rural or urban, often ﬁ  nd them-
selves trying to keep their customs for themselves, to pre-vent others from appropriating their customs for eco-nomic beneﬁ  t. Anthropologists and geographers have 
studied how others are using local cultural knowledge, customs, and even names. For example, the estate of Crazy Horse (a Lakota Indian leader) sued a brewery that produced Crazy Horse beer.
The process through which something (a name, a 
good, an idea, or even a person) that previously was not regarded as an object to be bought or sold becomes an object that can be bought, sold, and traded in the world market is called commodiﬁ  cation. One need look no 
further than eBay to see commodiﬁ  cation. Newspapers 
frequently report on bizarre objects, such as a wafﬂ  e

Lindsborg, Kansas
Lindsborg, Kansas, founded by Swedish Luther-
ans in 1869, has remade itself in recent decades as “Little Sweden, U.S.A.” Swedish gift shops, restaurants, and ethnic festivals, along with faux-Swedish storefronts, all attract visitors interested in the Swedish American heritage. Here you see a Dala horse, a traditional Swedish folk craft that has been adopted as the town symbol. Note, too, the Swedish and American ﬂ ags ﬂ  ying in the background. Most visitors to 
the town assume one of two things: either the town is an island of nineteenth-century culture passed on unchanged for generations, or it is a crock of Disneyesque fakery cooked up to draw in gullible tourists. The fascination of ﬁ  eldwork 
is that it undermines any such simpliﬁ  cations. I 
found ethnicity here to be complex, quirky, ever-changing, and very much a part of the people’s lives. Swedishness in Lindsborg has been invented and reinvented time and time again through the decades, as people con-stantly look for answers to that most basic of questions: who am I?

purportedly half eaten by President Barack Obama, 
being commodiﬁ  ed in Internet space.
Commodiﬁ  cation affects local cultures in numerous 
ways. First, their material culture, their jewelry and clothing, their food and games, can be commodiﬁ  ed by themselves or by nonmembers. Similarly, their nonmaterial culture, their religion, language, and beliefs, can be commodiﬁ  ed, often by nonmembers selling local spiritual and herbal cures for ail-ments. Local cultures may be commodiﬁ  ed as a whole, with tourist buses “observing” the Amish culture of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, or trekking with “traditional” Nepalese guides on spiritual journeys through the Himalayas.
When commodiﬁ  cation occurs, the question of 
authenticity follows. When local cultures or customs are commodiﬁ  ed, usually one image or experience is typecast 
as the “authentic” image or experience of that culture, and it is that image or experience that the tourist or buyer desires. However, local cultures are dynamic, and places and people change over time. T o gain an “authentic” sense of place, people need to experience the complexity of a place directly rather than the stereotype of a place. An “authentic” local culture does not ﬁ  t into a single experi-
ence or image; rather, an “authentic” local culture is one that is complex and not stereotyped.
The act of stereotyping local culture is quite confusing 
for the members of the local culture because rarely is there consensus that all things must be done in one traditional way. T ourists in Lancaster County, for example, may be dis-appointed to see some Amish driving tractors across their ﬁ elds. European, Canadian, American, or Australian trek-
kers in Nepal desire the same “authentic” experience that a travel pamphlet shows when trekking across the Himalayas.

Running through the Hasidic Jewish neighborhood in Williamsburg, Brooklyn was striking: even before noticing the traditional dress of the neighborhood’s residents, I noticed the c rowd 
was much quieter—the people were not yelling, they were clapping and quietly cheering.”c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 122  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 122  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
Authenticity of Places
During the process of colonization, Europeans tagged the 
cultures they encountered as either savage or mystic. “Authentic” tourist destinations are designed to exploit the mystical in local cultures. A South African theme park, The Lost City (built on the site of the resort Sun City), capitalizes on mystical images of Africa described in a legend, thereby “freez-
ing” the continent to a time that never existed (Fig. 4.9).
A local culture need not be “mystical” in order to cre-
ate an authentic place. The city of Branson, Missouri, is capitalizing on a local culture in the Ozarks that melds a number of people and perceptions in one place so that tour-ists can consume the place. Geographer Johnathan Bascom studied the processes by which the city of Branson has effec-tively tapped its local customs, such as food preferences, his-tory, and music, to create an “authentic” identity for Branson that sets it apart from neighboring towns. Branson becomes “authentic,” and surrounding towns that try to capitalize on their rural, country heritage become “copies.”
Guinness and the Irish Pub Company
Theme parks and entertainment venues overtly choose a stereotype and perpetuate it, but a discerning tourist or consumer may be aware of what is occurring. Often, the act of corporations commodifying the mystique of local cultures to drive proﬁ  ts is less obvious to the consumer. The Guinness Brewing Company of Dublin, Ireland, cre-ated a business plan nearly 20 years ago aimed at capital-izing on the global mystique of the traditional Irish pub. Guinness saw the sales of its stout beer declining in Ireland and the United Kingdom and decided to go global.
Guinness formed a partnership with the Irish Pub 
Company, which has ofﬁ  ces in Dublin, Atlanta, the United Arab Emirates, and Australia. The Irish Pub Company studied traditional Irish pubs and created ﬁ  ve 
Irish pub prototypes—including Irish Country Cottage, Victorian Dublin, traditional pub, Gaelic (based on what pubs would have looked like had they existed over 2000 years ago in Ireland), and Irish Brewery. For exam-ple, a hotel owner in Naples, Florida, or a businessper-son in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (Fig. 4.10) works  How Are Local Cultures Sustained? 123

to choose the pub type. The speciﬁ  cations are sent to Ireland, and the pub itself is built in Ireland and shipped abroad. Along with the pub, the Irish Pub Company provides food recommendations, training, music sug-gestions, and notably, Irish bartenders trained in their Dublin “pub school.” The Irish Pub Company also sells bric-a-brac (Irish antiques and reproductions) to give the place the feel of an Irish pub. Of course, every pub has Guinness on tap. All of these components create  Figure 4.11

As I walked through the streets of town, I noticed the color-ful inns and houses of the older town.

Boulevard. The “authentic” Irish pub in “authentic” New Y ork in the “Disneyﬁ  ed” Las Vegas is one we can chew on for a while.
The commodiﬁ  cation of local customs freezes cus-
toms in place and time for consumption, with claims of “authenticity” abounding. The search for “authentic” local cultures implies an effort to identify peoples who are seemingly untouched by change or external inﬂ  u-
ence. However, all local cultures (rural and urban) are dynamic, and all have been touched by external inﬂ  u-
ences throughout their existence (Fig. 4.12). The search for an “authentic” local culture merely perpetuates myths about local cultures. Members of local cultures are constantly renegotiating their place in this world and making sense of who they are in the midst of the popular culture onslaught.
What is the last place you went to or the last product you purchased that claimed to be “authentic?” What are the challenges of defending the authenticity of this place or product while refuting the authenticity of other similar places or products?HOW IS POPULAR CULTURE DIFFUSED?
Extraordinary changes have occurred since 1900 in 
the time it takes for people, innovations, and ideas to dif-fuse around the globe. The innovation of agriculture took nearly 10,000 years to diffuse around the world. In much more recent times, the diffusion of developments such as the printing press or the Industrial Revolution was mea-sured over the course of 100 years or more.
During the twentieth century, however, the pace of 
diffusion shrank to months, weeks, days, and in some cases even hours. Simultaneously, the spatial extent of diffusion has expanded, so that more and more parts of the Earth’s surface are affected by ideas and innovations from faraway places. For example, the social networking site Facebook, which Mark Zuckerberg launched in 2004, passed 500 mil-lion subscribers worldwide in 2010 and adds many new members each day. Canada grew from 2 million to 7 mil-lion Facebook subscribers in 2007, and by 2010, had over 15 million subscribers, accounting for 45.48 percent of the population. With enough subscribers to be the third most populated country in the world, and with instant communi-cation, news travels quickly through the Facebook network.
The map of Facebook users (Fig. 4.13) highlights 
the interconnectedness of individuals around the world, and it also points out the lack of interconnection between c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 126  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 126  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401

individuals in China and North Korea with the rest of the 
world via this social media tool. In 2009, China banned Facebook, T witter, and Google. Only about one-third of China’s 1.3 billion people have Internet access. Chinese who want to use Facebook have to use proxy servers to get around the government’s ban. Chinese social networks have grown in place of Facebook. In 2011, the social net-work Renren boasted 165 million Chinese users.In 2005 and 2006, Chinese entrepreneur Wang Xing 
launched the Chinese social network Xiaonei (“on cam-pus”), which copied Facebook down to the color scheme. Wang sold Xiaonei in 2006 for $4 million. Oak Paciﬁ  c 
Interactive got a steal, as the company is estimated to be worth several billion dollars today. They renamed the site Renren, which means “everybody” (Fig. 4.14). Renren is not merely a copy of Facebook, however. Renren is credited

with innovating social gaming and advertising. In fact, the 
popular Facebook game FarmVille launched a year after HappyFarmer launched on Renren. Advertisers, including Lay’s, pay to place their products in Renren’s games. In HappyFarmer, a player can plant Lay’s potatoes and take them to a Lay’s potato chip factory.
China allows Renren and its competitor, Kaixin001, 
to operate because they have agreed to the political cen-sorship mandated by the Chinese government. For exam-ple, according to Fast Company, Renren censors “a range of sensitive keywords, including terms related to the Dalai Lama, the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and Chinese dissidents including 2010 Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo.” Renren users report that they receive a warning message when they update their status or post a comment that is censored by Renren.
Controlling information ﬂ  ow is increasingly difﬁ  cult 
in China, and many argue that despite being censored, Renren and its competitors allow for freer ﬂ  ow of ideas 
than previously possible in communist China. 
T ransportation and communication technologies 
have altered distance decay. No longer does a map with a bull’s-eye surrounding the hearth of an innovation describe how quickly the innovation will diffuse to areas around it (Fig. 4.15 top). Rather, what geographer David Harvey called time–space compression explains how quickly innovations diffuse and refers to how interlinked two places are through transportation and communica-tion technologies (Fig. 4.15 bottom).
In the past few decades, major world cities have 
become much closer to each other as a result of modern 
technologies, including airplanes, high-speed trains, express-ways, wireless connections, fax machines, e-mail, and tele-phone. Places that lack transportation and communications technologies are now more removed from interconnected places than ever. All of the new technologies create the infrastructure through which innovations diffuse. Because the technologies link some places more closely than others, ideas diffuse through interconnected places rapidly rather than diffusing at constant rates across similar distances.
Hearths of Popular Culture
Popular culture diffuses hierarchically in the context of time–space compression, with diffusion happening most rapidly across the most compressed spaces. As we saw in the last section, even local customs practiced for centuries in one place can be swept up into popular culture. How does a custom, idea, song, or object become part of popular cul-ture? It is relatively easy to follow the communications, transportation, and marketing networks that account for the diffusion of popular culture, but how do we ﬁ  nd the 
hearths of popular culture, and how do certain places estab-lish themselves as the hearths of popular culture? Figure 4.15a, b
Distance Decay and Time–Space Compression. With 
distance decay, the likelihood of diffusion decreases as time and distance from the hearth increases. With time–space compres-sion, the likelihood of diffusion depends on the connectedness (in communications and transportation technologies) among places.

Establishing a Hearth
All aspects of popular culture—music, sports, television, 
and dance—have a hearth, a place of origin. T ypically, a hearth begins with contagious diffusion: developers of an idea or innovation may ﬁ  nd they have followers who dress as they do or listen to the music they play. A multitude of American musical groups (REM, Hootie and the Blowﬁ  sh, 
Vertical Horizon) began as college bands or in college towns. They play a few sets in a campus bar or at a campus party and gain followers. The group starts to play to bars and campuses in nearby college towns, and soon they sell self-made compact discs at their concerts.
Bands that begin on college campuses or in college 
towns and build from their base typically follow the path of building a hearth for their sound’s diffusion ﬁ  rst through 
contagious diffusion and then through hierarchical diffu-sion. College towns like Athens, Georgia, Burlington, Vermont, Seattle, Washington, and Charlottesville, Virginia, are the perfect nesting spaces for new bands. The Dave Matthews Band created and perfected their sound in Charlottesville, Virginia, in the early 1990s. Lead singer and guitarist Dave Matthews was born in South Africa and landed in Charlottesville as a young adult after living in Johannesburg, New Y ork, and London (Fig. 4.16).
Matthews was a bartender at Miller’s in Charlottesville 
when he met Ross Hoffman, a local songwriter who men-tored Matthews in song writing. The Dave Matthews Band was formed when Matthews invited Carter Beuford (drums), LeRoi Moore (saxophone, who died in 2008), Stefan Lessard (bass), and Boyd Tinsley (violin) to join him in creating a demo of some of his songs. The Dave Matthews Band’s ﬁ  rst live show was in Charlottesville on Earth Day in April 1991. The band played bars throughout the Charlottesville area from 1991 through 1993. Manager Coran Capshaw followed the path of diffusion carved by the Grateful Dead and Phish, through a grassroots cam-paign of word of mouth (contagious diffusion).
Hierarchical diffusion of the band soon followed, 
through the hierarchy of college towns in the United States (Fig. 4.17). The Dave Matthews Band played 200 nights a year in fraternities, sororities, bars, and clubs throughout the American Southeast, following the same circuit as college band Hootie and the Blowﬁ  sh. The 
band encouraged fans to record their music and send it to friends, helping to establish audiences for the band in college towns far removed from Charlottesville.
Their ﬁ  rst album, released in 1993, was on the 
band’s own independent label. It hit the college charts, and a union with RCA soon followed with their second album, Under the T able and Dreaming, released in 1994. As 
Entertainment magazine explained in 1995, “By playing nearly 200 gigs a year and releasing their own CDs, they built up such a zealous following that when Under the T able entered the album chart at No. 34, neither MTV nor most of America had even heard of them.” The band’s ﬁ rst video was not released until three months after the 
song “What Would Y ou Say” hit the Billboard charts.
The band became broadly popular after 1995 and 
began playing large arenas throughout the United States and in Australia. The band continues to rely on its fan base for support. Manager Capshaw and the Dave Matthews Band were early adopters of using the Internet to stay connected with fans. T oday, the ofﬁ  cial Dave Matthews 
Band fan club has over 80,000 online members, each of whom pays $35 a year to belong.
The music of groups such as the Dave Matthews 
Band, Phish, Grateful Dead, and Jimmy Buffet also dif-fuses relocationally, as fans follow the musicians along their concert routes, living in their cars and selling tie-died shirts and beaded necklaces out of the backs of their cars in the parking lots of concert venues. The action of following the bands for years (an estimated 500 to 1000 fans traveled to every Grateful Dead concert) leads fans to create their own customs and culture. Like other acts of pilgrimage (see Chapter 7 on religion), environmental effects can be grave. Prior to their ﬁ  nal concert, Phish 
(breaking up for the second time) used their website to plead to fans to leave their beloved rural Vermont as they found it. T oday, Reverb, a nonproﬁ  t organization, helps 
bands, including the Dave Matthews Band, create envi-ronmentally conscious concerts by having bands purchase carbon offset credits for each of their concerts, supporting

Manufacturing a Hearth
The question of whether a college band “makes it” depends greatly on the choices and actions of record pro-ducers and music media corporate giants. Certain corpo-rations, such as Viacom, the parent company of MTV , generate and produce popular culture, pushing innova-tions in popular culture through the communications infrastructure that links them with the rest of the world. Geographer Clayton Rosati studied the infrastructure of MTV and its role in the production of popular culture and geographies of popular culture. In his study, he found that MTV produces popular culture by opening globalized spaces to local culture, thereby globalizing the local. Rosati explained that “MTV’s incorporation of rap music and Hip Hop expressive forms into its pro-duction since 1997” helped produce music celebrities and opened the MTV space to “artists and forms that were often formerly relegated to street corners, block parties and mixtapes—broadening the uniﬁ  cation of 
popular aspirations with the machinery of the industrial production of culture.”
A 2001 documentary produced by PBS entitled 
The Merchants of Cool looks at the roles corporations and marketing agencies play in creating popular culture. By conducting focus groups with teenagers (the main demographic for innovations in popular culture), by amassing enormous databases of what teenagers do and like, by sending “cool hunters” (“cool” kids themselves) out to talk with other “cool” kids about what is “cool,” and by rummaging through teenagers’ bedrooms (as Rosati noted MTV does for casting its reality shows), MTV and marketing companies are creating what is cool, what is new in popular culture. In the process of producing The Merchants of Cool, producers interviewed 
Sharon Lee, one of the founding partners of Look-Look, a research company specializing in youth culture. Lee explained how trends in popular culture are spread from the hearth:
Actually it’s a triangle. At the top of the triangle there’s the innovator, which is like two to three percent of the population. Underneath them is the trend-setter, which we would say is about 17 percent. And what they do is they pick up on ideas that the innovators are doing and they kind of claim them as their own. Underneath them is an early adopter, which is questionable exactly what their percentage is, but they kind of are the layer above mainstream, which is about 80 percent. And what they do is they take what the trend-setter is doing and they make it palatable for mass consumption. They take it, they tweak it, they make it more acceptable, and that’s

 How Is Popular Culture Diffused? 131
when the mass consumer picks up on it and runs with it 
and then it actually kills it.
This description is a perfect story of the hierarchical dif-fusion of traits and trends in popular culture.
With these kinds of infrastructure behind the pro-
duction of popular culture, we may expect popular cul-ture to act as a blanket, evenly covering the globe. Even as popular culture has diffused throughout the world, it has not blanketed the world, hiding all existing local cultures underneath it. Rather, one aspect of popular culture (such as music or food) will take on new forms when it encounters a new locality and the people and local culture in that place. Geographers and anthropol-ogists call this the reterritorialization of popular cul-ture: a term referring to a process in which people start to produce an aspect of popular culture themselves, doing so in the context of their local culture and place, and making it their own.
Reterritorialization of Hip Hop
Hip Hop and rap grew out of the inner cities of New Y ork and Los Angeles during the 1980s and 1990s. Places such as Compton (Los Angeles) and the Bronx and Harlem (New Y ork) came to represent the hearths of Hip Hop. These neighborhoods as well as places in Detroit and Atlanta that later served as the basis for the Midwestern and Southern hearths became the authentic spaces of Hip Hop and rap. Neighborhood venues became the best place to enjoy an authentic perfor-mance, and the lyrics reﬂ  ected the importance of local places to the music itself.
The Hip Hop from these hearths diffused abroad, 
especially to major cities in Europe. MC Solaar (Fig. 4.18), Die Fantastischen Vier, and Jovanotti each made Hip Hop their own by writing music that connected with the youth of their country (France, Germany, and Italy, respectively). As Hip Hop diffused throughout Europe, it mixed with existing local cultures, experiences, and places, reterritori-alizing the music to each locale.
In Southeast Asia, Indonesia serves as a good exam-
ple of the process of reterritorialization. Imported Hip Hop diffused ﬁ  rst to a small group of people in Indonesia; 
then, Indonesians began to create Hip Hop music. Through the creation of their own music, Indonesian Hip Hop artists integrated their local culture with the prac-tices of the “foreign” Hip Hop hearth to create a hybrid that was no longer foreign.
As Hip Hop has diffused and grown, artists have 
addressed the major concerns of their local cultures in their lyrics. Hip Hop artists in the United States wrote about social issues in the 1980s and 1990s, and some wrote about violence, crime, and surviving during the gangsta rap of the 1990s. Some artists write more about having fun and partying. In France and Germany,  Figure 4.18

132 Chapter 4  Local Culture, Popular Culture, and Cultural Landscapes
American Hip Hop music diffused ﬁ  rst to immigrants 
living in major cities. In France, for example, some of the ﬁ  rst Hip Hop artists were African, Arab, and Spanish immigrants writing about the racism they experienced in France.
The results of reterritorialization are seen in the 
ways Hip Hop artists around the world use the texts and music from their own local cultures, national cultures, and libraries to sample (mix) in their music. Hip Hop artists outside of the United States typically write and perform in their own language or dialect with reference to Hip Hop terms used by artists in the United States.
Replacing Old Hearths with New: Beating Out 
the Big Three in Popular Sports
Baseball, football, and basketball are historically the big 
three sports in the United States. During the 1800s and 1900s, they all beneﬁ  ted from advances in transporta-tion technology, communication technology, and insti-tutionalization. First, the railroad interconnected cities across the country, allowing baseball teams to compete and baseball to diffuse. The telegraph enabled newspa-pers to report baseball scores, which added to the sport’s following. In the late 1880s, electric lighting made bas-ketball a nighttime spectator sport, played inside gym-nasiums. The founding of the National Football League in 1920 helped institutionalize (by creating institutions to support it, formalize it, and regulate it) the sport of football, with rules for the game remaining relatively unchanged since then.
During much of the twentieth century, the big three 
dominated sports popular culture. Figures including Mark McGwire, Michael Jordan, and Brett Favre found their ways onto Wheaties boxes and reached icon status. In the last decades of the twentieth century, advertising contracts and corporate sponsorship padded and eventu-ally surpassed the salaries of the biggest sports heroes.
While the big three continued to draw millions of 
fans and huge crowds to their venues, a growing number of alternative sports captured the imagination of young sports fans. Popular ﬁ  lms (including Endless Summer) of 
the 1960s immortalized the freedom of surﬁ  ng. In the 
1970s, sidewalk surﬁ  ng, now known as skateboarding, dif-
fused from its hearth in Southern California. In the 1980s, snowboarding found a following and initially met strong resistance on ski slopes in the United States.
The debut of ESPN’s X Games in 1995 and the pro-
liferation of video games involving extreme sports pro-pelled previously alternative sports into popular culture. Snowboarding debuted as a winter Olympic sport in 1998. Video games sparked interest in the sports for kids who had never shown any interest in sports. T ony Hawk, the famous vert (a skateboarding ramp that looks like an enormous pipe cut in half—also called a halfpipe) skate-boarder, worked with Activision to create several versions of T ony Hawk’s Pro Skater, with average annual sales of $180 million. In 2001, sales relating to video games were higher than the movie industry’s box ofﬁ  ce receipts. That 
same year, baseball took a back seat to skateboarding, with more children under the age of 18 skateboarding than playing baseball.
Extreme sports greats, like T ony Hawk, gain cor-
porate sponsors, create their own brands, and sign lucrative advertising deals. Hawk, who retired from competitive skate boarding in 1999, reportedly still earns more than $12 million a year through his skate-boards and clothing lines, his video games, and his stints as spokesperson for Heinz, Hershey, and Frito-Lay. Hawk combined popular sports with popular music, creating his Boom Boom Huck Jam tour that features famous skateboarders, BMX bike riders, and motorcy-cle stunt drivers, neatly choreographed and enhanced by alternative live music. T ony Hawk, Inc., employs 30 people to oversee Hawk’s branded products, which had sales of over $200 million in 2009.
Advertisers who court the 12–34 age demographic, 
fans looking for athletes who are outside of the excess of major league sports, and fans who desire a sport that is different from their parents’ sport drove the expansion of extreme sports into mainstream popular culture. Marketers and business analysts refer to Hawk as the godfather of extreme sports. He discovered Shaun White as a 7-year-old in a skateboard park and helped White become a professional skateboarder. Shaun White has won more than a dozen medals in the X games for skate-boarding and snowboarding and two gold medals in the Winter Olympics for snowboarding (Fig. 4.19). The cash prizes for winning a professional snowboarding competi-tion are low, and Forbes reports it is rare for skateboard-ers or snowboarders to bring in more than $100,000 a year in prize money.
Shaun White has followed the path carved by T ony 
Hawk. White’s endorsement and product deals with Burton, Red Bull, Oakley, Ubisoft and T arget earn him more than $9 million a year. White invented a snow-boarding trick called the Double McT wist 1260 on a half-pipe that Red Bull spent $500,000 to build in the back country of Silverton, Colorado. White had to helicopter into this top-secret location to practice and develop the trick in preparation for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Forbes named White the top-grossing athlete of the Vancouver Olympics.
Researchers Maureen Smith and Becky Beal have 
studied how MTV’s television show Cribs creates mascu-line identities. They found that in the current economy, “marketing lifestyles and desires is central to selling prod-ucts, which has opened new and multiple masculinity markets.” Marketers use sports to “sell trucks, beer, fast 
c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 132  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 132  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401

food, ﬁ  nancial advice, and a number of other products and 
lifestyles, including fashion and skin care.”
Like new music or other forms of popular culture, 
extreme sports become more popular, mainstream, and 
commodiﬁ  ed. Once that happens, the fan base turns its 
attention to a new extreme sport, and the corporate spon-sors begin to tap into the new popular sport, helping it follow the same path to popular, mainstream, and com-modiﬁ  ed status.
One of the best known recent examples of this 
trend is the popularization of Ultimate Fighting. In the early 1990s, advertising executives and sports promoters drew from a long history of mixed martial arts ﬁ  ghts in 
Brazil to produce a series of ﬁ  ghts in the United States among different martial arts and boxing experts to see who was the best ﬁ  ghter. The new ﬁ  ghts, called mixed martial arts, grew a fan base through live matches and pay per view on cable television. The early mixed martial arts ﬁ  ghts had few rules including no headbutting and no weight classes.
The fan base grew quickly, and by 1993, the 
Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) formed to serve as a professional organization for mixed martial arts (Fig. 4.20). The sport continued to grow during the 1990s, with the establishment of rules over time allot-ments for matches, the institutionalization of promo-tions and marketing, and the growth in popularity of a reality television show called The Ultimate Fighter. The Fight Network reports the UFC has diffused to “over 130 countries, territories, and jurisdictions, reaching 430 million homes worldwide, in 20 different lan-guages.” UFC has deals in China and India to broadcast ﬁ ghts. In China, UFC is working to build a fan base through a Chinese UFC website (ufc.cn) and a Chinese version of The Ultimate Fighter reality show. The rules of the UFC, including 7 weight classes and speciﬁ  cations 
for the ﬁ  ghting arena called “the Octagon” or “the Cage,” have been institutionalized as the basis for ulti-mate ﬁ  ghting worldwide. References to ultimate ﬁ  ght-
ing and ultimate ﬁ  ghters (such as Chuck Liddell’s appearance on HBO’s Entourage) are diffusing into other aspects of popular culture, spreading both the commodi-ﬁ cation and the popularization of the sport.
Identity and the desire to remain outside of popu-
lar culture will continue to spur the creation of extreme sports to rival the big three. In discussing MTV’s pro-duction of culture, Rosati explained that the founda-tion of industrial capitalism is not simply “meeting the existing needs of the public.” Rather, industrial capi-talism demands that corporations continue to produce goods that “become socially desirable.” The need for corporations to create the “new” so that they have something to sell that is “socially desirable” applies to MTV and the music industry, as well as to major sports promoters and marketers. Skateboarding and ultimate fighting will be followed by the next extreme sport and the next, as long as corporations can spur the con-sumption of the new.
Stemming the Tide of Popular Culture—Losing 
the Local?
The assimilation policies practiced by American, Canadian, 
Russian, Australian, and New Zealand governments were ofﬁ cial policies designed for the express purpose of disrupting c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 133  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 133  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
134 Chapter 4  Local Culture, Popular Culture, and Cultural Landscapes
and changing indigenous, local cultures. Western, demo-
cratic governments no longer have ofﬁ  cial policies of assimi-lation. Y et, for people in many local cultures and in regions that are not hearths of popular culture, popular culture itself can feel like a policy of assimilation.
Popular media such as music, television, and ﬁ  lm 
from the United States and the United Kingdom diffuse quickly. American and British products can now be seen and heard around the world. If you turn on the television in Harare, Zimbabwe, you can easily ﬁ  nd reruns of a 
10-year-old American television show, or a contemporary CNN broadcast. If you go to a cinema in Seoul, South Korea, you can choose among several just released American ﬁ  lms shown in English with Korean subtitles.
The inﬂ  uence of Europe, the United States, Japan, 
and South Korea in global popular culture makes many people feel threatened by cultural homogenization. At the global scale, North America, western Europe, Japan, India, and South Korea exert the greatest inﬂ  uence on 
popular culture at present. Each region acts as a major hearth for certain aspects of popular culture. North America inﬂ  uences are mainly in movies, television, 
music, sports, and fast food. Japan’s inﬂ  uences are primar-
ily in children’s television programs, electronic games, and new entertainment technologies. Western Europe’s inﬂ uences are in fashion, television, art, and philosophy. 
South Korea’s inﬂ  uences are in television dramas, movies, and popular music, and India’s inﬂ  uence on popular cul-ture is mainly in movies.
The rapid diffusion of popular culture can cause 
consumers to lose track of the hearth of a good or idea. For example, Americans may think of the Nintendo Wii as an American product because of its popularity through-out the country. The Nintendo Wii, like most video game consoles and games, was created in Japan. Japanese video designer Shigeru Miyamoto, who also created Donkey Kong, Mario Brothers, and the Legend of Zelda, led the design of the interactive Wii for Nintendo.
Japan is known for its innovation in video games, and 
neighboring South Korea has made a mark on popular culture from television to popular music. In 1995, Chinese television stations began broadcasting South Korean tele-vision dramas. The South Korean dramas typically aired late at night, often after midnight, but they quickly gained a large following in China. The Chinese government changed a law that restricted Korean content on television to 15 percent of air time, and in response South Korean popular television dramas took off in China. An entire wave of South Korean popular culture, including televi-sion shows movies, fashions, and music diffused through China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Hallyu (also called Hanryu) are waves of South Korean popular culture that move quickly through Asia and have resulted in signiﬁ  -
cant growth in the South Korean entertainment and tour-ism industries (Fig. 4.21).
Beginning with television dramas and movies, 
Hallyu expanded to music in the early part of this cen-tury. South Korean popular music, known as K-pop, has followed the same path of diffusion. The Chinese gov-ernment allowed Korean band H.O.T . to play in a sta-dium in Beijing in 2002. T oday, K-pop bands including Super Junior (called SuJu) and Girls Generation, K-pop recording artists including Rain and BoA, and Korean movie stars, including Bae Y ong Joon, have fans through-out East Asia, Southeast Asia, and increasingly in the Middle East.
Ironically, South Korea was quite protective of its 
entertainment industry in the post-World War II era, for fear that Japan, which formerly colonized South Korea, would export its entertainment industry to South Korea and overpower South Korea’s entertainment industry. Hallyu has diffused not only to China but also to Japan. In turn, millions of Japanese and Chinese are taking Korean

 How Is Popular Culture Diffused? 135
Field Note
“Just days before the Japanese tsunami in 
2011, I walked out of the enormous Lotte department store in Seoul, South Korea and asked a local where to ﬁ  nd a marketplace with handcrafted goods. She pointed me in the direction of the Insa-dong traditional market street. When I noticed a Starbucks’ sign written in Korean instead of English, I knew I must be getting close to the tradi-tional market. A block later, I arrived on Insa-dong. I found quaint tea shops and boutiques with hand crafted goods, but the market still sold plenty of bulk made goods, including souvenirs like Korean drums, chopsticks, and items sporting Hallyu stars. Posters, mugs, and even socks adorned with the faces of members of Super Junior smiled at the shop-pers along Insa-dong.”

language classes, traveling and studying abroad in South Korea, and adopting South Korean fashions.
A 2009 article in T ourism Geographies describes the 
diffusion and proliferation of Hallyu in Asia:
Having ﬁ  rst penetrated the Chinese mainland, the 
Korean cultural phenomenon of Hallyu, in particu-lar Korean television, has spread throughout the East and South-east of Asia, including Japan, Hong Kong, T aiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines and later even to the Middle East and East Europe. The infatuation with Korean popular culture and celebrities has not stopped at popular media consump-tion but has also led to more general interest in popular music, computer games, Korean language, food, fashion, make-up and appearance, and even plastic surgery.
When popular culture displaces or replaces local culture, it will usually be met with resistance. In response to an inﬂ ux of American and British ﬁ  lms, the French govern-
ment heavily subsidizes its domestic ﬁ  lm industry. French 
television stations, for example, must turn over 3 percent of their revenues to the French cinema. The French gov-ernment also stemmed the tide of American and British music on the radio by setting a policy in the 1990s requir-ing 40 percent of on-air time to be in French. Of the 40 percent, half must be new artists. These policies directly beneﬁ  ted the French Hip Hop industry. By performing in 
French, the new artists received quite a bit of air time on French radio. Through policies and funding, the French government has helped maintain its cultural industries, but in countless other cases, governments and cultural institutions lack the means or the will to promote local cultural productions.
Concern over the loss of local distinctiveness and 
identity is not limited to particular cultural or socio-economic settings. We ﬁ  nd such concern among the dominant societies of wealthier countries, where it is reﬂ ected in everything from the rise of religious funda-
mentalism to the establishment of semiautonomous communes in remote locations. We ﬁ  nd this concern among minorities (and their supporters) in wealthier countries, where it can be seen in efforts to promote local languages, religions, and customs by constructing barriers to the inﬂ  ux of cultural inﬂ  uences from the dominant society. We ﬁ  nd it among political elites in poorer countries seeking to promote a nationalist ide-ology that is explicitly opposed to cultural globaliza-tion. And we ﬁ  nd it among social and ethnic minorities in poorer countries that seek greater autonomy from regimes promoting acculturation or assimilation to a single national cultural norm.
Geographers realize that local cultures will inter-
pret, choose, and reshape the inﬂ  ux of popular culture. c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 135  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 135  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
136 Chapter 4  Local Culture, Popular Culture, and Cultural Landscapes
People interpret individual cultural productions in very 
different ways, depending on the cultural context in which they view them. What people choose to adopt from popu-lar culture, how they reterritorialize it, and what they reject help shape the character and culture of people, places, and landscapes.
Think about your local community (your college campus, your neighborhood, or your town). Determine how your local community takes one aspect of popular culture and makes it your own.
HOW CAN LOCAL AND POPULAR 
CULTURES BE SEEN IN THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE?
The tension between globalized popular culture 
and local culture can be seen in the cultural land-
scape, the visible imprint of human activity on the landscape. Human imprint includes everything from how people have changed and shaped the environment to the buildings, signs, fences, and statues people erect. Cultural landscapes reflect the values, norms, and aes-thetics of a culture. On major roadways in North American towns and suburbs, the landscape is a series of big box stores, gas stations, and restaurants that reflect popular culture (Fig. 4.22). As you drive down one of these roadways, one place looks like the next. Y ou drive past TGIFridays, Applebees, Wal-Mart, T arget, and McDonald’s. Then, several miles down the road, you pass another conglomeration (clustering) of the same stores. Geographer Edward Relph coined the word placelessness to describe the loss of uniqueness 
of place in the cultural landscape to the point that one place looks like the next.
Cultural landscapes begin to blend together, converg-
ing cultural landscapes in three dimensions: (1) particular architectural forms and planning ideas have diffused around the world; (2) individual businesses and products have become so widespread that they now leave a distinc-tive landscape stamp on far-ﬂ  ung places; and (3) the 
wholesale borrowing of idealized landscape images, though not necessarily fostering convergence, promotes a blurring of place distinctiveness.
The global diffusion of the skyscraper provides a 
clear illustration of the ﬁ  rst point—particular architectural

forms and planning ideas have diffused around the world 
(Fig. 4.23). In the second half of the 1800s, with advance-ments in steel production and improved costs and efﬁ  -
ciencies of steel use, architects and engineers created the ﬁ rst skyscrapers. The Home Insurance Building of 
Chicago is typically pointed to as the ﬁ  rst skyscraper. The fundamental difference between a skyscraper and another building is that the outside walls of the skyscraper do not bear the major load or weight of the building; rather, the internal steel structure or skeleton of the building bears most of the load.
From Singapore to Johannesburg and from Caracas 
to T oronto, the commercial centers of major cities are dominated by tall buildings, many of which have been designed by the same architects and engineering ﬁ  rms. 
With the diffusion of the skyscraper around the world, the cultural landscape of cities has been profoundly impacted. Skyscrapers require substantial land clearing in the vicin-ity of individual buildings, the construction of wide, straight streets to promote access, and the reworking of transportation systems around a highly centralized model. Skyscrapers are only one example of the globalization of a particular landscape form. The proliferation of skyscrap-ers in T aiwan, Malaysia, and China in the 1990s marked the integration of these economies into the major players in the world economy (Fig. 4.24). T oday, the growth of skyscrapers in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, signals the world city status of the place.Reading signs is an easy way to see the second dimen-
sion of cultural landscape convergence: the far-ﬂ  ung stamp 
of global businesses on the landscape. Walking down the streets of Rome, you will see signs for Blockbuster and Pizza Hut. The main tourist shopping street in Prague hosts Dunkin’ Donuts and McDonald’s. A tourist in Munich, Germany, will wind through streets looking for the city’s famed beer garden since 1589, the Hofbräuhaus, and will happen upon the Hard Rock Café, right next door (Fig. 4.25). If the tourist had recently traveled to Las Vegas, he may have déjà vu. The Hofbräuhaus Las Vegas, built in 2003, stands across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. The storefronts in Seoul, South Korea, are ﬁ lled with Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, and Outback 
Steakhouses. China is home to more than 3200 KFC res-taurants, and its parent company Yum! controls 40 percent of the fast-food market in China.
Marked landscape similarities such as these can be 
found everywhere from international airports to shop-ping centers. The global corporations that develop spaces of commerce have wide-reaching impacts on the cultural landscape. Architectural ﬁ  rms often specialize in building one kind of space—performing arts centers, medical laboratories, or international airports. Property management companies have worldwide holdings and encourage the Gap, the Cheesecake Factory, Barnes and Noble, and other companies to lease space in all of their holdings.

The third dimension of cultural landscape conver-
gence is the wholesale borrowing of idealized landscape images across the world. As you study the cultural landscape, you may notice landscape features transplanted from one place to another—regardless of whether the landscape fea-ture even “ﬁ  ts.”The strip in Las Vegas, Nevada, represents an 
extreme case of this tendency, with various structures designed to evoke different parts of the planet. The popu-lar Venetian Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas replicates the Italian city of Venice, including canals. The Las Vegas Sands Corporation, a casino developer and owner, built the Venetian Hotel and Casino across the Paciﬁ  c from Las Vegas in Macao in 2007. The port city of Macao was once c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 138  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 138  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401

The borrowing of landscape is not conﬁ  ned to 
grand-scale projects like the Venetian. A more common 
borrowed landscape in North America is the town cen-ter. T own centers popping up in suburbia in North America have a similar look-one that is familiar if you have walked on Main Street, U.S.A. at Disneyland or  Figure 4.25

number of “quaint” historic towns on the eastern sea-board. Each town center is designed to make you think of all things American and to feel immediately “home” in the place.
In less obvious ways, cultural borrowing and mix-
ing is happening all around the world. This idea is behind the global-local continuum concept. This notion emphasizes that what happens at one scale is not independent of what happens at other scales. Human geography is not simply about documenting the differ-ences between places; it is also about understanding the processes unfolding at different scales that produce those differences. What happens in an individual place is the product of interaction across scales. People in a local place mediate and alter regional, national, and global processes, in a process called glocalization. The charac-ter of place ultimately comes out of a multitude of dynamic interactions among local distinctiveness and wider-scaled events and inﬂ  uences.
Cultural Landscapes of Local Cultures
What makes travel interesting for most people is the presence of variety in the cultural landscape. T ravel beyond the tourist sites and the main roads, and one will easily ﬁ  nd landscapes of local cultures, even in wealthy countries including the United States and Canada. By studying local cultural landcapes, you can gain insight into the social structures of local cultures. In everything from the houses to the schools to the churches to the cemeteries, a local cultural landscape reveals its foundation.
Founders and early followers of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints created the Mormon landscape of the American West as they migrated west-ward under persecution and in search of a place where they could practice their religion freely. The Mormon Church began in New Y ork, and then Joseph Smith and his followers moved westward to Independence, Missouri. From there, Mormons migrated westward to present-day Salt Lake City, Utah. The easiest place to see the foundations of the Mormon cultural landscape are in the small towns established by Mormons through-out Utah and stretching into Arizona, Nevada, and Idaho (Fig. 4.27).
Geographers, including Donald Meinig, Richard 
Francaviglia, and Allen Noble, have studied the Mormon landscape and discerned the roots of the Mormon culture in the local landscape. If you drove from Chicago west to Las Vegas and traveled through the rural areas of Nebraska and Utah on your path, you would immediately notice one fundamental difference in the landscape: farmsteads in the plains replaced by farming villages in

the west. In the Great Plains, the Homestead Act encour-
aged farmers to establish single farmsteads where a farm family lived alone on their 160 acres and the nearest neighbor was down the dirt road. In the rural Mormon landscape, early settlers established farming villages where houses clustered together and croplands sur-rounded the outskirts of the village (Fig. 4.28). Clustering houses together in a farming village allowed Mormons to protect each other because the religious followers were experiencing persecution in the East and because the settlers’ fears were raised by stories of Indians attacking villages in the West. Equally importantly, through clus-tering they sought to join together for services in each village’s chapel.

Guest Field Note
Paragonah, Utah
I took this photograph in the village of Paragonah, Utah, in 
1969, and it still reminds me that ﬁ  eldwork is both an art and a science. People who know the American West well may immediately recognize this as a scene from “Mormon Coun-try,” but their recognition is based primarily on their impres-sions of the place. “It is something about the way the scene looks,” they may say, or “it feels like a Mormon village because of the way the barn and the house sit at the base of those arid bluffs.” These are general impressions, but how can one prove that it is a Mormon scene? That is where the science of ﬁ  eld-
work comes into play. Much like a detective investigating a crime scene, or a journalist writing an accurate story, the geographer looks for proof. In this scene, we can spot several of the ten elements that comprise the Mormon landscape. First, this farmstead is not separate from the village, but part of it—just a block off of Main Street, in fact.
Next we can spot that central-hall home made out of brick; then there is that simple, unpainted gabled-roof barn; and 
lastly the weedy edge of a very wide street says Mormon Country. Those are just four clues suggesting that pragmatic Mor-mons created this cultural landscape, and other ﬁ  eldwork soon conﬁ  rmed that all ten elements were present here in Par-agonah. Like this 40-year old photo, which shows some signs of age, the scene here did not remain unchanged. In Paragonah and other Mormon villages, many old buildings have been torn down, streets paved, and the landscape “cleaned up”—a reminder that time and place (which is to say history and geography) are inseparable.

United States and Canada, including symmetrical brick houses that look more similar to houses from the East Coast than to other pioneer houses, wide streets that run due north–south and east–west, ditches for irrigation, poplar trees for shade, bishops storehouses for storing food and necessities for the poor, and unpainted fences. Because the early Mormons were farmers and were clustered together in villages, each block in the town was quite large, allowing for one-acre city lots where a farmer could keep livestock and other farming supplies in town. The streets were wide so that farmers could easily turn a cart and horses on the town’s streets.
The morphology (that is, the size and shape of a 
place’s buildings, streets, and infrastructure) of a Mormon village tells us a lot, and so too, can the shape and size of a local culture’s housing. In Malaysia, the Iban, an indigenous people, live along the Sarawak River in the Borneo region of Malaysia. Each long house is home to an extended family of up to 200 people. The family and the long house function as a community, sharing the rice farmed by the family, supporting each other through frequent flooding of the river (the houses are built on stilts), and working together on the porch that stretches the length of the house. The rice paddies surrounding each long house are a familiar shape and form throughout Southeast Asia, but the Iban long house tells you that you are experiencing a different kind of place-one that reflects a unique local culture.
Focus on the cultural landscape of your college campus. Think about the concept of placelessness. Determine whether your campus is a “placeless place” or whether the cultural landscape of your college reﬂ  ects the unique iden-
tity of the place. Imagine you are hired to build a new stu-dent union on your campus. How could you design the building to reﬂ  ect the uniqueness of your college?

Advances in transportation and communications technology help popular culture dif-fuse at record speeds around the world today. Popular culture changes quickly, offering new music, foods, fashions, and sports. Popular culture envelopes and inﬁ  ltrates local 
cultures, presenting constant challenges to members of local cultures. Some members of local cultures have accepted popular culture, others have rejected it, and still others have forged a balance between the two.
Customs from local cultures are often commodiﬁ  ed, propelling them into popular 
culture. The search for an “authentic” local culture custom generally ends up promot-ing a stereotyped local culture or glorifying a single aspect of that local culture. Local culture, like popular culture, is dynamic, and the pursuit of authenticity disregards the complexity and ﬂ  uidity of cultures.c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 143  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401c04LocalCulturePopularCultureandCulturalLandscapes.indd Page 143  9/15/11  1:02 PM user-f401 F-401F-401
144Identity: Race, Ethnicity, 
Gender, and SexualityCHAPTER
Field Note Building Walls
Traveling on the Indonesian island of 
Bali, I saw a brick-making facility and stopped to visit. Boys and women were building bricks by hand, in the hot sun. I watched young boys scoop wet mud from a quarry by a creek into their wheelbar-rows. They poured the mud into wooden forms. Once the bricks began to dry and harden in the sun, someone had to turn the bricks repeatedly to prevent them from cracking.
The woman in Figure 5.1 worked ten hours a day, six 
days a week, turning, stacking, and restacking bricks to pre-vent them from cracking. For her work, she earned about 45 cents (U.S.) per hour.
More than a century ago, bricks were made this way 
in the United States. Today, the brick-making industry in the United States makes use of a great deal of technol-ogy and robotics to manufacture bricks. Instead of using the sun to bake the bricks, brick-making factories in the United States employ enormous tunnel-shaped kilns. The Mississippi Business Journal described how bricks 
are made in one factory: “Clay and water go in one end of the new 590 foot tunnel kiln and brick pallets will roll out the other end as robots and employees work side by side.”
What hit me harder than the difference in tech-
nology between the two countries is the difference in labor. In Bali, women and boys make bricks. In the United States, the vast majority of brick-makers are men, aided by machines. One company estimated that 98 percent of its operations’ employees in the factory are men. What

makes brick-making a job for women and boys in Bali and a job for men and robots 
in the United States? Does being a brick-maker mean different things in each of 
these places?
Throughout the world, different cultures and societies have different 
ideas about what jobs are appropriate for men and what jobs are appropriate for women. Geographers, especially those who study gender, realize people have created divisions of labor that are gendered. Geographers Mona Domosh and Joni Seager deﬁ  ne gender as “a culture’s assumptions about the differences 
between men and women: their ‘characters,’ the roles they play in society, what they represent.” Divisions of labor are one of the clearest ways in which societ-ies are gendered.
In Bali, brick-making is still done by hand by boys and women. The industry is 
not technologically sophisticated, and bricks are made one by one. Even beyond brick-making facilities, most of the factory jobs in Indonesia and in poorer coun-tries of the world go to women instead of men. Factory managers in these areas often hire women over men because they see women as an expendable labor pool. Researcher Peter Hancock studied gender relations and women’s work in facto-ries in Indonesia and reported, “Research in different global contexts suggests that factory managers employ young women because they are more easily exploited, less likely to strike or form membership organizations, are comparatively free from family responsibilities, and more adept at doing repetitive and delicate tasks associated with assembly line work.”
In many societies in poorer countries, families see young women as ﬁ  nan-
cial supporters of their families. Thus, many women migrate from rural areas and travel to cities or central industrial locales (such as export production zones—EPZs) to produce and earn a wage that is then sent home to support the schooling of their brothers and younger sisters (until these girls are also old enough to leave home and work). In Indonesia and in neighboring Malaysia and the Philippines, many women temporarily migrate to the Middle East to work as domestics: cook-ing, cleaning, and providing childcare in order to send money home to support the family. In the United States, rarely does an oldest daughter migrate to the city to labor in a factory so she can pay for her younger brothers’ schooling.
Although public education in the United States is free and open to boys and 
girls, American society still has gendered divisions of labor. The few women who work in brick-manufacturing facilities in the United States are typically assigned to tasks that require little lifting—such as gluing pieces of the various types of brick the company produces to boards so that salespeople can use them as samples. A long-standing assumption in American society is that work requiring heavy lifting needs to be completed by men and that good-paying, unionized jobs need to go to men because men are the “heads of the household.” Times are changing and gen-dered work is being increasingly challenged, but assumptions about gender still have an impact on the labor market.
Society creates boxes in which we put people and expect them to live. These 
boxes are in a sense stereotypes embodying assumptions we make about what is expected from or assumed about women, men, members of certain races or eth-
nic groups, and people with various sexual preferences. By creating these boxes, society can assign entire professions or tasks to members of certain categories, for example “women’s work,” thereby gendering the division of labor. Places, notably the kitchen of a home or a store in the mall, can also be gendered. People are constantly negotiating their personal identities, ﬁ  nding their ways through 
all the expectations placed on them by the boxes society puts around them, and c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 145  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 145  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

modifying and reinforcing the social relations that create the places where they 
work and live.
Rarely do the social relations that create gendered divisions of labor focus only 
on gender. The social relations in a place also create boxes for other identities. In this chapter, we focus on gender, race, ethnicity, and sexuality. We examine how people and society construct identities, how place factors into identity, and how geography reﬂ ects and shapes power relationships among different groups of people.
Key Questions For Chapter 5
 1. What is identity, and how are identities constructed?
 2. How do places affect identity, and how can we see identities in places?
 3. How does geography reﬂ  ect and shape power relationships among groups?
WHAT IS IDENTITY, AND HOW ARE 
IDENTITIES CONSTRUCTED?
A man gets off the airplane, walks to the baggage car-
ousel to ﬁ  nd his suitcase, and is greeted by dozens of black 
suitcases. He walks to the parking garage to ﬁ  nd his car and sees a sea of black cars that all look the same. The nar-rator intones, “Maintain your identity. Drive a Saab.”
Identities are marketed through cars, clothing, club 
memberships, jewelry, and houses. Advertisements often convey the impression that we can purchase our identity. Y et, identity is much more personal than what we drive, wear, belong to, or where we live. Geographer Gillian Rose deﬁ  nes identity as “how we make sense of ourselves.” 
How do each of us deﬁ  ne ourselves? We construct our own identities through experiences, emotions, connections, and rejections. We work through derivations and delineations to ﬁ  nd an identity that meshes with who and where we are at any given time. An identity is a snapshot, an image of who we are at that moment. Identities are ﬂ  uid, constantly 
changing, shifting, and becoming. Place and space are inte-gral to our identities because our experiences in places and our perceptions of places help us make sense of who we are.
In addition to deﬁ  ning ourselves, we deﬁ  ne others and 
others deﬁ  ne us. One of the most powerful ways to construct an identity is by identifying against other people. T o iden-tify against, we ﬁ  rst deﬁ  ne the “Other,” and then we deﬁ  ne 
ourselves in opposing terms. Edward Said wrote thought-fully about how Europeans, over time, constructed an image of regions that are now commonly called the Middle East and Asia. He described the circumstances that led Europe-ans to deﬁ  ne this area as the “Orient,” a place with suppos-edly mystical characteristics that were depicted and repeated in European art and literature. In a similar vein, geographer James Blaut wrote eloquently about how Europeans came to deﬁ ne Africans and Americans as “savage” and “mystical.” Through these images of the “Other,” which developed during periods of European exploration and colonialism, Europeans deﬁ  ned themselves as “not mystical” or “not sav-
age” and, therefore, as “civilized.” These ideas are still part of our vernacular speech even today, as seen in references to “the civilized world” or a time “before civilization” Phrases such as these invariably carry with them a sense of superior-ity in opposition to an “Other.”
One of the most powerful foci of identity in the mod-
ern world is the state. State nationalism has been such a powerful force that in many contexts people think of them-selves ﬁ  rst and foremost as French, Japanese, or American. Nationalist identities are a product of the modern state sys-tem, so we defer consideration of this form of identity to the chapter focused on the rise of the state system (Chapter 8). But nationalist identities coexist with all sorts of other identities that divide humanity—identities that can trump state nationalism in certain contexts and certain scales of interaction. Language and religion can function as foci of identity, and we will turn to these in the next two chapters. This chapter takes up several other important foundations of identity—those based on race, gender, ethnicity, and sex-uality. We look at issues of identity construction, place, and scale by way of an analysis of race. We examine ethnicity and sexuality as identities that are shaped by and that shape place. Our concluding discussion in this chapter looks at power relationships through the lenses of gender and ethnicity.
Race
Race provides an excellent example of the ways in which geo-graphic context shapes axes of identity. The various “races” to which people refer are the product of ways of viewing minor genetic differences that developed as modern humans spread around the world. The physical attributes that are seen as signiﬁ  cant have changed across time and space. In c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 146  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 146  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 What Is Identity, and How Are Identities Constructed?  147
position was (however shakily) based to the vastness of the 
overseas possessions, covertly (or not so covertly) conveying the idea that if, say, English lords were naturally superior to other Englishmen, no matter: these other Englishmen were no less superior to the subjected natives.
The stories the commoners heard about the “mysti-
cal” and “savage” “Others” fostered feelings of superiority. One of the easiest ways to deﬁ  ne the “Other” is through skin color because it is visible. Differences in the color of skin, then, became the basis for a fundamental social divide.
What society typically calls a “race” is in fact a com-
bination of physical attributes in a population. Differences in skin color, eye color, and hair color likely result from a long history of adaptation to different environments. Sun-light stimulates the production of melanin, which protects skin from damaging ultraviolet rays; the more melanin that is present, the darker the skin will be. Many believe that this helps to explain why, over the millennia, humans living in low latitudes (closer to the equator, from tropical Africa through southern India to Australia) had darker skins. Another, not incompatible, theory holds that the produc-tion of vitamin D, which is a vitamin necessary to live a healthy life, is stimulated by the penetration of ultraviolet rays. Over the millennia, natural selection in higher lati-tudes, closer to the North and South Poles, favored those with the least amount of pigmentation. People with less pigmentation could more easily absorb ultraviolet rays, which, in the higher latitudes, are sparse in winter months with the amount of sunlight is lower and less direct. When humans absorb ultraviolet light, their bodies in turn pro-duce vitamin D, which is a necessary nutrient for survival.
Whatever may be said about the link between envi-
ronment and the development of particular physical char-acteristics, it is important to recognize that skin color is not a reliable indicator of genetic closeness. The indigenous peoples of southern India, New Guinea, and Australia, for example, are about as dark-skinned as native Africans, but native Africans, southern Indians, and Aboriginal Austra-lians are not closely related genetically (Fig. 5.3). Thus there is no biological basis for dividing the human spe-cies into four or ﬁ  ve groups based on skin color. Instead, those racial categories are the product of how particular cultures have dominantly viewed skin color.
The racial distinctions used in a place today are 
drawn from categories of skin color that are rooted in the cultural history, power relationships, and politics of a place over the past few centuries. Geographer Benjamin Forest gives us a global overview of racial distinctions:
In Britain, the term “black” refers not only to Afro-Caribbeans and Africans, but also to individuals from the Indian subcontinent. In Russia, the term “black” is used to describe “Caucasians,” that is, people such as Chechens from the Caucasus region. In many parts of Latin America, particularly Brazil, “racial” classiﬁ  cation is really a kind precolonial Africa, lines of division sometimes reﬂ  ected 
differences in skin tones among people whom Europeans all came to view as “black” during the colonial period. Y et modern ways of dividing people into races have become so pervasive that we ﬁ  nd ourselves continually ﬁ  lling out cen-sus forms, product warranty information, surveys, medical forms, and application forms that ask us to “check” a box identifying ourselves by races, for example “white,” “black,” “Asian” (Fig. 5.2). Such practices tend to naturalize and rein-force modern ways of viewing race.
Where did society get the idea that humans fall into dif-
ferent, seemingly unchangeable categories of race? Through-out history, societies in different parts of the world have drawn distinctions among peoples based on their physical characteristics, but many of societies’ modern assumptions about race grew out of the period of European exploration and colonialism. Y et as Benedict Anderson notes, even before the Age of Exploration and colonialism, wealthy Europeans deﬁ ned themselves as superior to those living elsewhere, sug-
gesting that socioeconomic differences can fuel the sense of superiority attached to race known as racism. With the onset 
of the colonial era, however, even the nonwealthy in colo-nizing countries came to deﬁ  ne themselves as superior to the people in the colonies. Anderson explains:
Colonial racism was a major element in that conception of “Empire” which attempted to weld dynastic legitimacy and national community. It did so by generalizing a principle of innate, inherited superiority on which its own domestic

of class placement, in which members of the wealthy upper 
class are generally considered as “white,” members of the middle class as mixed race or Mestizo, and members of the lower class as “black.” Indeed, because racial classiﬁ  cations 
are based on class standing and physical appearance rather than ancestry, “the designation of one’s racial identity need not be the same as that of the parents, and siblings are often classiﬁ  ed differently than one another.”
In each of these cases, and in countless others, peo-
ple have constructed racial categories to justify power, economic exploitation, and cultural oppression.
Race and Ethnicity in the United States
Unlike a local culture or ethnicity to which we may choose to belong, race is an identity that is more often assigned. 
In the words, once again, of Benjamin Forest: “In many respects, racial identity is not a self-consciously con-structed collection of characteristics, but a condition which is imposed by a set of external social and histori-cal constraints.” In the United States, racial categories are reinforced through residential segregation, racialized divisions of labor, and the categories of races recorded by the United States Census Bureau and other government and nongovernmental agencies.
Deﬁ nitions of races in the United States histori-
cally focused on dividing the country into “white” and “nonwhite,” but how these categories are understood has changed over time (Figure 5.4). For example, when immi-gration to the United States shifted from northern and western Europe to southern and eastern Europe in the early twentieth century, the United States government Field Note
“We were traveling in Darwin, Australia, in 1994 and decided to walk away from the modern downtown for a few hours. Darwin is a multicultural city in the midst of a region of Australia that is largely populated by Aboriginals. At the bus stops on the outskirts of the city, Aboriginals reached Darwin to work in the city or to obtain social services only offered in the city. With a language barrier between us, we used hand gestures to ask the man in the white shirt and his son if we could take their picture. Gesturing back to us, they agreed to the picture. Our continued attempts at sign language soon led to much laughter among the people waiting for the next bus.”

and many countries in Central and South America and the 
Caribbean. In our example above, the black person from Brazil who was classiﬁ  ed as “Hispanic” should not have 
been under this deﬁ  nition. The predominant language in Brazil is Portuguese, not Spanish.
In 2000, the United States Census categorized “His-
panic” as an ethnicity rather than a race. In the boxes pro-vided by the United States Census Bureau, a person can now be “White, non-Hispanic,” “White, Hispanic,” “Black, non-Hispanic,” “Black, Hispanic,” and so forth (T able 5.1).
In 2010, the United States Census recognized that 
“Hispanic” excludes people from Latin America who are not native Spanish speakers. The Census also recognized that some people, including United States Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, prefer the term “Latina” or “Latino” to “Hispanic.” In 2010, the United States Cen-sus Bureau described the Hispanic ethnicity as “Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin,” and continued to list Hispanic as an ethnicity and not a race.and the public at large had to redeﬁ  ne what constituted 
“white” so that people with olive-colored skin from the Mediterranean would count as “white.”
As a result of immigration and differences in fertility 
rates, the United States is becoming increasingly “non-white.” At the same time, how Americans deﬁ  ne “race” 
is changing. Before 2000, the United States Census clas-siﬁ ed “Hispanic” as a race. This categorization was cho-
sen because people in Latin America, like North America, represent different races. Before the 2000 census a white person from Venezuela, a black person from Brazil, and a native person from Bolivia were all classiﬁ  ed as “His-panic.” This example demonstrates the arbitrary nature of racial and ethnic classiﬁ  cations. In this example, coming 
from Latin America “trumped” all other identities and the person was deﬁ  ned as “Hispanic.” Hispanic, then, is not a race. It is better deﬁ  ned as an ethnicity. However, the word “Hispanic” means coming from a country where Spanish is the predominant language, including Spain, Mexico,

respondents prefer the term ‘Hispanic,’ 21% prefer the 
term ‘Latino’ and the rest have no preference.”
In the United States, 64 percent of the Hispanic pop-
ulation is of Mexican origin, and 9 percent of people who deﬁ ne themselves as Hispanic are of Puerto Rican descent. 
In the 2000 and 2010 censuses, all persons who deﬁ  ned 
themselves as Hispanic also deﬁ  ned themselves by a racial category. By combining race and ethnicity boxes, statisticians can still separate the American population into “White, non-Hispanic” and “everyone else.” According to the data pro-jections provided after the 2010 Census, the population of “everyone else” will surpass (in numbers) the “White, non-Hispanic” population around in 2042 (T able 5.2).With the evolution in understanding of race and 
ethnicity, it is sometimes difﬁ  cult to choose the right term to describe an individual or group of people. In this chapter and in the rest of the textbook, we use the most precise description as possible. Instead of a generic term “Hispanic,” if we are talking about a group of immigrants from Bolivia, we call the people immigrants from Bolivia. If we discuss a study about Cree Indians in Canada, we describe the Cree tribe, not a generic term First Nations. In general references, we use the term “Hispanic” instead of “Latino” or “Latina” in accordance with a 2008 Pew Research survey. The survey of Americans who deﬁ  ned 
themselves as “Hispanic” or “Latino,” found “36% of

The researchers reported that all ﬁ  ve measures 
showed a decrease in residential segregation for African 
Americans between 1980 and 1990 and another such decrease between 1990 and 2000. A report after the 2010 census found that residential segregation for African Americans peaked in the 1960s and 1970s and declined again between 2000 and 2010. Between 2000 and 2010, residential segregation did increase in fewer than 10 of 102 metropolitan areas with populations of 500,000 or more. In 2010, the most residentially segregated large metropolitan area for African Americans was Milwaukee, Wisconsin (Fig. 5.5).
In 2000, when using an average of all ﬁ  ve measures 
of segregation, the most residentially segregated met-ropolitan area for American Indians and Alaska Natives was Phoenix-Mesa, Arizona, and the least residentially segregated is Oklahoma City. In 2000, the four least resi-dentially segregated metropolitan areas (with at least 3 percent of the population American Indian) were all in Oklahoma.
Grouping Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific 
Islanders, researchers of the 2000 report found 30 Residential Segregation
Racism has affected the distribution of African Ameri-cans, American Indians, and others throughout the history of the United States. During the past century, some of the most dramatic geographic impacts of racism could be found at the neighborhood scale. Historically, states, cities, and towns passed laws that promoted resi-dential segregation by disallowing the migration of cer-tain racial groups into particular neighborhoods. Laws passed during and after the civil rights movement of the 1960s in the United States made it illegal to legislate residential segregation. Despite these changes, many cities in the United States remain strongly segregated along racial lines.
Geographers Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton 
deﬁ ned residential segregation as the “degree to which 
two or more groups live separately from one another, in different parts of the urban environment.” Massey and Denton deﬁ  ned different kinds of residential segregation in a 1988 article, explaining that residential segregation is complex because:
groups may live apart from one another and be “segre-gated” in a variety of ways. Minority members may be distributed so that they are overrepresented in some areas and underrepresented in others, varying on the charac-teristic of evenness. They may be distributed so that their exposure to majority members is limited by virtue of rarely sharing a neighborhood with them. They may be spatially concentrated within a very small area, occu-
pying less physical space than majority members. They may be spatially centralized, congregating around the urban core, and occupying a more central location than the majority. Finally, areas of minority settlement may be tightly clustered to form one large contiguous enclave, or 
be scattered widely around the urban area.
A special report issued by the United States Census 
Bureau in 2002 statistically analyzed, charted, and mapped residential segregation in metropolitan areas of the coun-try, using the following ﬁ  ve statistical measurements of 
segregation: evenness, exposure, concentrated, central-ized, and clustered. These ﬁ  ve measurements directly cor-respond to the ﬁ  ve types of segregation outlined by Massey 
and Denton.
In the 2002 Census Bureau report, the authors 
reported on the levels of residential segregation in metro-politan areas of the United States between 1980 and 2000. They found that overall residential segregation by race/ethnicity is on the decline. For each of the four identities they researched—American Indians and Alaska Natives; Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Paciﬁ  c Islanders; Black/
African Americans; and Hispanics/Latinos—they calcu-lated ﬁ  ve statistical measures of residential segregation.

accounting for at least 3 percent of the total urban popula-

The numbers and maps produced by the Census 
Bureau based on 2000 data and from Brookings Insti-tute demographer William Frey based on the 2010 data show the outcomes of a variety of stories, but they do not tell us the stories. Why does residential segregation persist in some places and not in others? In some of the most segregated cities, people know where the “other” lives and will purposefully choose to live in neighbor-hoods with people like themselves instead. Real estate agents and community leaders may consciously or sub-consciously direct people to their “own” neighborhoods (blockbusting and redlining are discussed in Chapter 9). In some cities, race is related to class, making it difﬁ  -
cult to afford a higher class neighborhood that is also populated by another race. In other cities, people may choose to live in a blighted neighborhood because it is their neighborhood, one they have helped create and that reﬂ  ects their culture.metropolitan areas with at least 3 percent of the popu-lation fitting one of these identities. Based on calcu-lations for all five statistics of residential segregation, the most residentially segregated metropolitan area for Asians/Pacific Islanders was San Francisco, followed by New Y ork and Los Angeles. The data and maps change depending on how statistics are calculated. A report after the 2010 census examined Asian segrega-tion using a dissimilarity index with white populations in 102 large metropolitan areas. The report based on the 2010 census data found Buffalo/Niagra Falls to be the most segregated for Asians (not including Pacific Islanders) based on the dissimilarity index and consid-ering all large metropolitan areas, not only those with at least 3% of the population being Asian.
Baltimore, Maryland (Fig. 5.6) is one of the more res-
identially integrated cites in the United States for Asians and also for Hispanics/Latinos. The report based on the 2000 census found that the cities with the highest number of Hispanic residents experienced the greatest degree of residential segregation. They focused their analysis on the 36 large metropolitan areas with an Hispanic population

 What Is Identity, and How Are Identities Constructed?  153
New immigrants to a city often move to low-income 
areas that are being gradually abandoned by older immi-
grant groups. This process is called succession. In New 
Y ork, Puerto Ricans moved into the immigrant Jewish neighborhood of East Harlem in the early twentieth cen-tury, successively assuming a dominant presence in the neighborhood. With the inﬂ  ux of Puerto Ricans, new 
names for the neighborhood developed, and today it is frequently called Spanish Harlem or El Barrio (meaning “neighborhood” in Spanish). As the Puerto Rican popu-lation grew, new storefronts appeared, catering to the Puerto Rican population, such as travel agencies (special-izing in ﬂ  ights to Puerto Rico), specialty grocery stores, 
and dance and music studios.
Like the immigrant ﬂ  ow from Puerto Rico, the 
large-scale immigrant ﬂ  ow from the Dominican Repub-
lic that began in 1965 resulted in a distinct neighborhood and cultural landscape. Dominican immigrants landed in the Washington Heights/Inwood neighorhood of upper Manhattan, a neighborhood previously occupied by immigrant Jews, African Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans. Miyares reports that although a Jewish cultural landscape persists, including a Jewish university, syna-gogues, and Jewish delicatessens, the cultural landscape of Washington Heights is clearly Dominican—from store signs in Spanish to the presence of the colors of the Dominican ﬂ  ag (Fig. 5.7).
New Y ork is unique because of the sheer number and 
diversity of its immigrant population. The city’s cultural landscape reﬂ  ects its unique population. As Miyares explains:
Since the overwhelming majority of New York City’s population lives in apartments as opposed to houses, it is often difﬁ  cult to discern the presence of an ethnic group by 
looking at residential housescapes. However every neigh-borhood has a principal commercial street, and this is often converted into an ethnic main street. It is commonly through business signs that immigrants make their pres-ence known. Names of businesses reﬂ  ect place names from the home country or key cultural artifacts. Colors of the national ﬂ  ag are common in store awnings, and the ﬂ  ags 
themselves and national crests abound in store décor. Key religious symbols are also common. Immigrants are so prevalent and diverse that coethnic proprietors use many kinds of visual clues to attract potential customers.
Throughout the process, new immigrants need not 
change the facades of apartment buildings to reﬂ  ect their 
culture. Instead, many new immigrants focus their atten-tion on the streetscapes, creating businesses to serve their community and reﬂ  ect their culture.
The Caribbean presence in the city is so strong that 
some people think that new Hispanic migrants to New Y ork City simply have to adapt to Caribbean cultural Identities Across Scales
The way we make sense of ourselves in an increas-ingly globalized world is complex. We have different identities at different scales: individual, local, regional, national, and global. At the individual scale, we may see ourselves as a daughter, a brother, a golfer, or a student. At the local scale, we may see ourselves as members of a community, leaders of a campus organization, or resi-dents of a neighborhood. At the regional scale, we may see ourselves as Southerners, as north Georgians, as Atlantans, as Yankees living in the South, or as migrants from another region of the world. At the national scale, we may see ourselves as American, as college students, or as members of a national political party. At the global scale, we may see ourselves as Western, as educated, as relatively wealthy, or as free.
One way to view an individual’s various identities is 
to treat them as nested, one inside of the other; the appro-priate identity is revealed at the appropriate scale. In this vein, each larger territorial extent of geographic space has its own corresponding set of identities. T oday, more geog-raphers see identities as ﬂ  uid, intertwined, and context 
dependent rather than as neatly nested. Identities affect each other in and across scales, and the ways places and peoples interact across scales simultaneously affect identi-ties within and across scales.
The Scale of New York City
One way scale affects identity is by helping to shape what is seen—what identity is apparent to others and to our-selves at different scales. T o demonstrate this idea, we can shift our focus from residential segregation in all large metropolitan areas in North America to one enor-mous metropolitan area, New Y ork City. New Y ork has a greater number and diversity of immigrants than any other city in the United States. At the scale of New Y ork, we can see how identities change so that we are no longer simply Hispanic (as the Census enumerates us); we are Puerto Rican or Mexican or Dominican from a certain neighborhood.
The point is that the people in New Y ork are much 
more diverse than the box on census forms labeled “Hispanic” would suggest. In a chapter called “Chang-ing Latinization of New Y ork City,” geographer Inés Miyares highlights the importance of Caribbean cul-ture to New Y ork. The majority of New Y ork’s 2.2 mil-lion “Hispanics” are Puerto Ricans and Dominicans (together accounting for over 65 percent of Hispanics in the city). As the majority Hispanic culture, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans have had a profound impact on New Y ork’s cultural landscape.c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 153  21/11/11  11:21 AM user f-404c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 153  21/11/11  11:21 AM user f-404 user f-404user f-404
and neighborhoods. The overarching category “His-
panic” tells us even less about diversity when one moves up to the scale of the United States, but as long as that category persists in the Census, people will be encouraged to think about it as a meaningful basis for understanding social differences.
Recall the last time you were asked to check a box for your race. Does that box factor into how you make sense of yourself individually, locally, regionally, nationally, and globally? What impact might it have on how other people view you?norms. Miyares cautions, however, that not all Hispanics in the city are categorically assimilated into the Caribbean culture. Rather, the local identities of the Hispanic popu-lations in New Y ork vary by “borough, by neighborhood, by era, and by source country and entry experience.” Since 1990, the greatest growth in the Hispanic population of New Y ork has been Mexican. Mexican migrants have set-tled in a variety of ethnic neighborhoods, living alongside new Chinese immigrants in Brooklyn and Puerto Ricans in East Harlem. The process of succession continues in New Y ork, with Mexican immigrants moving into and succeeding other Hispanic neighborhoods, sometimes producing tensions between and among the local cultures.
In New Y ork and in speciﬁ  c neighborhoods such as 
East Harlem, the word Hispanic does little to explain the 
diversity of the city. At these scales, different identities are claimed and assigned, identities that reﬂ  ect local cultures Guest Field Note
Washington Heights, New York
It is a warm, humid September morning, and the 
shops along Juan Pablo Duarte Boulevard are already bustling with customers. The Dominican ﬂ  ag waves 
proudly from each corner’s trafﬁ  c signal. Calypso and salsa music ring through the air, as do the voices of Dominican grandmothers negotiating for the best prices on fresh mangos and papayas. The scents of fresh empanadas de yuca and pastelitos de pollo waft from street vendor carts. The signage, the music, the language of the street are all in Span-ish and call out to this Dominican community. I am not in Santo Domingo but in Washington Heights in upper Manhattan in New York City.
Whenever I exit the “A” train at 181st Street and 
walk toward St. Nicholas Avenue, renamed here Juan Pablo Duarte Boulevard for the founding father of the Dominican Republic, it is as if I have boarded a plane to the island. Although there are Dominicans living in most neighborhoods of New York’s ﬁ  ve boroughs, 
Washington Heights serves as the heart and soul of the community. Dominicans began settling in Washington Heights in 1965, replacing previous Jewish, African American, and Cuban residents through processes of invasion and succession. Over the past 40 years they have established a vibrant social and economic enclave that is replenished daily by transnational connections to the residents’ homeland. These transnational links are pervasive on the landscape, and include travel agencies advertising daily ﬂ  ights to Santo Domingo and Puerto Plata 
and stores handling cargas, envios , and remesas  (material and ﬁ  nancial remittances) found on every block, as well as farmacias  
(pharmacies) selling traditional medicines and botanicas  selling candles, statues, and other elements needed by practitioners 
of Santería, a syncretistic blending of Catholicism and Yoruba beliefs practiced among many in the Spanish Caribbean.

 How Do Places Affect Identity, and How Can We See Identities in Places?  155
often at the canton level—a small geographically deﬁ  ned 
area that distinguishes cultural groups within the state. 
So, which Swiss are Swiss Americans? The way Swiss Americans see Switzerland as part of who they are may 
not exist in Switzerland proper (Fig. 5.8). Ethnicity sways and shifts across scales, across places, and across time. A map showing all recognizable ethnic areas would look like a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with thousands of often-overlapping pieces—some no larger than a neigh-borhood, others as large as entire countries.
Ethnic identity is greatly affected by scale and place. 
In 2002, the Washington Post reported about the thriv-ing South Asian community in Fairfax County, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. In South Asia, the coun-tries of Pakistan and India have a history of animosity, and people identify themselves by country within the region of South Asia and by areas within each country. However, in Fairfax County, Virginia, a world apart from India and Pakistan, many South Asians identify with each other. A South Asian video rental store rents both Pakistani and Indian movies. South Asian grocery stores carry foods from both countries and areas within the countries. The geographical context of suburban Washington, D.C. fos-ters a collective South Asian identity.
Cultural groups often invoke ethnicity when race can-
not explain differences and antagonism between groups. Just as “racial conﬂ  icts” are rooted in perceptions of dis-tinctiveness based on differences in economics, power, language, religion, lifestyle, or historical experience, so too are “ethnic conﬂ  icts.” A conﬂ  ict is often called ethnic when a racial distinction cannot easily be made. For example, using physical appearance and skin color, an observer can-not distinguish the ethnic groups in many of the conﬂ  icts HOW DO PLACES AFFECT IDENTITY, AND 
HOW CAN WE SEE IDENTITIES IN PLACES?
The processes of constructing identities and iden-
tifying against an “Other,” just like any other social 
or cultural process, differ from place to place and are rooted in places. When we construct identities, part of what we do is to infuse place with meaning by attach-ing memories and experiences to the place. This process of infusing a place “with meaning and feeling” is what Gillian Rose and countless other geographers refer to as “developing a sense of place.” Like identity, our sense of place is ﬂ  uid; it changes as the place changes and as we change.
What is of particular interest to geographers is 
how people deﬁ  ne themselves through places. Our sense of place becomes part of our identity, and our identity affects the ways we deﬁ  ne and experience place. Rose explains:
One way in which identity is connected to a particular place is by a feeling that you belong to that place. It’s a place in which you feel comfortable, or at home, because part of how you deﬁ  ne yourself is symbolized by certain qualities of that place. The geographer Relph, for exam-ple, has even gone so far as to claim that “to be human is to live in a world that is ﬁ  lled with signiﬁ  cant places: to be human is to have to know your place.”
The uniqueness of a place can become a part of who we are.
Ethnicity and Place
Ethnicity offers a good example of how identities affect places and how places affect identities. The idea of eth-
nicity as an identity stems from the notion that people are closely bounded, even related, in a certain place over time. The word ethnic comes from the ancient Greek word eth-nos, meaning “people” or “nation.” Geographer Stuart Hall explains, “Where people share not only a culture but an ethnos, their belongingness or binding into group and 
place, and their sense of cultural identity, are very strongly deﬁ ned.” Hall makes clear that ethnic identity is “histori-
cally constructed like all cultural identities” and is often considered natural because it implies ancient relations among a people over time.
This deﬁ  nition may sound simple, but the concept 
of ethnicity is not. In the United States, for example, a group of people may deﬁ  ne their ethnicity as Swiss 
American. Switzerland is a state in Europe. The people in Switzerland speak four major languages and other minor ones. The strongest identities in Switzerland are most  Figure 5.8

others have created distinct patterns of settlement and 
ethnically imprinted cultural landscapes.
The town of Mexicali is the capital of the State of 
Baja California (located in Mexico, just south of the State of California in the United States). Not far from the cen-tral business district of Mexicali lies one of the largest Chinatowns in Mexico. A 1995 study of the Mexicali Chi-natown by geographer James R. Curtis showed that it has been the crucible of Chinese ethnicity in the Mexicali Val-ley throughout much of the twentieth century. Chinese began arriving in 1902, and by 1919 more than 11,000 Chinese were either permanent or temporary residents of the valley. They established a thriving Chinatown in the heart of Mexicali that served as the uncontested center of Chinese life in the region for decades (Fig. 5.9).
The Chinese of Mexicali were prominent players in 
the social and economic life of the city during the twenti-eth century. They owned and operated restaurants, retail trade establishments, commercial land developments, currency exchanges, and more. By 1989 they owned nearly 500 commercial or service properties. In an effort to sustain their cultural traditions and add to the cultural around the world. The adversaries in post–World War II conﬂ icts in Northern Ireland, Spain, the former Yugosla-
via, Sri Lanka, Ivory Coast, or Rwanda cannot be identiﬁ  ed 
racially; thus “ethnicity” becomes the marker of difference.
In some instances, the term ethnicity is reserved for 
a small, cohesive, culturally linked group of people who stand apart from the surrounding culture (often as a result of migration). Like other aspects of culture, ethnicity is a dynamic phenomenon that must be understood in terms of the geographic context and scales in which it is situated.
Chinatown in Mexicali
The border region between the United States and Mexico is generally seen as a cultural meeting point between Mex-icans and Anglo Americans. Y et the ethnic composition of people in the border region is more varied than Mexican and Anglo. Through migration, people from Germany, Russia, India, China, Japan, and countless other places also live in the cities and rural areas of the United States–Mexico border region. Over time some of the migrants to this region have blended into the larger community, and

themselves, and what kinds of problems they confront. 
For example, early studies examining gay neighborhoods in San Francisco and London focused on how gay men created spaces and what those spaces meant to gay identi-ties. Speciﬁ  c studies have also focused on the role of gay 
pride parades in creating communities and the political struggle for access to other parades such as St. Patrick’s Day parades in some cities. Other studies examine the role gays and lesbians play in the gentriﬁ  cation of neighbor-
hoods in city centers (a topic we explore in Chapter 9).
T oday, geographers studying sexuality are focusing 
not only on the distributions and experiences of people in places but also on the theories behind the experiences, the theories that explain and inform our understanding of sexu-ality and space. Many of the geographers who study sexual-ity are employing queer theory in their studies. By calling the theory queer theory, Elder, Knopp, and Nast explain that social scientists (in geography and other disciplines) are appropriating a commonly used word with negative conno-tations and turning it in a way that “highlights the contextual nature” of opposition to the heteronormative and focuses on the political engagement of queers with the heteronorma-tive. Geographers are also concentrating on extending ﬁ  eld-
work on sexuality and space beyond the Western world of North America and Europe to the rest of the world, explor-ing and explaining the local contexts of political engagement.
In 2000, the United States Census Bureau counted 
the number of same-sex households in the United States. In 2010, the Census added same-sex marriage to their counts. These data, by census tract—a small area in cit-ies and a larger area in rural America—made it possible for Gary Gates and Jason Ost to publish The Gay and 
Lesbian Atlas. Their detailed maps of major cities in the United States show concentrations of same-sex house-holds in certain neighborhoods of cities (Fig. 5.10), such as Adams-Morgan and DuPont Circle in Washington, D.C., and the West Village and Chelsea in Manhattan (Fig. 5.11). T aking the Census data by county, we can see a pattern of same-sex households in the United States, with concentrations in cities with well-established gay and les-bian neighborhoods. And we can also see the presence of same-sex households throughout the country, throughout states where same-sex unions are illegal.
In the 2010 census, the government tallied the number of households where a same-sex couple (with or without chil-dren) lived. Study the map of same-sex households in New York by census tract in Figure 5.10. How would the map change if sexuality were one of the “boxes” every person ﬁ lled out on the census?life of the city, they established the China Association, which plays an active role in Mexicali’s social and civic life.
Mexicali’s Chinatown is experiencing a transforma-
tion, as Chinese residents have dispersed to the edges of the city and beyond (many because they can afford to move out of town now). Relatively few Chinese continue to live in the city’s Chinatown; some have even moved across the border to Calexico (a city of 27,000 on the California side of the border), while retaining business interests in Mexicali. Y et Mexicali’s Chinatown contin-ues to play an important symbolic and functional role for individuals of Chinese ancestry in the area, who are still shaping the region’s social and economic geography. Even in regions where an ethnic population is small in number, if they have a group identity and consciousness they can have a lasting effect on the cultural landscape.
Identity and Space
Another way of thinking about place is to consider it as a cross section of space. Doreen Massey and Pat Jess deﬁ  ne 
space as “social relations stretched out” and place as “par-ticular articulations of those social relations as they have come together, over time, in that particular location.” Part of the social relations of a place are the embedded assumptions about ethnicity, gender, and sexuality, about what certain groups “should” and “should not” do socially, economically, politically, even domestically. Geographers who study iden-tities, such as gender, ethnicity, race, and sexuality, realize that when people make places, they do so in the context of surrounding social relationships. We can, for example, create places that are gendered—places seen as being appropriate for women or for men. A building can be constructed with the goal of creating gendered spaces within it, or a building can become gendered by the way people make use of it.
Sexuality and Space
Sexuality is part of humanity. Just as gender roles are culturally constructed, so too do cultures decide sexual norms. In their installment on “Sexuality and Space” in Geography in America at the Dawn of the 21st Century, geog-raphers Glen Elder, Lawrence Knopp, and Heidi Nast argue that most social science across disciplines is writ-ten in a heteronormative way. This means that the default subject in the minds of the academics who write studies is heterosexual, white, and male. These geographers and many others are working to ﬁ  nd out how heternormative ideas inﬂ  uence understandings of places and cultures, and 
how the practices of peoples who do not conform to these ideas inﬂ  uence the development of places.
Geographers’ initial forays into the study of sexual-
ity focused largely on the same kinds of questions posed by those who ﬁ  rst took up the study of race, gender, and ethnicity. Geographers ask where people with shared identity live and gather, what they do to create a space for c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 157  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 157  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Field Note
“It’s July 26, 2011, and I happen to be in New 
York City the weekend just after the State of New York legalized same-sex marriages. I cut it close getting to the airport so I could catch the ﬁ rst part of the annual Gay Pride parade. The 
parade, which started on the edge of the Chel-sea neighborhood at 36th Street, traveled down 5th Avenue toward where I took this photograph near Union Square and ended in the West Vil-lage. Always a boisterous, celebratory event, the parade has a special feel this year as celebrants cheer what many describe as one of the great civil rights victories of the current era.”

 How Does Geography Reﬂ  ect and Shape Power Relationships Among Groups of People?  159
people of all races, ethnicities, and sex, some charge that 
the United States Census Bureau continues to undercount minority populations (see Chapter 2).
Throughout the world, the work of women is often 
undervalued and uncounted. When the United States and other state governments began to count the value of goods and services produced within state borders, they did so with the assumption that the work of the house-hold is reserved for women and that this work does not contribute to the productivity of the state’s economy. The most commonly used statistic on productivity, the gross national income (the monetary worth of what is produced within a country plus income received from HOW DOES GEOGRAPHY REFLECT AND 
SHAPE POWER RELATIONSHIPS AMONG GROUPS OF PEOPLE?
Power relationships are assumptions and structures 
about who is in control and who has power over others. 
Power relationships affect identities directly, and the nature of those effects depends on the geographical con-text in which they are situated. Power relationships also affect cultural landscapes by determining what is seen and what is not. Massey and Jess contend power is central to the study of place: “the power to win the contest over how the place should be seen, what meaning to give it; the power, in other words, to construct the dominant imagina-tive geography, the identities of place and culture.”
Power relationships do much more than shape the 
cultural landscape. Power relationships can also subjugate entire groups of people, enabling society to enforce ideas about the ways people should behave or where people should be welcomed or turned away—thus altering the distribution of peoples. Policies created by governments can limit the access of certain groups. Jim Crow laws in the United States once separated “black” spaces from “white” spaces, right down to public drinking fountains. Even without government support, people create places 
where they limit the access of other peoples. For example, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Catholics and Protestants deﬁ ned certain neighborhoods as excluding the “other” 
through painting murals, hanging bunting, and painting curbs (Fig. 5.12). In major cities in the United States, local governments do not create or enforce laws deﬁ  ning cer-
tain spaces as belonging to members of a certain gang, but the people themselves create spaces, much like the people of Belfast do, through grafﬁ  ti, murals, and building colors.
Just Who Counts?
The statistics governments collect and report reﬂ  ect the 
power relationships involved in deﬁ  ning what is valued and what is not. Think back to the Constitution of the United States prior to the Fourteenth Amendment, when the government enumerated a black person as three-ﬁ  fths of 
a white person. Until 1924, the U.S. government did not recognize the right of all American Indians to vote even though the Fifteenth Amendment recognized the right to vote regardless of race in 1870. The U.S. government sepa-rated American Indians into those who were “civilized” enough to be citizens and those who were not (“Indians not taxed”) until 1924, when it recognized the citizenship of all American Indians born in the United States. Not until 1920 did enough states ratify the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which recognized the right of all Americans to vote regardless of sex. Despite progress in counting  Figure 5.12

The mural features images of women who lost their lives in the conﬂ  ict, including Maureen

in nearly all cultures and places around the world. A 2004 
report from the United Nations stated that two-thirds of the 880 million illiterate adults in the world are women and that women account for 70 percent of the world’s poorest citizens.
The World’s Women 2010 reported regional varia-
tions in agriculture employment for women. In Africa, for example, the proportion of women employed in agricul-ture ranges from a low of 19 percent in countries in south-ern Africa to a high of 68 percent in countries in eastern, middle, and western Africa. In Northern Africa, 42 per-cent of women are employed in agriculture and 41 percent of women are employed in services. In Asia, employment of women in agriculture ranges from 11 percent in eastern Asia, where 76 percent of women are employed in the ser-vice sector, to South Asia with 55 percent of women work-ing in agriculture and 28 percent in the service sector.
Although the number of women working in indus-
tries globally is small relative to the proportion of men, it is rising. Employment of women in the industrial sec-tor was slowed by the global economic downturn of the 2000s, as well as by mechanization, which leads to job reductions and hence to layoffs of women workers. In the maquiladoras of northern Mexico (see Chapter 10), for example, many women workers lost their jobs when labor markets contracted between 2001 and 2002, and then again between 2008 and 2010.
As the foregoing discussion has highlighted, many 
women engage in “informal” economic activity—that is, private, often home-based activity such as tailoring, beer brewing, food preparation, and soap making. Women who seek to move beyond subsistence activities but cannot enter the formal economic sector often turn to such work. In the migrant slums on the fringes of many cities, infor-mal economic activity is the mainstay of communities.investments outside the country), does not evaluate work in the home. The gross national income (GNI) includes neither the unpaid labor of women in the household nor, usually, the work done by rural women in less wealthy countries.
Scholars estimate that if women’s productivity in the 
household alone were given a dollar value by calculating what it would cost to hire people to perform these tasks, the gross national income (GNI) for all countries of the world combined would grow by about one-third. In poorer coun-tries, women produce more than half of all the food; they also build homes, dig wells, plant and harvest crops, make clothes, and do many other things that are not recorded in ofﬁ  cial 
statistics as being economically productive (Fig. 5.13).
Despite these conditions, the number of women in 
the “ofﬁ  cial” labor force is rising while the proportion of 
men in the labor force globally declined between 1990 and 2010. In The World’s Women 2010: Trends and Statistics , the 
United Nations reported “women are predominantly and increasingly employed in the services sector” of the formal economy. Combining paid work with work in the infor-mal economy and unpaid domestic work, “women work longer hours than men do.” The proportion of women in the labor force grew in all regions reported by the United Nations except Asia and eastern Europe. In South Amer-ica, for example, the percent of women in the labor force rose from 38 in 1990 to 59 in 2010. In North Africa, the participation of women in the labor force increased from 23 percent in 1990 to 29 percent in 2010 while over the same time period in Subsaharn Africa, women accounted for 60 and 62 percent of the labor force.
Even though women are in the ofﬁ  cial labor force in 
greater proportions than ever before, they continue to be paid less and have less access to food and education than men  Figure 5.13

inﬂ uenced by geographically speciﬁ  c social and envi-
ronmental circumstances.
Fieldwork is often the best way to understand how 
power structures in society create vulnerable groups at 
the local scale, and how those vulnerable groups might be affected by particular developments. Through ﬁ  eldwork 
and interviews, geographers can see differences in vulner-ability within groups of people.
Geographer Sarah Halvorson, for example, studied 
differences in the vulnerabilities of children in northern Pakistan. She examined the vulnerability of children to diarrheal diseases by paying attention to “constructions of gender, household politics, and gendered relationships that perpetuate inherent inequalities and differences between men and women and within and between social groups.”
Halvorson studied 30 families, 15 of whom had a 
low frequency of diarrhea and dysentery and 15 of whom had a high frequency of these diseases. Through her ﬁ  eld-
work, Halvorson came to understand that several tangible resources, including income and housing, and several intan-gible resources, such as social status and position within the family structure, all inﬂ  uenced the vulnerability of children to diarrheal diseases in northern Pakistan. Halvorson found that people with higher incomes generally had lower disease rates, but that income was not the only relevant factor (Fig. 5.14). The least vulnerable children and women were those who had higher incomes and an established social network of support. In cases where income was low, if a woman had a strong social network, her children were more likely to be in the low-disease group.
Geographer Joseph Oppong recognized that the spa-
tial analysis of a disease can reveal what populations are most vulnerable in a country. In North America and Europe, Statistics showing how much women produce and 
how little their work is valued are undoubtedly interest-ing. Y et, the work geographers who study gender have done goes far beyond the accumulation of such data. Since the 1980s, geographers have asked why society talks about women and their roles in certain ways and how these ideas, heard and represented throughout our lives, affect geo-graphic circumstances and how we understand them. For example, Ann Oberhauser and her co-authors explained that people in the West tend to think that women are employed in the textile and jewelry-making ﬁ  elds in 
poorer countries because the women in these regions are “more docile, submissive, and tradition bound” than women in more prosperous parts of the world. A geogra-pher studying gender asks where these ideas about women come from and how they inﬂ  uence women’s work possi-
bilities and social positions in different places—key ele-ments in making places what they are.
Vulnerable Populations
Power relations can have a fundamental impact on which populations or areas are particularly vulner-able to disease, death, injury, or famine. Geographers use mapping and spatial analysis to predict and explain what populations or people will be affected most by natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanoes, hurri-canes, and tsunamis or by environmental policies. The study of vulnerability requires thinking geographically because not all people and places are affected in the same way by social, political, economic, or environ-mental change. Rather, vulnerability is fundamentally Guest Field Note
One of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity among children under 
the age of ﬁ  ve in developing countries is waterborne disease. My research has focused on building an understanding of the factors that contribute to the vulnerability of young children to this signiﬁ  cant public health problem. I have conducted my research in communities located in the relatively remote Kara-koram Range of northern Pakistan. Of interest to me is the microenvironment of water-related disease risk, and in particular, the factors at the household and local scale that inﬂ  uence the prevalence and severity of childhood illness. One of the primary methodological strategies that I employ in this research involves household microstudies, which entail in-depth interviews with family members (primarily mothers who are the principal child health providers), child health histories, and structured observations. One of the most important ﬁ  ndings of 
this research in these mountain communities, in my opinion, is that the educa-tion, social networks, and empowerment of women are all critical to breaking the cycle of disease impacts and to ensuring long-term child survival.

AIDS, according to his research. Oppong also found that 
women in polygamous relationships in the Muslim part of northern Ghana had lower HIV/AIDS rates. Oppong offers two theories to explain why women Muslims in polygamous relationships had lower HIV/AIDS rates: ﬁ  rst, 
as a matter of cultural practice, most Muslims tend to avoid sexual promiscuity, and second, Muslims in Ghana practice circumcision, which helps lower the rate of HIV/AIDS transmission in that part of the country.
Fieldwork helps geographers apply vulnerabil-
ity theory to understand how existing spatial structures, power relationships, and social networks affect the sus-ceptibility of people to diseases and and other hazards around the world.HIV/AIDS is much more prevalent among homosexual and bisexual men than among heterosexual men and women. In Subsaharan Africa, women have much higher rates of HIV/AIDS than men. As Oppong explains, “AIDS as a global problem has unique local expressions that reﬂ  ect the spatial distribution and social networks of vulnerable social groups.”
According to Oppong, in most of Subsaharan Africa, 
HIV/AIDS rates are highest for women in urban areas and for women who work as sex workers. However, in Ghana, HIV/AIDS rates were lower for women in the urban area of Accra. Oppong postulates that women in Accra have lower HIV/AIDS rates because they have greater access to health care than women in rural areas. Women in rural areas who were not treated for malaria had higher incidences of HIV/162 Chapter 5   Identity: Race, Ethnicity, Gender, and Sexuality

Women in Subsaharan Africa
Migration ﬂ  ows, birth rates, and child mortality rates 
affect the gender composition of cities, states, and regions. 
Some regions of the world have become male-dominated, whereas other regions have become female-dominated—at least numerically.
Much of Subsaharan Africa, especially rural areas, 
is dominated numerically by women. In this region of the world, most rural to urban migrants are men. Domosh and Seager point out that men leave rural areas to work in heavy industry and mines in the cities, “while women are left behind to tend the farms and manage the household econ-omy. Indeed parts of rural South Africa and Zimbabwe have become feminized zones virtually depopulated of men.”
In the large region of Subsaharan Africa, women out-
number men in many rural areas. Women in Subsaharan Africa have heavy responsibilities, coupled in many places with few rights and little say (Fig. 5.15). Women produce an estimated 70 percent of the region’s food, almost all of it without the aid of modern technology. Their back-breaking hand-cultivation of corn and other staples is an endless task. As water supplies decrease, the exhausting walk to the nearest pump gets longer. Firewood is being cut at ever-greater distances from the village, and the task of hauling it home becomes more difﬁ  cult every year. As 
men leave for the towns, sometimes to marry other wives and have other children, the women left in the villages often struggle for survival.
Even though a woman in this position becomes the 
head of a household, if she goes to a bank for a loan she may well be refused; traditional banks throughout much of Africa do not lend money to rural women.

T oday, the country where women hold the highest 
proportion of legislative seats is neither Uganda nor South 
Africa. Rather, another African country, Rwanda, is the ﬁ  rst 
country in the world where women hold more than 50 per-cent of the legislative seats. Women passed the 50 percent mark in the 2008 election in Rwanda (Figure 5.17). Rwanda suffered a bloody civil war in the 1990s and over 800,000 people died (one-tenth of the population at the time), a majority of whom were men. Immediately after the war, women accounted for more than 70 percent of the popula-tion of the country. T oday, women account for 55 percent of the voting-age population. The Rwandan constitution, adopted in 2003, recognizes the equality of women and set a quota of at least 30 percent women in all govern-ment decision-making bodies. Of the 80 legislative seats in Rwanda, 24 are reserved for women. In these 24 seats, the only candidates are women and only women can vote.
Dowry Deaths in India
On a 2004 Oprah! show, the talk show hostess interviewed journalist Lisa Ling about her travels through India and her reports on dowry deaths in India. The Chicago audi-ence looked stunned to discover that thousands of girls in India are still betrothed through arranged marriages and that in some extreme cases, disputes over the dowry, which is the price to be paid by the bride’s family to the groom’s father, have led to the death of the bride. The bride may be brutally punished, often burned, or killed for her father’s failure to fulﬁ  ll a marriage agreement. children, she might wish to apply for title to the land she has occupied and farmed for decades, but in many places land titles are not awarded to women.
Y oung girls soon become trapped in the cycle of female 
poverty and overwork. Often there is little money for school fees; what is available ﬁ  rst goes to pay for the boys. As soon as she can carry anything at all, the girl goes with her mother to weed the ﬁ  elds, bring back ﬁ  rewood, or fetch water (Fig. 5.16). She will do so for 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, during all the years she remains capable of working. In East Africa, cash crops such as tea are sometimes called “men’s crops” because the men trade in what the women produce. When the government of Kenya tried to increase the productivity on the tea plantations in the 1970s and 1980s, the govern-ment handed out bonuses—not to the women who did all of the work but to the men who owned title to the land!
Since the 1990s, women have lobbied for greater 
representation in governments in southern and east-ern Africa. Uganda was a leader in afﬁ  rmative action for women by setting up a quota or guarantee that women must hold at least 20 percent of the legislative seats. In South Africa, Apartheid, the systematic oppression of the majority black population by the minority white popu-lation, ended in 1994. The South African government established a constitution with universal suffrage (voting rights) in 1997. The constitution does not include an afﬁ  r-
mative action policy for women’s representation in the parliament. Instead, major political parties, starting with the African National Congress (ANC) reserved a certain percentage of their seats won for women.Field Note

in fewer dowry deaths in the short run in India. An article 
in The Times of India in 2010 explained police in the city of 
Chennai, where the information technology boom is in full swing, reported that a rise in dowry deaths was likely a result of increasing materialism among the middle class and an ensuing feeling of desperation for more goods and cash, coupled with men in less powerful positions, which had led to more men acting out violently.
Understanding shifting gender relations and power 
structures in India is not at all easy. Just as some statis-tics point to an improving place of women in Indian society, other statistics conﬁ  rm India still has a prefer-ence for males overall. India’s 2011 census reported a sex ratio of 940 girls for every 1,000 boys, which looks to be an improvement over the 2001 sex ratio of 933 girls for every 1,000 boys. However, the sex ratio for children 0 to 6 years old in India was at a record low of 914 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2011. The 2011 census data sur-prised many because between 2001 and 2011, while India gained unprecedented economic growth, the number of girls ages 0 to 6 dropped from 927 in 2001 to 914 in 2011. Many pregnant women in India, especially in northern states, undergo gender-determining tests (ultrasound and amniocentesis) and elect to have abortions when the fetus is a girl. Girls who make it to birth may suffer female infanticide as many parents fear the cost of dowries and extend little social value to girls.
In India and elsewhere, directing the attention of 
people in far-ﬂ  ung places to social ills—moving the issues up in scale—has the potential to create change. Y et prob-lems cannot really be solved unless power relations shift at the family, local, regional, and national scales. As the num-ber of women and men in the middle class in urban India continues to rise, love marriages will continue to rise, as well. The number of dowry deaths, arranged marriages, and divorces in the country will continue to ﬂ  uctuate as 
power relations shift across gender and scales.
Shifting Power Relations among Ethnic Groups
In Chapter 4, we discussed local cultures that deﬁ  ne them-
selves ethnically. The presence of local ethnic cultures can be seen in the cultural landscapes of places we discussed in Chapter 4: “Little Sweden” in Kansas or the Italian North End in Boston. In many places, more than one ethnic group lives in a place, creating unique cultural landscapes and revealing how power relations factor into the ways ethnicities are constructed, revised, and solidiﬁ  ed, where 
ethnic groups live, and who is subjugating whom.
Three urban geographers, John Frazier, Florence 
Margai, and Eugene T ettey-Fio, tracked the ﬂ  ow of peo-ple and shifts in power relations among the multiple eth-nic groups that have lived in Alameda County, California, in their book Race and Place: Equity Issues in Urban America. Only a small fraction of India’s girls are involved in dowry deaths, but the practice is not declining. According to the Indian government, in 1985, the number was 999; in 1987, 1786 women died at the hands of vengeful husbands or in-laws; in 1989, 2436 perished; in 2001, more than 7000 women died; and in 2009, it was reported that 8383 women died from dowry deaths. These ﬁ  gures report 
only conﬁ  rmed dowry deaths; many more are believed to occur but are reported as suicides, kitchen accidents, or other fatal domestic incidents.
The power relationships that place women below 
men in India cannot simply be legislated away. Govern-ment entities in India (federal as well as State) have set up legal aid ofﬁ  ces to help women who fear dowry death and 
seek assistance. In 1984, the national legislature passed the Family Courts Act, creating a network of “family courts” to hear domestic cases, including dowry disputes. But the judges tend to be older males, and their chief objective, according to women’s support groups, is to hold the fam-ily together—that is, to force the threatened or battered woman back into the household. Hindu culture attaches great importance to the family structure, and the family courts tend to operate on this principle.
Recognizing that movement away from arranged 
marriages and dowries among the Indian population is slow in coming, the journalist and talk show host took the issue of dowry deaths to the global scale —to generate 
activism in the West and create change at the local scale in India. Ling explained that the place of women in India has changed little. She described women as a ﬁ  nancial 
burden on the bride’s family, who must save for a sizable dowry to marry off the woman. Ling describes the dowry as a ﬁ  nancial transaction; through marriage the burden 
of the woman moves from the bride’s family to her hus-band’s family. Y et Winfrey and Ling interviewed a woman in India to show that global change can help make local change possible. Nisha Sharma was to marry in front of 1500 guests in a town just outside of the capital of New Delhi. On her wedding day, the groom’s family demanded $25,000 in addition to the numerous luxury items they had already received as dowry (including washing machines, a ﬂ at screen TV , and a car). Nisha’s father refused to pay, the 
man’s family became violent, and Nisha called the police on her cell phone. She has become a local hero and is also an example in the West of how to beat the dowry deaths using global technology, in this case, a cell phone.
India is starting to see the impact of its booming econ-
omy and growing proportion of educated young women and men in well paid jobs on marriage. The number of love marriages is on the rise (Fig. 5.18), and many couples in love marriages are meeting on-line in India. The number of divorces is also on the rise with 1 in 1,000 marriages ending in divorce in India today, which is one of the lowest divorce rates in the world but is also double the country’s divorce rate ﬁ  ve years ago. These changes will not necessarily result c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 165  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401c05IdentityRaceEthnicityGenderandSexuality.indd Page 165  9/15/11  8:52 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

Chinese Exclusion Act, which prohibited immigration of 
Chinese in 1882. Chinese exclusion efforts persisted for decades afterward in Alameda County and resulted in the city of Oakland moving Chinatown several times.
During the 1910s, the economy of the region grew 
again, but the city of Oakland limited the Chinese residents to Chinatown, using ethnic segregation to keep them apart from the rest of the population. Frazier, Margai, and T ettey-Fio described how Oakland’s Chinatown was dictated by law and not elected by choice:
At a time when the Chinese were beneﬁ  ting from a better economy, the “whites only” speciﬁ  cations of local zoning and neighborhood regulations forced separatism that segregated the Oakland Chinese into the city’s Chinatown. What today The county borders San Francisco and includes the geo-graphic areas of Berkeley and Oakland. Latinos populated the region prior to the Gold Rush. After 1850, migrants from China came to the county. The ﬁ  rst Asian migrants to the county were widely dispersed, but the ﬁ  rst African 
Americans lived in a segregated section of the county.
Areas with multiple ethnicities often experience an 
ebb and ﬂ  ow of acceptance over time. When the economy is booming, residents are generally more accepting of each other. When the economy takes a downturn, residents often begin to resent each other and can blame the “Other” for their economic hardship (for example, “they” took all the jobs). In Alameda County, much of the population resented Chinese migrants when the economy took a downturn in the 1870s. The United States government passed the ﬁ  rst  Figure 5.17

educated, are not residentially segregated from the white 
population. However, the newer immigrants from Asia (mainly Southeast Asia—during and following the Viet-nam War) are segregated from whites residentially, mixing much more with the African American population in inner-city neighborhoods. Here, Asians experience a high rate of poverty, much like the Hispanic and African American populations in the same regions of the county do.
In California and in much of the rest of the United 
States, the “Asian” box is drawn around a stereotype of what some call the “model minority.” Frazier and his col-leagues explain the myth of the model minority: the myth “paints Asians as good, hardworking people who, despite their suffering through discrimination, harassment, and exclusion, have found ways to prosper through peaceful means.” Other researchers have debunked the myth by is sometimes presented as an example of Chinese unity and choice was, in fact, place dictated by law.
Until World War II, the Chinese were segregated 
from the rest of Oakland’s population. When the war began, residents of Alameda County, like much of the rest of the United States, focused on the Japanese population in the county, persecuting, segregating, and blaming them. After World War II, the ethnic population of Asians in Alam-eda County became more complex. The Asian population alone doubled in the decade between 1980 and 1990 and diversiﬁ  ed to include not only Chinese and Japanese but 
also Koreans, Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Laotians. In Alameda County today, as in much of the rest of the United States, the ﬁ  rst wave of immigrants from Asia (mainly from China, India, and Korea), who came to the region already GREENLAND

dustrialization (see Chapter 11). As plants closed and white 
laborers left the neighborhoods, a Hispanic population migrated into southeastern Los Angeles. A housing crunch followed in the 1980s, as more and more Hispanic migrants headed to southeastern Los Angeles. With a cheap labor supply now readily available in the region again, companies returned to southeastern Los Angeles, this time focusing on smaller-scale production of textiles, pharmaceuticals, furni-ture, and toys. In addition, the region attracted industrial toxic-waste disposal and petrochemical reﬁ  ning facilities.
In his study of the region, Curtis records the changes to 
the cultural landscape in the process. He uses the term barri-oization (derived from the Spanish word for neighborhood, barrio) to describe a change that saw the Hispanic population of a neighborhood jump from 4 percent in 1960 to over 90 percent in 2000. With the ethnic succession of the neighbor-hood from white to Hispanic, the cultural landscape changed to reﬂ  ect the culture of the new population. The structure of the streets and the layout of the housing remained largely the same, giving the Hispanic population access to desig-nated parks, schools, libraries, and community centers built by the previous residents and rarely found in other barrios in Southern California. However, the buildings, signage, and landscape changed as “traditional Hispanic housescape ele-ments, including the placement of fences and yard shrines as well as the use of bright house colors” diffused through the barrios. Curtis explains that these elements were added to existing structures, houses, and buildings originally built by the white working class of southeastern Los Angeles.
The inﬂ  ux of new ethnic groups into a region, the 
replacement of one ethnic group by another within neigh-borhoods, changes to the cultural landscape, the per-sistence of myths such as the “model minority” myth of Asians, and an economic downturn can create a great deal of volatility in a city.
On April 29–30, 1992, the City of Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia, became engulfed in one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in United States history. During the two days of rioting 43 people died, 2383 people were injured, and 16,291 people were arrested. Property damage was estimated at approxi-mately $1 billion, and over 22,700 law enforcement personnel were deployed to quell the unrest. According to the media, the main catalyst for the mass upheaval was the announce-ment of a “not guilty” verdict in the trial of four white Los Angeles police ofﬁ  cers accused of using excessive force in the videotaped arrest of Rodney King, a black motorist. T o the general public, the Los Angeles riots became yet another symbol for the sorry state of race relations between blacks and whites in the United States. Y et, a geographic perspective on the Los Angeles riots helps us understand that they were not simply the product of localized reactions to police bru-tality, but reﬂ  ected sweeping economic, political, and ethnic changes unfolding at regional and even global scales.
The riots took place in South Central Los Angeles. 
Like the region of southeast Los Angeles (described above), the South Central area was once a thriving industrial region demonstrating statistically the different levels of economic success experienced by various Asian peoples, with most success going to the ﬁ  rst wave of migrants and lower paying jobs going to newer migrants. Both groups are burdened with a myth that stereotypes them as the “model minority.”
Power Relations in Los Angeles
Over the last four decades, the greatest migration ﬂ  ow 
into California and the southwestern United States has come from Latin America and the Caribbean, especially Mexico. The 2010 Census reported a 43 percent increase in the Hispanic or Latino population of the country. The City of Los Angeles had over 3.79 million people, 48.48 percent of whom were Hispanic. The Hispanic popula-tion in the city grew from 39.32 percent of the population in 1990 to 48.48 percent by 2010.
The area of southeastern Los Angeles County is today 
“home to one of the largest and highest concentrations of Latinos in Southern California,” according to a study by geographer James Curtis. Four decades ago, this area of Los Angeles was populated by working-class whites who were segregated from the African American and Hispanic popu-lations through discriminatory policies and practices. Until the 1960s, southeastern Los Angeles was home to corpora-tions such as General Motors, Bethlehem Steel, and Weiser Lock. During the 1970s and 1980s, corporations began to close as the United States went through a period of dein- Figure 5.18
Mumbai, India. Arranged marriages were the norm not long 
ago in India, and the family of the bride was expected to pro-vide a dowry to the groom’s family. Arranged marriages are still widespread in parts of rural India, but in urban areas they are rapidly giving way to love marriages follow romantic courtships.  
Evidence of this cultural shift is not hard to ﬁ  nd on the streets of India’s major cities.

 How Does Geography Reﬂ  ect and Shape Power Relationships Among Groups of People?  169
Geographer James Johnson and his colleagues 
explored the impact of economic loss on the ethnic and 
social geography of South Central Los Angeles. They found that the population of the area was over 90 percent African American in 1970, and by 1990, the population was evenly split between African Americans and Hispanics. This change in population composition was accompanied by a steady inﬂ  ux of Korean residents and small-business own-ers who were trying to ﬁ  nd a niche in the rapidly changing urban area (Fig. 5.19).with dependable, unionized jobs employing the resident population. In the 1960s, however, the population of South Central Los Angeles was working-class African Ameri-can, and the population of southeastern Los Angeles was working-class white. After 1970, South Central Los Ange-les experienced a substantial decrease in the availability of high-paying, unionized manufacturing jobs when plants closed and relocated outside of the city and even outside the country. The people of South Central Los Angeles lost over 70,000 manufacturing jobs between 1978 and 1982 alone!

170 Chapter 5   Identity: Race, Ethnicity, Gender, and Sexuality
Geographers who study race, ethnicity, gender, or sexu-
ality are interested in the power relations embedded in a place from which assumptions about “others” are formed or reinforced. Consider your own place, your campus, or your locality. What power relations are embedded in this place?Johnson and his colleagues argued that the Los 
Angeles riots were more than a spontaneous reaction to a verdict. They were rooted in the growing despair and frustration of different ethnic groups competing for a decreasing number of jobs in an environment of declin-ing housing conditions and scarce public resources. At a time when signiﬁ  cant unemployment is affecting com-
munities all over the United States, their work shows the importance of looking beyond the immediate catalysts of particular news events to the local, national, and global geographical contexts in which they unfold.
Summary
Identity is a powerful concept. The way we make sense of ourselves is a personal journey that is mediated and inﬂ  uenced by the political, social, and cultural contexts in which 
we live and work. Group identities such as gender, ethnicity, race, and sexuality are con-structed, both by self-realization and by identifying against and across scales. When learning about new places and different people, humans are often tempted to put places and people into boxes, into myths or stereotypes that make them easily digestible.
The geographer, especially one who spends time in the ﬁ  eld, recognizes that how 
people shape and create places varies across time and space and that time, space, and place shape people, both individually and in groups. James Curtis ably described the work of a geographer who studies places: “But like the popular images and stereotypical portrayals of all places—whether positive or negative, historical or contemporary—these mask a reality on the ground that is decidedly more complex and dynamic, from both the economic and social perspectives.” What Curtis says about places is true about people as well. What we may think  to be positive identities, such as the myths of “Orientalism” 
or of the “model minority,” and what we know are negative social ills, such as racism and dowry deaths, are all decidedly more complex and dynamic than they ﬁ  rst seem.

Field Note What Should I Say?
In stores throughout Brussels, Belgium, you can see the capital city’s bilingualism 
all around you—literally. From McDonald’s to health insurance ofﬁ  ces (Fig. 6.1) to the metro, signs in Brussels are posted in duplicate, with one in Flemish (a variant of Dutch) and one in French.
Walking into a travel agency in Brussels one afternoon, I immediately noticed 
the signs in duplicate: two signs towered over the woman behind the counter; two signs advertised a new budget airline carrier that would be serving the Brussels air-port; two signs labeled the restrooms; and two signs announced the travel agency’s hours of operation. Figure 6.1

 What Should I Say? 173
I debated for a minute whether to speak to the person behind the counter 
in French or Flemish. She was speaking Flemish with the person in front of me, 
but I decided to use French since my knowledge of that language is better. The student from Italy who stood behind me in line apparently had no such debate. She stepped up to the counter, asked her question in English, and received a reply in excellent English.
Many geographers are initially drawn to the discipline through maps. 
However, maps, especially at the world or continental scale, generalize so much information that they hide the complexities of everyday life. Once you become a geographer, you begin to question every map you examine. Look at the European map of languages (Fig. 6.2), and zero in on Belgium. The map shows a neat line dividing Flemish speakers (a Germanic language) in the northern region of Flanders from French speakers (a Romance language) in the southern region of Wallonia.
Behind this neat line on the language map is a complicated, at times con-
tentious, linguistic transition zone. To understand language patterns in Belgium, we must also study the issue at the local scale. Although the bilingual capital of Brussels is located in the Flemish-speaking north (Flanders), for an estimated 85 percent of the locals, French is the mother tongue (Fig. 6.3).
In Belgium, economic differences between linguistic groups have been a divi-
sive issue for generations. During the nineteenth century, French speakers con-trolled the industrial economy and government of the country. The concentration of industry in southern Belgium strengthened their position. The French-speaking elite in Brussels and other Flemish cities began a process of “Frenchiﬁ  cation.” They 
promoted French and used it when interacting with their counterparts in other countries. By the twentieth century, a majority of the people in Brussels spoke French, although people in the areas surrounding Brussels continued to speak Flemish.
Many people in northern Belgium (surrounding Brussels) opposed the growing 
Frenchiﬁ  cation of Flanders. The leaders of the Flemish movement initially sought 
linguistic rights, speciﬁ  cally the right of Flemish speakers to use their language in 
public affairs, court proceedings, and schools. Yet they were constantly frustrated with the opposition of French speakers to their demands. By the 1920s, the Flemish leadership began calling for the country to be partitioned along linguistic lines so that those living in northern Belgium could control their own affairs.
By the 1960s, a ﬁ  xed partition scheme came into being, which divided the 
country into Flemish-speaking Flanders in the north and French-speaking Wallonia in the south. The government recognizes Brussels as a distinct region, a bilingual capital, but places strict limits on the use of French in the rest of northern Belgium.
The partitioning process produced upheavals throughout the country. The 
experience helped strengthen the sense of Flemish identity and fueled a counter-movement among the French Walloons. With language-group identity on the rise, conﬂ  icts between linguistic “communities” became a central feature of Belgian 
political life. After the 1960s, Belgian heavy industry became less competitive, and the country’s economy shifted to high technology, light industry, and services, with much of the new economy concentrating in Flemish-speaking Flanders. As a result, the economic power in Belgium ﬂ  ipped, with the French-speaking indus-
trial south taking a back seat to the Flemish-speaking north. Today, Wallonia has an unemployment rate of 14 percent, and economists consider unemployment in Wallonia to be structural, making it difﬁ  cult for the economy or job market to c06Language.indd Page 173  9/12/11  11:08 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 173  9/12/11  11:08 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

bounce back. Flanders, on the other hand, has an unemployment rate below 6 per-
cent, which gives it one of the lower unemployment rates in Europe.
The vast majority of power and decision making rests with the individual 
governments of Flanders and Wallonia rather than in a centralized government in Brussels. With their newfound wealth, many in Flanders wanted to see a greater federalization of the country, which would put even more power in each of the two regions. Today, no political party in Belgium operates at the national scale. Wallonia and Flanders each have their own political parties that vie for power in their respective regions. Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that it took Belgium nine months to form a government after the spring 2007 elections. In June 2010, Belgium held regional elections, and a moderate separatist party won the most parliamentary seats in the more prosperous Flanders region. The New 
Y ork Times quoted the political leader of the separatist Flemish nationalist party as saying, “We do not want a revolution. We do not want to declare Flanders inde-pendent overnight. But we do believe in a gradual evolution.”
Brussels is going in another direction entirely, serving as the principal capital 
of the European Union (EU). Brussels is home to the EU Council and Commission. Moreover, much of the committee work done by the European Parliament takes place in Brussels (the formal home of the Parliament is in Strasbourg, France). The role Brussels serves as the European Union capital may prevent Belgium from split-ting into two countries. Both Flanders and Wallonia have vested interests in Brussels, so neither would abandon it lightly. And the French-speaking majority in Brussels has little interest in casting its lot with the region in which it is situated—Flanders. Some have proposed making Brussels a capital district for the European Union, much as the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) serves in the United States.
The example of Belgium gives us a multitude of insights into language. 
Language questions are often politicized. Language frequently is tied to other identity issues such as socioeconomic status. And while all of the debates about c06Language.indd Page 175  9/12/11  11:08 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 175  9/12/11  11:08 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

national and local language preservation abound, English continues to expand as a 
global language for commerce, trade, and popular culture.
In this chapter, we question what languages are and examine the roles lan-
guages play in cultures. We study the spatial distribution of the world’s languages and learn how languages diffuse, change, and even become extinct. Finally, we examine how language contributes to making places unique.
Key Questions For Chapter 6
 1. What are languages, and what role do languages play in cultures?
 2. Why are languages distributed the way they are?
 3. How do languages diffuse?
 4. What role does language play in making places?
WHAT ARE LANGUAGES, AND WHAT ROLE 
DO LANGUAGES PLAY IN CULTURES?
A scene in Quentin T arantino’s cult classic movie 
Pulp Fiction shows Vincent and Jules in the front seat of the 
car talking about France. Vincent, trying to demonstrate his knowledge of French culture, turns to Jules and says, “Y ou know what they call a . . . . a . . . . a quarter pounder with cheese in Paris?” Jules replies, “They don’t call it a quarter pounder with cheese?” Vincent, ever the expert, explains in a few choice words that France uses the metric system and that the French would not know what a quar-ter pounder is. Then, he explains, “They call it a ‘royale’ with cheese.” Jules, surprised, asks, “What do they call a Big Mac?” Vincent explains, “Well a Big Mac is a Big Mac, but they call it ‘Le Big Mac.’”
This humorous exchange shows the juxtaposition of 
two opposing forces in our globalized world: globalization of culture and preservation of local and national culture. Are the two contradictory, or can we have globalization of restaurants, food, music, and culture while preserving local languages?
Language is a fundamental element of local and 
national culture. The French government has worked dil-igently, even aggressively, to protect the French language, dating back to 1635 and the creation of the Académie Française, an institution charged with standardizing and protecting the French language. Since the 1970s, diffu-sion of globalized terms into France has posed an enor-mous challenge for the Académie Française.
With the support of many French people, the French 
government passed a law in 1975 banning the use of foreign words in advertisements, television, and radio broadcasts, and ofﬁ  cial documents, unless no French equivalent could be found. In 1992, France amended its constitution to make French the ofﬁ  cial language. In 1994, the French govern-
ment passed another law to stop the use of foreign (mainly English) words in France, with a hefty ﬁ  ne imposed for vio-lators. The law mandates French translations for globalized words, requiring the use of ofﬁ  cial French terms in ofﬁ  cial 
communications rather than le meeting, le weekend, le drugstore, or le hamburger. The Internet, where 49.9 per-cent of Internet users browse in English or Chinese (Fig. 6.4), has posed another set of challenges for the Académie Française. Many of the translations the Académie requires are somewhat cumbersome. For example, the ofﬁ  cial 
translation of e-mail was “courrier electronique,” but the Académie shortened it to “courriel.”
In addition to demonstrating the conﬂ  icting forces 
of globalized language and local or national language, the example of France reveals that language is much more than a way of communicating. A language is a set of sounds and symbols that is used for communication. But language is also an integral part of culture, reﬂ  ecting and shaping it.
Language and Culture
Language is one of the cornerstones of culture; it shapes our very thoughts. We can use vast vocabularies to describe new experiences, ideas, and feelings, or we can create new words that represent these things. Who we are as a culture, as a people, is reinforced and redeﬁ  ned 
moment by moment through shared language. Language reﬂ ects where a culture has been, what a culture values, 
even how people in a culture think, describe, and expe-rience events.Perhaps the easiest way to understand the role of language in culture is to examine people who have experienced the loss of language under pressure from oth-ers. During colonization, both abroad and within coun-tries, colonizers commonly forced the colonized people c06Language.indd Page 176  9/12/11  11:08 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 176  9/12/11  11:08 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 What Are Languages, and What Role Do Languages Play in Cultures?  177
to speak the language of the colonizer. These language 
policies continued in many places until recently and were enforced primarily through public (government) and church (mission) schools.
American, Canadian, Australian, Russian, and New 
Zealand governments each had policies of forced assimila-tion during the twentieth century, including not allowing indigenous peoples to speak native languages. For example, the United States forced American Indians to learn and speak English. Both mission schools and government schools enforced English-only policies in hopes of assimilating American Indians into the dominant culture. In an interview with the producers of an educational video, Clare Swan, an elder in the Kenaitze band of the Dena’ina Indians in Alaska, eloquently described the role of language in culture:
No one was allowed to speak the language—the Dena’ina language. They [the American government] didn’t allow it in schools, and a lot of the women had married non-native men, and the men said, “You’re American now so you can’t speak the language.” So, we became invisible in the community. Invisible to each other. And, then, because we couldn’t speak the language—what happens when you can’t speak your own language is you have to think with someone else’s words, and that’s a dread-ful kind of isolation [emphasis added].
Shared language makes people in a culture visible to each other and to the rest of the world. Language helps to bind a cultural identity. Language is also quite personal. Our thoughts, expressions, and dreams are articulated in our language; to lose that ability is to lose a lot.
Language can reveal much about the way people 
and cultures view reality. Some African languages have no word or term for the concept of a god. Some Asian lan-guages have no tenses and no system for reporting chron-ological events, reﬂ  ecting the lack of cultural distinction 
between then and now. Given the American culture’s pre-occupation with dating and timing, it is difﬁ  cult for many in the United States to understand how speakers of these languages perceive the world.
Language is so closely tied to culture that people use 
language as a weapon in cultural conﬂ  ict and political strife. In the United States, where the Spanish-speaking popula-tion is growing (Fig. 6.5), some Spanish speakers and their advocates are demanding the use of Spanish in public affairs. In turn, people opposed to the use of Spanish in the United States are leading countermovements to promote “Ofﬁ  cial 
English” policies, where English would be the ofﬁ  cial lan-
guage of government. Of course, Spanish is one of many non-English languages spoken in the United States, but it overshadows all others in terms of number of speakers and is therefore the focus of the ofﬁ  cial English movement (T able 6.1). During the 1980s, over 30 different States con-
sidered passing laws declaring English the State’s ofﬁ  cial

country between France and Great Britain. Government 
documents and even scholarly journals are printed in both English and French. Most of the country’s French speak-ers live in the province of Quebec. The majority of people in Quebec speak French at home.
Since the 1970s, the Quebecois (people of Quebec) 
have periodically called for more independence for their province within Canada, even voting on secession at times. Although a majority has never voted for secession, the provincial government has passed several laws requir-ing and promoting the use of French in the province. In 1977, the Quebec government compelled all businesses language. Some 30 States today have declared English the ofﬁ cial language of the State either by statute or by amend-
ing the State constitution (one law was subsequently over-turned by the courts). A few States have passed English-plus laws, encouraging bilingualism for non-English speakers, and a few other States are ofﬁ  cially bilingual, including 
Hawai’i (Hawai’ian and English), or have bi-lingual educa-tion, including New Mexico (Spanish and English).
In Quebec, Canada, the focus is on passing laws 
that promote the use of the province’s distinct version of the French language. The country of Canada is ofﬁ  -
cially bilingual, a reﬂ  ection of the colonial division of the  Figure 6.5

in the province to demonstrate that they functioned in 
French. Upon passage of this law, many businesses and individuals moved out of the province of Quebec into neighboring Ontario. In 1993, the Quebec government passed a law requiring the use of French in advertising (Fig. 6.6). The Quebec law allows the inclusion of both French and English (or another language) translations on signage, as long as the French letters are twice the size of the other language’s letters.Not all of Quebec’s residents identify with the 
French language. Within the province, a small propor-tion of people speak English at home, others speak indig-enous languages, and still others speak another language altogether—one associated with their country of origin. When the Quebec Parliament passed several laws pro-moting French during the 1980s and 1990s, members of Canada’s First Nations, including the Cree and Mohawk, who live in Quebec, expressed a desire to remain part of

in many (or nearly all) aspects are Serbian and Croatian, 
Hindi and Urdu, Spanish and Portuguese, and Navajo and Apache.
Given the complexities of distinguishing languages 
from dialects, the actual number of languages in use in the world remains a matter of considerable debate. The most conservative calculation puts the number at about 3000. However, most linguists and linguistic geographers today recognize between 5000 and 7000 languages, including more than 600 in India and over 2000 in Africa.
Standardized Language
Language is dynamic: new discoveries, technologies, and ideas require new words. T echnologically advanced soci-eties are likely to have a standard language , one that is 
published, widely distributed, and purposefully taught. In some countries, the government sustains the standard language through ofﬁ  cial state examinations for teachers 
and civil servants. Ireland promotes the use of the Irish (Celtic) language by requiring all government employees to pass an Irish-language examination before they can be hired. The phrase “the King’s English” is a popular refer-ence to the fact that the English spoken by well-educated people in London and its environs is regarded as British Received Pronunciation (BRP) English—that is, the standard.
Who decides what the standard language will be? 
Not surprisingly, the answer has to do with inﬂ  uence 
and power. In France, the Académie Française chose the French spoken in and around Paris as the ofﬁ  cial, stan-
dard language during the sixteenth century. In China, the government chose the Northern Mandarin Chinese heard in and around the capital, Beijing, as the ofﬁ  cial 
standard language. Although this is China’s ofﬁ  cial stan-
dard language, the linguistic term Chinese actually incor-porates many variants. The distinction between the stan-dard language and variations of it is not unique to China; it is found in all but the smallest societies. The Italian of Sicily is quite different from the Italian spoken north of Venice, and both tongues differ from the standard Italian spoken in Florence and T uscany, the region where many leaders of the Italian Renaissance wrote and published in what became the standard Italian language.
Dialects
Variants of a standard language along regional or ethnic lines are called dialects. Differences in vocabulary, syntax (the way words are put together to form phrases), pronunci-ation, cadence (the rhythm of speech), and even the pace of speech all mark a speaker’s dialect. Even if the written form of a statement adheres to the standard language, an accent Canada should Quebec secede from the country. During the same period, Quebec has experienced a ﬂ  ow of inter-
national migrants, many of whom seek residence in Quebec as a way to enter Canada and North America at large. These new immigrants must learn French under Quebec law.
Quebec, like any other place, is susceptible to 
change. Calls for independence in Quebec are waning since the separatist political party has captured fewer seats in recent parliamentary elections for the province. Nonetheless, the Quebecois still feel a connection to France. The province even has a presence in Paris in the Maison Quebec (House of Quebec), an embassy-like entity of the province. As people, ideas, and power ﬂ  ow through 
the province, change will continue. Y et, the province’s laws, programs, presence in France, and the desire of the Quebecois to remain loyal to their French language will at the very least keep the language alive as the province continues to experience change.
What Is a Language?
Many geography textbooks differentiate languages based on a criterion of mutual intelligibility. Mutual intel-ligibility means that two people can understand each other when speaking. The argument goes that if two of us are speaking two different languages, say Spanish and Portuguese, we will not be able to understand each other, but if we are speaking two dialects of one language, we will achieve mutual understanding. Y et linguists have rejected the criterion of mutual intelligibility as strongly as geog-raphers have rejected environmental determinism.
First, mutual intelligibility is almost impossible to 
measure. Even if we used mutual intelligibility as a cri-terion, many languages would fail the test. Famous lin-guist Max Weinreich once said that “a language is a dialect with an army.” Think about it. How could we possibly see Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese Chinese as dialects of the same language, when two people speaking the lan-guage to each other cannot understand what each other is saying? Both can read the standard form of Chinese that has been built up by a strongly centralized Chinese gov-ernment. But the spoken dialects are not mutually intel-ligible. Y et, we see Chinese as one language because of the weight of political and social institutions that lie behind it.
A further complication with the mutual intelligibil-
ity test is revealed in Scandinavia, where, for example, a Danish speaker and a Norwegian speaker (at least if they come from Oslo) will be able to understand what each other is saying. Y et we think of Danish and Norwegian as distinct languages. Having a Norwegian language helps Norwegians identify themselves as Norwegians rather than as Danes or Scandinavians. Other languages that are recognized as separate but are mutually intelligible c06Language.indd Page 180  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 180  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

limits as isoglosses. An isogloss is a geographic bound-
ary within which a particular linguistic feature occurs, but such a boundary is rarely a simple line. Usually, outlying areas of usage extend beyond the isogloss. Fuzzy iso-glosses may signify that the dialect has expanded or con-tracted. Linguists who study dialects examine pronuncia-tions, vocabularies, use of colloquial phrases, and syntax to determine isoglosses.
Linguistic geographer Hans Kurath published 
atlases of dialects in the United States, deﬁ  ning Northern, 
Southern, and Midland dialect in the eastern part of the country. In the mid-1900s, Kurath drew distinct isoglosses among the three dialects, based on pronunciation of cer-tain sounds and words. A more recent study of American dialects by linguist Bert Vaux used a 122-question online survey to map dialects in the United States. Maps of the soda, pop, and coke question (Fig. 6.7) and the hero, sub, poor-boy question reveal the prominent dialects of New England and the deep South, the fuzzy border between the two regions (Kurath’s Midland dialect), the mixture of dialects in much of the rest of the country, and a few scat-tered areas outside the dialect regions where one or the other dialect dominates.can reveal the regional home of a person who reads the statement aloud. In the United States, the words “horse” and “oil” are written the same way in New England and in the South, but to the Southerner, the New Englander may be saying “hahse,” and to the New Englander, the Southerner seems to be saying “all.”
Linguists think about dialects in terms of dialect 
chains, distributed across space. Dialects nearest to each other geographically will be the most similar (greater spatial interaction), but as you travel across the space, the dialects become less intelligible to each other because less interaction occurs. If all of these dialects are part of one language, which one of the dialects is the language? This question points to another challenge in deﬁ  ning languages. 
Is one of the many English dialects in the world the one, true English? Language is actually an umbrella for a collec-tion of dialects, and we tend to see one of these dialects as the “true” language only because it is the one we speak or because it is the one a government claims as the standard.
Frequently, dialects are marked by actual differ-
ences in vocabulary. A single word or group of words can reveal the source area of the dialect. Linguistic geogra-phers map the extent of particular words, marking their

182 Chapter 6   Language
Linguist Bert Vaux’s study of dialects in American English 
points to the differences in words for common things such as soft drinks and sandwiches. Describe a time when you said something and a speaker of another dialect did not understand the word you used. Where did the person with whom you were speaking come from? Was the word a term for a common thing? Why do you think dialects have differ-ent words for common things, things found across dialects, such as soft drinks and sandwiches?WHY ARE LANGUAGES DISTRIBUTED 
THE WAY THEY ARE?
The ﬁ  rst step in mapping the distribution of world 
languages is to classify languages. Linguists and linguistic 
geographers classify languages in terms that are also used in biology and for the same reasons: like species, some lan-guages are related and others are not. At the global scale, we classify languages into language families. Within a single language family, the languages have a shared but fairly distant origin. We break language families into sub-families (divisions within a language family), where the

commonalities are more deﬁ  nite and their origin is more 
recent. Subfamilies consist of individual languages, whose spatial extent is smaller, and every individual language has its dialects, whose territorial extent is smaller still.
Deﬁ  nition and Debate
Although language families and subfamilies seem to be a logical way to classify languages, the classiﬁ  cation of lan-
guages is subject to intense debate. Deﬁ  ning a language 
family is a daunting challenge: some linguists argue that there are not just a few, but many dozens of language fam-ilies. So when you study Figure 6.8, be aware that this is only one depiction of the world’s geography of languages today. This map shows the distribution of some 20 lan-guage families, among which the Indo-European lan-guage family has the widest distribution and claims the largest number of speakers. What you see here, of course, results from a combination of contiguous as well as relo-cation diffusion: Indo-European languages spread from a western source in all directions into Eurasia, but colo-nialism also transplanted Indo-European languages to the Americas, Africa, and Australia.
Even when it comes to individual languages, com-
plicated issues arise. English is the most widely spoken

Madagascar, but by that time the language and culture of 
Southeast Asia had been well established.
Language Formation
In the process of classifying languages, linguists and linguistic geographers study relationships among lan-guages, looking for similarities and differences within and among languages. One way to ﬁ  nd and chart simi-larities among languages is to examine particular words, looking for sound shifts over time and across languages. A sound shift  is a slight change in a word across languages 
within a subfamily or through a language family from the present backward toward its origin. For example, Italian, Spanish, and French are all members of the Romance lan-guage subfamily of the Indo-European language family. One way linguists and linguistic geographers can deter-mine this is by looking at sound shifts for single words across time (all three languages are derived from Latin) and across languages. For example, the Latin word for milk, lacte, became latta in Italian, leche in Spanish, and 
lait in French. Also, the Latin for the number eight, oto, became otto, ocho, and huit, respectively. Even if linguists 
did not already know that Italian, Spanish, and French are languages rooted in Latin, they could deduce a con-nection among the languages through the sound shifts of particular words.
More than two centuries ago William Jones, an 
Englishman living in South Asia, undertook a study of Sanskrit, the language in which ancient Indian religious and literary texts were written. Jones discovered that the vocabulary and grammatical forms of Sanskrit bore a striking resemblance to the ancient Greek and Latin he learned while in college. “No philologer [student of words] could examine all three,” Jones wrote, “with-out believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.” His idea was a revolutionary notion in the 1700s.
During the nineteenth century Jakob Grimm, a 
scholar and a writer of fairy tales, suggested that sound shifts might prove the relationships between languages in a scientiﬁ  c manner. He explained that related languages have similar, but not identical, consonants. He believed these consonants would change over time in a predictable way. Hard consonants, such as the v and t in the German 
word vater, softened into vader (Dutch) and father 
(English). Using Grimm’s theory that consonants became softer as time passed and sounds shifted, linguists realized that consonants would become harder as they went “back-wards” toward the original hearth and original language.
From Jones’s notions and Grimm’s ideas came the 
ﬁ rst major linguistic hypothesis, proposing the existence 
of an ancestral Indo-European language called Proto-Indo-European. Discovery of a Proto-Indo-European Indo-European language, its speakers encircling the world with more than 300 million in North America, 70 million in Britain and Ireland, 25 million in Australia and New Zealand, and tens of millions more in South Africa, India, and elsewhere in the postcolonial world. Hundreds of millions of people speak versions of English as a sec-ond or third language. Our map cannot reﬂ  ect this, but 
the Indo-European family has actually diffused even more than Figure 6.8 suggests.
 Sometimes you will see Chinese listed as the 
language with more speakers than any other, but herein lies still another complication. Although Figure 6.8 shows China and neighboring areas to be the heart-land of the Sino-Tibetan language family, “Mandarin” Chinese, called Putonghua in China, is in common use by less than half of China’s population of 1.34 billion. A detailed language map of China reveals more than 1400 dialects, most of them mutually incomprehensible. What unites the “People of Han” is not their ability to understand each other’s spoken word, but their abil-ity to read the characters in which Chinese is written. When you watch television in China, you will see news reports and other programs subtitled by Chinese char-acters, so that even if the local news anchor speaks in a dialect, the viewer can read and understand what is being said. But this does not mean that a billion Chinese speak Mandarin.
At the other end of the scale, the world map of 
languages shows several language families spoken by dwindling, often marginally located or isolated groups. The Indo-European languages of European coloniz-ers surround the language families of Southeast Asia. Languages in the Austro-Asiatic language family sur-vive in the interior of eastern India and in Cambodia and Laos. Languages in the Austronesian family are numerous and quite diverse, and many of the individual languages are spoken by fewer than 10 million people. Remoteness helps account for the remaining languages in the Amerindian language family. These languages remain strongest in areas of Middle America, the high Andes, and northern Canada.
If we look carefully at the map of world language 
families, some interesting questions arise. Consider, for example, the island of Madagascar off the East African coast. The primary languages people in Madagascar speak belong not to an African language family but to the Austronesian family, the languages of Southeast Asia and the Paciﬁ  c Islands. Why is a language from this family spoken on an island so close to Africa? Anthropologists have found evidence of seafarers from the islands of Southeast Asia crossing the Indian Ocean to Madagascar. At the time, Africans had not sailed across the strait to Madagascar, so no African languages diffused to the island, preserving the Southeast Asian settlements and language for centuries. Later, Africans began to come to

and Finnish, T urkish and Mongolian), the Dravidian lan-
guages of India, and the Afro-Asiatic language family, in which Arabic is dominant (Fig. 6.8).
Locating the Hearth of Proto-Indo-European
German linguist August Schleicher was the ﬁ  rst to com-pare the world’s language families to the branches of a tree (Fig. 6.9). In the mid-nineteenth century, he suggested that new languages form through language divergence, which occurs when spatial interaction among speakers of a language breaks down and the language fragments ﬁ  rst 
into dialects and then into discrete tongues. The process of language divergence has happened between Spanish and Portuguese and is now happening with Quebecois French. Each new language becomes a new leaf on a tree, its branches leading back to the hearth, the trunk of the tree. Through backward reconstruction, linguists and lin-guistic geographers can ﬁ  nd how languages ﬁ  t together and where the branches were once joined. T racing backward far enough, researchers can ﬁ  nd the hearth of a language family.
If linguists and linguistic geographers can ﬁ  nd 
the hearth of the Proto-Indo-European language, they will ﬁ  nd a major part of the tree’s trunk. Finding the trunk is a daunting task, for reconstructing even a small branch of the language tree is complicated. Languages do not change only through divergence (the splitting of branches); they also change through convergence and extinction. If peoples with different languages have con-sistent spatial interaction, language convergence can take place, collapsing two languages into one. Instances of language convergence create special problems for researchers because the rules of reconstruction may not apply or may be unreliable. 
Language extinction creates branches on the tree 
with dead ends, representing a halt in interaction between the extinct language and languages that continued (Fig. 6.10). Languages become extinct either when all 
descendants perish (which can happen when an entire peo-ple succumb to disease or invaders) or when descendants choose to use another language, abandoning the language of their ancestors. The process of language extinction does not occur overnight; typically, it takes place across genera-tions, with degrees of bilingualism occurring in the interim.
T racking the divergence, convergence, extinction, 
and locations of the languages derived from Proto-Indo-European, linguists theorize that the hearth of the Proto-Indo-European language was somewhere in the vicinity of the Black Sea or east-central Europe. From this hearth, Proto-Indo-European speakers dispersed, vocabularies grew, and linguistic divergence occurred, spurring new languages. By analyzing the vocabulary of the Proto-Indo-European language, linguists and geographers can discern the environment and physical geography of the language’s hearth and also deduce aspects of the peoples’ culture and language would give us the hearth of ancient Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. A single Proto-Indo-European hearth would link modern languages from Scandinavia to North Africa and from North America through parts of Asia to Australia. Several research tasks followed from this hypothesis. First, the vocabulary of the proposed ancestral language had to be reconstructed. Second, the hearth of the language had to be located. Third, the routes of diffu-sion needed to be traced.
Reconstructing the Vocabulary of Proto 
Indo-European and Its Ancient Ancestor
Linguists use a technique called backward reconstruc-
tion to track sound shifts and hardening of consonants “backward” toward the original language. If it is possible to deduce a large part of the vocabulary of an extinct lan-guage, a language without any native speakers, it may be feasible to go even further and re-create the language that preceded it. This technique, called deep reconstruction, has yielded some important results.
The work of two Russian scholars in particular has 
had great impact on the deep reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European language and even the ancestral language of the Proto-Indo-European language. Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky began working in the 1960s, each using deep reconstruction to re-create ancient languages. Using words they assumed to be the most sta-ble and dependable parts of a language’s vocabulary, such as those identifying arms, legs, feet, hands, and other body parts, and terms for the sun, moon, and other elements of the natural environment, they reconstructed an inventory of several hundred words. Remarkably, they worked inde-pendently, each unaware of the other’s work for many years. When they ﬁ  nally met and compared their inventories, they found that the inventories were amazingly similar. The scholars agreed that they had established some key charac-teristics not only of the Proto-Indo-European language but also of its ancient ancestor, the Nostratic language.
The Nostratic vocabulary the researchers recon-
structed revealed much about the lives and environments of its speakers. Apparently, they had no names for domesti-cated plants or animals, so Nostratic speakers were hunter-gatherers, not farmers. The Nostratic words for dog and wolf turned out to be the same, suggesting that the domes-tication of wolves may have been occurring at the time people were speaking Nostratic. The oldest known bones of dogs excavated at archaeological sites date from about 14,000 years ago, so Nostratic may have been in use at about that time, well before the First Agricultural Revolution.
Nostratic is believed to be the ancestral language 
not only of Proto-Indo-European, and thus the Indo-European language family as a whole, but also of the Kartvelian languages of the southern Caucasus region, the Uralic-Altaic languages (which include Hungarian c06Language.indd Page 185  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 185  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

moved approximately 18 kilometers (11 miles). This means 
farmers would have completely penetrated the European frontier in about 1500 years, which is close to what the archaeological record suggests. But some of the nonfarm-ing societies in their path held out, and their languages did not change. Thus, Etruscan did not become extinct until Roman times, and Euskera (the Basque language) survives to this day as a direct link to Europe’s prefarming era.
In 1991, the agriculture theory received support 
from analyses of the protein (that is, gene) content of indi-viduals from several thousand locations across Europe. This research conﬁ  rmed the presence of distance decay 
in the geographic pattern: certain genes became steadily less common from southern T urkey across the Balkans and into western and northern Europe. This pattern was interpreted as showing that the farming peoples of Anatolia moved steadily westward and northward (Fig. 6.11). With established farming providing a more reliable food supply, population could increase. As a result, a slow but steady wave of farmers dispersed into Europe and mixed with nonfarming peoples, diluting their genetic identity as the distance from their source area increased.
Despite the genetic gradient identiﬁ  ed in Europe, 
some linguistic geographers continue to favor the dis-persal hypothesis, which holds that the Indo-European languages that arose from Proto-Indo-European were ﬁ rst carried eastward into Southwest Asia, next around the 
Caspian Sea, and then across the Russian-Ukrainian plains and on into the Balkans (Fig. 6.12). As is so often the case, there may be some truth in each hypothesis. If Anatolia were the hearth, the diffusion of Proto-Indo-European could have occurred both westward across southern Europe and in the broad arc shown in Figure 6.12.economy. Judging from the reconstructed vocabulary of Proto-Indo-European, it appears that the language dates back to a people who used horses, developed the wheel, and traded widely in many goods.
Tracing the Routes of Diffusion of Proto-
Indo-European
Several major theories hypothesize how, why, and where 
languages diffuse over time. Each theory varies according to the main impetus for diffusion, and each theory leads us back to different hearths. One commonality among the theories is a focus on Europe. When studying the diffu-sion of Proto-Indo-European, the focus is typically on Europe for two reasons: one, it is clear that the language diffused into Europe over time; and two, a signiﬁ  cant 
body of historical research and archaeology focuses on the early peopling of Europe.
The presence of Europe’s oldest languages (Celtic) in 
the far west supports the idea that newer languages arrived from the east. But how and where did they spread through Europe? The conquest theory provides one explana-tion. This theory holds that early speakers of Proto-Indo-European spread from east to west on horseback, overpow-ering earlier inhabitants and beginning the diffusion and differentiation of Indo-European tongues. The sound shifts in the derivative languages represent a long period of diver-gence in languages as one moves west through Europe.
An alternative agricultural theory proposes that Proto-
Indo-European diffused westward through Europe with the diffusion of agriculture. Citing the archaeological record, Luca Cavalli-Sforza and Albert Ammerman proposed that for every generation (25 years) the agricultural frontier  Figure 6.10

reading between the two languages is easier than 
speaking between them.
The Germanic languages (English, German, 
Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish) reﬂ  ect the expansion 
of peoples out of northern Europe to the west and south. Some Germanic peoples spread into areas domi-nated by Rome, and at the northern and northeast-ern edges of the Roman Empire their tongues gained ascendancy. Other Germanic peoples spread into areas that were never part of an ancient empire (present-day Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the northern part of the Netherlands). The Germanic character of English bears the imprint of a further migration—that of the Normans into England in 1066, bringing a Romance tongue to the British Isles. The essential Germanic character of English remained, but many new words were added that are Romance in origin.
The Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, Czech, 
Slovak, Ukrainian, Slovenian, Serbo-Croatian, and Bulgarian) developed as Slavic people migrated from a base in present-day Ukraine close to 2000 years ago. Slavic tongues came to dominate much of eastern Europe over the succeeding centuries. They, too, over-whelmed Latin-based tongues along much of the east-ern part of the old Roman Empire—with the notable exception of an area on the western shores of the Black Sea, where a Latin-based tongue either survived the Slavic invasion or was reintroduced by migrants. That tongue is the ancestor of the modern-day Romance lan-guage: Romanian.
Language and Politics
A comparison of Europe’s linguistic and political maps shows a high correlation between the languages spoken and the political organization of space. The Romance languages, of Romanic-Latin origin, domi-nate in five countries, including Romania. The east-ern boundaries of Germany coincide almost exactly with the transition from Germanic to Slavic tongues. Even at the level of individual languages, boundar-ies can be seen on the political map: between French and Spanish, between Norwegian and Swedish, and between Bulgarian and Greek.
Although Figure 6.2 shows a signiﬁ  cant correlation 
between political and linguistic boundaries in Europe, there are some important exceptions. The French lin-guistic region extends into Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy, but in France, French coexists with Basque in the southwest, a variant of Dutch in the north, and a Celtic tongue in the northwest. The Celtic languages survive in the western region of France called Brittany (Breton), in the northern and western parts of Wales (Welsh), in western Ireland (Irish Gaelic), and in the western We still do not know where the Proto-Indo-
European language was born, or the location of its hearth. Like all other languages that gave rise to language fami-lies, Proto-Indo-European has deeper roots that link it to languages outside of the Indo-European family. Some scholars have even suggested that Nostratic (and its con-temporaries, variously named Eurasiatic, Indo-Paciﬁ  c, 
Amerind, and Austric) is a direct successor of a proto-world language that goes back to the dawn of human his-tory, but this notion is highly speculative. The inset in Figure 6.9 reminds us how little of the human language tree we know with any certainty.
The Languages of Europe
The map of world languages (Fig. 6.8) demonstrates how widely spread the Indo-European language family is across the globe, dominating Europe, signiﬁ  cant parts 
of Asia (including Russia and India), North and South America, Australia, and portions of Southern Africa. About half the world’s people speak Indo-European lan-guages. The Indo-European language family is broken into subfamilies including Romance, Germanic, and Slavic. And each subfamily is broken into individual lan-guages, such as English, German, Danish, and Norwegian within the Germanic subfamily.
The language map of Europe (Fig. 6.2) shows 
that the Indo-European language family prevails in this region, with pockets of the Uralic family occurring in Hungary (the Ugric subfamily) and in Finland and adja-cent areas (the Finnic subfamily), and a major Altaic lan-guage, T urkish, dominating T urkey west of the Sea of Marmara.
Celtic people brought Indo-European tongues into 
Europe when they spread across the continent over 3000 years ago. Celtic speech survives at the western edges of Europe, but in most places Celtic tongues fell victim to subsequent migrations and empire building. These his-torical developments led to the creation of a European linguistic pattern characterized by three major subfami-lies: Romance, Germanic, and Slavic.
The Subfamilies
The Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian, 
Romanian, and Portuguese) lie in the areas of Europe that were once controlled by the Roman Empire. Over time, local languages mixed with Latin, which the Roman Empire introduced to the region. The Romance languages that have much in common because of their Latin connection, but they are not mutually comprehensible. Spanish and Portuguese remain closely related to each other, but even there, c06Language.indd Page 189  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 189  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
190 Chapter 6   Language
Studying language subfamilies helps us under-
stand migration and settlement patterns in Subsaharan 
Africa. The oldest languages of Subsaharan Africa are the Khoisan languages, which include a “click” sound. Although they once dominated much of the region, Khoisan languages were marginalized by the invasion of speakers of the Bantu languages. Studying the languages in the Bantu subfamily, we can see that the languages are still closely related, with similar preﬁ  xes and vocab-ularies. Similarities among the Bantu languages mean that the languages have been in Subsaharan Africa for a shorter time—typically, the longer a language has been in a place, the more likely sounds will have shifted and languages splintered.
Linguistic diversity is evident not just at the world 
regional scale, but at the country scale. Nigeria encom-passes several subfamilies of the Niger-Congo fam-ily, and its population includes speakers of two major Subsaharan African language families. Indeed, Nigeria’s 141 million people speak more than 500 different lan-guages. The three most prominent languages are dis-tributed regionally: Hausa is in the north and is spoken by some 35 million, Y oruba is in the southwest and is spoken by 25 million and Ibo is in the southeast and is spoken by more than 25 million people (Fig. 6.15). Of the remaining languages spoken in Nigeria, the vast majority are spoken by fewer than one million people. These minor languages persist because daily survival, community, and culture are tied closely to the local scale in Nigeria. Even people who leave their hometowns for work send money back to their hometown associations to support their culture and economy.
Were it not for British colonialism, the country of 
Nigeria would never have existed. The diverse people of this place have been amalgamated into the Nigerian Highlands and islands of Scotland (Scots Gaelic). The use of Romanian extends well into Moldavia, signifying a 
past loss of national territory. Greek and Albanian are also Indo-European languages, and their regional distribution corresponds signiﬁ  cantly (though not exactly) with state 
territories. Figure 6.2 underscores the complex cultural pattern of eastern Europe: German speakers in Hungary; Hungarian speakers in Slovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia; Romanian speakers in Greece and Moldavia; T urkish speakers in Bulgaria; and Albanian speakers in Serbia.
Although the overwhelming majority of Europeans 
and Russians speak Indo-European languages, the Uralic and Altaic language families are also represented. Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian are major languages of the Uralic family, which, as Figure 6.8 shows, extends across Eurasia to the Paciﬁ  c Coast. The Altaic family to which T urkish 
belongs is equally widespread and includes T urkish, Kazakh, Uigur, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek languages.
One language on the map of Europe stands out 
for two reasons: ﬁ  rst, it covers a very small land area, 
and second, it is in no way related to any other lan-guage family in Europe. Did you ﬁ  nd it? This tantaliz-
ing enigma is the Basque language, Euskera. Isolated in the Andorra Mountain region between Spain and France, the Basque people and their Euskera language survived the tumultuous history of Europe for thou-sands of years—never blending with another language or diffusing from the Andorra region. (Some recent genetic evidence points to a link between Euskera and an extinct language in the Middle East.) The Basques have a strong identity tied to their language and inde-pendent history, an identity that was cemented by the horrid treatment they received under fascist dictator Francisco Franco, who ruled Spain during and after World War II. After Franco died in 1975, a Basque sep-aratist group demanded autonomy within Spain. The Spanish government recognized Basque autonomy in its 1979 constitution, granting the Basque region its own parliament, giving their language ofﬁ  cial status, and transferring some taxation and education powers from the capital to the Basque region. A group of Basque sep-aratists continue to demand more, waging a campaign 
of violence against Spanish targets and even moderate Basque leaders (Fig. 6.13).
Languages of Subsaharan Africa
The world map of language families masks the extreme fragmentation of languages in parts of the world such as Subsaharan Africa. In Subsaharan Africa, the map of world language families reﬂ  ects the dominance of the Niger-
Congo language family. By including language subfami-lies, we can gain a more meaningful picture of Subsaharan Africa’s linguistic diversity (Fig. 6.14). Figure 6.13

only six years) unable to function in local Nigerian society. 
Nigeria is having serious doubts about its relationship with the English language brought there by the colonists who arbitrarily established their multilinguistic and multieth-nic country in the ﬁ  rst place.
Education also affects the distribution of languages across the globe and within regions and countries. Thinking about dif-ferent regions of the world, consider how education plays a role in the distribution of English speakers. Who learns English in each of these regions and why? What role does education play in the global distribution of English speakers?borders for less than a century. European colonists are responsible for the arbitrary borders of most of Africa—borders that ignore cultural divides. When Nigeria gained its independence in 1962, the government decided to adopt English as the “ofﬁ  cial” language, as the three 
major regional languages are too politically charged and thus unsuitable as national languages.
When Nigeria’s children go to school, they ﬁ  rst must 
learn English, which is used for all subsequent instruction. Certainly, the use of English has helped Nigeria avoid some conﬂ icts based on language, but Nigerian educators, espe-
cially in the north, are having second thoughts about the policy. Upon entering school, children who have grown up speaking a local language are suddenly confronted with a new, unfamiliar tongue. The time and energy spent learn-ing English takes away from learning other subjects. Moreover, for many students, knowledge of English is irrelevant when they emerge from school (as many do after  Figure 6.14

Gutenberg Bible (the sacred text for Christians), which 
brought the scriptures out of churches and monasteries. The Gutenberg press diffused quickly in the century fol-lowing—throughout Europe and beyond. The printing press allowed for an unprecedented production of written texts, in languages besides Latin. Gutenberg’s press made it possible to print the Bible in one’s own language, such as French or German, rather than Latin, helping to standard-ize European languages. The Luther Bible played this role for German, as did the King James Bible for English.
The rise of relatively large independent states was 
equally important (see Chapter 8), for these political enti-ties had a strong interest in promoting a common culture, often through a common language (such as French or Dutch). Political elites who were literate and had access to written texts brought peoples together and played a key role in distributing printed texts. Moreover, as the leaders of countries such as England and Spain sought to expand their inﬂ  uence overseas through mercantilism and colo-
nialism, they established networks of communication and interaction, helping to diffuse certain languages over vast portions of Earth’s surface.
Since 1500, the world has experienced several waves 
of globalization ranging from European colonialism to American-led globalization, resulting in widespread cultural, linguistic, political, and economic interaction. HOW DO LANGUAGES DIFFUSE?
Just a few thousand years ago most habitable parts of 
Earth were characterized by a tremendous diversity of languages. W ith the rise of empires, of larger-scale, more 
technologically sophisticated literate societies, some lan-guages began to spread over larger areas. By 2000 years ago, languages such as Chinese and Latin had successfully dif-fused over large regions. The Han Empire in China and the Roman Empire in Europe and North Africa knit together large swaths of territory, encouraging the diffusion of one language over the regions. The most powerful and wealthi-est people were the ﬁ  rst to learn Chinese and Latin in these empires, as they had the most to lose by not learning the languages. Local languages and illiteracy continued among the poor in the empires, and some blending of local with regional languages occurred. When the Roman Empire dis-integrated, places within the region discontinued interac-tion, prompting a round of linguistic divergence.
In the late Middle Ages, the invention of the 
Gutenberg printing press and the rise of nation-states worked to spread literacy and stabilize certain lan-guages through widely distributed written forms. Johann Gutenberg perfected the printing press, inventing the movable type printing press, the Gutenberg press, in Germany in 1440. In 1452, Gutenberg printed the ﬁ  rst c06Language.indd Page 192  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 192  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

mixture of two or more languages. When people speak-
ing two or more languages are in contact and they com-bine parts of their languages in a simpliﬁ  ed structure and vocabulary, we call it a pidgin language.
The ﬁ  rst widely known lingua franca was a pidgin 
language. During the 1200s seaborne commerce in the Mediterranean Sea expanded, and traders from the ports of southern France (the Franks) revitalized the ports of the eastern Mediterranean. But the local traders did not speak the seafarers’ language. Thus began a process of convergence in which the tongue of the Franks was mixed with Italian, Greek, Spanish, and Arabic. The mixture came to be known as the Frankish language, or lingua franca, and it served for centuries as the common tongue of Mediterranean commerce.
The term lingua franca is still used to denote a com-
mon language used for trade and commerce that is spoken by peoples with different native tongues. Arabic became a lingua franca during the expansion of Islam, and English did so in many areas during the colonial era. English is the only linguistic common denominator that binds together multi-lingual India—both in India itself and among those from the subcontinent who have migrated to other areas (Fig. 6.16).T rade and commerce stimulate the formation of new, hybrid languages to facilitate such interaction, but other, local languages collapse under the onslaught of change. Although new languages are created through trade and interaction over time, local languages with few native speakers are becoming extinct. Globalization is shrink-ing the world’s linguistic heritage. Anthropologist Wade Davis estimates that half of “the world’s 7000 languages are endangered.” Davis argues that most languages are lost because one group dominates another and the domi-nant language is privileged, which is “driving vibrant peo-ples and languages out of existence.”
Lingua Franca
Even before the expansion of trade encouraged the global diffusion of languages such as English and Spanish, regional trade encouraged people speaking different tongues to ﬁ  nd ways to communicate with one another. A lingua franca is a language used among speakers of dif-
ferent languages for the purposes of trade and commerce. A lingua franca can be a single language, or it can be a

Poland in Europe; and Lesotho in Africa. Even these 
countries, however, have small numbers of people who speak other languages; for example, more than a half-million Koreans live in Japan. In fact, as a result of migration and diffusion, no country is truly monolingual today. English-speaking Australia has more than 180,000 speakers of Aboriginal languages. Predominantly Portuguese-speaking Brazil has some 1.5 million speak-ers of Amerindian languages.
Countries in which more than one language is in 
use are called multilingual states. In some of these countries, linguistic fragmentation reﬂ  ects strong cul-tural pluralism as well as divisive forces. This is true in former colonial areas where colonizers threw together peoples speaking different languages, as happened in Africa and Asia.
Multilingualism takes several forms. In Canada 
and Belgium, the two major languages each dominate particular areas of the country. In multilingual India, the country’s ofﬁ  cial languages generally correspond with the country’s States (Fig. 6.17). In Peru, centuries of acculturation have not erased the regional identities of the American Indian tongues spoken in the Andean Mountains and the Amazonian interior, and of Spanish, spoken on the coast.
Ofﬁ  cial Languages
Countries with linguistic fragmentation often adopt an ofﬁ cial language  (or languages) to tie the people 
together. In former colonies, the ofﬁ  cial language is often 
one that ties them to their colonizer, as the colonizer’s language invariably is one already used by the educated and politically powerful elite. A State adopts an ofﬁ  cial 
language in the hope of promoting communication and interaction among peoples who speak different local and regional languages.
Many former African colonies have adopted 
English, French, or Portuguese as their ofﬁ  cial language, 
even though they have gained independence from for-mer imperial powers. Thus, Portuguese is the ofﬁ  cial 
language of Angola, English is the ofﬁ  cial language of 
Nigeria and Ghana, and French is the ofﬁ  cial language of 
Côte d’Ivoire.
Such a policy is not without risks. As we noted earlier 
in this chapter in the case of Nigeria, the long-term results of using a foreign language may not be positive. In some countries, including India, citizens objected to using a lan-guage (English in India) that they associated with colonial repression. Some former colonies chose not just one but two ofﬁ  cial languages: the European colonial language plus one of the country’s own major languages. English and Hindi are ofﬁ  cial languages of India. Similarly, A different sort of a lingua franca in wide use today 
is Swahili, the lingua franca of East Africa. Through centuries of trade and interaction, Swahili developed from an African Bantu language mixed with Arabic and Persian, encompassing 100 million speakers from south-ern Somalia to northern Mozambique and from coastal Kenya and T anzania to Uganda and the East African Great Lakes region. Swahili has a complex vocabulary and structure, and while millions of East Africans com-municate in the language, most still learn and speak a local language as their ﬁ  rst or primary language. Swahili has 
gained prominence since 2000 because of its status as the most widely used African language on the Internet. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has a Swahili language website, and Wikipedia offers pages of its free encyclopedia in Swahili.
Over time a pidgin language may gain native speak-
ers, becoming the ﬁ  rst language children learn in the home. When this happens, we call it a creolized or Creole language. A Creole language is a pidgin language that has developed a more complex structure and vocabulary and has become the native language of a group of people. The word Creole stems from a pidgin language formed in the Caribbean from English, French, and Portuguese languages mixed with the languages of African slaves. The language became more complex and became the ﬁ  rst 
language of people in the region, replacing the African languages.
Pidgin and Creole languages are important unify-
ing forces in a linguistically divided world. They tend to be simple and accessible, and therefore disseminate rapidly. In Southeast Asia a trade language called Bazaar Malay is heard from Myanmar (Burma) to Indonesia and from the Philippines to Malaysia; it has become a lingua franca in the region. A simpliﬁ  ed form of Chinese also serves as a language of commerce even beyond the bor-ders of China.
Multilingualism
In a world of some 200 political entities and several thou-sand languages, most countries cope, to varying degrees, with multilingualis—the use of more than one language by 
sectors of the population. In the United States, the cur-rent issue of Spanish as a second language is only the most recent manifestation of a debate that is as old as the coun-try itself. Canada is ofﬁ  cially a bilingual state, but quite a few Canadians speak a language other than English or French at home.
T o be sure, a few virtually monolingual states—
countries where almost everyone speaks the same lan-guage—do exist. These include Japan in Asia; Uruguay in South America; Iceland, Denmark, Portugal, and c06Language.indd Page 194  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 194  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 How Do Languages Diffuse?   195
The European Union is not a country, but it rec-
ognizes 23 ofﬁ  cial languages, and the United Nations 
has 6 ofﬁ  cial languages. In each of these cases, the international organization offers simultaneous transla-tion among the ofﬁ  cial languages to any member of the parliament (European Union) or the general assembly (United Nations) who requests it. Each international organization also publishes paper documents and main-tains its website in all ofﬁ  cial languages.
Global Language
What will the global language map look like 50 years from now? More and more people are using English in a vari-ety of contexts. English is now the standard language of international business and travel (the lingua franca), much of contemporary popular culture bears the imprint of English, and the computer and telecommunications rev-olution relies heavily on the use of English terminology. Does this mean that English is on its way to becoming a global language?English and Swahili are ofﬁ  cial languages of T anzania. 
In Mauritania, French and Arabic are ofﬁ  cial languages. 
But this solution was not always enough. When India gave Hindi ofﬁ  cial status, riots and disorder broke out 
in non-Hindi areas of the country. Kenya, which at ﬁ  rst 
made English and Swahili its ofﬁ  cial languages, decided to drop English in the face of public opposition to rules requiring candidates for public ofﬁ  ce to pass a test of their ability to use English.
The ofﬁ  cial languages in a country are a reﬂ  ec-
tion of the country’s history. In Peru, Spanish and the Amerindian language Quechuan have ofﬁ  cial status 
and are found in distinct regions. In the Philippines, English (spoken primarily in Manila) and a creolized Spanish called Pilipino are both ofﬁ  cial languages. 
Tiny Singapore, the city-state at the tip of the Malay Peninsula, has four ofﬁ  cial languages: English, Chinese, Malay, and T amil (an Indian tongue). India is the coun-try with the largest number of ofﬁ  cial languages—22 if we include both ofﬁ  cial languages listed in the country’s constitution and ofﬁ  cial languages proclaimed by States within India.

circumstances, the role of English as an international 
language of commerce will grow.
We must be careful in this conclusion, however. 
Anyone looking at the world 200 years ago would have predicted French as the principal language of cross-cultural communication in the future. Times are different now, of course. The role of English in the computer revolution alone makes it hard to imagine a fundamental shift away from the dominance of English in international affairs. Y et, economic and politi-cal influences on language use are always in flux, and nothing is inevitable.
Choose a country in the world. Imagine you become a strong leader of a centralized government in the country. Pick a language used in the country other than the tongue spoken by the majority. Determine what policies you could put in place to make the minority language an ofﬁ  cial language of the country. What reactions would your initiative generate? Who would support it and who would not?If global language means the principal language 
people use around the world in their day-to-day activi-ties, the geographical processes we have examined so far emphatically do not point to the emergence of English as a global tongue. Population growth rates are gener-ally lower in English-speaking areas than they are in other areas, and little evidence shows people in non-English speaking areas willing to abandon their local language in favor of English. Indeed, since language embodies deeply held cultural views and is a basic fea-ture of cultural identity, many people actively resist switching to English.
Y et if global language means a common language 
of trade and commerce used around the world, the pic-ture looks rather different. Although not always wel-
comed, the trend throughout much of the world is to use English as a language of cross-cultural communi-cation—especially in the areas of science, technology, travel, business, and education (Fig. 6.18). Korean scholars are likely to communicate with their Russian counterparts in English; Japanese scientiﬁ  c journals are increasingly published in English; Danish tourists visit-ing Italy may use English to get around; and the meet-ings of most international ﬁ  nancial and governmental institutions are dominated by English. Under these Field Note
“English is an important part of the curriculum even at a small school for deaf children in remote Bhu-tan.  The children and I began com-municating by writing questions to each other on the blackboard.  Their English is quite good, and I am reminded once again of the incred-ible global reach of English, despite its idiosyncrasies. In English, light is pronounced as if it were lite, the past tense of the verb to read is read, but the past tense of the word to lead is led.”

explains that some of the most interesting toponyms 
are manufactured, such as T ruth or Consequences, 
New Mexico, which voted to change its name to honor a 1950s radio game show. Stewart’s ﬁ  nal category of toponyms is shift names. Shift names include relocated names, examples of relocation diffusion and typically found in migrant communities (Lancaster, England to Lancaster, Pennsylvania).
Knowing Stewart’s ten categories of toponyms at 
the very least helps us understand that a story lies behind every toponym we encounter in our travels. The stories of toponyms quite often have their roots in migration, move-ment, and interaction among people. When languages diffuse through migration, so too do toponyms. Studying the toponyms in a place can tell us much about the histori-cal migration of peoples. George Stewart’s classic book on toponyms reveals many clusters of migrants and cor-responding toponyms. Often the toponyms remain long after the migrants moved on. Clusters of Welsh toponyms in Pennsylvania, French toponyms in Louisiana, and Dutch toponyms in Michigan reveal migration ﬂ  ows and 
also can provide insight into language change and evolu-tion of dialects.
Toponyms and Globalization
Brazil provides an interesting case study of migration ﬂ ows and toponyms. Most Brazilian toponyms are 
Portuguese, reﬂ  ecting the Portuguese colonization of the land. Amid the Portuguese toponyms sits a cluster of German toponyms in the southern state of Santa Catarina. The map of the state is marked by the place-naming activities of German immigrants. For example, the German word for ﬂ  ower is “Blume,” and several last names in German begin with “Blum.” The German immigrants had a fondness for the tropical ﬂ  owers 
they saw in Brazil: southern Brazil is therefore dotted with towns named Blumenau, Blumberg, Blumenhof, Blumenort, Blumenthal, and Blumenstein. Brazilian toponyms also reveal the enormous ﬂ  ow of forced migration from West Africa to Brazil during the slave trade. The Brazilian State of Bahia has a number of top-onyms that originated in West Africa, especially Benin and Nigeria.
The toponyms we see on a map depend in large part 
on who produced the map. Some embattled locales have more than one name at the same time. Argentineans refer to a small cluster (archipelago) of islands off the southeast coast of South America as the Malvinas, but the British call the same cluster of islands the Falkland Islands. In 1982, Argentina invaded the Malvinas, but the British forces fought back, and the islands remain under British control. British, American, and other allies call and map the islands as the Falklands, but Argentineans continue to WHAT ROLE DOES LANGUAGE PLAY 
IN MAKING PLACES?
The cultural geographer Yi-Fu T uan has studied the 
role and function of language in the shaping of places. He 
researched the way people use language as a tool to give perceptual meaning to areas on the Earth’s surface, large and small. Each place has a unique location and consti-tutes a reﬂ  ection of human activities, ideas, and tangible, durable creations. T uan argued that by simply naming a place, people in effect call that place into being, and thereby impart a certain character to it.
Geographers call place-names toponyms. Such 
names often refer to the social processes going on in a par-ticular area, and these may determine whether a toponym is passed down or changed, how the people will interpret the history of a place, and how the people will see a place. T uan contrasts the examples of “Mount Prospect” and “Mount Misery” to help us understand that a name alone can color the character of a place and even the experiences of people in a place. If you planned to travel to “Mount Prospect,” your expectations and even your experiences might well be quite different than a trip to “Mount Misery.”
The Ten Toponyms
A toponym can give us a quick glimpse into the history of a place. Simply by knowing who named the place and how the name was chosen helps us understand the uniqueness of a place. In his book, Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States  
(1982), English professor George Stewart recognized that certain themes dominate American toponyms. Stewart developed a classiﬁ  cation scheme focused on ten basic types of place-names, including: descriptive (Rocky Mountains), commendatory (Paradise Valley, Arizona), 
and possession (Johnson City, T exas) (T able 6.2). Stewart

call and map the islands as the Malvinas. The war ended in 
a matter of weeks, but the underlying dispute lingers, and so do both names.
Changing Toponyms
T uan explained that when people change the toponym of a place, they have the power to “wipe out the past and call forth the new.” For example, people in a small town in Wales feared the loss of the Welsh language and despised the role the English had played in diminish-ing the use of the Welsh language. They also wanted to boost their local economy by attracting tourists to their town. A century ago, the people renamed their town with a Welsh word unpronounceable by others: Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysilio gogogoch (Fig. 6.19). The name accurately describes the town in northern Wales, “The Church of St. Mary in the hollow of white hazel near the rapid whirlpool by the church of St. T ysilio of the red cave.” Since 1988, Wales has had an ofﬁ  cial policy of teaching both Welsh and English in the schools in order to preserve and boost usage of the Welsh language. Pronouncing the name of this town correctly is now a benchmark for students learn-ing Welsh, and the residents of the town take pride in their ability to pronounce it. Figure 6.19

T oponyms are part of the cultural landscape. 
Changes in place-names give us an idea of the layers of 
history, the layers of cultural landscape in a place. For example, on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, where Clare Swan (whom we cited earlier in this chapter) is from, the changing place-names give us insight into iden-tity questions in the place. Natives in one town on the Kenai Peninsula called their home Nanwalek in the early 1800s; when the Russians came in and took over the pen-insula, they changed the name to Alexandrof. Americans mapped Alaska and then made it a State, and in the pro-cess, they changed the name to English Bay. In 1991, the townspeople changed the name of their home back to Nanwalek. When you arrive in Nanwalek, you will see native people, see signs of the Russian Orthodox religion, hear them speak English, and then talk with the native people who are reviving their native language and cul-ture. The changes in the place-name provide insight into the cultural landscape.
Postcolonial Toponyms
The question of changing toponyms often arises when power changes hands in a place. When African colonies became independent countries, many of the new gov-ernments immediately changed the toponyms of places named after colonial ﬁ  gures. The new governments c06Language.indd Page 198  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 198  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401
 What Role Does Language Play in Making Places?   199
In the same time frame, South Africa experienced 
a major revolution that also resulted in a fundamen-
tal change in governance. T oday, the government of South Africa is wrestling with pressures for and against toponym changes. The government restructured the country’s administrative framework, creating nine provinces out of four and giving some of the new prov-inces African names (Mpumalanga for the new Eastern T ransvaal, Gauteng for a new central province). One of the old provinces, Natal, has become Kwazulu-Natal. The government also changed some names of towns and villages, but South Africa’s map still includes many names from the Boer-British and Apartheid periods. Name changes can evoke strong reactions from people, and the South African government is trying to move slowly and carefully to avoid arousing emotions in their still-divided country.
Memorial Toponyms
People can choose to change a toponym to memorialize an important person or event. Hundreds of parks in the United States are named Memorial Park for hundreds of such persons and events. T owns or government agencies can vote to change the name of a school, a library, or a public building to memorialize people who have played a role in shaping the place or who have had an enormous inﬂ uence on people in the place.
Certain events such as decolonization or a politi-
cal revolution can spur changes in toponyms, and so too can revolutions in thought and behavior. The civil rights movement of the 1960s in the United States left many lasting impressions of people and events, especially in the South, where many protests, sit-ins, and marches occurred. Geographer Derek Alderman explains that, in recent decades, African Americans in the South have “taken a particularly active role in reconstructing commemorative landscapes—from call-ing for the removal of Confederate symbols from pub-lic places to the building of memorials and museums honoring the civil rights movement.” Streets are often the focal point of commemoration in the cultural land-scape because so many people travel along them daily, serving as a constant reminder of the person or event being memorialized.
Alderman studied the practice of changing street 
names to memorialize Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK), the major African American leader of the civil rights movement. Although streets named after MLK are found throughout the United States, the greatest con-centration of memorial streets are in the South, espe-cially in Georgia (King’s home state) and Mississippi (Fig. 6.20). Alderman studied the distribution of MLK streets in the South, comparing their locations with census data on race and socioeconomics. He found renamed several countries: Upper Volta to Burkina Faso, Gold Coast to Ghana, Nyasaland to Malawi, and Northern and Southern Rhodesia to Zambia and Zimbabwe, respectively. Countries in Asia also chose new toponyms to mark their independence and sepa-rate themselves from their past: East Pakistan became Bangladesh, and the Netherlands East Indies became Indonesia.
Newly independent countries also changed the 
names of cities and towns to reﬂ  ect their independence. 
Thus, Leopoldville (named after a Belgian king) became Kinshasa, capital of the Congo; Salisbury, Zimbabwe, named after a British leader, became Harare; and Lourenço Marques, Mozambique, commemorating a Portuguese naval hero, became Maputo. However, newly independent countries did not wipe all colonial names and references from their maps. Etoile (the Congo), Colleen Bawn (Zimbabwe), and Cabo Delgado (Mozambique) remain on the postcolonial map.
Postrevolution Toponyms
Independence prompts name changes, and so too do changes in power through coups and revolutions. During his reign, authoritarian dictator, General Mobutu Sese Seko, changed the name of the Belgian Congo in Subsaharan Africa to Zaïre. At ﬁ  rst, other governments and international agencies did not take this move seri-ously, but eventually they recognized Mobutu’s Zaïre. Governments and companies changed their maps and atlases to reﬂ  ect Mobutu’s decision. The government of 
Zaïre changed the name of their money from the franc to the zaïre, and they even changed the name of the Congo River to the Zaïre.
In 1997, the revolutionary leader Laurent Kabila 
ousted Mobutu and established his regime in the capital, Kinshasa. Almost immediately, he renamed the country. Zaïre became the Democratic Republic of the Congo (reﬂ ecting the colonial name). Again, governments and 
companies reacted, changing their maps and atlases to reﬂ ect Kabila’s decision.
Recent revolutions in power in Russia and South 
Africa led to many changes in toponyms in these coun-tries. When the Soviet Union began, the communist gov-ernment changed many places named for tsars who were in power before them, replacing them (of course) with Soviet names. Once the Soviet Union collapsed, a new round of name changes occurred, often going back to T sarist-era names. In the new Russia, Leningrad reverted to St. Petersburg, Sverdlovsk went back to Y ekaterinburg (its name under the tsars), and Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd (for the river). Reformers, nationalists, and lingering communists argued bitterly over the toponym changes, and many people continued to address their mail according to their city’s former name.c06Language.indd Page 199  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401c06Language.indd Page 199  9/12/11  11:09 AM user-f401 F-401F-401

1983 and Disneyland Paris in 1990, both places that capi-
talize on the success of Disneyland and Disneyworld in the United States. As corporations spread their names and logos to other places, they seek to “brand” places, creating or re-creating places that consumers associate with places of the same brand.
In recent years, the activities of corporations 
with a global reach have been stamped on the land-scape. Stadiums are especially susceptible to this form of commodiﬁ  cation: FedEx Field, MCI Center, Fleet Center, and Coors Field are perfect examples. In 2004, the Metropolitan T ransit Authority in New Y ork City proposed renaming the metro stops, bridges, and tun-nels after corporate sponsors. Instead of the Lincoln T unnel, we could be traveling through the T arget T unnel, and instead of stopping at Times Square, we could be stopping at Disney Times Square (which, ironically is already named for a company—the New 
York Times).
This place was ﬁ  rst named by Gabrielino Indians. In 1769, 
Spanish Franciscan priests renamed the place. In 1850, English speakers renamed the place. Do not use the Internet to help you. Use only maps in this book or in atlases to help you deduce what this place is. Maps of European exploration and colonialism will help you the most. Look at the end of the chapter summary for the answer.that although MLK streets are found in both cities and rural areas, “MLK streets are located—whether by choice or by force—in census areas that are generally poorer and with more African Americans than citywide averages.” (Fig. 6.21) Alderman tempers this finding with a caution that not all MLK streets are located in poorer areas of cities. Even when MLK streets are located in depresssed areas, the African American pop-ulation may have purposefully chosen a street because it runs through an African American neighborhood. Alderman’s subsequent studies explore the scale of the city and the contested views of what kinds of streets should be named for MLK—be they residential, com-mercial, major thoroughfares (perhaps those that con-nect white and African American neighborhoods), or residential streets in largely African American neigh-borhoods.
The presence of streets named for civil rights lead-
ers in the cultural landscapes of the American South cre-ates a signiﬁ  cant counterbalance to the numerous places 
of commemoration named for leaders of the Confederacy during the Civil War (see Chapter 1).
Commodiﬁ  cation of Toponyms
The practice of commodifying (buying, selling, and trad-ing) toponyms is growing, especially in areas largely within the fold of popular culture. International media corpora-tions that reach across the globe bring known names to new places, drawing consumers to the place based on what they have heard or experienced elsewhere. For example, the Disney Corporation opened T okyo Disneyland in  Figure 6.20

Greenville, North Carolina
Greenville, North Carolina, changed West Fifth 
Street to Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in 1999. Originally, African American leaders wanted all of Fifth Street renamed—not just part of it—but residents and business owners on the east-ern end strongly opposed the proposal. After driving and walking down the street, I quickly realized that King Drive marked an area that was predominantly black with limited commercial development, whereas East Fifth was mostly white and more upscale. When I interviewed members of Greenville’s African American com-munity, they expressed deep frustration over the marginalization of the civil rights leader. In the words of one elected ofﬁ  cial, “The accomplishments of Dr. King were important to all Americans. A whole man deserves 
a whole street!” Naming streets for King is a controversial process for many cities, often exposing continued racial tensions and the potential for toponyms to function as contested social boundaries within places.

201Summary
The global mosaic of languages reﬂ  ects centuries of divergence, convergence, extinction, and diffusion. Linguists and linguistic geographers have the interesting work of uncov-ering, through deep reconstruction, the hearths of the world’s language families. Some languages, such as Basque, defy explanation. Other languages are the foci of countless studies, many of which come to differing conclusions about their ancient origins.
As certain languages, such as English and Chinese, gain speakers and become 
global languages, other languages become extinct. Some languages come to serve as the lingua franca of a region or place. Governments choose ofﬁ  cial languages, and through public schools, educators entrench an ofﬁ  cial language in a place. Some countries, faced with the global diffusion of the English language, defend and promote their national language. Whether requiring signs to be written a certain way or requiring a television station to broadcast some proportion of programming in the national language, gov-ernments can preserve language, choose a certain dialect as the standard, or repel the diffusion of other languages.
Regardless of the place, the people, or the language used, language continues to 
deﬁ ne, shape, and maintain culture. How a person thinks about the world is reﬂ  ected in 
the words used to describe and deﬁ  ne it.

Field Note Dying and Resurrecting
When I made my ﬁ  rst trip to the Soviet Union in 1964, the world was divided into 
West and East in the Cold War. I was cataloging the unique cultural landscape in my mind as my group drove along a road from Leningrad to Moscow: I was look-
ing for evidence of communism on the landscape. The rural areas were ﬁ  lled with 
state and collective farms. To me, the most interesting aspect of the landscape was the multitude of churches in ruins.
In every town we passed, and in many villages along the way, churches lay in 
ruins, their roofs collapsed, their steeples toppled. The bells were gone; where stained-glass windows once adorned the churches there were now gaping holes (Fig. 7.1). My host did not want me to photograph the churches.
“Why let them collapse?” I asked, “Why not remove them altogether?” He 
pointed his ﬁ  nger to emphasize his point, “Religion causes conﬂ  ict. We had many 
religions in the Soviet Union, and they set Soviet against Soviet. And the Orthodox

Church opposed our communist victory. That’s what these useless relics are for. 
They remind the people of our victory and their freedom.”
When the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was established in 1924, 
the communist regime led by Vladimir Lenin inherited a multicultural empire orig-inally forged by ruthless tsars whose cruelties precipitated the revolution in the ﬁ rst place. The Soviet Union (short for USSR) extended from Eastern Europe to the 
Paciﬁ  c Ocean and from the Arctic to Central Asia. It was territorially the largest 
state in the world and culturally one of the most diverse.
Planners of the Soviet Union ofﬁ  cially recognized the cultural diversity 
of the country by creating “republics” mostly named after the dominant peo-ple within the boundaries of each republic, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, and Russia. Culturally, the Soviet Union favored Russia, which was evidenced by the country’s policy of Russiﬁ  cation. Through 
Russiﬁ  cation, the Soviet Union sought to spread the Russian language and cul-
ture throughout the entire Soviet Union. Politically, the Soviet Union believed its people would show less allegiance to their republics and more allegiance to the Soviet Union if power rested in the local rather than the republic scale. Each republic had a diversity of people within its boundaries. The Republic of Russia, for example, included 70 distinct territories, which largely corresponded with ethnic groups.
Culturally, the Soviet Union also espoused an ofﬁ  cial policy of atheism with 
the goal of discouraging and suppressing religious practice. This was no easy task: among Soviet citizens were many millions of adherents to numerous faiths ranging from Christianity to Buddhism and from Islam to Judaism. In the Russian Republic, the Russian Orthodox Church was at the heart of Slavic culture.
The Russian Orthodox Church posed the greatest potential challenge to 
communist rule, so Soviet leaders set about arresting religious leaders, closing churches, seizing church bells and other religious paraphernalia. As a result, much of the Russian Orthodox Church’s architectural heritage and artistic legacy was lost. The Soviet government forced schools to teach the “evils” of religious belief. Many churches, such as the one in Figure 7.1, were simply left to decay; others were converted to “practical” uses such as storage sheds and even livestock barns.
In more remote corners of the Soviet Union, where Islam was ﬁ  rmly estab-
lished, the communist rulers tolerated Islamic practice among the old, but not among the young, who were indoctrinated into the tenets of Marxism. The Soviets appeared to regard Buddhism as a lesser threat; the mostly Buddhist Kalmyks did not face the same pressure. Jewish citizens saw their synagogues close, but close-knit communities often managed to stay below the communist radar. In any case, the Soviet planners believed that time would slowly but surely erase the imprints of the empire’s many faiths.
By the 1960s, when I took this photo, it seemed as though the Soviet plan 
to diminish religion would succeed. In the mainly Muslim republics, Islam was tightly controlled and in retreat, but Islamic structures tended to be preserved as museums or libraries. However, in the Russian Republic, Moscow showed little residue of centuries of Orthodox Christianity. In 1931 the Soviet regime decided to destroy one of Moscow’s great monuments, the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. The Soviet government planned to build a palace to commemorate Soviet lead-ers on the site. The government never built the palace, and the large pit that was to contain its foundation marked the site for decades. Russian geographer Dmitri Sidorov described the pit as “Russia’s most famous geographical symbol for the failed communist endeavor.”c07Religion.indd Page 204  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 204  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 What Is Religion, and What Role Does It Play In Culture? 205
WHAT IS RELIGION, AND WHAT ROLE 
DOES IT PLAY IN CULTURE?
Religion and language lie at the foundation of cul-
ture: both confer and reﬂ  ect identity. Like languages, reli-
gions are constantly changing. Although religious leaders 
and bureaucracies sometimes attempt to slow the pace of change, religions nevertheless change over time.
Religions diffuse through expansion diffusion, 
including both contagious and hierarchical, and reli-gions also diffuse through relocation diffusion. In any of these cases, leaders or followers of a religion interact with people who do not espouse the religion, and the interac-tions sometimes lead to conversion. Spatial interaction occurs because of migration, missionary efforts, and even conquest. Along these paths, major religions of the world have diffused.
The cultural landscape is marked by religion—
most obviously by church, synagogues, temples, and mosques, cemeteries and shrines, statues and symbols (Fig. 7.2). Other more subtle markers of religion dot the landscape as well. The presence or absence of stores selling alcohol or of signs depicting the human form in particular ways reﬂ  ect prevailing religious views. Religion is also proclaimed in modes of dress (veils, turbans) and personal habits (beards, ritual scars). The outward display of religious beliefs often reveals the inward structure of a religion. For example, in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, in 1991, the government proclaimed that possessing a beard would be a condi-tion for the appointment of judges. The beard require-ment is an outward display of religion, and it also shows the inward structure of Islam in Pakistan, where women are not in a place of judicial power.
Religion is an extraordinarily difﬁ  cult concept to 
deﬁ ne. In the chapter “Geography of Religion and Belief 
Systems,” written for Geography in America, geographers Robert Stoddard and Carolyn Prorak deﬁ  ne religion as 
“a system of beliefs and practices that attempts to order life in terms of culturally perceived ultimate priorities.” Stoddard and Prorak explain that the idea of “perceived ultimate priorities” is often expressed in terms of “should”: people explain and justify how they and others “should” behave based on their religious beliefs. From eating habits to dress codes, religions set standards for how adherents “should” behave (Fig. 7.3). “Shouldness” goes beyond religion to other belief systems, but in this chapter we focus on formal religions, their distribution, and their role in making and shaping places and cultures. The idea that a “good” life has rewards and that “bad” behavior risks pun-ishment has an enormous inﬂ  uence on cultures, on how 
people behave, and on how people perceive and evaluate the behavior of others.When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russians soon proved that 
they had not forgotten their faith. The Russian Orthodox Church revived dra-
matically, churches were rebuilt and reopened, Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Savior was re-created, and church leaders once again took their place in national affairs. Religion is a durable, perhaps the most durable, element of cul-
ture at all scales, and religious beliefs and behavior are intertwined with pol-itics, economics, and other components of culture. In this chapter we study the origins, diffusions, and transformations of the world’s great religions, their regional patterns and cultural landscapes. As we will ﬁ  nd, religion can unite and divide, ﬂ  ourish and stagnate, surge and fade. Understanding the changing map of world religions and the role of religion in culture is essential to appreciating human geography.

“Each religion approaches the disposition of 
the deceased in different ways, and cultural landscapes reﬂ  ect religious traditions. In largely 
Christian, western regions, the deceased are buried in large, sometimes elaborate cemeter-ies. The Hindu faith requires cremation of the deceased. Wherever large Hindu communities exist outside of India, you will see crematori-ums, the equivalent of a Hindu funeral home.”Field Note

 What Is Religion, and What Role Does It Play In Culture? 207
Religion manifests itself in many different ways. 
We can see religion in the worship of the souls of ances-
tors who are thought to inhabit natural objects such as mountains, animals, or trees; in the belief that a certain living person possesses special abilities granted by a super-natural power; and in the belief in a deity or deities, as in the great world religions. In some places, societies are so infused with religion that religious tradition strongly inﬂ uences behaviors during waking hours through ritual 
and practice and even during periods of sleep in prescrib-ing the orientation of the body.
Across the multitude of religions, some religious 
practices such as ritual and prayer are common. Rituals may mark important events in people’s lives: birth and death, attainment of adulthood, or marriage. Rituals are typically expressed at regular intervals in a routine manner, as is done on certain days in the Christian and Jewish worlds, certain times of the day in the Muslim world, or according to certain astronomical events in the Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, and Christian worlds. A common ritual is prayer, whether at mealtime, at sunrise and sundown, at night upon retiring, or in the morning when arising.
Although religious beliefs and prescriptions inﬂ  u-
ence many societies, in other places, religion, at least in its organized form, has become less signiﬁ  cant in the lives of people. Secularism is the indifference to or rejection of 
formal religion. The most secular countries in the world today are in Europe. A 2009 Pew survey asked people in 56 countries how important religion is in their lives. Among the wealthiest countries surveyed, the United States stood out as the highest, with 57 percent of Americans sur-veyed saying religion is very important in their lives. Only 13 percent of people surveyed in France, 8 percent in Sweden, and 7 percent in the Czech Republic agreed that religion is very important in their lives. Regionally, survey respondents in Subsaharan Africa, South Asia, Southwest Asia, and South America more strongly agreed that reli-gion is very important in their lives: 98 percent in Senegal, 97 percent in Bangladesh, 95 percent in Indonesia, and 78 percent in Brazil reported religion to be very important in their lives.
Although survey respondents in Europe largely did 
not see religion as very important in their lives today, religion certainly had a critical role in the history of Europe. During the Middle Ages and into the colonial period, the Christian church was a dominant force polit-ically, economically and culturally in Europe. Because Christianity was a major part of life in Europe for cen-turies, much of the art, architecture, history, customs, and cultural norms derive from Christian beliefs and teachings (Fig. 7.4). Even if your society is secular and regardless of your religious beliefs, what you eat, when you work, when you shop, and what you are allowed to do are inﬂ  uenced by religion.Regardless of the religion, the number of adherents, 
or the place, organized religion has a powerful effect on human societies. It has been a major force in combat-ing social ills, sustaining the poor, promoting the arts, educating the deprived, and advancing medical knowl-edge. However, religion has also blocked scientiﬁ  c study, 
encouraged the oppression of dissidents, supported colonialism and exploitation, and condemned women to an inferior status in many societies. Religion is, if noth-ing else, one of the most complex and often controversial aspects of the human condition.

208 Chapter 7  Religion
Describe how religion and language affect and change each 
other to shape cultures. Consider what happens to a soci-ety’s religion and language when a different religion or lan-guage diffuses to the place.
WHERE DID THE MAJOR RELIGIONS 
OF THE WORLD ORIGINATE, AND HOW DO RELIGIONS DIFFUSE?
Despite the wide variety of religions found around 
the world, they are commonly classiﬁ  ed into three catego-
ries based on their approaches to the concept of divinity. Adherents of monotheistic religions worship a single deity, a God or Allah. Believers in polytheistic religions worship more than one deity, even thousands. Animistic religions are centered on the belief that inanimate objects, such as mountains, boulders, rivers, and trees, possess spirits and should therefore be revered.
Throughout much of human history, virtually all 
religions were either animistic, polytheistic, or both. Somewhere around 3500 years ago, however, a mono-theistic religion developed in Southwest Asia called Zoroastrianism. (The Parsi we talked about at the begin-ning of Chapter 4 are Zoroastrians who moved to India.) Some believe that the monotheism of late Judaism, Christianity, and Islam can be traced to Zoroastrian inﬂ  u-ences. Others believe that Judaism itself was the ﬁ  rst 
monotheistic religion. Whichever the case, the eventual diffusion of Christianity and Islam spread monotheistic ideas throughout much of the world and marked a major theological shift from the long dominance of polytheis-tic and animist beliefs in most places. The transforma-tion from polytheistic to monotheistic religions happened quite rapidly in Subsaharan Africa. In 1900, neither reli-gion had many followers in Subsaharan Africa, though Islam had many followers in North Africa by 1900. By 2010, the number of Muslims in Subsaharan Africa had grown from 11 million to 234 million, and the number of Christians had grown from 7 million to 470 million.
By 500 bce (Before the Common Era), four major 
hearths of religion and philosophy were developed in the world (Fig. 7.5). The hearth of Greek philosophy is along the northern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. From a hearth in South Asia, along the Indus River Valley, came Hinduism; from a hearth on the eastern Mediterranean came Judaism; and from a hearth on the Huang He River Valley in China came Chinese philosophies. These early-established reli-gions and philosophies profoundly impacted other religions, as the arrows in Figure 7.5 demonstrate. Philosophies and religions diffused from their hearths, affecting one another and inﬂ  uencing the ways founders established newer reli-gions. The two religions with the greatest number of adher-ents in the world today, Christianity and Islam, were both inﬂ uenced by Judaism and Greek philosophy.

 Where Did the Major Religions of the World Originate, and How Do Religions Diffuse?  209
world religions is a generalization, and caution must be 
used when making observations from the map. First, the shadings on the map show the major religion in an area, thereby masking minority religions, many of which have a signiﬁ  cant number of followers. India, for example, is 
depicted as a Hindu region (except in the northwest), but other religions, such as Islam and Sikhism, attract millions of adherents in India. Of the 1.2 billion people in India, 161 million are Muslims, which makes India the third largest Muslim country in the world behind Indonesia and Pakistan.
Second, some of the regions shown as belonging to 
a particular religion are places where faiths have pene-trated relatively recently and where traditional religious ideas inﬂ  uence the practice of the dominant faith. Many Christian and Muslim Africans, for example, continue to believe in traditional powers even as they profess a belief in a universalizing religion. A 2010 Pew Research survey of 25,000 people in 19 African countries found “Large numbers of Africans actively participate in Christianity or Islam yet also believe in witchcraft, evil spirits, sacriﬁ  ces to ancestors, traditional religious heal-ers, reincarnation and other elements of traditional African religions.” The survey found 25 percent of Christian Africans and 30 percent of Muslim Africans they interviewed believed in the protective power of sacriﬁ  ces to spirits or ancestors. The country with the 
highest percentage of respondents who agreed with this statement was T anzania with 60 percent, and the lowest was Rwanda with 5 percent.
In Cameroon, 42 percent of those surveyed believed 
in the protective power of sacriﬁ  ces to spirits or ancestors. For example, the Bamileke tribe in Cameroon lives in an area colonized by the French, who brought Catholicism to the region. The Bamileke are largely Christian today, but they also continue to practice aspects of their tradi-tional, animist religion. Ancestors are still very impor-tant in the lives of the Bamileke. Many believe ancestors decide everything for them. It is common practice to take the skull of a deceased male member of the tribe and place it in the basement of the home of the family’s oldest liv-ing male. Birth practices also reﬂ  ect traditional religious practices. The Bamileke bury the umbilical cord in the ground outside their home so that the baby remembers where he or she came from. Members of the Bamileke tribe also commonly have two weddings today: one in the church and one traditional.
Finally, Figure 7.6 does not reﬂ  ect the rise in sec-
ularism in the world, especially in Europe. In a number of areas many people have moved away from organized religion entirely. Thus, France appears on the map as a Roman Catholic country, yet a large proportion of peo-ple in France profess adherence to no particular faith, and only 13 percent of French people say religion is very important in their lives.Despite the limitations of the map of world reli-
gions, it illustrates how far Christian religions have dif-fused (2.25 billion adherents worldwide), the extent of the diffusion of Islam (1.57 billion), the connection between Hinduism (950 million adherents) and one of the world’s major population concentrations, and the continued importance Buddhism (347 million followers) plays in parts of Asia. Many factors help explain the distributions shown on the map, but each of the widespread religions shares one characteristic in common: they are all uni-versalizing religions. Universalizing religions actively seek converts because they view themselves as offering belief systems of universal appropriateness and appeal. Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism all fall within this cate-gory, and their universalizing character helps explain their widespread distribution.
Universalizing religions are relatively few in num-
ber and of recent origin. Throughout human history, a greater number of religions have not actively sought converts. Rather, a given religion has been practiced by one particular culture or ethnic group. In an ethnic reli-gion, adherents are born into the faith and converts are not actively sought. Ethnic religions tend to be spatially concentrated—as is the case with traditional religions in Africa and South America (250 million followers). The principal exception is Judaism (13 million adherents), an ethnic religion whose adherents are widely scattered as a result of forced and voluntary migrations.

Hinduism
In terms of number of adherents, Hinduism ranks 
third after Christianity and Islam as a world religion. Hinduism is one of the oldest religions in the modern world, dating back over 4000 years, originating in the Indus River Valley of what is today part of Pakistan. Hinduism is unique among world religions in a number of ways. The religion does not have a single founder, a single theology, or agreement on its origins. The com-mon account of the history of Hinduism holds that the religion is based on ancient practices in the Indus River cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. The ancient prac-tices included ritual bathing and belief in reincarnation, or at least a long journey after death. The common his-tory says that Aryans invaded (some say migrated) into the Indus region and gave the name Hinduism to the diverse religious practices of the people who lived along the Indus River.
Despite the ambiguous beginnings of Hinduism, 
one thing is certain: Hinduism is no longer associ-ated with its hearth in Pakistan. The vast majority of Pakistanis are Muslim, and as Figure 7.6 demonstrates, the vast majority of Indians are Hindu. Archaeologists c07Religion.indd Page 209  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 209  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

hypothesize that ﬂ  ooding along the Indus spurred the 
migration of early Hindus eastward to the Ganges River. The Ganges (Ganga, as Indians call it) is Hinduism’s sacred river. Hindus regard its ceaseless ﬂ ow and spiritual healing power as Earthly manifesta-
tions of the Almighty.
Just as there is no consensus on Hinduism’s ori-
gins, there is a lack of agreement on deﬁ  ning Hinduism 
relative to other major world religions. Some deﬁ  ne Hinduism as a polytheistic religion because of the pres-ence of many gods. However, many Hindus deﬁ  ne their 
religion as monotheistic. The one god is Brahman (the universal soul), and the other gods in the religion are various expressions of Brahman. Similarly, Western academics deﬁ  ne Hinduism today as an ethnic religion because Hindus do not actively seek converts. At the same time, historical evidence shows Hindus migrat-ing into Southeast Asia and diffusing their religion, as I

a universalizing religion would, before the diffusion 
of Buddhism and Islam into Southeast Asia (Fig. 7.7). Although Hinduism is now more of an ethnic religion, the religion has millions of adherents in the popu-lous region of South Asia, extending beyond India to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.
The Hindu religion is not centrally organized. The 
religion does not have an administrative or bureaucratic structure like Christianity and Islam. The Hindu reli-gion does not have a prophet or a single book of scrip-tures, although most Hindus recognize the sacredness of the Vedas, the four texts that make up the sacred books of 
Hinduism. Hinduism is a conglomeration of beliefs char-acterized by a great diversity of institutional forms and practices. The fundamental doctrine is karma, which has to do with the transferability of the soul. According to Hindu doctrine, all beings have souls and are arranged in a hierar-chy. The ideal is to move upward in the hierarchy and then escape from the eternal cycle of reincarnation through union with Brahman (the universal soul). A soul moves upward or downward according to the individual’s behavior in the present life. Good deeds and adherence to the faith lead to a higher level in the next life, whereas bad behavior leads to demotion to a lower level. All souls, those of animals as well as humans, participate in this process. The principle of reincarnation is a cornerstone of Hinduism.
Hinduism’s doctrines are closely bound to Indian 
society’s caste system, for castes themselves are steps on the universal ladder. However, the caste system locks people into particular social classes and imposes many restrictions, I

especially in the lowest of the castes and in those consid-
ered beneath the caste system, Dalits. Until a generation ago, Dalits could not enter temples, were excluded from certain schools, and were restricted to performing the most unpleasant tasks. The coming of other religions to India, the effects of modernization during the colonial period, the work of Mahatma Gandhi, and afﬁ  rmative action policies helped loosen the social barriers of the caste system. The Indian government’s afﬁ  rmative action policies reserve seats in universities and jobs in government for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and Dalits.
Diffusion of Hinduism
As Figure 7.8 shows, Hinduism evolved in what is today Pakistan. From there, Hinduism migrated to the Ganges River and diffused throughout South Asia and into Southeast Asia before the advent of Christianity. It ﬁ rst attached itself to traditional faiths and then slowly 
replaced them. Later, when Islam and Christianity appeared and were actively spread in Hindu areas, Hindu thinkers attempted to integrate certain new teachings into their own religion. For example, elements of the Sermon on the Mount (Jesus’ sermon in which he described God’s love for the poor and the peacemakers) now form part of Hindu preaching, and Christian beliefs contributed to the weakening of caste barriers. In other instances, the con-frontation between Hinduism and other faiths led to the emergence of a compromise religion. Islam stimulated the rise of Sikhism, whose followers disapproved of the wor-ship of idols and disliked the caste system, but retained the concepts of reincarnation and karma.
Given its current character as an ethnic religion, it 
is not surprising that Hinduism’s geographical extent is relatively small. Indeed, throughout most of Southeast Asia, Buddhism and Islam overtook the places where Hinduism had diffused during its universalizing period. In overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia, the island of Bali remains a Hindu outpost. Bali became a refuge for Hindu holy men, nobles, and intellectuals during the sixteenth century, when Islam engulfed neighboring Java, which now retains only architectural remnants of its Hindu age. Since then, the Balinese have developed a unique faith, still based on Hindu principles but mixed with elements of Buddhism, animism, and ancestor worship. Religion plays an extremely important role in Bali. T emples and shrines dominate the cultural landscape, and participation in worship, festivals, and other ceremonies of the island’s unique religion is almost universal. Religion is so much at the heart of Balinese culture that it is sometimes described as a celebration of life.
Outside South Asia and Bali, Hinduism’s presence is 
relatively minor. Over the last two centuries, Hinduism has diffused to small parts of the world through migra-tion. During British colonialism, the British transported hundreds of thousands of Hindu adherents from their colony of India to their other colonies in East and South Africa, the Caribbean, northern South America, and the Paciﬁ  c Islands (see Fig. 7.2). Because Hinduism is not a 
universalizing religion today, the relocation diffusion pro-duced pockets rather than regions of Hinduism.
Buddhism
Buddhism splintered from Hinduism over 2500 years ago. Buddhism and several other religions appeared in India as a reaction to questions about Hinduism’s teach-ings at the time. Reformers questioned Hinduism’s strict social hierarchy that protected the privileged and kept millions in poverty. Prince Siddhartha, who was heir to a wealthy kingdom in what is now Nepal, founded  Figure 7.7
Angkor Wat, Cambodia. The extensive, walled structure at 
the temple complex in Angkor Wat marks the earliest period of Hinduism’s diffusion into Southeast Asia. Eventually, Buddhism supplanted Hinduism in Cambodia, and many Hindu temples such as this now suffer from neglect and destruction.

Buddhism. Siddhartha was profoundly shaken by the mis-
ery he saw around him, which contrasted sharply with the splendor and wealth in which he had been raised. Siddhartha came to be known as Buddha, the enlightened one. He may have been the ﬁ  rst prominent Indian reli-
gious leader to speak out against Hinduism’s caste system. Salvation, he preached, could be attained by anyone, no matter what his or her caste. Enlightenment would come through knowledge, especially self-knowledge; elimina-tion of greed, craving, and desire; complete honesty; and never hurting another person or animal.
After Buddha’s death in 489 bce at the age of 80, 
the faith grew rather slowly until the middle of the third century bce, when the Emperor Asoka became a con-
vert. Asoka was the leader of a large and powerful Indian empire that extended from the Punjab to Bengal and from the Himalayan foothills to Mysore. He not only set out to rule his country in accordance with the teachings of Buddha; he also sent missionaries to carry Buddha’s teachings to distant peoples (Fig. 7.9). Buddhism spread as far south as Sri Lanka and later advanced west toward the Mediterranean, north into Tibet, and east into China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and Indonesia, over a span of about ten centuries (Fig. 7.8). Although Buddhism diffused to distant lands, it began to decline in its region of origin. During Asoka’s rule there may have been more Buddhists than Hindu adherents in India, but after that period Hinduism gained followers in India. T oday Buddhism is practiced by relatively few in India, but thrives in Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, Nepal, Tibet, and Korea. Along with other faiths, Buddhism is part of Japanese culture.
Like Christianity and Islam, Buddhism changed 
as it grew and diffused, and now the religion is strongly regional with different forms in different regions. Buddhism’s various branches have an estimated 347 mil-lion adherents, with Mahayana Buddhism and Theravada 
Buddhism claiming the most adherents. Theravada Buddhism is a monastic faith practiced in Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. It holds that salvation is a personal matter, achieved through good behavior and religious activities, including periods of service as a monk or nun. Mahayana Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in Vietnam, Korea, Japan, and China, holds that salvation can be aided by appeals to super-human, holy sources of merit. The Buddha is regarded as a divine savior. Mahayana Buddhists do not serve as monks, but they spend much time in personal medita-tion and worship. Other branches of Buddhism include the Lamaism of Xizang (Tibet), which combines monas-tic Buddhism with the worship of local demons and dei-ties, and Zen Buddhism, the contemplative form that is prevalent in Japan.
Buddhism has become a global religion over the last 
two centuries, diffusing to many areas of the world, but not without conﬂ  ict in its wake. Militant regimes have 
attacked the religion in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. In Thailand, Buddhism has been under pressure owing to rising political tensions. At the same time, Buddhism has gained adherents in the western world.IBH C60° 60°

Shintoism
Buddhism is mixed with a local religion in Japan, where 
Shintoism is found. This ethnic religion, which is related to Buddhism, focuses particularly on nature and ances-tor worship (Fig. 7.10). The Japanese emperor made Shintoism the state religion of Japan in the nineteenth century, according himself the status of divine-right monarch. At the end of World War II, Japan separated Shintoism from the emperor, taking away the state sanc-tioning of the religion. At the same time, the role of the emperor in Japan was diminished and given a ceremonial status. The number of adherents in Japan is somewhere between 105 and 118 million, depending on the source. The majority of Japanese observe both Buddhism and Shintoism.
From the Hearth of the Huang He River Valley
Taoism
While the Buddha’s teachings were gaining converts in India, a religious revolution of another kind was taking place in China. T wo major schools of Chinese philosophy, T aoism and Confucianism, were forming. The beginnings of Taoism  are unclear, but scholars trace the religion to an 
older contemporary of Confucius, Lao-T su, who published a volume titled T ao-te-ching , or “Book of the Way.” In his 
teachings, Lao-T su focused on the proper form of political rule and on the oneness of humanity and nature: people, he said, should learn to live in harmony with nature. This gave rise to the concept of Feng Shui —the art and sci-
ence of organizing living spaces in order to channel the life forces that exist in nature in favorable ways. According to tradition, nothing should be done to nature without con-sulting the geomancers , people who know the desires of the 
powerful spirits of ancestors, dragons, tigers, and other beings occupying the natural world and can give advice on how to order things according to Feng Shui.
Among the T aoist virtues are simplicity and sponta-
neity, tenderness, and tranquility. Competition, possession, and even the pursuit of knowledge are to be avoided. War, 
punishment, taxation, and ceremonial ostentation are viewed as evils. The best government, according to Lao-T su, is the least government.
Thousands of people began to follow T aoism. 
Followers worshipped Lao-T su as a god, something of

the arrivals of Islam and Christianity and lay overgrown until uncovered and restored under Dutch colonial rule from 1907 to 1911. The monument consists of a set of intricately carved, walled terraces; the upper terraces are open. In the upper terraces  
stand six dozen stupas, each containing a sculpture of the Buddha in meditation, visible when you peer through the openings.”Field Note

which Lao-T su would have disapproved. People, animals, 
even dragons became objects of worship.
Confucianism
Confucius lived from 551 to 479 bce, and his followers 
constructed a blueprint for Chinese civilization in almost every ﬁ  eld, including philosophy, government, and edu-cation. In religion, Confucius addressed the traditional Chinese tenets that included belief in heaven and the existence of the soul, ancestor worship, sacriﬁ  cial rites, 
and shamanism. He held that the real meaning of life lay in the present, not in some future abstract existence, and that service to one’s fellow humans should supersede ser-vice to spirits.
Confucianism is mainly a philosophy of life, and like 
T aoism, Confucianism had great and lasting impacts on Chinese life. Appalled at the suffering of ordinary people at the hands of feudal lords, Confucius urged the poor to assert themselves. He was not a prophet who dealt in prom-ises of heaven and threats of hell. He denied the divine ancestry of China’s aristocratic rulers, educated the landless and the weak, disliked supernatural mysticism, and argued that human virtues and abilities, not heritage, should deter-mine a person’s position and responsibilities in society.
Confucius came to be revered as a spiritual leader 
after his death in 479 bce, and his teachings diffused widely throughout East and Southeast Asia. Followers built temples in his honor all over China. From his writ-ings and sayings emerged the Confucian Classics, a set of 13 texts that became the focus of education in China for 2000 years. Over the centuries, Confucianism (with its T aoist and Buddhist ingredients) became China’s state ethic, although the Chinese emperor modiﬁ  ed Confucian ideals over time. For example, one emperor made worship of and obedience to the emperor part of Confucianism. In government, law, literature, religion, morality, and many other ways, the Confucian Classics were the guide for Chinese civilization.
Diffusion of Chinese Religions
Confucianism diffused early into the Korean Peninsula, Japan, and Southeast Asia, where it has long inﬂ  uenced the 
practice of Buddhism. More recently, Chinese immigrants expanded the inﬂ  uence of the Chinese religions in parts 
of Southeast Asia and helped to introduce their principles into societies ranging from Europe to North America.
The diffusion of Chinese religions even within 
China has been tempered by the Chinese government’s efforts to suppress religion in the country. Like the Soviet government, the communist government that took con-trol of China in 1949 attempted to ban religion, in this case Confucianism, from public practice. But after guid-ing all aspects of Chinese education, culture, and society for 2000 years, Confucianism did not fade easily from the Chinese consciousness. Confucianism and T aoism are so entrenched in Chinese culture that the government’s antireligion initiatives have not had their desired effect. For example, a Chinese government policy in the 1950s that ran counter to the teachings of Feng Shui met much resistance by tradition-bound villagers. Feng Shui geo-mancers in China have the responsibility of identifying suitable gravesites for the deceased so that gravesites leave the dead in perfect harmony with their natural surround-ings. The Chinese created burial mounds for their dead at these chosen gravesites. The pragmatic communist Chinese government saw the burial mounds as a barrier  Figure 7.10

to efﬁ  cient agriculture, so they leveled the burial mounds 
during the communalization program. T radition-bound 
villagers strongly opposed the practice, and they harbored a reserve of deep resentment that exploded much later in the revolutionary changes of the 1970s.
Geomancy is still a powerful force in China today, 
even in urban areas with large populations. Geographer Elizabeth T eather studied the rise of cremation and colum-baria (resting places for ashes) in Hong Kong, investigat-ing the impact Feng Shui has had on the structures and the continued inﬂ  uence of Chinese religious beliefs on burial practices in the extremely densely populated city of Hong Kong. T raditional Chinese beliefs favor a cofﬁ  n and burial 
plot aligned with Feng Shui teachings. However, with the growth of China’s population, the government has highly encouraged cremation over the past few decades. The availability of burial plots in cities like Hong Kong is quite low, and the costs of burial plots have risen in turn.
T eather explains that although cremation is on the 
rise in Hong Kong, traditional Chinese beliefs are dictat-ing the ﬁ  nal resting places of ashes. Most Chinese people, she states, have a “cultural need to keep ancestral remains appropriately stored and in a single place.” In North America and Europe, a family often chooses to scatter the ashes of a cremated loved one, but a Chinese family is more likely to keep the ashes together in a single identiﬁ  -
able space so that they can return to visit the ancestor dur-ing Gravesweeping Festivals—annual commemorations of ancestors during which people visit and tend the graves of their ancestors. T eather describes how Feng Shui mas-ters are consulted in the building of columbaria and how Feng Shui helps dictate the price placed on the niches for sale in the columbaria, with the lowest prices for the niches near the “grime of the ﬂ  oor.”
From the Hearth of the Eastern Mediterranean
Judaism
Judaism grew out of the belief system of the Jews, one of several nomadic Semitic tribes living in Southwest Asia about 4000 years ago. The roots of Jewish religious tra-dition lie in the teachings of Abraham (from Ur), who is credited with uniting his people to worship only one God. According to Jewish teaching, Abraham and God have a covenant in which the Jews agree to worship only one God, and God agrees to protect his chosen people, the Jews.
The history of the Jews is ﬁ  lled with upheaval. Moses 
led them from Egypt, where they had been enslaved, to Canaan, where an internal conﬂ  ict developed and the 
nation split into two branches, Israel and Judah. Israel was subsequently wiped out by enemies, but Judah survived longer, only to be conquered by the Babylonians and the Assyrians. The Jews regrouped to rebuild their headquar-ters, Jerusalem, but then fell victim to a series of foreign powers. The Romans destroyed their holy city in 70 ce (Common Era) and drove the Jews away, scattering the adherents to the faith far and wide. Jews retained only a small presence on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean until the late nineteenth century.
Our map shows that, unlike most other ethnic reli-
gions, Judaism is not limited to contiguous territories. Rather, Judaism is distributed throughout parts of the Middle East and North Africa, Russia, Ukraine, Europe, and parts of North and South America (Fig. 7.6). According to The Atlas of Religion, of all the world’s 18 million Jews, 
40.5 percent live in the United States, 40.2 percent live in Israel, and then in rank order, less than 5 percent live in France, Canada, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Argentina. Judaism is one of the world’s most inﬂ  uential 
religions, although it claims only 18 million adherents.
During the nineteenth century, a Reform movement 
developed with the objective of adjusting Judaism and its practices to current times. However, many feared that this reform would cause a loss of identity and cohesion, and the Orthodox movement sought to retain the old precepts. 
Between those two extremes is a sector that is less strictly orthodox but not as liberal as that of the reformers; it is known as the Conservative movement. Signiﬁ  cant differ-
ences in ideas and practices are associated with these three branches, but Judaism is united by a strong sense of ethnic distinctiveness.
Diffusion of Judaism
The scattering of Jews after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem is known as the diaspora—a term that now signi-ﬁ es the spatial dispersion of members of any ethnic group. 
The Jews who went north into Central Europe came to be known as Ashkenazim, and the Jews who scattered across North Africa and into the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) are called Sephardim. For centuries, both the Ashkenazim and the Sephardim were persecuted, denied citizenship, driven into ghettos, and massacred (Fig. 7.11).
In the face of constant threats to their existence, the 
Jews were sustained by extraordinary efforts to maintain a sense of community and faith. The idea of a homeland for the Jewish people, which became popular during the nineteenth century, developed into the ideology of Zionism. Zionist ideals are rooted in the belief that Jews should not be absorbed into other societies. The horrors of the Nazi campaign against Jews from the 1930s through World War II, when the Nazis established concentration camps and killed some six million Jews, persuaded many Jews to adopt Zionism. Jews from all over the world con-cluded that their only hope of survival was to establish a strongly defended homeland on the shores of the eastern Mediterranean. Aided by sympathetic members of the international community, the Zionist goal of a Jewish state became a reality in 1948, when a United Nations resolution carved two states, Israel and Palestine, out of the territory of the eastern Mediterranean.c07Religion.indd Page 216  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 216  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

While adherents to Judaism live across the world, 
many Jews have moved to Israel since its establishment. The 
Israeli government passed the Law of Return in 1950, which recognizes the rights of every Jew to immigrate to Israel. In 2004, over 10,000 Jews left the former Soviet Union for Israel, along with nearly 4000 Jews from Africa and over 2000 from each of western Europe and North America.
Christianity
Christianity can be traced back to the same hearth in the Mediterranean as Judaism, and like Judaism, Christianity stems from a single founder, in this case, Jesus. Christian teachings hold that Jesus is the son of God, placed on Earth to teach people how to live according to God’s plan. Christianity split from Judaism, and it, too, is a monothe-istic religion. Jesus of Nazareth was born in Bethlehem, and during his lifetime, he traveled through the eastern Mediterranean region preaching, performing miracles, and gaining followers. Christians celebrate Easter as the day Jesus rose from the dead after being cruciﬁ  ed three days prior (Good Friday). According to Christian teaching, the cruci-ﬁ xion of Jesus fulﬁ  lled an ancient prophecy and changed the 
fate of Jesus’ followers by giving them eternal life.
The ﬁ  rst split in Christianity, between Roman 
Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox, developed over a num-ber of centuries. At the end of the third century, the Roman Emperor Diocletian attempted to keep the empire together by dividing it for purposes of government. His divisions left a lasting impression. When the Roman Empire fell and broke apart, the western region, centered on Rome, fell on hard times. The eastern region, with Constantinople (now Istanbul in T urkey) at its heart, became the new focus of the Byzantine Empire (Fig. 7.12). Christianity thrived there and radiated into other areas, including the Balkan Peninsula. This split into west and east at the end of the Roman Empire became a cultural fault line over time. It was formally recog-nized in 1054 ce when the Roman Catholic Church (cen-tered in Rome) and the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church (centered in Constantinople) separated.
The Eastern Orthodox Church suffered blows when 
the Ottoman T urks defeated the Serbs in Kosovo in 1389, when the T urks took Constantinople in 1453, and when the Soviet Union suppressed Eastern Orthodox churches in the twentieth century. T oday, the Eastern Orthodox Church remains one of the three major branches of Christianity and is experiencing a revival in former Soviet areas.
The Roman Catholic Church claims the most 
adherents of all Christian denominations (more than 1 billion). Centered in Rome, Catholic theology teaches the infallibility of the pope in interpreting Jesus’ teachings and in formulating ways to navigate through the modern world. The power of the Roman Catholic Church peaked in the Middle Ages, when the Church controlled sources of knowledge and worked in conjunction with monarchs to rule much of western Europe.
During the Middle Ages, Roman Catholic authorities 
often wielded their power in an autocratic manner and dis-tanced themselves from the masses. The widespread dif-fusion of the Black Death during the 1300s and the deaths Field Note
“Many cities in Europe have distinct Jew-ish neighborhoods with active synagogues 
and communities. Others, such as Prague, have historical Jewish neighborhoods, marked with cemeteries and synagogues that have become historical sites or museums. The Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague was built in the 1400s and the last person was buried there in 1787. The jumbled mass of tombstones in the cemetery is a result of layers of people (up to 12 layers) being buried within the conﬁ  nes of 
the cemetery over the centuries.”

that resulted caused many Europeans to question the role 
of religion in their lives. The Roman Catholic Church itself also experienced divisions within its hierarchy, as evidenced by the Western Schism during the early 1300s, which at one point resulted in three people claiming to be the pope. Reformers to the Church soon followed. During the ﬁ  fteenth and sixteenth centuries, John Huss, Martin 
Luther, John Calvin, and others challenged fundamental teachings of Roman Catholicism, leading to the Protestant Reformation and opposing the practices of the Church’s leaders. The Protestant  sects of Christianity compose the 
third major branch of Christianity. Like Buddhism’s chal-lenge to Hinduism, the Protestant Reformation affected Roman Catholicism, which answered some of the chal-lenges to its theology in the Counter-Reformation. Some countries in Europe, including Switzerland (Fig. 7.13), are still divided into Catholic and Protestant regions.
Christianity is the largest and globally the most widely 
dispersed religion. Christian churches claim more than 1.5 billion adherents, including some 430 million in Europe  Figure 7.12

and the former Soviet Union; approximately 355 million 
in North and Middle America; approximately 310 million in South America; perhaps 240 million in Africa; and an estimated 165 million in Asia. Christians thus account for nearly 40 percent of the members of the world’s major reli-gions. Roman Catholicism, as noted earlier, is the largest segment of Christianity. Figure 7.6 reveals the strength of Roman Catholicism in parts of Europe and North America, and throughout much of Middle and South America. Among religious adherents in signiﬁ  cant parts of 
North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, Protestant churches prevail. Eastern Orthodox churches have as many as 180 million followers in Europe, Russia and its neighboring states, Africa (where a major cluster exists in Ethiopia), and North America.
Diffusion of Christianity
The dissemination of Christianity occurred as a result of expansion combined with relocation diffusion. In western Europe, Christianity declined during the centuries imme-diately after the fall of the Roman Empire. Then a form of contagious diffusion took place as the religious ideas that had been kept alive in remote places such as coastal Ireland and Scotland spread throughout western Europe. In the case of the Eastern Orthodox faith, contagious diffusion took place from the religion’s hearth in Constantinople to the north and northeast. Protestantism began in several parts of western Europe and expanded to some degree through contagious diffusion. Much of its spread in north-ern and central Europe, however, was through hierarchical diffusion, as political leaders would convert—sometimes to escape control from Rome—and then the population would gradually accept the new state religion.
The worldwide diffusion of Christianity occurred 
during the era of European colonialism beginning in the sixteenth century. Spain invaded and colonized Middle and South America, bringing the Catholic faith to those areas. Protestant refugees who were tired of con-ﬂ ict and oppression in Europe came to North America 
in large numbers. Through the efforts of missionar-ies, Catholicism found adherents in Congo, Angola, Mozambique, and the Philippines. The Christian faith today has over 33,000 denominations. Hundreds of these denominations engage in proselytizing (purposeful spreading of religious teachings) around the world, cre-ating an incredibly complex geographical distribution of Christians within the spaces of the world map that are shaded in “Christian” (Fig. 7.6).
The Christian faith has always been characterized by 
aggressive and persistent proselytism, and Christian mis-sionaries created an almost worldwide network of conver-sion during the colonial period that endures and contin-ues to expand today (Fig. 7.14).

T oday, missionaries from North America and Europe work not only in their home countries, but also in developing countries where they work to bring food, shelter, edu-cation and health care around the world. Missionaries from develop-ing countries also travel in North America and Europe to inform church members of needs in their home countries.

220 Chapter 7  Religion
Islam
Like Christianity, Islam, the youngest of the major reli-
gions, can be traced back to a single founder, in this case, Muhammad, who was born in Mecca in 571 ce. According to Muslim belief, Muhammad received the truth directly from Allah in a series of revelations that began when the Prophet was about 42 years old. During these revelations, Muhammad spoke the verses of the Qu’ran (Koran), the Islamic holy book. Muhammad admired the monothe-ism of Judaism and Christianity; he believed Allah had already revealed himself through other prophets includ-ing Judaism’s Abraham and Christianity’s Jesus. However, Muhammad came to be viewed as the one true prophet among Muslims.
After his visions, Muhammad had doubts that he 
could have been chosen to be a prophet but was con-vinced by further revelations. He subsequently devoted his life to the fulﬁ  llment of the divine commands. In 
those days the eastern Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula were in religious and social disarray, with Christianity and Judaism coexisting with polytheistic religions. Muhammad’s opponents began to combat his efforts. The Prophet was forced to ﬂ  ee Mecca, where he 
had been raised, for Medina, and he continued his work from this new base.
In many ways, the precepts of Islam revised Judaic 
and Christian beliefs and traditions. The central precept is that there is but one god, who occasionally reveals him-self through the prophets, such as Abraham, Jesus, and Muhammad. Another key precept is that Earthly matters are profane; only Allah is pure. Allah’s will is absolute; he is omnipotent and omniscient. Muslims believe that all humans live in a world that was created for their use but only until the ﬁ  nal judgment day.
Adherents to Islam are required to observe the “ﬁ  ve 
pillars” of Islam (repeated expressions of the basic creed, frequent prayer, a month of daytime fasting, almsgiving, and, if possible, at least one pilgrimage to Mecca in one’s lifetime). The faith dictates behavior in other spheres of life as well. Islam forbids alcohol, smoking, and gam-bling. In Islamic settlements, the people build mosques to observe the Friday prayer and to serve as social gathering places (Fig. 7.15).
Islam, like all other major religions, is divided—
principally between Sunni Muslims (the great majority) and the Shi’ite or Shiah Muslims (concentrated in Iran). Smaller sects of Islam include Wahhabis, Suﬁ  s, Salaﬁ  sts, 
Alawites, Alevis, and Yazeedis. The religion’s main divi-sion between Sunni and Shi’ite occurred almost imme-diately after Muhammad’s death, and it was caused by a conﬂ ict over his succession. Muhammad died in 632 ce, 
and to some, the rightful heir to the Prophet’s caliph-ate (area of inﬂ  uence) was Muhammad’s son-in-law, Ali. 
Others preferred different candidates who were not nec-essarily related to Muhammad. The ensuing conﬂ  ict was marked by murder, warfare, and lasting doctrinal dis-agreements. The Sunni Muslims eventually prevailed, but the Shi’ite Muslims, the followers of Ali, survived in some areas. Then, early in the sixteenth century, an Iranian (Persian) ruling dynasty made Shi’ite Islam the only legitimate faith of that empire—which extended into what is now southern Azerbaijan, southeastern Iraq, and western Afghanistan and Pakistan. This gave the Shi’ite branch unprecedented strength and created the foundations of its modern-day culture region centered on the state of Iran.
Decendants of Muhammed through his daughter 
Fatimah and his son-in-law Ali are recognized through honoriﬁ  c titles such as sayyids, syeds or sharifs. They gener-
ate respect from both Sunni and Shi’ites, however Shi’ites place much more emphasis on lineage. Shi’ite veneration of the descendants of Muhammad has contributed to a much more centralized and hierarchical clergy than in the Sunni world.

 Where Did the Major Religions of the World Originate, and How Do Religions Diffuse?  221
In the Shi’ite branch, Imams are leaders whose 
appointments they regard as sanctioned by Allah. Shi’ites 
believe that the Imam is the sole source of true knowledge, without sin and infallible, making them a potent social as well as political force. Sunni Islam is much less central-ized. An imam for a Sunni is simply a religious leader at a mosque or recognized religious scholar.
Diffusion of Islam
At the time of Muhammad’s death in 632 ce, Muhammad and his followers had converted kings on the Arabian Peninsula to Islam. The kings then used their armies to spread the faith across the Arabian Peninsula through invasion and conquest. Moving west, in waves of inva-sion and conquest, Islam diffused throughout North Africa. By the early ninth century, the Muslim world included emirates extending from Egypt to Morocco, a caliphate occupying most of Spain and Portugal, and a uniﬁ  ed realm encompassing Arabia, the Middle East, Iran, and most of what is today Pakistan. Ultimately, the Arab empire extended from Morocco to India and from T urkey to Ethiopia. Through trade, Muslims later spread their faith across the Indian Ocean into Southeast Asia (Fig. 7.16). As Muslim traders settled trading ports in Southeast Asia, they established new secondary hearths of Islam and worked to diffuse the religion contagiously from the secondary hearths. Recent diffusion of Islam into Europe (beyond Spain and Portugal), South Africa, and the Americas has largely been a result of migration—of relocation diffusion.
T oday, Islam, with more than 1.57 billion follow-
ers, ranks second to Christianity in global number of adherents. Islam is the fastest growing of the world’s major religions, dominating in Northern Africa and Southwest Asia, extending into Central Asia, the for-mer Soviet Union and China, and including clusters in Indonesia, Bangladesh, and southern Mindanao in the  Figure 7.16

Philippines. Islam is strongly represented in India, with 
over 161 million adherents, and in Subsaharan Africa, with approximately 190 million adherents. Islam has followers in Bosnia and Albania and has substantial numbers of adherents in the United States and west-ern Europe (Fig. 7.17). The largest Muslim country is actually outside of the Middle East, in Southeast Asia. Indonesia has nearly 200 million adherents. In fact, of Islam’s 1.57 billion followers, more than half live out-side Southwest Asia and North Africa. And not every-one in Southwest Asia and North Africa is Muslim. The region is home to millions of Christians, Jews, and other smaller religious sects.
Indigenous and Shamanist
Finally, Figure 7.6 identifies large areas in Africa and several other parts of the world as “Indigenous and Shamanist.” Indigenous religions are local in scope, 
usually have a reverence for nature, and are passed down through family units and groups (tribes) of indigenous peoples. No central tenet or belief can be ascribed to all indigenous religions. We do not group indigenous religions because they share a common theology or belief system. Instead, we group indige-nous religions because they share the same pressures from the diffusion of global religions—and they have survived (Fig. 7.18).
Shamanism is a community faith in which people 
follow their shaman—a religious leader, teacher, healer, and visionary. Shamans have appeared at various times to various peoples in Africa, Native America, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. These appearances had similar effects on the cultures of widely scattered peoples. Perhaps if these shamanist religions had developed elaborate bureaucracies and sent representatives to international congresses, they would have become more similar and might have evolved into another world religion. Unlike Christianity or Islam, the shamanist faiths are small and comparatively isolated.
Shamanism is a traditional religion, an intimate 
part of a local culture and society, but not all traditional religions are shamanist. Many traditional African reli-gions involve beliefs in a god as creator and provider, in divinities both superhuman and human, in spirits, and in a life hereafter. Christianity and Islam have con-verted some followers of traditional religions, but as the map indicates, they have failed to convert most African peoples, except in limited areas. Figure 7.6 shows where the adherents to traditional religions remain in the majority.
The Rise of Secularism
The world map of religion might mislead us into assum-ing that all or even most of the people in areas portrayed as Christian or Buddhist do in fact adhere to these faiths. This is not the case. Even the most careful analysis of worldwide church and religious membership produces a total of about 4 billion adherents—in a population of  Figure 7.17
London, England. This large 
mosque in East London serves the United Kingdom’s largest Muslim community. It attests to the scale of Islamic migration to the United Kingdom over the past several decades. Global religions are not grouped into neat geographical spaces; they are now found side by side all over the world.

over 6 billion. Hundreds of millions of peoples are not 
counted in this ﬁ  gure because they practice traditional religions. But even when they are taken into account, additional hundreds of millions do not practice a reli-gion at all. Moreover, even church membership ﬁ  gures 
do not accurately reﬂ  ect the number of active members  
of a church. When polled about their church-going activities, fewer than 3 percent of the people in Scandinavia reported frequent attendance, and in France and Great Britain, less than 10 percent reported attending church at least once a month. The lack of members active or otherwise underscores the rise of secularism—indifference to or rejection of organized religious affiliations and ideas.
The level of secularism throughout much of the 
Christian and Buddhist worlds varies from country to country and regionally within countries. In North America, for instance, a poll in 2002 asked whether people felt religion was very important to them. Only 30 per-cent of Canadians agreed with this statement, whereas 59 percent of Americans felt religion was very important to them. In France, the government recently banned the wearing of overt religious symbols in public schools. The French government wanted to remove the “disruption” of Muslim girls wearing hijab (head scarves), Jewish boys wearing yarmulke (skullcaps), and Christian students wearing large crosses to school. The French government took the position that banning all religious symbols was the only egalitarian approach.
Looking at polls that ask about the importance of 
religion for people in a country does not give us the com-plete picture, however. Canada’s 30 percent rate would be much, much lower if we removed recent or second-generation immigrants from the tally. Immigrants often hold onto their religion more fervently in part to help them ease into a new place and to link into a community in their new home. Buddhists and Hindus on Canada’s west coast and Muslims in the eastern part of Canada have a higher rate of adherence to their religion than many long-term residents of the country.

Uluru, Australia. © H. J. de Blij. Field Note
“Arriving at the foot of erosion-carved Uluru just before sun-rise it is no surprise that this giant monolith, towering over the Australian desert, is a sacred place to local Aboriginal peoples. Throughout the day, the changing sun angle alters its colors until, toward sunset, it turns a ﬁ  ery red that yields to a bright orange. At night it looms against the moonlit, starry sky, silent sentinel of the gods. Just two years before this, my ﬁ  rst visit in 1987, the Australian government had returned “Ayers Rock” (named by European settlers after a South Australian political leader) to Aboriginal ownership, and reclaimed its original name, Uluru. Visitors continued to be allowed to climb the 1100 feet (335m) to the top, from where the view over the desert is awesome.My day had begun eventfully when a three-foot liz-
ard emerged from under my motel-room bed, but the chain-assisted climb was no minor challenge either. At the base you are warned to be “in good shape” and some would-be climbers don’t make it, but the rewards of per-sisting are dramatic. Uluru’s iron-rich sandstone strata have been sculpted into gullies and caves, the latter containing Aboriginal carvings and paintings, and on the broad summit there are plenty of places where you can sit quietly to con-template the historic, religious, and cultural signiﬁ  cance of 
a place that mattered thousands of years before globaliza-tion reached Australia.”c07Religion.indd Page 223  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 223  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
224 Chapter 7  Religion
In some countries, antireligious ideologies are con-
tributing to the decline of organized religion. Church 
membership in the former Soviet Union, which dropped drastically during the twentieth century under com-munist rule, rebounded after the collapse of the Soviet system but to much lower numbers. Maoist China’s drive against Confucianism was, in part, an antireligious effort, and China continues to suppress some organized religious practices, as reports of religious persecution continue to emanate from China.
In many areas labeled Christian on the world 
map of religions, from Canada to Australia and from the United States to western Europe, the decline of organized religion as a cultural force is evident. In the strongly Catholic regions of southern Europe and Latin America, many people are dissatisﬁ  ed with the papal teachings on birth control, as the desire for larger families wanes in these regions of the world. In Latin America, the Catholic Church is being challenged by rapid social change, the diffusion of other Evangelical Christian denominations into the region, and sexual abuse scandals similar to those that have occurred in the United States and Canada.
Secularism has become more widespread dur-
ing the past century. People have abandoned organized religion in growing numbers. Even if they continue to be members of a church, their participation in church activities has declined. T raditions have also weakened. For example, there was a time when almost all shops and businesses were closed on Sundays, preserving the day for sermons, rest, and introspection. T oday, shop-ping centers are mostly open as usual, and Sunday is increasingly devoted to business and personal affairs, not to church. T o witness the rise of secularism among Christians in America ﬁ  rst-hand, explore your town, city, or suburb on a Sunday morning: how many people are wearing casual clothes and hanging out at the cof-fee shop reading newspapers, and how many people are attending church services?
At the same time that secularism is on the rise in 
the United States, many people who do follow their reli-gion seem to be doing so more fervently. Religious tradi-tions are stronger in some cultural regions of the United States than in others, and Sunday observance continues at a high level, for example, in the Mormon culture area of the United States. Even though Catholic dioceses are closing churches and declaring bankruptcy in some parts of the Northeast, other Catholic dioceses are building new churches and enormous activity halls in other parts of the country. Moreover, Evangelical and other alter-native churches are growing rapidly in some parts of the United States and western Europe. Entire industries, such as Christian music and Christian publications, depend on the growing commitment of many Americans and Europeans to their religion.The division between secularism and fervent adher-
ence is not conﬁ  ned to the Christian world. Secularism is growing in South Korea, where half of the population does not profess adherence to any particular religion. Although major faiths are experiencing an overall decline in adherence, several smaller religions are growing in importance: Baha’i, Cao Dai, Jainism, and the Spiritual Church of Brazil.
Migration plays a large role in the diffusion of religions, both universalizing and ethnic. As Europe becomes more secular, migrants from outside of Europe continue to settle in the region. Imagine Europe 30 years from now. Predict where in Europe secularism will be the most prominent and where religious adherence will strengthen.
HOW IS RELIGION SEEN IN THE 
CULTURAL LANDSCAPE?
Religion marks cultural landscapes with houses of 
worship such as churches, mosques, synagogues, and tem-
ples; with cemeteries dotted with religious symbols and icons; with stores designated to sales of religious goods; and even with services provided to religious adherents who travel to sacred sites. When adherents voluntarily travel to a religious site to pay respects or participate in a ritual at the site, the act of travel is called a pilgrimage. 
Geographers who study religion are interested in the act of pilgrimage and its impacts on place, people, religion, culture, and environment.
Sacred sites are places or spaces people infuse with 
religious meaning. Members of a religious group may deﬁ ne a space or place as sacred out of either reverence or 
fear. If a sacred site is held with reverence, adherents may be encouraged to make a pilgrimage to the sacred site for rejuvenation, reﬂ  ection, healing, or fulﬁ  llment of a reli-
gious commitment.
In ancient human history, sacred spaces were typi-
cally features in the physical geographic landscape, such as buttes, mountain peaks, or rivers. In more recent history, as universalizing religions diffused across the world, sacred sites were abandoned, usurped, or altered. Geographer Mary Lee Nolan studied Irish sacred sites and observed that many of the remote physical geo-graphic features of the Irish landscape were sacred to the Celtic people (Fig. 7.19). When Roman Catholicism c07Religion.indd Page 224  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 224  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
diffused to Ireland, the Catholic Church usurped many 
of these features, infusing them with Christian meaning. Nolan described the marriage of Celtic sacred sites and Christian meaning:
The early Celtic Church was a unique institution, more open to syncretism of old and new religious traditions than was the case in many other parts of Europe. Old holy places, often in remote areas, were “baptized” in the new religion or given new meaning through their historical, or more often legendary, association with Celtic saints. Such places were characterized by sacred site features such as heights, insularity, or the presence of holy water sources, trees, or stones.
Nolan contrasted Irish sacred sites with those in conti-nental Europe, where sacred sites were typically built in urban, accessible areas. In continental Europe, Nolan found that the “sacred” (bones of saints or images) was typically brought to a place in order to infuse the place with meaning.
In many societies, features in the physical geo-
graphic landscape remain sacred to religious groups. Access to and use of physical geographic features are constrained by private ownership, environmental con-cerns, and the act of designating certain sacred spaces as public recreational or tourist areas. Geographer Kari Forbes-Boyte studied Bear Butte, a site sacred to members of the Lakota and Cheyenne people in the northern Great Plains of the United States and a site that became a state park in the 1960s. Bear Butte is used today by both Lakota and Cheyenne people in religious ceremonies and by tourists who seek access to the recreational site. Nearby Devils T ower, which is a National Monument, experiences the same pull between religious use by American Indians and recre-ational use by tourists.
Places such as Bear Butte and Devils T ower experi-
ence contention when one group sees the sites as sacred and another group does not. In many parts of the world, sacred sites are claimed as holy or signiﬁ  cant to adher-ents of more than one religious faith. In India several sites are considered sacred by Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains. Speciﬁ  cally, Volture Peak in Rajgir in northeast-ern India is holy to Buddhists because it is the site where Buddha ﬁ  rst proclaimed the Heart Sutra, a very impor-
tant canon of Buddhism. Hindus and Jains also consider the site holy because they consider Buddha to be a god or prophet. Fortunately, this site has created little discord among religious groups. Pilgrims of all faiths peacefully

Ardmore, Ireland
At St. Declan’s Holy Well in Ireland, I found a 
barbed wire fence substituting for the more traditional thorn tree as a place to hang scraps of clothing as offerings. This tradition, which died out long ago in most parts of Con-tinental Europe, was one of many aspects of Irish pilgrimage that led me to speculate on “Galway-to-the-Ganges” survival of very old religious customs on the extreme margins of an ancient Indo-European culture realm. My subsequent ﬁ  eldwork focused on contem-porary European pilgrimage, but my curios-ity about the geographical extent of certain ancient pilgrimage themes lingered. While traveling in Asia, I found many similarities among sacred sites across religions. Each reli-gion has formation stories, explanations of how particular sites, whether Buddhist monasteries or Irish wells, were recog-nized as sacred. Many of these stories have similar elements. And, in 1998, I traveled across Russia from the remote Kam-chatka Peninsula to St. Petersburg. Imagine my surprise to ﬁ  nd the tradition of hanging rag offerings on trees alive and well all the way across the Russian Far East and Siberia, at least as far as Olkon Island in Lake Baikal.

congregate in the place year after year. Other sacred sites 
are not so fortunate. Some of the most contentious sites are in Jerusalem, a city that three major world religions regard as holy.
Sacred Sites of Jerusalem
The ancient city of Jerusalem is sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Jews saw Jerusalem as sacred before the birth of Jesus, but most Jews ﬂ  ed from the city and surrounding area during the diaspora. For Jews, Jerusalem remained sacred even though they did not control it, and when the Zionist movement gained strength, Jews set their sights on controlling the sacred city once again. The most important sacred site for Jews is the Western Wall (also called the Wailing Wall), at the edge of the T emple Mount in Jerusalem (Fig. 7.20). The T emple Mount was the site of the two great tem-ples of the Jewish people. Occupying the top of a mod-est hill where, according to the T orah (the sacred book of Judaism that is also part of the Old T estament of Christianity’s sacred book, the Bible), Abraham almost sacriﬁ  ced his son Isaac. On this hill, Jews built two 
temples, each of which was destroyed by invaders. The Western Wall is all that remains of the second temple, and Jews gather in the place to remember the story of Abraham and the destruction of the temples and to offer prayers. The name “Wailing Wall” evokes the sounds of mourning over the temple’s demise made by Jewish pil-grims and recognizes the suffering of Jews over time.
For Christians, Jerusalem is sacred both because 
of the sacriﬁ  ce Abraham was willing to make of his son at the T emple Mount and because Jesus’ cruciﬁ  x-
ion took place outside of the city’s walls. Jesus was then buried near the Cross (Jews only allowed kings to be buried inside the city walls) in a tomb Roman Emperor Constantine marked with a basilica that is now the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Fig. 7.21). Christians believe that from that tomb Jesus rose from the dead on Easter. For centuries the Roman, and then the Byzantine, Empire controlled the city and protected their sacred site.
In the seventh century, Muslim armies took control 
over the city from the Byzantine Empire. Muslims con-structed a mosque called the Dome of the Rock adjacent to the Western Wall to mark the site where Muslims believe Muhammad arrived from Mecca and then ascended into heaven (Fig. 7.20). The site Jews call T emple Mount is called al-Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) by Muslims.
Christians and Muslims fought the Crusades of the 
Middle Ages over the question of who should control the sacred land of Jerusalem. Between 1095 and 1199,

 How Is Religion Seen in the Cultural Landscape?  227
European political and religious leaders organized a 
series of Crusades to retake the so-called Holy Land. The ﬁ  rst Christian crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, ruling the city for almost 100 years. As the ﬁ  rst 
crusaders made their way across what is modern-day T urkey on their way to Jerusalem, they also left a series of conquests in their wake—laying claim to the city of Antioch and a number of other strategically important sites. Some of the crusaders returned to western Europe, but many settled, mingled, and intermarried with the local people. Muslims ultimately retook Jerusalem in 1187, 
and later Christian crusaders were unable to conquer it again. The Crusades helped cement a commitment by Christians to protect the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Similarly, the Crusades and then Zionism cemented a commitment by Muslims to protect the Dome of the Rock and by Jews to protect the Western Wall. The commitment by three major religions to protect and control their sacred sites has led to political turmoil that echoes far beyond Jerusalem, as we will see in the next section of this chapter.
Landscapes of Hinduism and Buddhism
T raditional Hinduism is more than a faith; it is a way of life. Pilgrimages follow prescribed routes, and rituals are attended by millions of people. Festivals and feasts are frequent, colorful, and noisy. Hindus believe that the erection of a temple, whether modest or elaborate, bestows merit on the builder and will be rewarded. As a result, the Hindu cultural landscape—urban as well as rural—is dotted with countless shrines, ranging from small village temples to structures so large and elabo-rate that they are virtually holy cities. The location of shrines is important because Hindus prescribe that such holy places should minimally disrupt the natural land-scape. Whenever possible, a Hindu temple is located in a “comfortable” position, for example, under a large, shady tree. Hindus also want their temples to be near water because many gods will not venture far from water and because water has a holy function, ritual bathing, in Hinduism (Fig. 7.22). A village temple should face the village from a prominent position, and followers must make offerings frequently. Small offerings of fruit and ﬂ owers lie before the sanctuary of the deity honored by 
the shrine.
The cultural landscape of Hinduism is the cul-
tural landscape of India, its main culture region. As one travels through India, the Hindu faith is a visual as well as an emotional experience. T emples and shrines, holy animals by the tens of millions, distinctively garbed holy men, and the sights and sounds of long proces-sions and rituals all contribute to a unique atmosphere (Fig. 7.23).
When Buddha received enlightenment, he sat 
under a large tree, the Bodhi (enlightenment) tree at Bodh Gaya in India. The Bodhi tree now growing on the site is believed to be a descendant of the original tree. The Bodhi tree has a thick, banyan-like trunk and a wide canopy of leafy branches. Because of its association with the Buddha, the tree is revered and protected. Buddhists make pilgrimages to Bodh Gaya and other places where Buddha may have taught beneath Bodhi branches. With Buddhism, the Bodhi tree diffused as far as China and

“In the summer of 2007, the newer, Hi-Tec city area of Hyder-
abad, India was under construction. Migrant workers built new roads, new apartment houses, and new ofﬁ  ce buildings 
throughout the city. Beautiful homes reﬂ  ected the wealth 
accrued among many of the city’s newly wealthy. In front of the new homes, I could see Hinduism in the cultural land-scape, as many owners built temples for their favorite Hindu god. In the oldest parts of the city, I visited Golconda Fort, built more than 1500 years ago. On the day I was there, the Hindu women of the city were participating in the Bonalu Festival as an act of honoring Mother Goddess. The women climbed nearly 400 steps to the top of the fort, carrying with them offerings of food. At the top, I was welcomed into the temple. I took off my shoes and took part in a festival that began in the mid-1800s, when the Hindu women began the festival to ward off the anger of the gods, as the city stood under the siege of the bubonic plague.”

Japan, its purposeful planting marking the cultural land-
scape of numerous villages and towns.
Buddhism’s architecture includes some magniﬁ  -
cent achievements, especially the famed structures at Borobudur in central Java (Indonesia). Buddhist shrines include stupas, bell-shaped structures that protect burial 
mounds. Buddhists also construct temples that enshrine an image of Buddha in his familiar cross-legged pose, as well as large monasteries that tower over the local land-scape. The pagoda is perhaps Buddhism’s most famil-iar structure. Its shape is derived from the relic (often funeral) mounds of old. Every fragment of its construc-tion is a meaningful representation of Buddhist philoso-phy (Fig. 7.24).
Along with the religious structures such as temples, 
we can see evidence of religion in the cultural landscapes of the dead. T raditionally, Hindus, and more recently Buddhists, and Shintoists cremate their dead. Thus, wher-ever a large pocket of Hindus, Buddhists, or Shintoists live, a crematorium will be nearby. The Hindu crema-torium in Kenya stands in stark contrast to much of the rest of the cultural landscape and signals the presence of a large Hindu population (see Fig. 7.2).The cultural landscapes of South Asian religions 
extend into Southeast Asia, where several religions that began in the South Asian hearth (including Hinduism and Buddhism) diffused into Southeast Asia. Later, Islam replaced the South Asian religions in many of these places, and even later Christian missionaries gained adherents in Southeast Asia when Christian gov-ernments encouraged the migration of their people and their religion to their colonies in these areas. T oday, we can stand in Singapore, study the cultural landscape, and see the inﬂ  uences of Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam.
Landscapes of Christianity
The cultural landscapes of Christianity’s branches reﬂ ect the changes the faith has undergone over the 
centuries. In medieval Europe the cathedral, church, or monastery was the focus of life. Other buildings clus-tered around the tower, steeple, and spire of the church that could be seen (and whose bells could be heard) for miles in the surrounding countryside (Fig. 7.25). In the

“To reach the city of Yangon, Myanmar (Burma) we had to transfer to a ferry and sail up the Rangoon River for sev-eral hours. One of Southeast Asia’s most spectacular Bud-dhist shrines is the golden Shwedogon Pagoda in the heart of Yangon. The golden dome (or chedi) is one of the ﬁ  nest 
in Southeast Asia, and its religious importance is striking: eight hairs of the Buddha are preserved here. Vast amounts of gold have gone into the creation and preservation of the Shwedogon Pagoda; local rulers often gave the monks their weight in gold—or more. Today, the pagoda is a cornerstone of Buddhism, drawing millions of faithful to the site. Myan-mar’s ruling generals have ruined the country’s economy and continue to oppress Buddhist leaders who try to convey public grievances to the regime, even blocking international aid following the devastating impact of cyclone Nargis in May 2008. The generals have a powerful ally in the Chinese, who are building bridges and laying pipelines but who exer-cise little inﬂ  uence over the military junta.”c07Religion.indd Page 229  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 229  9/19/11  10:50 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

square or plaza in front of the church, crowds gathered 
for ceremonies and festivals, and the church was always present—even if the event was not primarily religious. Good harvests, military victories, public announce-ments, and much else took place in the shadow of the symbol of religious authority. As a result of mercantil-ism and colonialism, Europeans exported the ornate architecture of European Christian churches wherever they settled (Fig. 7.26).
The Reformation, the rise of secularism, and the 
decline of organized religion are reflected in the cul-tural landscape as well. Many of the ornate churches in the town squares of medieval cities now function as museums instead of serving active congregations. Other churches in secular regions are closing their doors or significantly reducing the number of religious services offered. Y et, not all of Europe’s sacred sites have become secularized. Famous cathedrals continue to hold services while tourists peruse the interior of the vast churches. And other sacred sites of Christianity, such as churches for specific saints, places where sig-nificant events occurred, and Vatican City in Rome, are still major pilgrimage sites in Europe. When in Rome, the leader of the Catholic Church, the pope, holds an outdoor service for pilgrims to Vatican City, attracting thousands of followers to St. Peter’s Square each week (Fig. 7.27).
Cities in Europe are also home to centuries-old 
Christian cemeteries. T raditionally, Christians bury,  Figure 7.25

rather than cremate, their dead, and in cities, the cem-
eteries are often crowded with tombstones. Outside of European cities and in North America, Christian cem-eteries can resemble large parks. These cemeteries often reﬂ ect class differences: some graves are marked by sim-
ple tombstones, whereas others are elaborate structures. With rising land-use pressures and the associated costs of burial, however, cremation is becoming increasingly com-mon among Christians—particularly in North America and western Europe.
Religious Landscapes in the United States
The United States, a predominantly Christian country, demonstrates considerable diversity in its religious cul-tural landscapes. In The Cultural Geography of the United States, geographer Wilbur Zelinsky constructed a map identifying religious regions in the country. Figure 7.28 presents a modiﬁ  ed version of Zelinsky’s map. The reli-
gious regions on the map are familiar to anyone who has even the most general impression of cultural differences in the United States.
The New England region is strongly Catholic; 
the South’s leading denomination is Baptist; the Upper Midwest has large numbers of Lutherans; and the Southwest is predominantly Spanish Catholic. The broad midland region extending from the Middle Atlantic to the Mormon region (in the Western United States) has a mixture of denominations in which no sin-gle church dominates; this is also true of the West. As Figure 7.28 shows, some regions represent local cluster-ing, such as the French Catholic area centered in New Orleans and the mixed denominations of Peninsular Florida, where a large Spanish Catholic cluster has emerged in metropolitan Miami.
More interesting than the simple regionalization 
of religions in the United States is the variation in cul-tural landscapes within regions. In a 2008 study, geog-raphers Barney Warf and Mort Winsberg used data on religious adherents by county in the United States to discern what counties and regions of the country have the most and the least religious diversity. Warf and Winsberg deﬁ  ned religious diversity as having a vari-ety of religions within a small spatial unit, in this case a county. One way the authors mapped religious diver-sity is presented in Figure 7.29, a map showing counties with the least religious diversity in the darkest colors. In counties with the darkest shading, one religion accounts for 64 percent or more of all religious adherents in the county. In comparing Figure 7.29 to Figure 7.28, we can see that the Mormon region in Utah and southern Idaho, the Southern Baptist region in the South, and the Catholic region of the Northeast are some of the least diverse regions in the country. In these regions, you can expect to see the imprint of one major religion through-out the cultural landscape. By contrast, religious regions characterized by many lightly colored counties have a rich religious mix.
The plain white churches of the South and 
Lutheran Upper Midwest coincide with the Protestant Church’s pragmatic spending of church money—not on art and architecture as the Catholic Church historically did (Fig. 7.30). Conversely, many Catholic churches in the United States, both in the Northeast and in Chicago, as well as in other immigrant-magnet cities, were built by immigrants who lived in ethnic neighborhoods.

Immigrants spent their own money and used their build-
ing skills to construct more ornate churches and dozens of cathedrals that tied them back to their country of ori-gin and demonstrated their commitment to their faith (Fig. 7.31).
Landscapes of Islam
Elaborate, sometimes magniﬁ  cently designed mosques 
whose balconied minarets rise above the townscape domi-nate Islamic cities, towns, and villages. Often the mosque is the town’s most imposing and most carefully main-tained building. Five times every day, from the towering minarets, the faithful are called to prayer. The sounds emanating from the minarets ﬁ  ll the streets as the faithful converge on the holy place to pray facing Mecca.
At the height of Islam’s expansion into eastern North 
Africa and southern Europe, Muslim architects incor-porated earlier Roman models into their designs. The results included some of the world’s greatest architectural masterpieces, such as the Alhambra Palace in Granada and the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain. Islam’s pro-hibition against depicting the human form led to the wide  Figure 7.28

use of geometric designs and calligraphy—the intricacy of 
which is truly astounding (Fig. 7.32). During the eleventh century, Muslim builders began glazing the tiles of domes and roofs. T o the beautiful arcades and arched courtyards, they added the exquisite beauty of glass-like, perfectly symmetrical cupolas. Muslim architecture represents the unifying concept of Islamic monotheism: the perfection and vastness of the spirit of Allah.
Islam achieved its greatest artistic expression, its 
most distinctive visible element, in architecture. Even in the smallest town, the community helps build and main-tain its mosque. The mosque symbolizes the power of the faith and its role in the community. Its primacy in the cul-tural landscape conﬁ  rms the degree to which, in much of 
the Muslim world, religion and culture are one.
One of the most well-known pilgrimages in the 
modern world is the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, the hajj. One of the ﬁ  ve pillars of Islam, the hajj implores all Muslims (if ﬁ  nancially and physically able) to make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once during their lifetime. Each year, over 1.3 million Muslims from outside of Saudia Arabia and over 1 million from inside the country make the hajj (Fig. 7.33). The pilgrimage requires the faithful to follow certain steps of reverence in a certain order and within a certain time frame. As a result, the pil-grims move from Mecca through the steps of the hajj en masse. In 2004, over 250 pilgrims were trampled to death as hordes of people followed the steps of the pilgrimage, and in 1990 over 1400 pilgrims suffered the same fate. The Saudi government now restricts the number of visas granted each year to Muslims from outside of the country. Y et, the number of pilgrims continues to climb, and the services needed for Muslim pilgrims during the hajj and during the rest of the year now employ four times as many people in Saudi Arabia as the oil industry does. The land-scape around Mecca reﬂ  ects the growing number of pil-
grims year round, as towers of apartment buildings and hotels encircle the sacred city.
Geographer Surinder Bhardwaj has studied non-
hajj pilgrimages in Islam, which include “visits to sacred shrines of holy men, the graves of saints and Imams, and the tombs of martyrs of the faith.” Although some sects of Islam see non-hajj pilgrimage as non-Islamic, the ziarats 
(non-hajj pilgrimages) are important to a growing num-ber of Muslims. Bhardwaj points out that the hajj is oblig-atory but the ziarat is voluntary. He explains that study of the ziarat helps geographers understand the many varia-tions and regional forms of Islam in the world today. For example, Bhardwaj describes how the ziarat in Indonesia (the country with the largest number of Muslims) reﬂ  ects 
the continued inﬂ  uence of pre-Islamic ways. Especially in 
the interior of Indonesia, Islam has mixed with Buddhism and Hinduism, both of which stress the importance of pil-grimage. Similar to Ireland, where the Catholic Church usurped Celtic sacred sites, Bhardwaj found that many sites in Indonesia that were sacred under Hinduism and Buddhism were usurped by Islam, which changed the 
object of pilgrimage from non-Muslim to Muslim.

 What Role Does Religion Play in Political Conﬂ  icts?  235
Choose a pilgrimage site, such as Mecca, Vatican City, or the 
Western Wall, and describe how the act of pilgrimage (in some cases by millions) alters this place’s cultural landscape and environment.
WHAT ROLE DOES RELIGION PLAY 
IN POLITICAL CONFLICTS?
Religious beliefs and histories can bitterly divide peo-
ples who speak the same language, have the same ethnic 
background, and make their living in similar ways. Such divisions arise not only between people adhering to differ-ent major religions (as with Muslims and Christians in the former Yugoslavia) but also among adherents of the same religion. Some of the most destructive conﬂ  icts have pitted 
Christian against Christian and Muslim against Muslim.
Religious conﬂ  icts usually involve more than dif-
ferences in spiritual practices and beliefs. Religion often functions as a symbol of a wider set of cultural and politi-cal differences. The “religious” conﬂ  ict in Northern 
Ireland is not just about different views of Christianity, and the conﬂ  ict between Hindus and Muslims in India 
has a strong political as well as religious dimension. Nevertheless, in these and other cases religion serves as the principal symbol around which conﬂ  ict is organized.
Conﬂ  icts along Religious Borders
A comparison between Figure 7.6 and a political map of the world (see Fig. 8.3) reveals that some countries lie entirely within the realms of individual world religions, whereas other countries straddle interfaith boundaries , 
the boundaries between the world’s major faiths. Many countries that lie astride interfaith boundaries are subject to potentially divisive cultural forces—particularly when  Figure 7.33

the people see their religious differences as a source of 
social division within their country. This is the case in sev-eral countries in Africa that straddle the Christian-Muslim interfaith boundary (Fig. 7.34). Other countries with major religious disputes straddle intrafaith boundaries , the 
boundaries within a single major faith. Intrafaith bound-aries include divisions between Christian Protestants and Catholics, divisions between Muslim Sunni and Shi’ite, and the like. This is the case in Northern Ireland, where Protestants and Catholics, who both worship in the Christian tradition, have a long history of conﬂ  ict.
Interfaith and intrafaith boundaries can be peace-
ful, or they can spur enormously violent political con-ﬂ ict. Israel/Palestine, Nigeria, and the former Yugoslavia 
provide examples of interfaith conﬂ  icts, and Northern 
Ireland is an example of an intrafaith conﬂ  ict. In each case, religious difference is not the only factor, but it certainly plays an important symbolic and perceptual role.

 What Role Does Religion Play in Political Conﬂ  icts?  237
Israel and Palestine
Earlier in this chapter, we discussed the history of the con-
ﬂ ict over the sacred space of Jerusalem. The region of 
Israel and Palestine is home to one of the most contentious religious conﬂ  icts in the world today. In the aftermath of World War I, European colonialism came to a region that had previously been controlled and fought over by Jews, Romans, Christians, Muslims, and Ottomans. A newly formed League of Nations (a precursor to the United Nations) recognized British control of the land, calling the territorial mandate Palestine. At that point, the vast major-ity of people living in the land were Muslim Palestinians. The goal of the British government was to meet Zionist goals and to create, in Palestine, a national homeland for the Jewish people (who had already begun to migrate to the area). The British explicitly assured the world that the religious and civil rights of existing non-Jewish peoples in Palestine would be protected. The British policy did not produce a peaceful result, however. Civil disturbances erupted almost immediately, and, by 1947–1948, Jews and Palestinians engaged in open warfare.
In the wake of World War II and the Holocaust, 
many more Jews moved to the region. Shortly after the war, the British mandate ended, and the newly formed United Nations voted to partition Palestine—creating independent Israeli and Palestinian states. From the drawing of the ﬁ  rst map, the partitioning plan was set for failure (see Fig. 3.11). Palestinians and Israelis were to live in noncontiguous states. Surrounding Arab states reacted violently against the new Jewish state. Israel survived through numerous wars in which Palestinians lost their lands, farms, and villages. As a consequence of war and the consolidation of the Israeli state, Palestinians migrated or ﬂ ed to refugee camps in neighboring Arab states.
In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Israel gained con-
trol of the Palestinian lands in Gaza, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights. The international community calls these lands the Occupied T erritories. The Jewish pres-ence in Gaza has always been small. But over the last three decades, the Israelis built Jewish housing settle-ments throughout the West Bank and have expanded the city of Jerusalem eastward into the West Bank (razing Palestinian houses along the way) to gain more control of territory. The Israeli government severely restricts new building by Palestinians, even on lands in the Palestinian zones of the West Bank. Events in the early and mid-1990s began to change this religious-political mosaic as self-government was awarded to Gaza and to small areas inside the West Bank. Palestinian Arabs were empowered to run their own affairs within these zones. Stability and satisfactory coexistence could lead to fur-ther adjustments, some thought—and eventually a full-ﬂ edged Palestinian state, but mistrust on both sides has 
kept that from happening.In September 2005, the Israeli government shifted 
its policy toward the Gaza Strip. Israel evacuated the settlements that had been built there, burned down the buildings that remained (Fig. 7.35), and then granted autonomy to Gaza. The Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip rejoiced—visiting the beaches that were previously open only to Israeli settlers and traveling across the bor-der into Egypt to purchase goods. Although Palestinians now have greater freedom within the Gaza Strip, they are economically isolated and the standard of living has dropped.
The Israeli government tightly controls the ﬂ  ow of 
Palestinians and goods into and out of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Gaza is surrounded by fences, and in some places a wall—with land mines in certain areas and dust road to show footprints. Most controversially, however, the Israelis have set about constructing a security fence in the West Bank, which does not follow the 1947 West Bank border but dips into the West Bank to include some of the larger Israeli settlements on Israel’s side of the fence. This may greatly complicate any future territorial settle-ment, and some Israelis are opposed to it. But many oth-ers argue that Palestinians continue to ﬁ  ght a war against the Israelis—with terrorism. Palestinian attacks against Israelis threaten the everyday lives of the Israeli people; no bus, coffee shop, restaurant, or sidewalk is safe from the threat of terrorist attack. Similarly, in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, the Israeli military hunts the suspects, shedding blood in Palestinian neighborhoods, further exacerbating tensions.
The situation in Israel and Palestine today does not 
reﬂ ect a simple interfaith boundary. The tiny region has a 
multitude of interfaith boundaries, especially in the West Bank (Fig. 7.36). The settlements in the West Bank have produced many miles of interfaith boundaries within a small political territory.
Until 2011 the Palestinians in the West Bank and 
Gaza were represented by separate governments—the lat-ter by Hamas, a group long opposed to Israel’s existence. A 2011 accord between the two governments altered the political landscape, but the prospects for peace between Israelis and Palestinians are greatly complicated by the fact that each side feels it has a historic (in the minds of some, even a divine) right to the land and by the violence inﬂ icted on each side by the other.
Nigeria
As Figure 7.34 makes clear, many of the countries of West Africa are predominantly Muslim in the North, but not in the South. Nigeria is a prime example. With over 155 million people, Nigeria is Africa’s most populous coun-try, and it is fairly evenly divided between Muslims in the North and Christians in the South (see Fig. 8.11). Since c07Religion.indd Page 237  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 237  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
238 Chapter 7  Religion
1999, when the country emerged from years of military 
rule, Nigeria has witnessed persistent violence between these communities that has cost tens of thousands of lives.
As with many such conﬂ  icts, the causes of north-
south violence in Nigeria cannot be attributed solely to different religious beliefs. The southern part of Nigeria is characterized by a wet tropical rainforest climate. Moving north, Nigeria’s climate becomes progressively hotter and drier. The climate in the central part of the country is somewhere in between, being both wetter than the arid north and drier than the south. This climatic variation is associated with different modes of livelihood. In northern Nigeria, many people engage in cattle herding, whereas in the south of the country, most rural peoples are farmers.
As land has become scarcer, the fertile grasslands 
of central Nigeria have become coveted by both cattle herders and farmers. It is in these central regions of the country where the worst violence between Muslims and Christians has taken place. One such area is a place called Jos, some 300 miles north of Lagos, the largest city in the country. In the ﬁ  rst six months of 2011 alone, nearly 
1000 people were killed in Jos. The violence may have its roots in the struggle for access to land, political power, and resources, but religion has served as a key marker of  Figure 7.35

difference in the region. Not surprisingly, then, the con-
ﬂ ict escalated into a series of attacks and reprisals in the 
name of the region’s Christian and Muslim populations. Such developments reinforce the perceptual importance of Nigeria’s intrafaith Christian-Muslim boundary, and promote a sense—whether right or wrong—that reli-gious differences represent the most important obstacle to social cohesion in the country.
The Former Yugoslavia
A number of religious and linguistic fault lines run through the Balkan Peninsula. We discussed one of the fault lines earlier in the chapter when we looked at the fall of the Roman Empire and the subsequent divi-sion between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. The dividing line between the two branches of Christianity runs right through the Balkan Peninsula. The Slovenians and Croats in the west of the peninsula are Catholic, and the Serbians and Montenegrans in the east and south of the peninsula are Eastern Orthodox.
The Balkan Peninsula is also a dividing line for lan-
guage in Europe, with people west of the line using the Roman alphabet and people east of the line using the Cyrillic alphabet. The Serbo-Croatian language is now recognized as two languages, Serbian and Croatian. Even when these languages were recognized as a single language, the Croats used the Roman alphabet in the written form of their language and the Serbs used the Cyrillic script.
These divisions in religion and language were com-
plicated by the entry of another universalizing religion during the 1300s. The Ottoman T urks, a Muslim empire, brought soldiers to their northwestern military frontier and converted some Serbian communities to Islam. The Ottomans took control of the region by force, begin-ning with the bloody battle of Kosovo in 1389, which was the Serbian homeland during the European Middle Ages. From that point on, the region has had pockets of Muslims in the middle and south of the peninsula, cre-ating numerous interfaith boundaries. Even by the early 1990s, the clusters of Muslims on the peninsula were quite large, in terms of both territorial extent and population. Muslims had a strong presence in Bosnia and in its capital, Sarajevo, as well as in Kosovo and Macedonia.
Yugoslavia is another example of a country thrown 
together and left wrestling with signiﬁ  cant diver-
sity. The name “Yugoslavia” means land of the South Slavs. The country was formed in the chaotic after-math of World War I before 1920. When World War II began, many Serbs already resented the Muslim pres-ence in the region, harking back to the time when the Ottomans defeated the Serbs. During World War II, the Croats, who supported the German Nazis, fought the anti-Nazi Serbs. Croats, with the might of the Nazis behind them, sought to rid their territories of Serbs, who lived in Croatia and Bosnia during the war. After 1945, Yugoslavia came under the control of a commu-nist dictator, Josip Broz Tito. For decades, Tito ran Yugoslavia as a centralized country with six republics. Tito never healed the ethnic divides in Yugoslavia; he simply suppressed them and pushed them out of view during his control. After his death in 1980, nationalist sentiments began to emerge, and Yugoslavia was sub-sequently swept up in the winds of change produced by the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s. Slovenia was the ﬁ  rst republic to declare its indepen-dence from the rest of the country, followed closely by Croatia and Bosnia.
Serbia, led by an ardent Serb nationalist, Slobodan 
Milosevic, tried to force the republics to stay in a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. The multiethnic republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was caught in the middle when war broke out between the Croats and Serbs (Fig. 7.37). The Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina were soon attacked by both camps. The term ethnic cleansing  
came into use to describe the ouster of Bosnian Muslims and others from their homes and lands—and some-times their slaughter. Serbs and Croats also sought to “cleanse” each other’s territories. In the midst of war, the Croats and Muslims formed a coalition to ﬁ  ght 
against the Serbs. More than 2.5 million Bosnians were driven from their homes, and hundreds of thousands were injured or killed. Atrocities became so rampant that other countries agreed to form a war crimes tribu-nal while the war was ongoing.
The international community belatedly became 
involved, and a partition plan was put in place. New countries joined the United Nations: Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The plan divided Bosnia and Herzegovina into two republics: one for Croats and Muslims and one for Serbs. The future of Bosnia and Herzegovina is uncertain. The central government has little power, and the wounds of war are still raw. The long line divid-ing the two republics was secured by 60,000 NATO peacekeepers from Europe and the United States, but oversight is now in the hands of a European Union force (Fig. 7.38).
In 2003, the name Yugoslavia disappeared from 
the maps and was replaced by the name Serbia and Montenegro for the former Yugoslavia. The splinter-ing of the Balkan Peninsula continued in 2006 when Montenegro voted for independence in a referendum. The United States and the European Union recog-nized Montenegro’s statehood, and in the same year, Montenegro joined the United Nations.
A ﬁ  nal development of signiﬁ  cance began to unfold 
in the second half of the 1990s, when a group of ethnically 
c07Religion.indd Page 240  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 240  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

Albanian Muslims in Kosovo (an autonomous region in 
southwestern Serbia) demanded autonomy. The Serbian leadership responded with a campaign of ethnic cleans-ing against Kosovo Albanians in 1999. They razed whole villages, drove out people in great numbers, and killed many. The international community was once again slow to intervene. This time the North Atlantic T reaty Organization (NATO), led by the United States, initiated a bombing campaign against Serbia that brought hostili-ties to a halt and paved the way for the introduction of a peacekeeping force. After failed attempts to reach a nego-tiated agreement on independence, in 2008 the Kosovars unilaterally declared the founding of the new independent state of Kosovo. Many countries, including the United States, recognized the new state, but others—notably Russia and, of course, Serbia—did not. Figure 7.37

242 Chapter 7  Religion
Northern Ireland
A number of western European countries, as well as 
Canada and the United States, have large Catholic com-munities and large Protestant communities, and often these are reﬂ  ected in the regional distribution of the pop-
ulation. In most places, the split between these two sects of Christianity creates little if any rift today. The most notable exception is Northern Ireland.
T oday Northern Ireland and Great Britain 
(which includes England, Scotland, and Wales) form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the UK). This was not always the case. For centuries, the island of Ireland was its own entity, marked by a mixture of Celtic religious practices and Roman Catholicism. As early as the 1200s, the English began to inﬁ  ltrate the island of Ireland, taking control 
of its agricultural economy. Colonization began in the sixteenth century, and by 1700, Britain controlled the entire island. During the 1800s, the Irish colony pro-duced industrial wealth for Britain in the shipyards of the north. Protestants from the island of Great Britain (primarily Scotland) migrated to Ireland dur-ing the 1700s to Northern Ireland to take advantage of the political and economic power granted to them in the colony. During the 1800s, migrants were drawn to northeastern Ireland where industrial jobs and oppor-tunities were greatest. During the colonial period, the British treated the Irish Catholics harshly, taking away their lands, depriving them of their legal right to own property or participate in government, and regarding them as second-class citizens.
In the late 1800s, the Irish began reinvigorating 
their Celtic and Irish traditions; this strengthening of their identity fortiﬁ  ed their resolve against the British. In the early 1900s, the Irish rebelled against British colo-nialism. The rebellion was successful throughout most of the island, which was Catholic dominated, leading to the creation of the Republic of Ireland. But in the 1922 settle-ment ending the conﬂ  ict, Britain retained control of six counties in the northeast, which had Protestant majori-ties. These counties constituted Northern Ireland, which became part of the United Kingdom. The substantial Catholic minority in Northern Ireland, however, did not want to be part of the United Kingdom (Fig. 7.39)—par-ticularly since the Protestant majority, constituting about two-thirds of the total population (about 1.6 million) of Northern Ireland, possessed most of the economic and political advantages.
As time went on, economic stagnation for both 
populations worsened the situation, and the Catholics in particular felt they were being repressed. T errorist acts by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), an organi-zation dedicated to ending British control over all of Ireland by violent means if necessary, brought British troops into the area in 1968. Although the Republic of

 What Role Does Religion Play in Political Conﬂ  icts?  243
Ireland was sensitive to the plight of Catholics in the 
North, no ofﬁ  cial help was extended to those who were engaging in violence.
In the face of worsening conﬂ  ict, Catholics and 
Protestants in Northern Ireland increasingly distanced their lives and homes from one another. The cultural land-scape marks the religious conﬂ  ict, as each group clusters 
in its own neighborhoods and celebrates either important Catholic or Protestant dates (see Fig. 6.11). Irish geogra-pher Frederick Boal wrote a seminal work in 1969 on the Northern Irish in one area of Belfast. Boal used ﬁ  eldwork 
to mark Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods on a map, and he interviewed over 400 Protestants and Catholics in their homes. Boal used the concept of activity space to demonstrate how Protestants and Catholics had each cho-sen to separate themselves in their rounds of daily activity. Boal found that each group traveled longer distances to shop in grocery stores tagged as their respective religion, walked further to catch a bus in a neighborhood belong-ing to their own religion, gave their neighborhood differ-ent toponyms, read different newspapers, and cheered for different football (soccer) teams.
Although religion is the tag-line by which we refer to 
“the T roubles” in Northern Ireland, the conﬂ  ict is much 
more about nationalism, economics, oppression, access to opportunities, terror, civil rights, and political inﬂ  uence. 
But religion and religious history are the banners beneath which the opposing sides march, and church and cathe-dral have become symbols of strife rather than peace.
In the 1990s, Boal updated his study of Northern 
Ireland and found hope for a resolution. Boal found that religious identities were actually becoming less intense among the younger generation and among the more educated. In Belfast, the major city in Northern Ireland, Catholics and Protestants are now intermixing in spaces such as downtown clubs, shopping centers, and college campuses.
Boal’s observations proved to be right, and a move-
ment toward resolution among the population along with the British government’s support for devolution (see Chapter 8) helped fuel the April 1998 adoption of an Anglo-Irish peace agreement known as the Belfast Agreement & Good Friday Agreement, which raised hopes of a new period of peace in Northern Ireland. Following a decade of one step forward and two steps back toward peace, Northern Ireland ﬁ  nally realized a tenuous peace in 2007 when the Northern Ireland Assembly (Parliament) was reinstated. The two sides have made major strides toward reconciliation in recent years, but the conﬂ  ict has not gone away. While some of the younger generation may be mix-ing socially, more “peace walls” (giant barriers between Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods) have been con-structed since the signing of the Belfast agreement—raising concerns that segregation may be increasing.

244 Chapter 7  Religion
Religious Fundamentalism and Extremism
T oday, throughout the world, religious leaders and mil-
lions of their followers are seeking to return to the basics of their faith. The drive toward religious fundamental-
ism is often born out of frustration over the perceived breakdown of society’s mores and values, lack of religious authority, failure to achieve economic goals, loss of a sense of local control, or a sense of violation of a religion’s core territory. Regardless of the religion, a fundamental-ist group holds its religious beliefs as nonnegotiable and uncompromising.
People in one society often fear fundamentalism 
in other societies without recognizing it in their own. In fact, what many call fundamentalism is sometimes bet-ter deﬁ  ned as extremism. Religious extremism is fun-damentalism carried to the point of violence. The attacks on the United States in September 2001 reinforced the tendency of many Americans to equate extremism with Islam. Y et Christian extremism is also a potent force, as witnessed in the United States when religious zealots kill physicians who perform legal abortions. Fundamentalists can be extremists, but by no means are all fundamental-ists, whether Christian, Muslim, Jewish, or any other religion, extremists.
T oday the forces of globalization affect religions. 
Education, radio, television, and travel have diffused notions of individual liberties, sexual equality, and free-dom of choice—but also consumerism and secularism. In the process, the extent of cultural diffusion and inno-vation has accelerated. Some churches have managed to change with the times, allowing women to serve as priests and homosexuals to marry, and generally liberalizing their doctrines. Others have gone in the opposite direction, reafﬁ rming fundamental or literalist interpretations of 
religious texts and trying to block modern inﬂ  uences and 
external cultural interference.
Christianity
The Roman Catholic Church has long resisted innova-tions deemed incompatible with the fundamentals of the faith. Among the issues giving rise to disputes are birth control, family planning, and the role of women in the religious bureaucracy. The major religions tend to be male-dominated, and few women have managed to enter the hierarchy. This is true in the Roman Catholic Church, where women are not allowed to serve as priests. The Roman Catholic Church has over 1 billion adher-ents and has a global diplomatic and political presence, affecting policies in numerous places and on many top-ics. For example, the Roman Catholic Church preaches against the use of artiﬁ  cial means of birth control as well as abortion. During the September 1994 United Nations Conference on Population and Development, the Roman Catholic Church sought to ally itself with Islamic coun-tries against advocates of population control.
In the United States, certain sects of the Catholic 
Church continue to hold Mass in Latin and are much more fundamentalist than the rest of the Church. Some of these sects are part of the Catholic Church and continue to oper-ate within the purview of the Church. Others stand apart from the Catholic Church and do not recognize the pope, nor does the Vatican sanction them. For example, actor/director Mel Gibson belongs to the Holy Family Church, which does not recognize the pope, and the Vatican does not recognize that church as part of the Catholic Church. Gibson’s church is most associated with the Traditionalist 
Catholic Movement, a fundamentalist movement that believes the Mass should still be conducted in Latin and that modern popes and clergy are not following the tradi-tional theology and practices of the Church.
In the United States, Christian fundamental-
ism is also associated with Protestant faiths. Preaching a doctrine of strict adherence to the literal precepts of the Bible, many Protestant Christian fundamentalists believe that the entire character of contemporary society needs to be brought into alignment with biblical prin-ciples. Fundamentalist Protestant churches range from tiny churches to enormous warehouse-style churches with thousands of members. Regardless of the size of the congregation, fundamentalist Protestant churches have become increasingly active in political and social arenas—arguing for prayer in public schools, the teaching of cre-ationism in science courses, a strict ban on abortion, and the adoption of laws outlawing gay marriage (Fig. 7.40). In the process, they have gained considerable inﬂ  uence, 
especially in local politics (school boards and city councils).
Judaism
Like all other major religions, Judaism has fundamental-ist sects. The most conservative of the three major sects of Judaism is Orthodox. Y et, the Orthodox sect is divided into several different schools of thought, teachings, and synagogues. Much diversity exists among Orthodox Jews, with varying views on Israel, education, and interaction with non-Orthodox Jews. Fundamentalist Jews who have migrated to Israel tend to vote for more conserva-tive candidates in Israeli elections, affecting election out-comes. Similarly, some fundamentalist Jews who remain in Europe or North America send money to certain politi-cians in Israel in support of policies such as Israeli settle-ments on the West Bank.
Judaism also has its extremist element—people 
whom the majority of Jews denounce and whom the government of Israel has even banned from the coun-try. Among the Jewish extremist groups is the Kach and Kahane Chai—followers of the late American-born, Israeli Rabbi Meir Kahane. Rabbi Kahane espoused anti-c07Religion.indd Page 244  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 244  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 What Role Does Religion Play in Political Conﬂ  icts?  245
Arabism in his teachings, and his followers (Kahane Chai) 
continue to do so. Members of Kach or Kahane Chai are suspected in several terrorist acts in Isreal.
Islam
Other major faiths must also confront the pressures of change. Not all Muslim communities, for example, adhere precisely to the rules of the Qu’ran prohibiting the use of alcohol. The laws of Islam, which (like some other religions) are very strict when interpreted literally, are not applied with equal force throughout the Muslim world.
Prior to September 11, the growth of a fundamen-
talist movement, the T aliban in Afghanistan, provided a particularly striking example of how quickly a fundamen-talist government can use extremism to change a place. The T aliban regime seized control of much of the coun-try during the 1990s and asserted the strictest fundamen-talist regime in the contemporary world. The leadership imposed a wide range of religious restrictions, sought to destroy all statues depicting human forms, required fol-lowers of Hinduism to wear identifying markers, and for-bade women to appear in public with their head exposed.The T aliban in Afghanistan also provided a haven for 
the activities of Islamic extremists who sought to promote an Islamic holy war, or jihad, against the West in general and the United States in particular. One of the key ﬁ  gures 
in the Islamic extremist movement of the past decade, Osama bin Laden, helped ﬁ  nance and mastermind a variety 
of terrorist activities conducted against the United States, including the destruction of the World T rade T owers, the attack on the Pentagon, and the downing of Flight 93 on September 11, 2001 (Fig. 7.41). Bin Laden is now dead, but those following in his footsteps are a product of a revo-lutionary Islamic movement that views the West as a great enemy and that opposes both the westernization and liber-alization of the traditionally Islamic realms. These beliefs are certainly not representative of Islam as a whole, but they are religious beliefs. Indeed, they can be traced to a form of Islam, known as Wahhabi Islam , which developed 
in the eighteenth century in opposition to what was seen as sacrilegious practices on the part of Ottoman rulers. The champions of the opposition movement called for a return to a purportedly pure variant of Islam from centuries ear-lier. The Saudi Arabian state is the hearth of Wahhabi Islam today, as the Saudi Royal family has championed

Wahhabi Islam since the 1800s. Saudis fund Wahhabi 
Islamic schools, called madrasses, around the world.
A variety of forces have fueled the violent path on 
which the Wahhabi extremist movement has embarked, but some of these forces are unambiguously geographic. Perhaps the most important is the widely held view among movement followers that “inﬁ  dels” have invaded the 
Islamic holy land over the past 80 years. Of particular con-cern to Islamic extremists are the presence of American military and business interests in the Arabian Peninsula, the establishment of the state of Israel, and the support European and American governments have given Israel. A principal goal of the movement is to bring an end to what are seen as improper territorial incursions. A second geo-graphically related concern of Wahhabi extremists is the diffusion of modern culture and technology and its impact on traditional lifestyles and spiritual practices. Ridding the Islamic world of such inﬂ  uences is also a major goal.
Islamic fundamentalists who have resorted to vio-
lence in pursuit of their cause (thereby becoming extrem-ists) are relatively small in number. Y et one of the critical contemporary issues is the extent to which they can attract widespread support throughout the Islamic world. The potential for such support is greatest among those who feel that they are the losers in the contemporary global eco-nomic order and who feel their cultures are fundamentally threatened. By extension, a key to avoiding the division of the world into mutually antagonistic religious realms is to promote an atmosphere in which such feelings do not become widespread. This, in turn, suggests the impor-tance of non-Islamic cultures conveying an understanding of the gap between mainstream and fundamentalist Islam, and supporting the economic and political efforts of genu-inely democratic forces in Islamic countries.
Boal’s studies in Northern Ireland demonstrate that solving a religious conﬂ  ict is typically not about theology; it is about identity. You are assigned the potentially Nobel Prize–win-ning task of “solving” the conﬂ  ict either in Northern Ireland or in Israel and Palestine. Using Boal’s example, determine how you can alter activity spaces and change identities to create the conditions for long-lasting peace in this conﬂ  ict zone. Figure 7.41

Religion is a major force in shaping and changing culture. The major world religions today all stem from an area of Eurasia stretching from the eastern Mediterranean to China. Major world religions are distributed regionally, with Hinduism in India; Buddhism, T aoism, Shintoism, and Chinese philosophies in East and Southeast Asia; Islam reaching across North Africa, through the Middle East and into Southeast Asia; Shamanist religions mainly in Subsaharan Africa; and Christianity in Europe, Western Asia, the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Judaism, another major world religion, is not as concentrated. T oday, Judaism has a base in Israel and has adherents scattered throughout Europe and the Americas.
As the September 11, 2001, attacks on New Y ork City and Washington, D.C. made 
clear, religious beliefs can drive people to extremist behaviors. On a day-to-day basis, however, religion more typically drives cultures—shaping how people behave, how people perceive the behaviors of others, and how people across place, scale, and time interact with each other.c07Religion.indd Page 247  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501c07Religion.indd Page 247  9/19/11  10:51 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

249  Political Geography   8     CHAPTER
  Field Note    Independence Is Better Than Servitude  
  I arrived in Ghana just after an assas-
sination attempt on the coun-try’s ﬁ  rst president,   Kwame   
Nkrumah. As I drove through the capital city of Accra in 1962, I stopped short when I saw a statue of President Nkrumah in the middle of the street. I have seen plenty of statues of leaders in my travels, but this one was unique.   Ghanians   had dressed their hospital-ridden president in a hospital gown and bandaged his head!  
  I stopped the car to take a picture (Fig. 8.1), and I 
read the proclamations on Nkrumah’s statue. Written in English, they said, “To me the liberation of Ghana will be meaningless unless it is linked up with the lib-eration of Africa” and “We prefer self-government with danger to servitude in tranquility.”  
  Ghana, the ﬁ  rst   Subsaharan   African colony 
to become independent, gained its independence in 1960. A wave of decolonization swept through Africa in the 1960s (Fig. 8.2)—fueled by the hope that decolonization would bring political and economic independence. But decolonization did not eliminate political and economic problems for Africa. Former colonies became states, reaching political indepen-dence under international law; each new country was now sovereign, legally ha  v  ing the ultimate say over what happened within the borders. New politi-cal problems arose within the formally independent countries. Each had to deal with a mixture of peoples, cultures, languages, and religions that were grouped within single poli  t  ical units during the colonial period.

They had to try to adapt colonial social and political structures to the needs of 
the newly independent states. Economically, the new countries found themselves fully intertwined in the world economy, unable to control fundamental elements of their own eco  n  omies.  
  For many of the new African states, Nkrumah’s words rang true—independence 
was better than servitude, even if it meant danger instead of tranquility. Nkrumah, elected in 1960, was overthrown by the mil  i  tary in 1966 and died in exile in 1972.  
  The story of Ghana and President Nkrumah is a familiar one. After decades 
of European colonial rule,   peoples   around the world sought indepen  d  ence; they  Figure 8.2

pendence movements between 1750 and 1939 occurred mainly in the Americas. The second 
major wave of independence movements after 1940 occurred mainly in Africa and Asia. South Sudan became the most recently recognized independent state in July 2011, bringing the total number of member states in the United Nations to 193.

wanted to have their own country, and they wanted to have a voice in what hap-
pened in their country. Nkrumah knew the risk was great—danger came with the quick transition and from the inheritance of a political organization that made lit-tle sense for Ghana or the people who lived there. European colonialism  organized the world as a huge functional region controlled from Europe and d  e  signed to serve Europe’s economic and political interests. Colonialism also brought the European way of polit  i  cally o  r  ganizing space into states to the rest of the world. This system and its lack of ﬁ  t for most of the world   has   caused political strife, and yet, peoples still seek to become independent countries.  Tropic of CancerArctic Circle

252 Chapter 8   Political Geography 
organizing space (into states) that is less than 400 years 
old. Just as people create places, imparting ch  a  racter to 
space and shaping culture, people make states. States and state boundaries are made, shaped, and r  e  ﬁ ned by people, 
their actions and their history. Even the idea of dividing the world into territorially deﬁ  ned states is one created 
and e  x  ported by people.  
  Central to the  state are the concepts of   territory   and 
territoriality. As geographer Stuart   Elden   has pointed out, 
the modern concept of territory arose in early modern 
Europe as a system of political units came into being with ﬁ xed, distinct boundaries and at least a quasi-independent 
government.   Territoriality   is the process by which such 
units come into being. T erritoriality, however, can take 
place at different scales. In a book published in 1986, geographer Robert Sack deﬁ  ned   territoriality   as “the 
attempt by an individual or group to affect, inﬂ  uence, or 
control people, phenomena, and relationships, by delim-
iting and asserting control over a geographic area.” Sack sees human territoriality as a key ingredient in the con-struction of social and p  o  litical spaces. He calls for a bet-
ter understanding of the human organization of the planet through a consideration of how and why certain territorial strategies are pursued at different times and across pla  c  es.  
  T oday, territoriality is tied to the concept of sover-
eignty. As Sack explained, territorial behavior implies an 
expression of control over a territory. In international law, the concept of sovereignty is territorially d  e  ﬁ ned.   HOW   IS SPACE   POLITICALLY ORGANIZED 
INTO STATES AND NATIONS?  
  Political geography is the study of the political 
organization of the world. Political geographers study 
the spatial manifestations of political processes at various scales: how politically meaningful spaces came into b  e  ing 
and how these spaces inﬂ  uence outcomes. At the global 
scale, we have a world divided into individual cou  n  tries, 
which are commonly called states. A state is a politi-cally organized territory with a permanent popul  a  tion, 
a deﬁ  ned territory, and a government. T o be a state, an entity must be recognized as such by other states.  
  The present-day division of the world political map 
into states is a product of endless accommodations and 
adjustments within and between human societies. On the conventional political map, a mosaic of colors is used to represent more than 200 countries and territories, a visu-alization that accentuates the sep  a  ration of these countries 
by boundaries (Fig. 8.3). The political map of the world is the world map most of us learn ﬁ  rst. We look at it, memo-
rize it, and name the countries and perhaps each country’s capital. It hangs in the front of our classrooms, is used to organize maps in our textbooks, and becomes so natural looking to us that we begin to think it is natural.  
  The world map of states is anything but natural. The 
mosaic of states on the map represents a way of politically   Political activity is as basic to human culture as language or religion. All indi-
viduals, groups, communities, nations, governments, and supranational organizations 
engage in poli  t  ical activity. Each desires power and inﬂ  uence to achieve personal and public goals. Whether or not we like po  l  itics, each of us is caught up in these processes, with effects ranging from the composition of school boards to the conduct of war.  
  In this chapter, we examine how geographers study politics, the domain of polit-
ical geography. Like all ﬁ  elds of g  e  ography (and the social sciences, more generally), political geographers used to spend a lot of time explaining why the world is the way it is and trying to predict or prescribe the future. Today, political geographers spend much more time trying to understand the spatial a  s  sumptions and structures under-lying politics, the ways people organize space, the role territory plays in politics, and the problems that result from changing political and territorial circum  s  tances.  
  Key Questions     For   Chapter 8  
   1.   How is space politically   organized into states and nations?  
   2 .    How do states spatially organize their governments?

   4.   How does the study of geopolitics help us understand the world?  
   5.   What are supranational organizations, and what is the future of the state?  c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 252  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 252  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

minor German states created a complicated patchwork of 
political entities, many with poorly deﬁ  ned borders. The 
emerging political state was accompanied by mercantilism, which led to the accumulation of wealth through plun-der, colonization, and the protection of home industries and foreign markets. Rivalry and competition intensi-ﬁ ed in Europe as well as abroad. Powerful royal families 
struggled for dominance in eastern and southern Europe. Instability was the rule, strife occurred fr  e  quently, and 
repressive governments prevailed.  
  The event in European history that marks the 
beginning of the modern state system is the Peace of 
Westphalia, negotiated in 1648 among the princes of 
the states making up the Holy Roman Empire, as well as a few neighboring states. The treaties that constituted this peace concluded Europe’s most destructive internal struggle over religion during the Thirty Y ears’ War. They contained new language recognizing the rights of ru  l  ers 
within deﬁ  ned, demarcated territories. The language of 
the treaties laid the foundations for a Europe made up of mutually recognized territorial states.  
  The rise of the   Westphalian   state system marked a 
fundamental change in the relationship between people 
and territory. In previous eras,   where   a society lived con-
stituted its territory; in the   Westphalian   system it became 
the   territory   that deﬁ  ned the   society  . T erritory is treated as 
a ﬁ  xed element of political ident  i  ﬁ cation, and states deﬁ  ne 
exclusive,   nonoverlapping   territories.  
  Even well after the Peace of Westphalia, absolutist 
rulers controlled most European states. During the later 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, however, the devel-opment of an increasingly wealthy middle class proved to be the undoing of absolutism in parts of   western   Europe. 
City-based merchants gained money, inﬂ  uence, and pres-
tige, while the power of the nobility declined. The tra-ditional measure of afﬂ  uence—land—became less impor-
tant. The merchants and bus  i  nessmen demanded political 
recognition. In the 1780s, a series of upheavals began that changed the sociopolitical face of the continent, most notably the French Rev  o  lution of 1789. The revolution, 
conducted in the name of the French people, ushered in an era in which the foundations for political authority came to be seen as resting with a state’s citizenry, not with a hereditary m  o  narch.  
  Nations  
  The popular media and press often use the words nation, 
state, and country interchangeably. Political geographers use state and country interchangeably (often preferring 
state), but the word nation is distinct. State is a l  e  gal term 
in international law, and the international political com-munity has some agreement about what this term means. Nation, on the other hand, is a culturally deﬁ  ned term, and Sovereignty means having a recognized right to control a territory both politically and militarily. The states of the world have the last say, legally, at least, over their respective territories. When the intern  a  tional community recognizes 
an entity as a state, it also recognizes the entity as being sov-
ereign within its borders. Under international law, states are sovereign, and they have the right to defend their territorial integrity against incu  r  sion from other states.  
  The Modern State Idea  
  In the 1600s, Europeans were not the only ones who 
behaved territorially, organized themselves into di  s  tinct 
political units, or claimed sovereignty. Because territorial-ity manifests itself in different ways, the idea of the state appeared in a variety of forms across world regions 400 or 500 years ago. The role territory played in d  e  ﬁ ning the 
state and the sovereign varied by region.  
  In North America, American Indian tribes behaved 
territorially but not necessarily exclusively. Plains tribes 
shared hunting grounds with neighboring tribes who were friendly, and they fought over hunting grounds with neighboring tribes who were unfriendly. T erri-torial boundaries were usually not delineated on the ground. Plains tribes also held territory communally so that individual tribal members did not “own” land. In a political sense, terr  i  toriality was most expressed by 
tribes within the Plains. Similarly, in Southeast Asia and 
in Africa, state-like political entities also existed. In all of these places, and in Europe before the mid-1600s, rulers held sway over a people, but there was no collec-tive agreement among rulers about how territory would be organized or what r  u  lers could do within their respec-
tive domains.  
  The European state idea deserves particular atten-
tion because it most inﬂ  uenced the development of 
the modern state system. We can see traces of   this   state 
idea more than two millennia ago near the southeastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea, where distinct kingdoms emerged within discrete territ  o  ries.   Greek philosophy on 
governance and aspects of Ancient Greece and Rome play 
parts in the modern state idea.   Political geogr  a  pher Rhys 
Jones studied state formation in the United Kingdom 
during the European Middle Ages. He found the ﬁ  rst 
states in Wales were small in size but had the attributes of the modern state. In the late   Middle   Ages, powerful rul-
ers constructed more sizable states in what are now the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. We cannot trace a clear evolution in the Eur  o  pean state idea, but we can see 
aspects of the modern state in many places and at many points in European history.  
  By the early seventeenth century, states including 
the Republic of Venice, Brandenburg, the Papal States 
of central Italy, the Kingdom of Hungary, and several c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 253  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 253  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

of the most widely read sch  o  lars on nationalism today, 
Benedict Anderson, deﬁ  nes the nation as an “imagined 
community”— it is ima  g  ined because one will never 
meet all of the people in the nation, and it is a com-
munity because one noneth  e  less sees oneself as part of 
that nation.  
  All nations are ultimately mixtures of different peo-
ples. The French are often considered to be the cla  s  sic 
example of a nation, but the most French-feeling person 
in France today is the product of a melding together of a wide variety of cultural groups over time, including Celts, Ancient Romans, Franks, Goths, and many more. If the majority of inhabitants of modern France belong to the French nation, it is because, during the formation few people agree on exactly what it means. Some argue that a nation is simply the people within a state’s bor-ders; in this case, all people who live in Ge  r  many. Y et this 
approach gives little sense of how politically charged the concept of nation really is.  
  In keeping with the way the term was originally 
used, we deﬁ  ne nation as a group of people who think 
of themselves as one based on a sense of shared culture 
and history, and who seek some degree of political-territorial autonomy. This idea encompasses different kinds of culturally deﬁ  ned nations. Nations variously see the  m  selves as sharing a religion, a language, an eth-
nicity, or a history. How a nation is deﬁ  ned depends on 
the people who see themselves as part of the nation. One Tropic of Cancer

 How Is Space Politically Organized Into States and Nations? 255
  Nation-State  
  The European idea that the map of   states   should look 
like the map of   nations   became the aspiration of govern-
ing elites around the world. A nation-state is a politi-
cally organized area in which nation and state o  c  cupy the 
same space. Since few (if any) states are nation-states, the importance of the concept of the nation-state lies primar-ily in the idea behind it. In the effort to form nation-states, some states have chosen to privilege one et  h  nic group at 
the expense of others, and other states have outlined a common history and culture. Either way, the state works to temper identities that might challenge the state’s territorial i  n  tegrity.  of the French territorial state, the people came to think of themselves as French—not b  e  cause the French nation 
existed as a primordial group that has always been di  s  tinct.  
  People in a nation tend to look to their past and 
think, “we have been through much together,” and when 
they look to their future they often think, “whatever hap-pens we will go through it together.” A nation is identi-ﬁ ed by its own membership; therefore, we cannot simply 
deﬁ ne a nation as the people within a territory. I  n  deed, 
rarely does a nation’s extent correspond precisely with a state’s borders. Many countries have mu  l  t  i  ple nations 
within their borders. For example, in the country of Bel-gium, two nations, the Flemish and the Wa  l  loons, exist 
within the state borders.  Tropic of CancerArctic Circle

256 Chapter 8   Political Geography 
This loyalty does not necessarily coincide with the borders 
of the state. A state, in contrast, seeks to promote a sense of nationhood that coincides with its own borders. In the name of nationalism, a state with more than one nation within its borders may attempt to build a single national identity out of the divergent people within its bo  r  ders. In the name of 
nationalism, a state may also promote co  n  ﬂ ict with another 
state that it sees as threatening to its territorial inte  g  rity.  
  Even though the roots of nationalism lie in ear-
lier centuries, the nineteenth century was the true age 
of nationalism in Europe. In some cases the pursuit of nationalist ambitions produced greater cohesion within long-established states, such as in France or Spain; in other cases nationalism became a rallying cry for bring-ing together people with some shared historical or cul-tural el  e  ments into a single state, such as in the cases of 
Italy or Germany. Similarly, people who saw themselves as separate nations within other states or empires launched successful separatist mov  e  ments. Ireland, Norway, and 
Poland all serve as examples of this phenomenon.  
  European state leaders used the tool of nationalism 
to strengthen the state. The modern map of Europe is still 
fragmented, but much less so than in the 1600s (Fig. 8.4). In the process of creating nation-states in Europe, states absorbed smaller entities into their borders, resolved   The goal of creating nation-states dates to the 
French Revolution, which sought to replace control by a 
monarchy or colonizer with an imagined cultural-historical community of French people. The Revolution initially promoted democracy, the idea that the people are the 
ultimate sovereign—that is, the people, the   n  a  tion  , have 
the ultimate say over what happens within the state. Each 
nation, it was argued, should have its own sove  r  eign terr  i-
  tory, and only when that was achieved would true democ-
racy and stability exist.  
  People began to see the idea of the nation-state as 
the ultimate form of political-territorial organization, 
the right expression of sovereignty, and the best route to stability. The key problem associated with the idea of the nation-state is that it assumes the presence of reasonably well-deﬁ  ned, stable nations living co  n  tiguously within 
discrete territories. Very few places in the world come close to satisfying this requirement. Nonetheless, in the Europe of the eigh  t  eenth and nineteenth centuries, many 
believed the assumption could be met.  
  The quest to form nation-states in the Europe of the 
1800s was associated with a rise in nationalism. We can view 
nationalism from two vantage points: that of the people and that of the state. When people have a strong sense of nation-alism, they have a loyalty to and a belief in the nation itself.

tions. Such complications might include states contai  n  ing 
more than one nation, nations residing in more than one 
state, and even n  a  tions without a state at all.  
  Nearly every state in the world is a multinational 
state, a state with more than one nation inside its borders. 
The people living in the former state of Yugoslavia never achieved a strong sense of Yugoslav nationhood. Mil-lions of people who were citizens of Yugoslavia never had a Yugoslav nationality. They long identiﬁ  ed themselves as  Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, or members of other nations or 
ethnic groups. Yugoslavia was a state that was always com-prised of more than one nation, and it eventually co  l  lapsed.  
  When a nation stretches across borders and across 
states, the nation is called a   multistate   nation. Polit  i  cal 
geographer George White studied the states of Roma-
nia and Hungary and their overlapping nations (Fig. 8.5). As he has noted, the territory of T ransylv  a  nia is cur-
rently in the middle of the state of Romania, but it has not always been that way. For two centuries, Hungary’s borders stretched far enough   east   to encompass T ra  n  syl-
vania. The T ransylvanian region today is populated by 
Romanians and by Hungarians, and places within T ran-sylvania are seen as pivotal to the histories of both Hun-gary and R  o  mania. In keeping with the nation-state ideal, 
it is not surprising that both Romania and Hungary have conﬂ icts by force as well as by negotiation, and d  e  ﬁ ned 
their borders more precisely.  
  T o help people within the borders relate to the domi-
nant national ideal, states provide security, infrastructure, 
and goods and services for their citizens. States support education, health care, and a mil  i  tary to preserve the state 
and to create a connection between the people and the 
state—to build a nation-state. Eur  o  pean states even used 
the colonization of Africa and Asia in the late 1800s and 
early 1900s as a way to pr  o  mote nationalism. People could 
take pride in their nation’s vast colonial empire. People 
could identify the  m  selves with their nation, be it French, 
Dutch, or British, by contrasting themselves with the peo-
ple in the colonies whom they deﬁ  ned as mystical or savage. By deﬁ  ning themselves in relation to an “Other,” the state and the people helped identify the supposed “traits” of their nation; in so doing, they began to build a n  a  tion-state.  
  Multistate   Nations, Multinational States, 
and Stateless Nations  
  People with a sense of belonging to a particular nation 
rarely all reside within a si  n  gle state’s borders. The lack of 
ﬁ t between nation and state therefore creates complica-  Guest Field Note  
  Cluj-Napoca  , Romania  
  To Hungarians, Transylvania is sig-niﬁ cant because it was an impor-
tant part of the Hungarian Kingdom for a thousand years. Many of their great leaders were born and bur-ied there, and many of their great churches, colleges, and architec-tural achievements are located there too. For example, in the city of   Cluj-Napoca   (  Kolozsvár   in Hun-garian) is St. Michael’s Cathedral, and next to it is the statue of King Matthias, one of Hu  n  gary’s greatest kings. Romanians have long lived in the territory too, tracing their roots back to the Roman Empire. To Romanian nationa  l  ists, the existence of Roman ruins in Tran-sylvania is proof of their Roman ancestry and their right to govern Transylvania because their ancestors lived in Transylvania before those of the Hungarians. When a  r  chaeologists found Roman ruins around St. Michael’s Cathedral and King Matthias’s statue, they i  m  mediately began excavating them, which in turn aggravated the ethnic Hungarians. Traveling in Tra  n  sylvania made me very aware of how important places are to peoples and how contested they can be.

established a Kurdish Security Zone north of the 36th 
parallel in Iraq, and that area continues to have signiﬁ  -
cant autonomy in present-day Iraq. The no-ﬂ  y zone in the 
Kurdish region of northern Iraq has created a relatively peaceful place compared to continued violence in south-ern Iraq. Violent acts still mar the Kurdish north, but prosperity has also come to the region through petrodol-lars. An October 2008 travel article in the   New York Times   
described new theme parks and gated communities that 
reﬂ ect the afﬂ  uence in the city of   Erbil  , which is the Kurd-
ish capital city in Iraq. The article also described   Erbil’s   
6000-year-old citadel as a reminder that the city is “one of the oldest continuously inh  a  bited cities in the world.”  
  An independent Kurdish state seems unlikely, at 
least in the near future. In addition to northern Iraq, the 
Kurds form the largest minority in T urkey where the city of   Diyarbakir   is the unofﬁ  cial Kurdish capital of T u  r  key. 
Relations between the 10 million Kurds in T urkey and the T urkish government in Ankara have been vol  a  tile, and 
T urkey regards the Kurdish region as part of the state’s core territory.  Without the consent of T urkey, establish-ing a truly independent Kurdish state will be di  f  ﬁ cult.  
  European Colonialism and the Diffusion 
of the Nation-State Model  
  Europe exported its concepts of state, sovereignty, and 
the desire for nation-states to much of the rest of the world through two waves of colonialism (Fig. 8.7). In the interests in T ransylv  a  nia, and some Hu  n  garians continue 
to look upon the region as territory that has been illegiti-mately lost. White explains how i  m  portant territory is 
to a nation: “The control and maintenance of territory is as crucial as the control and maint  e  nance of a national 
language, religion, or a particular way of life. Indeed, a la  n  guage, religion or way of life is difﬁ  cult to maintain 
without control over territory.” In the case of Romania and Hungary, as in other similar situations, te  r  ritory is as 
important as  “language, religion, or way of life.” When 
multiple nations or states claim a  t  tachments to the same 
piece of territory, the potential for conﬂ  ict is signiﬁ  cant.  
  Another complication that arises from the lack of ﬁ  t 
between nations and states is that some nations do not have 
a state; they are stateless nations. The Palestinians are an example of a stateless nation. The Palestinian Arabs have gained control over the Gaza Strip and fragments of the Occupied T erritories of the West Bank and Golan Heights. These territories may form the foundations of a future state. The United Nations Agency for Palestinian Refugees records 4.9 million registered  Palestinian refugees. Well over half of the registered  Palestinian refugees conti  n  ue 
to live in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and other Arab states. 
Nearly 2 million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip and West Bank; however, the international community does not universally recognize the Pale  s  tinian lands as a state.  
  A much larger stateless nation is the Kurds whose 
population of between 25 and 30 million live in an area 
called Kurdistan that covers parts of six states (Fig. 8.6). In the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, the United Nations

the ﬂ  ows of raw materials for their own beneﬁ  t, and we 
can still see the tangible evidence of that organization (plantations, ports, mines, and railroads) on the cultural landscape.  
  Despite the end of colonialism, the political organi-
zation of space and the global world economy persist. And 
while the former colonies are now independent states, their economies are anything but indepen  d  ent. In many 
cases raw material ﬂ  ows are as great as they were before 
the colonial era came to an end. For example, today in Gabon, Africa, the railroad goes from the interior forest, which is logged for plywood, to the major port and capi-tal city, Libreville. The second largest city, Port   Gentil  , 
is located to the south of Libreville, but the two cities are not connected directly by road or railroad. As the crow ﬂ ies, the cities are 90 miles apart, but if you drive from one 
to the other, the circuitous route will take you 435 miles. Both cities are export focused. Port   Gentil   is tied to the 
global oil economy, with global oil corporations respon-sible for building much of the city and its housing, and employing many of its people.  
  Construction of the Capitalist World Economy  
  The long-term impacts of colonialism are many and var-
ied. One of the most powerful impacts of colonialism was the construction of a global order characterized by great differences in economic and political power. The European colonial enterprise gave birth to a   globalized   
economic order in which the European states and areas dominated by European migrants emerged as the major centers of economic and political activity. Through sixteenth century, Spain and Portugal took advantage of an increasingly well-consolidated internal political order and newfound wealth to expand their inﬂ    u  ence to increas-
ingly far-ﬂ  ung realms during the ﬁ  rst wave of colonial-ism. Later joined by Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, the ﬁ  rst wave of colonialism established a far-
reaching political and economic system. A  f  ter indepen-
dence movements in the Americas during the late 1700s and 1800s, a second wave of c  o  lonialism began in the late 
1800s. The major colonizers were Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Italy. The coloniz-ing parties met for the Berlin Conference in 1884–1885 and arb  i  trarily laid out the colonial map of Africa with-
out reference to indigenous cultural or political arrange-ments. Driven by motives ranging from economic proﬁ  t 
to the desire to bring Christianity to the rest of the world, colonialism projected European power and a European approach to organizing poli  t  ical space into the non-Euro-
pean world (Fig. 8.8).  
  With Europe in control of so much of the world, 
Europeans laid the ground rules for the emerging inter-
national state system, and the modern European concept of the nation-state became the model adopted around the world. Europe also established and deﬁ  ned the ground 
rules of the capitalist world economy, creating a sy  s  tem of 
economic interdependence that persists today.  
  During the heyday of colonialism, the imperial pow-
ers exercised ruthless control over their domains and 
organized them for maximum economic exploitation. The capacity to install the infrastructure necessary for such efﬁ cient proﬁ  teering is itself evidence of the power rela-
tionships involved: entire populations were regimented in the service of the colonial ruler. Colonizers organized    Figure 8.7

other parts of East and Southeast Asia as well as Paciﬁ  c 
Islands by colonial means. But the concentr  a  tion of 
wealth that colonia  l  ism brought to Europe, and to parts 
of the world dominated by European settlers, i  n  cluding 
the United States, Canada, and Australia, is at the heart 
of the highly uneven global distribution of power that continues even t  o  day.  
  The forces of colonialism played a key role in knit-
ting together the economies of widely separated a  r  eas, 
which gave birth to a global economic order called the 
world economy. Wealth is unevenly distributed in the world economy, as can be seen in statistics on per cap-ita gross national income (GNI): Bangladesh’s GNI is only $1,340, whereas Norway’s is $53,690. But to truly colonialism, Europeans extracted wealth from colonies and put colonized peoples in a p  o  sition of subservience.  
  Of course, not all Europeans proﬁ  ted equally from 
colonialism. Enormous poverty persisted within the most 
powerful European states, and sustaining control over colonies could be costly. In the late seventeenth century, Spain had a large colonial empire, but the empire was economically draining Spain by then. Moreover, west-ern Europeans were not the only people to proﬁ  t from 
colonialism. During the period of European colonia  l  ism 
(1500–1950), Russia and the United States expanded over 
land instead of over seas, proﬁ  ting from the taking of ter-r  i  tory and the subjugation of indigenous peoples. Japan 
was a regional colonial power, controlling Korea and    Figure 8.8

how each dot ﬁ  ts into the pi  c  ture as a whole.1   In   the last 
few decades, social scientists have sought to understand 
how each dot, how each country and each locality, ﬁ  t into 
the picture of the world as a whole. T o study a single dot or even each dot one at a time, we miss the whole. Even if we study every single dot and add them together, we still miss the whole. We need to step back and see the whole, as well as the individual dots, studying how one affects the other. By now, this should sound familiar: it is one of the ways geographers think about scale.  understand why wealth is distributed unevenly, we can-not simply study each country, its resources, and its pro-duction of goods. Rather, we need to understand where countries ﬁ  t in the world economy. That is, we need to see the big picture.

sion the magniﬁ  cent work of nineteenth-century French 
painter Georges Pierre   Seurat  , Sunday Afternoon on the 
Island of La Grande   Jatte   (Fig. 8.9). The painting hangs in

see the painting and if you stand close enough, you will see   Seurat’s   post-Impressionist method of painting millions 
of points or dots—single, tiny brush strokes, each a single color. When you step back again, you can gain a sense of ATLANTIC

this metaphor for world-systems theory in a political geography class at

producers gain proﬁ  t by   commodifying   whatever they 
can.   Commodiﬁ  cation   is the process of pla  c  ing a price 
on a good, ser  v  ice, or idea and then buying, selling, and 
trading that item. Companies create new products, gen-
erate new twists on old products, and create demand for the products through marketing. As chil  d  ren, none of the 
authors of this book could have imagined buying a bottle of water. Now, the sale of water in bottles is commo  n  place.  
  Second, despite the existence of approximately 200 
states, everything takes place within the context of the 
world economy (and has since 1900). Colonialism played a major role in establishing this system by exporting the European state idea and facilita  t  ing the construction of an 
interdependent global economy. When col  o  nies became 
independent, gaining the legal status of sovereign states was relatively easy for most colonies. The United Nations Charter even set up a committee to help colonies do so after World War II. But gaining true econo  m  ic indepen-
dence is all but impossible. The economies of the world are tied together, generating intended and unintended consequences that fundame  n  tally change places.  
  Lastly, world-systems theorists see the world econ-
omy as a three-tiered structure: the core, periphery, and 
  semiperiphery  . The core and the periphery are not just 
places but the sites where particular pro  c  esses take place. 
The core is where one is most likely to ﬁ  nd higher levels 
of education, higher salaries, and more techno  l  ogy—core 
processes that generate more wealth in the world econ-omy. The periphery more commonly has lower levels of education, lower salaries, and less technology—peripheral processes associated with a more marginal position in the world eco  n  omy.    Political geographers took note of one sociologist’s 
theory of the world economy and added much to it. Build-
ing on the work of Immanuel   Wallerstein  , proponents of 
  world-systems theory   view the world as much more than 
the sum total of the world’s states. Much like a pointillist 
painting, world-systems theorists hold that to understand any state, we must also understand its spatial and func-tional relationships within the world eco  n  omy.  
  Wallerstein’s   publications number in the hundreds, 
and the political and economic geography publications tied to world-systems theory number in the thousands. T o simplify the research, we can study the three basic tenets of world-systems theory, as   Wallerstein   deﬁ nes them:  
  1.   The world economy has one market and a global 
division of labor.  
  2.   Although the world has multiple states, almost every-
thing takes place within the context of the world economy.  
  3.   The world economy has a three-tier structure.  
  According to   Wallerstein  , the development of a 
world economy began with capitalist exchange around 
1450 and encompassed the globe by 1900. Capitalism 
means that in the world economy, individuals, corpora-tions, and states produce goods and services that are exchanged for proﬁ  t. T o generate a proﬁ  t, produ  c  ers seek 
the cheapest production and costs. Since labor (including salaries and beneﬁ  ts) is now often the most e  x  pensive of 
these production costs, corporations often seek to move production of a good from, for example, North Carolina to Mexico and then to China, simply to take advantage of cheaper labor. In addition to the world labor supply,    Figure 8.9

fee, fruit, and cotton production. During the second wave 
of colonialism, which happened after the Indu  s  trial Revo-
lution, colonizers set their sights on cheap industrial labor, 
cheap raw materials, and large-scale agricu  l  tural plantations.  
  Not all core countries in the world today were colo-
nial powers, however. Countries including Switzerland, 
Singapore, and Australia have signiﬁ  cant global clout 
even though they were never classic colonial po  w  ers, and 
that clout is tied in signiﬁ  cant part to their positions in the global economy. The countries gained positions through access to the networks of production, consumption, and exchange in the wea  l  thiest parts of the world and through 
their ability to take advantage of that access.  
  World-Systems and Political Power  
  Are economic power and political power one and the 
same? No, but certainly economic power can bring polit  i-
  cal power. In the current system, economic power means 
wealth, and political power means the ability to inﬂ    u  ence 
others to achieve your goals. Political power is not simply a function of sovereignty. Each state is theoret  i  cally sover-
eign, but not all states have the same ability to inﬂ  uence 
others or achieve their political goals. Ha  v  ing wealth helps 
leaders amass political power. For instance, a wealthy   Figure 8.10 presents one way of dividing up the 
world in world-systems terms. The map desi  g  nates some 
states as part of the   semiperiphery  —places where core 
and periphery processes are both occu  r  ring—places that 
are exploited by the core but in turn exploit the periphery. 
The   semiperiphery   acts as a buffer between the core and 
periphery, preventing the polarization of the world into two e  x  tremes.  
  Political geographers, economic geographers, and 
other academics continue to debate world-systems theory. 
The major concerns are that it overemphasizes economic factors in political development, that it is very state-centric, and that it does not fully account for how places move from one category to another. Nonetheless,   Wallerstein’s   
work has encouraged many to see the world political map as a system of interlinking parts that need to be under-stood in relation to one another and as a whole. As such, the impact of world-systems theory has been considerable in political geography, and it is increasingly commonplace for geographers to refer to the kinds of core–periphery distin  c  tions suggested by world-systems theory.  
  World-systems theory helps explain how colonial 
powers were able to amass great concentrations of wealth. 
During the ﬁ  rst wave of colonialism, colonizers extracted goods from the Americas and the Caribbean and exploited Africa for slave labor, amassing wealth through sugar, cof-PACIFIC

264 Chapter 8   Political Geography 
  HOW DO STATES SPATIALLY ORGANIZE 
THEIR GOVERNMENTS?  
  In the  1950s, a famous political geographer, R  i  chard 
Hartshorne, described the forces within the state that 
unify the people as centripetal and the forces that divide them as centrifugal. Whether a state continues to exist, according to Hartshorne, depends on the balance between centripetal and centrifugal forces. Many political geo  g  ra-
phers have debated Hartshorne’s theory, and most have concluded that we cannot select a given event or  process 
and simply deﬁ  ne it as centrifugal or centripetal. An event 
such as a war can pull the state together for a short time and then divide the state over the long term. Timing, scale, interaction, and pe  r  spe  c  tive factor into uniﬁ  cation 
and division in a state at any given point. Instead of creat-ing a balance sheet of centripetal and ce  n  trifugal forces, 
governments attempt to unify states through nation-building, through structuring the go  v  ernment in a way 
that melds the nations within, by deﬁ  ning and defending 
boundaries, and through expres  s  ing control over all of the 
territory within those boundaries.  
  By looking at how different governments have 
attempted to unify the peoples and territories within their 
domains, we are reminded how important geography is. Governance does not take place in a vacuum. The unique characteristics of places shapes whether any possible gov-ernmental “solution” solves or exacerbates ma  t  ters.  
  Form of Government  
  The internal political geographic organization of states 
can have an impact on state unity. Most states in the world are either unit  a  ry or federal states.  
  Until the end of World War II, many European 
states, including multinational states, were highly central-
ized, with the capital city serving as the focus of power. States made no clear e  f  forts to accommodate minor  i  ties 
(such as Bretons in France or Basques in Spain) or outly-ing regions where identiﬁ  cation with the state was weaker. 
Political geographers call these highly centralized states   unitary   governments. The administrative framework of 
a unitary government is designed to ensure the central 
government’s authority over all parts of the state. The French government divided the state into more than 90   départements  , whose representatives came to Paris not just 
to express regional concerns but to implement central-
government decisions back home.  
  One way of governing a   multinational   state is to 
construct a federal system, organizing state territory into 
regions,   substates   (which we refer to as States), provinces, 
or cantons. In a strong federal system, the regions have 
much control over government policies and funds, and country can establish a mighty military. But political inﬂ  u-
ence is not simply a function of hard power; it is also dip-lomatic. Switzerland’s declared neutral  i  ty, combined with 
its economic might, aids the country’s diplomatic efforts.  
  World-systems theory helps us understand how 
Europe politically reorganized the world during colon  i  al-
ism. When colonialism ended in Africa and Asia, the newly 
independent people continued to follow the European model of political organization. The arbitrarily drawn colonial borders of Africa, dating from the Berlin Con-ference, b  e  came the boundaries of the newly independent 
states. On the map, former colonies became new states; administrative borders transformed into international boundaries; and, in most cases, colonial administrative towns b  e  came capitals. The greatest political challenge 
fa  c  ing the states of Africa since independence has been 
building nation-states out of incredibly divergent (some-times antagonistic) peoples. The leaders of the newly indepen  d  ent states continually work to build nation-states 
in the hope of quelling division among the people, secur-ing their territory, and developing their economic (as well as other) sy  s  tems of organization.  
  The Enduring Impact of the Nation-State Idea  
  The idea of meshing the nation and state into a n  a  tion-
state was not conﬁ  ned to nineteenth-century Europe or 
twentieth-century Africa. Major players in international relations still seek solutions to complex political co  n-
  ﬂ icts by trying to redraw the political map in an effort 
to bring political and national borders into closer corre-
spondence. Faced with the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia or the complex problems of Israel/Palestine, for example, the tendency is often to propose new state boundaries around nations, with the goal of making the nation and state ﬁ  t. Drawing neat boundaries of this sort is usually impossible and the creation of new territories can create different ethno-national problems. Regard-less of the multitude of problems and lack of simple  sol  u  tions to nation and state conﬂ  icts, the European 
 territorial state idea became the world model, and that 
idea is still shaping the political organiz  a  tion of space 
around the world.  
  Imagine you are the leader of a newly independent state 
in Africa or Asia. Determine what your government can do to build a nation that corresponds with the borders of your state. Consider the roles of education, government, military, and culture in your exercise in n  a  tion-building.  c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 264  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 264  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Do States Spatially Organize Their Governments? 265
of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia fell 
apart, despite their federalist systems, and the future of Belgium as a single state is uncertain.  
  Devolution  
  Devolution is the movement of power from the central 
government to regional governments within the state. Sometimes devolution is achieved by reworking a con-stitution to establish a federal system that recogni  z  es the 
permanency of the regional governments, as Spain has 
done. In other places, governments devolve power wit  h-
  out altering constitutions, almost as an experiment. In the 
United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Assembly, a par-liamentary body, resulted from devolution, but the Brit-ish government suspended its activities in 2002 and then reinstated the assembly in 2007. Devolutionary forces can emerge in all kinds of states, old and young, large and small. These forces arise from several sources of internal division:   ethnocultural  , ec  o  nomic, and territorial.  
  Ethnocultural   Devolutionary Movements  
  Many of Europe’s devolutionary movements came from 
nations within a state that deﬁ  ne themselves as being eth-nically, linguist  i  cally, or religiously distinct.  
  The capacity of   ethnocultural   forces to stimulate 
devolutionary processes has been evident, for example, in 
eastern Europe. Parts of the eastern European map have changed quite drastically over the past two de  c  ades, and 
two countries, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, succumbed to devolutionary pressures. In the case of Cz  e  choslovakia, 
the process was peaceful: Czechs and Slovaks divided 
their country, creating a new international border. As Figure 8.13 shows, however, one of the two new states, in a weak federal system, the central government retains a signiﬁ  cant measure of power. Most federal systems are somewhere in between, with gover  n  ments at the state 
scale and at the   substate   scale each having control over 
certain revenues and ce  r  tain policy areas. Gi  v  ing control 
over certain policies (e  s  pecially culturally relative policies) 
to smaller-scale governments is one strategy for keeping the state as a whole together.  
  Federalism functions differently depending on the 
context. In Nigeria, the 36 constituent States choose their 
own judicial system. In the Muslim north, twelve States have   Shari’a   laws (legal systems based on traditional Islamic 
laws), and in the Christian and animist south, the States do 
not (Fig. 8.11).   Shari’a   law in the northern states of Nigeria 
is only applied to Muslims, not to Christians and Animists. 
The move to   Shari’a   law in the north came at the same time 
as democracy swept Nigeria in 2000. Nigerians in the north 
hoped stri  c  ter laws would help root out corruption among 
politicians, although it has failed to do so.  
  In the United States, States take different approaches 
to matters such as the death penalty, access to alcohol 
(Fig. 8.12), and the right to carry concealed weapons but many of the fundamentals of the legal system do not differ among States.  
  Federalism accommodates regional interests by vest-
ing primary power in provinces, States, or other regional 
units over all matters except those explicitly given to the central government. The Australian geographer K. W. Robinson described a federation as “the most geographi-cally expressive of all political systems, based as it is on the existence and accommodation of regional differences . . . federation does not create unity out of d  i  versity; rather, it 
enables the two to coexist.”  
  Choosing a federal system does not always quell 
nationalist sentiment. After all, the multinational states 5° 10° 15°

succes  s  fully, integrated 56 ethnic nations into the state 
of China. China has acknowledged the precarious place 
of the minor  i  ty nations within the larger Han-domi-
nated state by extending rights to minorities, including 
the right to have two children under the government’s One Child Policy. Whether the nations within China will cha  l  lenge the state remains to be seen. In China’s 
far west, Tibetan and   U  y  ghur   separ  a  tist movements 
have become more visible, but the Chinese government’s 
ﬁ rm hold and control of the media and Internet makes it 
difﬁ cult, if not i  m  possible, for separatist groups to hold 
Egyptian-style protests in China.  
  Devolution, however, does not   necessarily   fuel greater 
calls for independence. Nations within states can, instead, 
call for autonomy within the borders of the state. In the United Kingdom, Scotland voted in 1997 to establish its own parliament, which had last met in 1707. The 129 members of the Scottish Parliament swear all  e  giance to 
the Queen of England. The Scottish Parliament has the right to introduce primary legislation over several issues, including education, health, housing, and police. Unlike the parliament in Wales that was esta  b  lished in 1997 and Slovakia, is not homogeneous. About 11 percent of Slovakians are Hungarian, and that minority is concen-trated along the border between Slovakia and Hungary. The Hungarian minority, concerned about linguistic and cultural discrimination, has at times demanded greater autonomy or self-governance to protect its heri  t  age in the 
new state of Slovakia.  
  Compared to the constituent units of the former 
Yugoslavia (discussed in detail in Chapter 7), other coun-
tries shown in Figure 8.14 have dealt with devolutionary pressures more peacefully. Among these are Lithuania and Ukraine. Elsewhere in the world, ho  w  ever, ethno-
cultural fragmentation has produced costly wars. For example, ethno-cultural differences were at the heart of the civil war that wracked Sri Lanka (South Asia) between the 1980s and 2009, with the Sinhalese (Buddhist) major-ity ultimately suppressing the drive by the T amil (Hindu) minority for an independent state.  
  Devolutionary forces based on ethno-cultural 
claims are gaining momentum in places that have long 
looked stable from the outside. The communist govern-ment of China has pragmatically, and arguably relatively   Guest Field Note

  In most states in the U.S., a “dry county” might cause one to think of a place where there is very li  t  tle rain. But in the southern part of the U.S., there are many dry counties—that is, counties with laws forbidding the sale of packaged alcohol. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, keep-ing counties dry was much easier than it is t  o  day. A hundred years ago, it took up to a day to travel to the next town or city on very poor roads. Today, with cars traveling 70 MPH on an interstate, the same trip takes a matter of minutes. Why would counties continue to ban a  l  cohol sales today? Many of the rea-sons are cultural. Of the Arkansas resi-dents who attend church, most are Bap-tists (see Figure 7.28) or other Protestant denominations. Many of these churches prohibit consumption of alcoholic beverages. The Arkansas legislature supports dry counties by requiring counties that want to sell packaged li  q  uor to get 38 percent of the voters in the last election t o 
sign a petition. It only takes 10 percent of that voter pool to get any other issue on the ballot. Today, however, many dry counties in A  r  kansas are known as “damp.” Damp counties are those where restaurants, country clubs and social organiza-tions can apply and receive a l  i  cense to serve alcohol by the drink. This arrangement seems counterintuitive to the idea of a dry county. But business and economic development authorities want damp counties to e  n  courage investment and growth in the local economy.

by the government in Rome high on the list of griev-
ances. Italy also faces serious devolutionary forces on its mainland peninsula. One is rooted in regional dis-parities between north and south. The   Mezzogiorno   
region lies to the south, below the   Ancona   Line (an 
imaginary border extending from Rome to the Adriatic 
coast at   Ancona  ). The wealthier north stands in sharp 
contrast to the poorer south. Despite the large subsi-
dies granted to the   Me  z  zo  g  iorno  , the development gap 
between the north, very much a part of the European 
core, and the south, part of the European periphery, has been widening. Some Italian politicians have exploited widespread impatience with the situation by forming organizations to promote northern interests, including devolution. One of these organiz  a  tions, the Northern 
League, has raised the prospect of an independent state 
called   Padania   in the northern part of Italy centered on 
the Po River. After a surge of enthusiasm, the   Padania   
campaign faltered, but it pushed the Italian government 
to focus more attention on regional inequalities within the country.  
  Brazil provides another example of the interconnec-
tions between devolutionary movements and economics. 
As in northern Italy, a separatist movement emerged in the 1990s in a better-off region in the south that includes the three southernmost States of Rio Grande do   Sul  , the assembly in Northern Ireland that was established in 1998, the parliament of Scotland has the right to levy a tax of up to 3 pence per British pound.  
  Devolutionary pressures can create demands for 
new states, such as the Czech Republic and Slovakia, or 
for greater autonomy within a state, like Scotland in the United Kingdom.  
  Economic Devolutionary Forces  
  Devolutionary pressures often arise from a combination 
of sources. In Catalonia,   ethnocultural   differences play a 
signiﬁ  cant role, but Catalonians also cite economics; with 
about 6 percent of Spain’s territory and just 15 percent of its population, Catalonia produces some 25 percent of all Spanish exports by value and 40 percent of its industrial exports (Fig. 8.15). Pro-independence groups in Cata-lonia held a referendum in April 2011 seeking a vote for independence. The vote failed, but devolutionary forces continue to argue that Cat  a  lonia’s economy pays more 
into the Spanish government than it receives from the state of Spain.  
  Economic forces play an even more prominent 
role in Italy and France. In Italy, demands for auton-
omy for Sardinia are deeply rooted in the island’s eco-nomic circumstances, with accusations of neglect Black Sea Sea of

  Territorial Inﬂ  uences on Devolution  
  We have seen how political decisions and cultural and 
economic forces can generate devolutionary processes in states. Devolutionary events have at least one fea-ture in common: they most often occur on the ma  r  gins 
of states. Note that every one of the devolution-affected areas shown in Figure 8.14 lies on a coast or on a border. Distance, remoteness, and marginal location frequently Santa   Catarina  , and   Parana  . Southerners complained 
that the government was misspending their tax money on assistance to   Amazonia   in northern Br  a  zil. The southern-
ers found a leader, manufactured a ﬂ  ag, and demanded 
independence for their Republic of the Pampas. The Bra-zilian government responded by outlawing the separat-ists’ political party, but the economic differences b  e  tween 
north and south continue, and devolution pressures will certainly arise again.  BASQUE

 How Do States Spatially Organize Their Governments? 269
In that year, a vocal minority of native   Hawai’ians   and 
their sympathizers demanded the return of rights lost 
during the “occupation.” These demands included the right to reestablish an independent state called   H  a  wai’i   
(before its annexation   Hawai’i   was a Polynesian king-
dom) on several of the smaller islands. Their hope is 
that ultimately the island of Kauai, or at least a signiﬁ  cant 
part of that island, which is considered ancestral land, will become a component of the independent   Hawai’ian   state.  
  At present, the native   Hawai’ian   separatists do not 
have the numbers, resources, or inﬂ  uence to achieve their 
aims. The potential for some form of separation between   Hawai’i   and the mainland United States does exist, how-
ever. The political geographer Saul Cohen theorized in 1991 that political entities situated in border zones between geopolitical powers may become gateway states, a  b  sorbing and assimilating diverse cultures and traditions 
and emerging as new entities, no longer dominated by one or the other.   H  a  wai’i  , he suggests, is a candidate for 
this status.  
  T erritorial characteristics can play a signiﬁ  cant role 
in starting and sustaining devolutionary processes. Dis-
tance can be compounded by differences in physical geog-raphy—a feeling of remoteness can be fueled by being iso-lated in a valley or separated by mountains or a river. Basic physical-geographic and   locational   fa  c  tors can thus be key 
ingredients in the devolutionary process.  
  Electoral Geography  
  The partitioning of state territory into electoral districts 
represents another key component of a state’s internal political geography. Ele  c  toral geographers examine how 
the spatial conﬁ  guration of electoral districts and the vot-ing patterns that emerge in particular elections reﬂ  ect and 
inﬂ uence social and political affairs. Various countries use 
different voting systems to elect their governments. For example, in the 1994 South African ele  c  tion, government 
leaders introduced a system of majority rule while award-ing some power to each of nine newly formed regions. The overall effect was to protect, to an extent, the rights of minor  i  ties in those regions.  
  In the 1994 election in South Africa, the leading 
political party, the African National Congress, designated 
at least 35 percent of its slate of candidates to women, helping South Africa become one of the world leaders in the percent of women who hold seats in parliament or legisl  a  ture (see Fig. 5.17).  
  The geographic study of voting behavior is espe-
cially interesting because it helps us assess whether peo-
ple’s voting tendencies are inﬂ  uenced by their geographic situation. Maps of voting patterns often produce surprises that can be explained by other maps, and Geographic Information Systems have raised this kind of analysis to strengthen devolutionary tendencies. The regions most likely to seek dev  o  lution are those far from the national 
capital. Many are separated by water, desert, or mountains from the ce  n  ter of power and adjoin neighbors that may 
support separatist objectives.  
  Note also that many islands are subject to devolutionary 
processes: Corsica (France), Sardinia (Italy), T aiwan (China), 
Singapore (Malaysia), Zanzibar (T anzania),   Jolo   (Philip-
pines), Puerto Rico (United States),   Mayotte   (Comoros), and 
East Timor (Indonesia) are notable examples. As this list indi-
cates, some of these islands became independent states, while others were divided during devolution. Insularity clearly has advantages for separatist movements.  
  Not surprisingly, the United States faces its most 
serious devolutionary pressures on the islands of   Hawai’i   
(Fig. 8.16). The year 1993 marked the hundred-year 
anniversary of the United States’ annexation of   Hawai’i  , 
   Figure 8.15  
  Barcelona, Spain.     Barcelona’s long-standing economic and 
political signiﬁ  cance is indelibly imprinted in the urban land-
scape. Once the heart of a far-ﬂ  ung Mediterranean empire, Barcelona went on to become a center of commerce and banking as the Iberian Peninsula industrialized. In the process, the city became a center of architectural innovation that is not just evi-dent in the major public buil  d  ings. The major streets are lined 
with impressive buildings—many with intricate stone façades.

270 Chapter 8   Political Geography 
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan lost representatives 
and the Sun Belt States of Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida along with the southwestern States of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah gained re  p  resentatives.  
  In the United States, once reapportionment is 
complete, individual States go through the process of 
redistricting, each following its own system. The crite-ria involved in redistricting are numerous, but the most important is equal representation, achieved by ensuring that districts have approximately the same populations. In addition, the Supreme Court prefers compact and con-tiguous districts that keep political units (such as counties) intact. F  i  nally, the courts have repeatedly called for repre-
sentational equality of racial and linguistic mino  r  ities.  
  Even after the civil rights movement of the 1950s 
and 1960s in the United States, minorities were refused 
voting rights in a mu  l  titude of districts and States around 
the country. County registrars would close their doors when African Americans came to register to vote, and intimidation kept many away from voting at the polls. Even in places where minorities were allowed to register and vote, the parties drawing the voting districts or choos-ing the electoral system would make it nearly impossible new levels. Political geographers study church afﬁ  liation, 
income level, ethnic background, educ  a  tion attainment, 
and numerous other social and economic factors to gain an understanding of why voters in a ce  r  tain region might have voted the way they did.  
  The domain in which electoral geographers can have 
the most concrete inﬂ  uence is in the drawing of electoral 
districts. In a d  e  mocracy with representatives elected by dis-
trict, spatial organization of the districts determines whose 
voice is heard in a given place—with impacts on who is elected. A voter’s most direct contact with government is at the local level. The United States Constitution establishes a system of territorial representation  . In the   Senate, each 
major territorial unit (State) gets two representatives, and 
in the House of Representatives, members are elected from territorially deﬁ  ned districts based on population.  
  The Co  n  stitution requires a census every ten years 
in order to enumerate the population and reapportion 
the representatives accordingly. Reapportionment is the process by which districts are moved accor  d  ing to popu-
lation shifts, so that each district encompasses approxi-mately the same number of people. For example, after the 2010 census, several States in the Rust Belt, including   Field Note  
  “As I drove along a main road through 
a Honolulu suburb I noticed that 
numerous houses had the   Hawai’i   State ﬂ  ag ﬂ  ying upside down. I 
knocked on the door of this house and asked the homeowner why he was trea  t  ing the State ﬂ  ag this way. 
He invited me in and we talked for more than an hour. ‘This is 1993,’ he said, ‘and we native   Hawai’ians   are letting the State government and the country know that we haven’t for-gotten the a  n  nexation by the United States of our kingdom. I don’t accept it, and we want our territory to plant our ﬂ  ag and keep the traditions alive. Why don’t you drive past the royal palace, and you’ll see that we mean it.’ He was right. The   Iolani   Palace, where the   Hawai’ians  ’ last monarch, Queen   Liliuokalani  , reigned until she was d  e  posed by a group of American busi-nessmen in 1893, was draped in black for all of Honolulu to see. Here was devoluti  o  n  ary stress on American soil.”

minority populations with meandering co  r  ridors and fol-
lowing Interstates to connect urban areas that have large 
minority populations (Fig. 8.18).  
  Strange-looking districts constructed to attain cer-
tain political ends are nothing new in American politics. 
In 1812, Governor Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts signed into law a district designed to give an adva  n  tage 
to his party—a district that looked so odd to artist Gilbert Stuart that he drew it with a head, wings, and claws. Stuart called it the “salamander district,” but a colleague immor-talized it by naming it a gerrymander (after the governor). Ever since, the term gerrymandering has been used to describe “redistricting for adva  n  tage.” Certainly, many of 
the districts now on the United States electoral map may be seen as gerr  y  manders, but for an important purpose: 
to provide representation to minorities who, without it, would not be represented as effe  c  tively in the House of 
Representatives. Despite this well-intended goal, others argue that the packing of minor  i  ties into majority-minority 
districts simply concentrates minority votes, creating a 
countrywide government that is less responsive to m  i  nor-
ity concerns.  
  The larger point is that the spatial organization of 
voting districts is a fundamentally geographical phenom-
enon, and it can have profound impacts on who is rep-resented and who is not—as well as peoples’ notions of fairness. And that is only the beginning. The voting pat-terns that emerge from particular elections can help rein-force a sense of regionalism and can shape a government’s for the election of a minority to occur. For example, if a government has to draw ten districts in a State that is 60 percent white, 30 percent African Amer  i  can, and 10 per-
cent Hispanic, it can easily dilute the minority voters by splitting them among multiple di  s  tricts, ensuring that the 
white population holds the majority in each district.  
  In 1982, the United States Congress amended the 
1965 Voting Rights Act by outlawing districts that have 
the effect of weakening minority voting power. In a series of decisions, the courts interpreted this amendment to mean States needed to redistrict in a way that would ensure minority representation. Using this criterion in the redis-tricting that followed the 1990 census, States increased the number of majority-minority districts in the House of Representatives from 27 to 52. Majority-minority dis-tricts are packed districts in which a majo  r  ity of the pop-
ulation is from the minority. In the hypothetical State 
described above, a redistricting follo  w  ing this criterion 
could have the goal of creating at least three majority-
minority districts and a fourth where minorities had a siz-able enough population to inﬂ  uence the outcome of the election.  
  Ideally, majority-minority districts would be com-
pact and contiguous and follow existing political units. 
Political geographers Jonathan   Leib   and Gerald Webster 
have researched the court cases that have resulted from trying to balance these often-conﬂ  icting criteria. T o pack minorities who do not live compactly and contiguously, States have drawn bizarrely shaped districts, connecting 6

known. As a result, coal seams and aquifers cross boundar-ies, and oil and gas r  e  serves are split b  e  tween states. Europe’s 
coal reserves, for example, extend from Belgium underneath 
the Net  h  erlands and on into the Ruhr area of Germany. 
Soon after mining began in the mid-nineteenth century, 
these three neighbors began to accuse each other of mining coal that did not lie directly below their own national ter-ritories. The underground surveys available at the time were too inaccurate to pinpoint the ownership of each coal seam.  
  During the 1950s–1960s, Germany and the Neth-
erlands argued over a gas reserve that lies in the subsoil 
across their boundary. The Germans claimed that the Dutch were withdrawing so much natural gas that the gas was ﬂ  owing from beneath German land to the Dutch side of the boundary. The Germans wanted compensation for the gas they felt they lost. A major issue between Iraq and Kuwait, which in part led to Iraq’s i  n  vasion of Kuwait in 
1990, was the oil in the   Rumaylah   reserve that lies under-
neath the desert and crosses the border b  e  tween the two 
states. The Iraqis asserted that the Kuwaitis were drilling 
too many wells and draining the r  e  serve too quickly; they 
also alleged that the Kuwaitis were drilling oblique bore-
holes to penetrate the vertical plane extending downward along the boundary. At the time the Iraq-Kuwait bound-ary was established, however, no one knew that this giant oil reserve lay in the subsoil or that it would contribute to an international crisis (Fig. 8.19).  
  Above the ground, too, the interpretation of bound-
aries as vertical planes has serious implications. A state’s 
“airspace” is deﬁ  ned by the atmosphere above its land 
area as marked by its boundaries, as well as by what lies beyond, at higher altitudes. But how high does the airspace response to issues in the future. Small wonder, then, that many individuals who have little general understanding of geography at least appreciate the impo  r  tance of its elec-
toral geography component.  
  Choose an example of a devolutionary movement and 
consider which geographic factors favor, or work against, greater autonomy (self-governance) for the region. Would granting the region autonomy stren  g  then or weaken the state in which the region is currently situated?  
  HOW ARE BOUNDARIES ESTABLISHED, AND 
WHY DO BOUNDARY DISPUTES OCCUR?  
  The territories of individual states are separated by 
international boundaries, often referred to as borders. 
Bou  n  daries may appear on maps as straight lines or may 
twist and turn to conform to the bends of rivers and the curves of hills and va  l  leys. But a boundary is more than 
a line, far more than a fence or wall on the ground. A boundary between states is actually a vertical plane that cuts through the rocks below (called the subsoil) and the airspace above, dividing one state from another (Fig. 8.18). Only where the vertical plane inte  r  sects the Earth’s 
surface (on land or at sea) does it form the line we see on the ground.

extend? Most states insist on controlling the airline traf-
ﬁ c over their territories, but states do not yet control the 
paths of satellite orbits.  
  Establishing Boundaries  
  States typically deﬁ  ne the boundary in a treaty-like legal 
document in which actual points in the landscape or 
points of latitude and longitude are described. Cartog-raphers delimit the boundary by drawing on a map. If 
either or both of the states so desire, they can demar-cate the boundary by using steel posts, concrete pillars, fences, walls, or some other visible means to mark the boundary on the ground. By no means are all boundaries on the world map demarcated. Demarcating a lengthy boundary is expensive, and it is hardly worth the effort in high mountains, vast deserts, frigid polar lands, or other places with few permanent settlements. Demar-cating boundaries is part of state efforts to administrate  
borders—to determine how the boundaries will be mai  n  tained and to determine which goods and people 
may cross them. How a boundary is administered can 
change dr  a  matically over time, however (Fig. 8.20).    Types of Boundaries  
  When boundaries are drawn using grid systems such as lat-
itude and longitude or township and range, political geog-raphers refer to these boundaries as geometric boundar-ies. In North America, the United States and Ca  n  ada used 
a single line of latitude west of the Great Lakes to deﬁ  ne 
their boundary. During the Berlin Conference, colonial 
powers used arbitrary reference points and drew straight lines to establish the boundaries in much of Africa.  
  At different times, political geographers and other 
academics have advocated “natural” boundaries over geo-
metric boundaries because they are visible on the landscape as physical geographic features. Physical-political (also called natural-political) boundaries are boundaries that follow an agreed-upon feature in the na  t  ural landscape, 
such as the center point of a river or the crest of a mountain 
range. The Rio Grande is an i  m  po  r  tant physical-political 
boundary between the United States and Mexico. Another 
physical-political boundary follows the crest lines of the Pyr-enees separating Spain and France. Lakes sometimes serve as boundaries as well; for example, four of the ﬁ  ve Great Lakes of North America are borders between the United States c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 273  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 273  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

boundary itself.  
  Boundary Disputes  
  The boundary we see as a line on a map is the product 
of a complex series of legal steps that begins with a wri  t-
  ten description of the boundary. Sometimes that legal 
description is old and imprecise. Sometimes it was dic-tated by a stronger power that is now less dominant, giving the weaker neighbor a reason to a  r  gue for change. 
At other times the geography of the borderland has actu-ally changed; the river that marked the boundary may have changed course, or a portion of it has been cut off. and Canada, and several of the Great Lakes of East Africa are borders between Congo and its eastern neighbors.  
  Physical features sometimes make convenient 
political boundaries, but topographic features are not 
sta  t  ic. Rivers change course, volcanoes erupt, and slowly, 
mountains erode. People perceive physical-political 
boundaries as stable, but many states have entered ter-ritorial conﬂ  icts over borders based on physical fea-tures (not  a  bly Chile and Argentina). Similarly, physical 
boundaries do not necessarily stop the ﬂ  ow of people or 
goods across boundaries, leading some states to rein-force physical boundaries with human-built o  b  stacles 
(the United States on the Rio Grande). The stability of 
boundaries has more to do with local historical and ge  o-  Field Note  
  “Seeing the border between Italy and Slovenia marked 
by a plaque on the ground reminded me of crossing this border with my family as a teenager. The year was 
1973, and after waiting in a long line we ﬁ  nally reached 
the place where we showed our passports to the authorities. They asked us many questions and they looked through the luggage in our trunk. Now that Slovenia is part of the European Union and has signed the   Schengen   Agre  e  ment eliminating border controls between countries, crossing that same border today is literally like a walk in the park.”

 How  Does   the Study of   Geopolitics  Help Us Understand the World? 275
    People used to think physical-political boundaries were 
always more stable than geometric boundaries. Through studies of many places, political geographers have con-ﬁ rmed that this idea is false. Construct your own argument 
explaining why physical-political boundaries can create just as much instability as geometric bound  a  ries.  
  HOW   DOES   THE STUDY OF   GEOPOLITICS   
HELP US UNDERSTAND THE WORLD?  
  Geopolitics is the interplay among geography, power, 
politics, and international relations on Earth’s surface. 
Political science and international relations tend to focus on governmental institutions, systems, and interactions. Geo-politics brings   locational   considerations, environmental con-
texts, territorial ideas and arrang  e  ments, and spatial assump-
tions to the fore. Geopolitics helps us understand the spatial 
power arrangements that shape international relations.  
  Classical Geopolitics  
  Classical   geopoliticians   of the late nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries generally ﬁ  t into one of two camps: the 
German school, which sought to explain why certain states 
are powerful and how to become powe  r  ful, and the British/
American school, which sought to offer strategic advice by 
identifying parts of Earth’s surface that were particularly important for the maintenance and projection of power. A few   geopoliticians   tried to bridge the gap, blending the two 
schools, but for the most part classical   geopoliticians   who 
are still writing today are in the British/American school, 
offering   geostrategic   perspe  c  tives on the world.  
  The German School  
  Why are certain states powerful, and how do states become 
powerful? The ﬁ  rst political geographer who stu  d  ied these 
issues was the German professor Friedrich   Ratzel   (1844–
1904). Inﬂ  uenced by the writings of Charles Darwin,   Rat-
zel   postulated that the state rese  m  bles a biological organ-
ism whose life cycle extends from birth through maturity 
and, ultimately, decline and death. T o prolong its existence, the state requires nouris  h  ment, just as an organism needs 
food. Such nourishment is provided by the acquisition of 
territories that provide ad  e  quate space for the members of 
the state’s dominant nation to thrive, which is what   Ratzel   
called lebensraum. If a state is conﬁ  ned within permanent Resources lying across a boundary can lead to conﬂ  ict. In 
short, states often argue about their boundaries. Bound-
ary disputes take four principal forms: deﬁ  n  i  tional,   loca-
tional  , operational, and   allocational  .  
  Deﬁ nitional boundary disputes focus on the legal lan-
guage of the boundary agreement. For example, a bound-
ary deﬁ  nition may stipulate that the median line of a river will mark the boundary. That would seem clear enough, but the water levels of rivers vary. If the valley is asymmet-rical, the median line will move back and forth between low-water and high-water stages of the stream. This may involve hundreds of meters of mov  e  ment—not very 
much, it would seem, but enough to cause serious argu-ment, especially if there are resources in the river. The solution is to reﬁ  ne the deﬁ  nition to suit both parties.  
  Locational   boundary disputes center on the delimita-
tion and possibly the demarcation of the boundary. The deﬁ nition is not in dispute, but its interpretation is. Some-
times the language of boundary treaties is vague enough to allow mapmakers to delimit the line in various ways. For example, when the colonial po  w  ers deﬁ  ned their 
empires in Africa and Asia, they speciﬁ  ed their interna-
tional boundaries rather carefully. But internal adminis-trative boundaries often were not strictly deﬁ  ned. When 
those internal boundaries b  e  came the boundaries between 
independent states, there was plenty of room for argu-ment. In a few instances,   locational   disputes arise b  e  cause 
no deﬁ  nition of the boundary exists at all. An important case involves Saudi Arabia and Y emen, whose potentially oil-rich boundary area is not covered by a treaty.  
  Operational boundary disputes involve neighbors who 
differ over the way their border should function. When 
two adjoining countries agree on how cross-border migration should be controlled, the border functions sat-isfactorily. However, if one state wants to limit migration while the other does not, a dispute may arise. Sim  i  larly, 
efforts to prevent smuggling across borders sometimes lead to operational disputes when one state’s e  f  forts are 
not matched (or are possibly even sabotaged) by its neigh-bor. And in areas where nomadic ways of life still prevail, the movement of people and their livestock across inter-national borders can lead to conﬂ  ict.  
  Allocational   boundary disputes of the kind described 
earlier, involving the Netherlands and Germany over nat-
ural gas and Iraq and Kuwait over oil, are becoming more common as the search for resources intensiﬁ  es. T oday 
many such disputes involve international boundaries at sea. Oil reserves under the seaﬂ  oor below coastal waters 
sometimes lie in areas where exact boundary delimit  a  tion 
may be difﬁ  cult or subject to debate. Another growing area of   allocational   dispute has to do with water supplies: 
the Tigris, Nile, Colorado, and other rivers are subject to such disputes. When a river crosses an international boundary, the rights of the upstream and downstream users of the river often come into conﬂ  ict.  c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 275  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 275  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
276 Chapter 8   Political Geography 
  In 1943,   Mackinder   wrote a ﬁ  nal paper expressing 
concern that the Soviet Union, under Stalin, would seek to 
exert control over the states of Eastern Europe. He offered strategies for keeping the Soviets in check, including avoid-ing the expansion of the Heartland into the Inner Cres-cent (Fig. 8.21) and creating an alliance around the North A  t  lantic to join the forces of land and sea powers against 
the Heartland. His ideas were not embraced by many at the 
time, but within ten years of publication, the United States began its containment po  l  icy to stop the expansion of the 
Soviet Union, and the United States, Canada, and Western 
Europe formed an alliance called the North Atlantic T reaty Organization (NATO). Further proof of the importance of   Mackinder’s   legacy can be seen in the fact that, even after 
the collapse of the Soviet Union, his theories enjoy wide-
spread currency in Ru  s  sian foreign po  l  icy circles.  
  Inﬂ  uence of   Geopoliticians   on Politics  
  Ratzel   and   Mackinder   are only two of many   geopoliti-
cians   who inﬂ  uenced international relations. Their writ-
ings, grounded in history, current events, and physical 
geography, sounded logical and inﬂ  uenced many politi-cians, and in some ways still do. NATO still exists and has not invited Russia to join the military alliance, but it has extended membership to 28 states since the end of the Cold War, including eastern European states. NATO has a working partnership with former republics of the Soviet Union, though the war between Russia and Georgia in 2008 produced a chilling effect on NATO’s eas  t  ward 
expansion.  
  Despite the staying power of geopolitical theories, 
geopolitics declined as a formal area of study after World 
War II. Because of the inﬂ  uence   Ratzel’s   theory had on 
Hitler and because anot  h  er   geopolitician  , Karl   Haush-
ofer  , also inﬂ  uenced Hitler, the term geopolitics acquired a and static boundaries and deprived of overseas domains,   Ratzel   argued, it can a  t  rophy. T erritory is thus seen as the 
state’s essential, life-giving force.  
  Ratzel’s   theory was based on his observations of 
states in the nineteenth century, including the United 
States. It was so speculative that it might have been for-gotten if some of   Ratzel’s   German followers in the 1930s 
had not translated his abstract writings into policy rec-
ommendations that ult  i  mately led to Nazi expansionism.  
  The British/ American School  
  Not long after the publication of   Ratzel’s   initial ideas, other 
geographers began looking at the overall organiz  a  tion of 
power in the world, studying the physical geographic map 
with a view toward determining the locations of most stra-tegic places on Earth. Prominent among them was the Oxford University geo  g  rapher Sir   Halford   J.   Mackinder   
(1861–1947). In 1904, he published an article titled “The 
Geographical Pivot of History” in the Royal Geographical Society’s Geographical Journal. That article became one of the 
most i  n  tensely debated geographic publications of all time.  
  Mackinder   was concerned with power relation-
ships at a time when Britain had acquired a global empire 
through its strong navy. T o many of his contemporaries, the oceans—the paths to colonies and trade—were the key to world domination, but   Mackinder   disagreed. He concluded 
that a land-based power, not a sea power, would ultimately 
rule the world. His famous article contained a lengthy appraisal of the largest and most populous landmass on Earth—Eurasia (Europe and Asia together). At the heart of Eurasia, he argued, lay an impre  g  nable, resource-rich “pivot 
area” extending from eastern Europe to eastern Siberia (Fig. 
8.21).   Mackinder   i  s  sued a warning: if this pivot area became 
inﬂ uential in Europe, a great empire could be formed.  
  Mackinder   later renamed his pivot area the heart-
land, and his warning became known as the heart-
land theory. In his book Democratic Ideals and Reality  
(1919),   Mackinder   (calling Eurasia “the World Island”) 
i  s  sued a stronger warning to the winners of World 
War I, stating:  
  Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland   
  Who rules the Heartland commands the World Island   
  Who rules the World Island commands the World  
  When   Mackinder   proposed his heartland theory, 
there was little to foretell the rise of a superpower in the 
heartland. Russia was in disarray, having recently lost a war against Japan (1905), and was facing revolution. Eastern Europe was fractured. Germany, not Russia, was gaining power. But when the Soviet Union emerged and Moscow controlled over much of Eastern Europe at the end of World War II, the heartland theory a  t  tracted renewed attention.   Figure 8.21

 How Does the Study of Geopolitics Help Us Understand the World? 277
  Statements such as these are rooted in a particular 
geopolitical perspective on the world—one that divides 
the globe into opposing camps. That much may seem obvious, as there are clear ideological fault lines between an organization such as al-Qaeda and a state such as the United States. But critical geopolitics seeks to move beyond such differences to explore the spatial ideas and understandings that   undergird   particular political per-
spectives and that shape policy approaches.  
  One of the most powerful geopolitical ideas since 
Samuel Huntington published   The Clash of Civilizations 
and the Remaking of World Order   in 1996 posits an “Islamic 
World.” September 11, 2001 ampliﬁ  ed the idea of a threat-
ening Islamic realm. The U.S. government, concerned about al-Qaeda’s inﬂ  uence in the Islamic World, justiﬁ  ed 
military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. The idea of a uniﬁ  ed “Islamic World” appears in the words of com-mentators on 24-hour news channels. The problem with such conceptions is that the “Islamic World” is tremen-dously diverse, cult  u  rally, and reli  g  iously, and some of 
the most intractable conﬂ  icts of recent times have been 
fought within the I  s  lamic World. Belief in or fear of a uni-
ﬁ ed “Islamic World” is not any more rational than belief 
in or fear of a uniﬁ  ed “Christian World.” Regardless, if geopolitical ideas are believed, they shape the policies that are pursued and how we perceive what happens on the ground. An important task for geographers, then, is to understand the ideological roots and implications of geo-political reasoning by intelle  c  tuals of statecraft.  
  Geopolitical World Order  
  Political geographers study geopolitical world orders, 
which are the temporary periods of stability in the way international politics is conducted. For example, during the Cold War, the geopolitical world order was bipolar—the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellites versus the United States and its close allies in Western E  u  rope. 
In the past, after a stable geopolitical world order broke 
down, the world went through a transition, eventually se  t-
  tling into a new geopolitical world order. Noted political 
geographers Peter J. T aylor and Colin Flint argue that at the end of World War II, ﬁ  ve possible orders could have emerged among the three major powers, the United King-dom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Each could have created its own bloc with its own allies; the three could have come together under the United Nations; or three possible alliances could have occurred—the United States and USSR against the UK, the United States and the UK against the USSR, or the UK and USSR against the United States. What emerged was the bipolar world order of the Cold War: the Uni  t  ed States and the UK against the USSR.  
  After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the world 
entered a transition period, again opening up a var  i  ety of 
different geopolitical possibilities. Some politicians spoke negative connotation. For some decades after World War 
II, the term was in such disrepute that few political geog-raphers, even those studying power rel  a  tionships, would 
identify themselves as students of geopolitics. Time, along with more balanced perspectives, has reinstated geopoli-tics as a signiﬁ  cant ﬁ  eld of study, encompassing efforts to 
understand the spatial and territorial dimensions of power relationships past, present, and f  u  ture.  
  Critical Geopolitics  
  Rather than focusing their attention on predicting and 
prescribing, many current students of geopolitics focus on revealing and explaining the underlying spatial assumptions and territorial perspectives of international actors. Political geographers   Gearoid     O’T uathail   and John Agnew refer to 
those actors in the most powerful states, the core states, as 
“intellectuals of statecraft.” The basic concept behind criti-
cal geopolitics is that intellectuals of statecraft construct ideas about geographical circumstances and places, these ideas i  n  ﬂ uence and reinforce their political behaviors and 
policy choices, and then affect what happens and how most 
people interpret what ha  p  pens.  
  O’T uathail   has focused particular attention on Ameri-
can geopolitical reasoning—examining speeches and state-
ments by U.S. intellectuals of statecraft. He has drawn atten-tion to how several American leaders often   spatialize   politics 
into a world of “us” and “them.” Political leaders can shape 
how their constituents see places and organize international space in their minds. By drawing on American cultural logic and certain represent  a  tions of America,   O’T uathail   
argues that presidents have repeatedly deﬁ  ned an “us” that 
is pro-democracy, indepe  n  d  ent, self-sufﬁ  cient, and free and a 
“them” that is in some way against all of these things.  
  During the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan 
coined the term Evil Empire for the Soviet Union and 
represented the United States as “the shining city on a hill.” During ensuing presidencies, terrorism replaced the Soviet Union as the “they.” Sounding remarkably similar, Democratic President William J. Clinton and Repu  b  li-
can President George W. Bush justiﬁ  ed military actions 
against terrorists. In 1998, President Clinton justiﬁ  ed 
American military action in Sudan and Afghanistan as a response to terrorist plans by Osama bin Laden by no  t  ing 
that the terrorists “come from diverse places but share a hatred for democracy, a fanatical gloriﬁ  cation of violence, and a horrible distortion of their religion, to justify the murder of innocents. They have made the Uni  t  ed States 
their adversary precisely because of what we stand for and what we stand against.” Immediately after September 11, President George W. Bush made a similar claim, argu-ing that “They [the terrorists] stand against us because we stand in their way.” In 2002, President Bush again explained, “I’ve said in the past that nations are either with us or against us in the war on te  r  ror.”  c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 277  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 277  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

we will discuss in Chapter 9, global cities may gain increas-
ing power over issues typ  i  cally addressed by states.  
  Read a major newspaper (in print or online) and look for a 
recent statement by a world political leader regarding interna-tional politics. Using the concept of critical geopolitics, deter-mine what geopolitical view of the world the leader has—how does he or she view and divide up the world spatially?  
  WHAT ARE SUPRANATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS, AND WHAT ARE THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE?  
  Ours is a world of contradictions. Over the past 
couple of decades some French Canadians,   Quebeçois  , 
have demanded indepen  d  ence from Canada even as 
Canada joined the United States and Mexico in NAFTA 
(the North American Free T rade Agreement). Flemings in northern Belgium called for autonomy or even inde-pen  d  ence despite the fact that Brussels, the capital of Bel-
gium (and Flanders), serves as the de facto capital of the European Union. At every turn we are reminded of the interconnectedness of nations, states, and regions; yet, separatism and calls for a  u  tonomy are rampant. In the 
early decades of the twenty-ﬁ  rst century, we appear to be caught between the forces of division and uniﬁ      cation.  
  Despite conﬂ  icts arising from these contradictory 
forces, today hardly a country exists that is not involved 
in some supran  a  tional organization. A supranational 
organization is an entity composed of three or more states that forge an association and form an administra-tive structure for mutual beneﬁ  t and in pursuit of shared 
goals. The twentieth century witnessed the establishment of numerous supranational associations in p  o  litical, eco-
nomic, cultural, and military spheres.  
  T oday, states have formed over 60 major suprana-
tional organizations (such as NATO and NAFTA), many 
of which have subsidiaries that bring the total to more than 100 (Figure 8.22). The more states participate in such mu  l  tilateral associations, the less likely they are to 
act alone in pursuit of a self-interest that might put them at odds with neighbors. And in most cases participation in a supranational entity is advantageous to the partners, and being left out can have serious negative implic  a  tions.  
  From League of Nations to United Nations  
  The modern beginnings of the supranational move-
ment can be traced to conferences following World optimistically about a new geopolitical world order where a standoff of nuclear terror between two superpowers would no longer determine the destinies of states. Sup-posedly, this new geopolitical order would be shaped by the forces that connect nations and states; by s  u  pranational 
entities like the European Union (discussed in the next 
section of this cha  p  ter); and, should any state violate inter-
national rules of conduct, by multilateral military action. 
The risks of nuclear war would r  e  cede, and negoti  a  tion 
would replace confrontation. When a United Nations 
coalition of states led by the United States in 1991 drove Iraq out of Kuwait, the framework of a New World Order seemed to be taking shape. The Soviet Union, which a few years before was the United States’ principal geopolitical antagonist, endorsed the operation. Arab as well as non-Arab forces helped repel the i  n  vaders.  
  Soon, however, doubts and uncertainties began 
to cloud hopes for a mutually cooperative geopolitical 
world order. Although states were more closely linked to each other than ever before, national self-interest still acted as a powerful force. Nations wanted to become states, and many did, as the number of United Nations members increased from 159 in 1990 to 184 by 1993 and 192 as of 2006. At the same time, a variety of organ  i  za-
tions not tied to speciﬁ  c territories posed a new challenge 
to the territorially deﬁ  ned state. The number and power 
of economic and social networks that extend across state 
borders increased. The new world order i  n  cludes   non-
state   organizations with political agendas that are not 
channeled through states and are often spatially diffuse.  
  Some hoped to see a geopolitical world order based 
on unilateralism, with the United States in a position 
of hard-power dominance and with allies of the United 
States following rather than joining the political decision-making process. The U.S. military budget is as large as all the military budgets of all other states in the world com-bined. The United States’ controversial invasion of Iraq signiﬁ  cantly undermined its inﬂ  uence in many parts of the 
globe. Southeast Asian states that had long been oriented toward the United States began to turn away. A signiﬁ  -
cant rift developed across the Atlantic between the United States and some European cou  n  tries, and anti-American-
ism surged around the world. The processes of globaliza-tion, the diffusion of nu  c  lear weapons, the emergence of 
China and India as increasingly signiﬁ  cant powers, and the 
growth of networked groups and organizations, including terrorist groups, also challenged American unilateralism.  
  When geopolitical strategists and intellectuals of 
statecraft predict future geopolitical orders, they often 
assume that individual states will continue to be the domi-nant actors in the international arena. Y et as we discuss later in this chapter, many of the same forces that worked against American unilateralism have undermined some of the tra-ditional powers of the state. The rise of regional blocs could lead to a new   multip  o  lar   order, with key clusters of states 
functioning as major geopolitical nodes. Alternatively, as c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 278  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 278  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the C  o  venant 
on Civil and Political Rights, and the Covenant on Eco-
nomic and Social Rights, set a precedent and laid the groundwork for countless human rights groups working in the world today.  
  By participating in the United Nations, states commit 
to internationally approved standards of behavior. Many 
states still violate the standards embodied in the United Nations Charter, but such violations can lead to collective action, such as economic sanctions or Security Council-supported military action. The United N  a  tions’ actions 
in South Africa (Apartheid) and Iraq (the Gulf War) are 
examples of UN success, but the organ  i  zation has its crit-
ics as well. Some argue that the composition of its Security 
Council reﬂ  ects the world of 1950 more than the world of today. Others express concern about power being vested in an organization that is not directly respo  n  sible to voters and 
that provides little room for non-state interests. Still oth-
ers criticize the fact that states like Iran, Cuba, and North Korea sit on the organization’s Human Rights Council. For all its wea  k  nesses, however, the United Nations represents 
the only truly international forum for addressing many sig-
niﬁ cant pro  b  lems co  n  fronting the globe.  
  Regional Supranational Organizations  
  The League of Nations and the United Nations are global 
manifestations of a phenomenon that is expressed even more strongly at the regional level. States organize supra-national organizations at the regional scale to p  o  sition 
themselves more strongly economically, politically, and even militarily.  
  Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg under-
took the ﬁ  rst major modern experiment in regional eco-
nomic cooperation. The three countries have much in common culturally and economically. Dutch farm prod-ucts are sold on Belgian markets, and Belgian industrial goods go to the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Dur-ing World War II, representatives of the three countries decided to create common tariffs and eliminate i  m  port 
licenses and quotas. In 1944, even before the end of the war, the governments of the three states met in London to sign an agreement of cooperation, creating the Benelux 
(Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) region.  
  Following World War II, U.S. Secretary of State 
George Marshall proposed that the United States ﬁ  nance 
a European recovery program. A committee representing 
16 Western European states plus (then) West Germany presented the United States Congress with a joint pro-gram for economic rehabilitation, and Congress approved it. From 1948 to 1952, the United States gave Europe about $12 billion under the Marshall Plan, the largest foreign aid program in history. This investment revived European national economies and spurred a movement toward cooperation among E  u  ropean states.  War I. Woodrow Wilson, president of the United States,  proposed an international organization that would include all the states of the world (fewer than 75 states existed at that point), leading to the creation of the League of N  a  tions in 1919. Even though it was the 
idea of an American president, the United States was 
among the countries that did not join this organiza-tion because isolationists in the U.S. Senate opposed joining. In all, 63 states participated in the League, although the total membership at any single time never reached that number. Costa Rica and Brazil left the League even before 1930; Germany departed in 1933, shortly before the S  o  viet Union joined in 1934. The 
League later expelled the Soviet Union in 1939 for 
invading Finland. The League was born of a world-wide desire to prevent future aggression, but the fail-ure of the United States to join dealt the organization a severe blow. In the mid-1930s, the League had a major opportunity when Ethiopia’s   Haile     Selassie   made a dra-
matic appeal for help in the face of an invasion by Italy, 
a member state until 1937. The League failed to take action, and in the chaos of the beginning of World War II the organization collapsed.  
  Even though the League of Nations ceased func-
tioning, it spawned other supranational organizations. 
Between World War I and World War II, states cre-ated the Permanent Court of International Justice to adjudicate legal issues between states, such as bound-ary disputes and ﬁ  shing rights. The League of Nations also init  i  ated international negotiations on maritime 
boundaries and related aspects of the law of the sea. The 
confe  r  ences organized by the League laid the ground-
work for the ﬁ  nal resolution of the size of territorial seas 
de  c  ades later.  
  After World War II, states formed a new organi-
zation to foster international security and cooperation: 
the United Nations (UN). Membership in the UN has grown signiﬁ  cantly since its inception in 1947 (Fig. 8.23). A handful of states still do not belong to the United Nations, but with the most recent additions in 2006, it now has 192 member states. The United Nations orga-nization includes numerous less visible but nonetheless signiﬁ      cant subsidiaries, including the FAO (Food and 
Agriculture Organization), UNESCO (United Nations 
Educ  a  tional, Scientiﬁ  c and Cultural Organization), and 
WHO (World Health Organization). Not all United 
N  a  tions members participate in every United Nations 
subsidiary, but many people around the world have ben-
eﬁ ted from their work.  
  We can ﬁ  nd evidence of the United Nations’ work 
in the “world” section of any major newspaper. UN 
peacekeeping troops have helped maintain stability in some of the most contentious regions of the world. The United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees is called upon to aid refugees in crises in far-ﬂ  ung places.

eliminations of certain tariffs and a freer ﬂ  ow of labor, capi-
tal, and commodities beyond steel. This led, in 1958, to the cre  a  tion of the European Economic Community (EEC).  
  The success of the EEC induced other countries 
to apply for membership. Denmark, Ireland, and the 
United Kingdom joined in 1973, Greece in 1981, and Spain and Portugal in 1986. The organization became known as the European Community (EC) because it began to address issues beyond economics. By the late 1980s, the EC had 12 members: the three giants (Germany, France, and the United Kingdom); the four southern countries (Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece); and ﬁ  ve smaller states (the Netherlands, Belgium, Lux-embourg, Denmark, and Ireland). These 12 members   The European Union  
  From the European states’ involvement in the Marshall 
Plan came the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), and this body in turn gave rise to other cooperative organizations. Soon after Europe e  s  tab-
lished the OEEC, France proposed the creation of a Euro-
pean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) with the goal of lifting the restrictions and obstacles that impeded the ﬂ  ow 
of coal, iron ore, and steel among the mai  n  land’s six primary 
producers: France, West Germany, Italy, and the three 
Benelux countries. The six states entered the ECSC, and gradually, through negotiations and agreement, enlarged their sphere of cooperation to i  n  clude reductions and even

because of the diversity of the states involved. For example, 
agricultural practices and pol  i  cies have always varied widely. 
Y et some general policy must govern agriculture through-
out the European U  n  ion. Individual states have found these 
adjustments difﬁ  cult at times, and the EU has had to devise 
policies to accommodate regional contrasts and delays in implementation. In addition, integration requires signiﬁ  cant 
expenditures. Under the rules of the EU, the richer coun-tries must subsidize (provide ﬁ  nancial support to) the poorer ones; therefore, the entry of eastern European states adds to the ﬁ  nancial burden on the wealthier western and northern European members. Recent ﬁ  nancial crises in Greece and Ireland have put the union under u  n  precedented pressure, 
as wealthier countries such as Germany question why they 
should foot the bill for cou  n  tries that have not (at least in 
German eyes) managed their ﬁ  nances responsibly.  initiated a program of cooperation and uniﬁ  cation that 
led to the formal establishment of a European Union 
(EU) in 1992. In the mid-1990s, Austria, Sweden, and Finland joined the EU, bringing the total number of members to 15 (Fig. 8.24).  
  In the late 1990s, the EU began preparing for the 
establishment of a single currency—the euro (Fig. 8.25). 
First, all electronic ﬁ  nancial transactions were denomi-
nated in euros, and on January 1, 2002, the EU introduced euro coins and notes. Not all EU me  m  ber states are cur-
rently a part of the euro-zone, but the euro has emerged as a signiﬁ  cant global currency.  
  The integration of ten eastern European and Mediter-
ranean island states into the European Union in 2004, and 
two more in 2007, is a signiﬁ  cant development. Integration is a difﬁ  cult process and often requires painful adjustments

thereby widening the organization’s reach. The govern-
ment of T urkey has long sought to join, but many Greeks are hesitant to support T urkish membership because of the long-standing dispute between Greece and T urkey over Cyprus and a number of islands off the T urkish coast. Other EU me  m  bers have expressed concern over T urkey’s 
human rights record, speciﬁ  cally its treatment of Kurds 
and its reluctance to recognize the extent of the mass kill-
ing of Armenians in World War I. Behind these claims lies an often-unspoken sense among many Europeans that T urkey is not “European” enough to warrant membership, perhaps rooted in a historical and cultural tendency to d  e  ﬁ ne Muslims as the “Ot  h  er.” The d  e  bate within the EU   The Union is a patchwork of states with many different 
ethnic traditions and histories of conﬂ  ict and competition, 
and some in Europe express concern over losing traditional state powers. Ec  o  nomic success and growing well-being 
tend to submerge hesitancy and differences, but in the face 
of difﬁ  cult economic or social times, divisive forces can, and have, reasserted themselves. Moreover, as the EU gets big-ger, it becomes increasingly difﬁ  cult for individual states (even powerful ones) to shape the dire  c  tion of the union. 
And some citizens in smaller states such as Denmark and 
Sweden worry about getting lost in the mix.  
  Another difﬁ  cult problem involves T urkey. Some 
western Europeans would like to see T urkey join the EU,

 What Are Supranational Organizations, and What Are Their Implications for the State? 283
Asia-Paciﬁ  c Economic Council (APEC), and the Com-
monwealth of Ind  e  pendent States (CIS), have drawn up 
treaties to reduce tariffs and import restrictions in order 
to ease the ﬂ  ow of commerce in their regions. Not all of these alliances are successful, but economic   suprana-
tionalism   is a sign of the times, a grand experiment still 
in progress.  
  Y et, when we turn back to the European Union, we 
see a supranational organization that is unlike any other. It 
is not a state, nor is it simply an o  r  ganization of states. The 
European Union is remarkable in that it has taken on a life of its own—with a multifaceted government structure, three capital cities, and billions of euros ﬂ  owing through about T urkey has alienated many T urkish people, causing them to que  s  tion their support for EU membership.  
  How Does   Supranationalism   Affect the State?  
  Supranationalism   is a worldwide phenomenon. Other 
economic associations, such as the North American 
Free T rade Agreement (NAFTA), the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), the Central American Com-mon Ma  r  ket, the Andean Group, the Southern Cone

state governments. With the European Union, we may be 
witnessing a transformation to a new political geographic construct that signiﬁ  es a change in the political organiza-tion of space similar to the transformation to the modern state system that occurred in Europe in the seventeenth ce  n  tury.  
  Other movements in addition to the European 
Union are posing major challenges to the state as we 
know it and raising questions as to whether the division of the world into territorial states is logical, effective, or its coffers. The European Union is extending into foreign relations, domestic policies, and mil  i  tary policies, with 
sovereignty over certain issues moving from the states to the European Union. One of the authors of this book has studied the degree to which Europeans in some regions are fee  l  ing a greater a  t  tachment to their region and to 
the European Union than to their own state (Fig. 8.26). Identifying with the European U  n  ion (over the state) is 
strong in the Benelux countries (the ﬁ  rst members) and in regions where people have been disempowered by their    Mediterranean  Sea    North

 What Are Supranational Organizations, and What Are Their Implications for the State? 285
or group to pu  r  chase the power with which to threaten 
the world.  
  Although states provide the territorial foundation 
from which producers and consumers still operate and 
they continue to exert considerable regulatory powers, economic globalization makes it ever more difﬁ  cult for 
states to control economic relations, which is an example of   deterritorialization  . States are respon  d  ing to this situation 
in a variety of ways, with some giving up traditional regula-
tory powers and others seeking to insulate themselves from the intern  a  tional economy. Still others are working to build 
supranational economic blocs that they hope will help them 
cope with an increasingly   globalized   world. The impacts of 
many of these develo  p  ments are as yet uncertain, but it is 
increasingly clear that states now compete with a variety of 
other forces in the intern  a  tional arena.  
  The state’s traditional position is being further eroded 
by the globalization of social and cultural relations. Net-
works of interaction are being constructed in ways that do not correspond to the map of states. In 2011, when unrest broke out in Egypt, for example, activists used   Facebook   
to garner support. Scholars and researchers in different 
countries work together in teams. Increased mobility has brought individuals from far-ﬂ  ung places into much closer 
contact than before. Paralleling all this change is the spread of popular culture in ways that make national borders vir-tually meaningless. Katy Perry is listened to from Iceland to Australia; fas  h  ions developed in northern Italy are hot 
items among Japanese tourists visiting South Korea; Thai 
restaurants are found in towns and cities across the United States; Russians hurry home to watch the next episode of soap o  p  eras made in Mexico; and movies produced in Hol-
lywood are seen on screens from Mumbai to Santiago.  
  The rise of fundamentalist religious movements 
with geopolitical goals represents another global phe-
nomenon with potentially signiﬁ  cant implications for a future world order. In Chapter 6, we noted that fund  a-
  mental religious movements sometimes become extrem-
ist by inciting violent acts in the name of their faith. V  i  olence by extremists challenges the state—whether 
undertaken by individuals at the local scale or by widely 
diffused groups spread across major world realms. The state’s mission to combat religious violence can produce support for the state government in the short term, but the state’s inability to defeat extremist attacks may we  a  ken the state in the long term. T errorist attacks have 
been threatened or carried out by religious extremists 
from a v  a  riety of different faiths, but the wave of inter-
national terrorism that began in the 1980s in the name 
of Islam has dominated the international scene over the past two decades. The attacks on the World T rade Cen-ter and the Pentagon and the downing of Flight 93 in Pennsylvania, and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan that followed, moved terrorism to the ge  o  political cen-
ter stage. More recent terrorist attacks in Madrid, Mos-
cow, and Mumbai have helped to keep it there.  even necessary. Among these challenges are the demand of nations within states for independence, economic glo-balization, increasing connectedness among people and cultures, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  
  Nuclear weapons give even small states the ability 
to inﬂ  ict massive damage on larger and distant adversar-
ies. Combined with missile technology, this may be the most serious danger the world faces, which is why the United Nations insisted on dismantling Iraq’s nuclear capacity after the 1991 Gulf War and why concerns over Iran’s nuclear program are so great. Some states pub-licize their nuclear weapons programs, whereas other nuclear states have never formally acknowledged that they possess nuclear weapons. Reports of nuclear pro-liferation have led to military actions in the last 30 years. In 1981, when reports of Iraq’s nuclear program reached Israel, the Israelis attacked Iraq. As nuclear weapons have become smaller and “tact  i  cal” nuclear arms have 
been d  e  veloped, the threat of nuclear weapons sales is 
of growing concern. It is now possible for a hostile state

the spatial di  s  tribution of power is more complex than the 
traditional map of states would suggest. Describing that 
spatial distribution will be a challenge for geographers for gener  a  tions to come.  
  In 2004, the European Union welcomed ten additional states, and in 2007, it welcomed two more. Examine the European Union website (listed below in the Learn More Online section). Read about the European Union’s expansion and what is going on in the European Union right now. Assess how complicated it is for the European Union to bring together these many divergent members into one supranational organization.    All of the foregoing processes are creating eco-
nomic, social, and cultural geographies that look less and 
less like the map of states (Fig. 8.3). The term   deterrito-
rialization   is sometimes used to describe these processes 
because globalization, networked communities, and the 
like undermine the state’s traditional territor  i  al author-
ity. But the state is far from disappearing, and national-ism continues to be a fundamental social force in the world today. Indeed, in many instances. the state is mov-ing to solidify control over its territory through a process known as   reterritorialization  . For example, in response 
to concerns over illegal immigration, some state borders 
are becoming more heavily fortiﬁ  ed, and moving across 
those borders is becoming more di  f  ﬁ cult. However one 
views the balance between   deterrit  o  rialization   and   reter-
ritorialization  , the state of the geopolitical order is clearly 
in ﬂ ux. We appear to be headed toward a world in which    Figure 8.26

  Summary  
  We tend to take the state for granted, but the modern state idea is less than 400 years 
old. The idea and ideal of the nation-state have diffused around the globe in the wake of colonialism and the emergence of the modern i  n  ternational legal order.  
  The state may seem natural and permanent, but it is not. New states are being rec-
ognized, and existing states are vulnerable to destructive forces. How long can this way 
of politically organizing space last?  c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 286  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501c08PoliticalGeography.indd Page 286  9/19/11  11:05 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  The semicircular shaped Grand Circus Park in Detroit, Michigan is divided by 
several streets, making it look like the hub and spokes of a bicycle wheel from above. The grouping of buildings along Grand Circus Park (Fig 9.1) reﬂ  ects the 
rise, fall, and revitalization of the   central business district (CBD)    in Detroit. 
  The ce  n  tral business di  s  trict is a concentration of business and commerce in the city’s downtown.  
  The Kales building is the tall building on the far left of the photograph. It 
was once the headquarters of the Kresge Corporation, which became K-Mart.

 Ghosts of Detroit? 289
Aba  n  doned in 1986 and left to a state of disrepair, the Kales building was renovated 
at a cost of $15 million in 2005. The Kales building now houses over 100 lu  x  ury apar  t  ments. In 2011, the Kales Building stood at 100 percent occupied.  
  The short building to the right of the Kales building, tucked behind the trees, 
was the Adams Theater. Closed in 1988, the Adams Theater fell into a state of dis-repair to the point that building could no longer be saved. The Downtown Detroit Development Authority required i  n  vestors to save the façade of the building and allowed them to demolish the rest of it. A new building is slated to go up behind the façade.  
  To the right of that building is the Grand Park Centre, which underwent a $7 
million renovation in 2000. Grand Park Centre is an ofﬁ  ce building, but downtown Detroit has an abundance of o  f  ﬁ  ce space. As a result, in 2011, the building was only 
26.1 percent leased, and 73.9 percent stood vacant.  
  The building on the far right houses the Fyfe Apartments, named for Richard 
H. Fyfe who built a fo  r  tune in the shoe trade in Detroit. The building was con-verted to apartments in 1960 and has functioned as apartments since that time. In 2011, the Fyfe Apar  t  ments were 97 percent occupied.  
  Buildings in the Grand Circus Park neighborhood have garnered millions 
in ren  o  vation because of the neighborhood’s close proximity to the revital-ized entertainment district in dow  n  town Detroit. Right around the corner from Grand Circus Park are C  o  merica Park, Fox Theater, and Ford Field. The property manager of the Kales Building said the central business district of Detroit is bouncing back because of the entertainment di  s  trict. He said it’s now tough to ﬁ nd an apartment in the central business district of Detroit, speculating that 
pe  o  ple are drawn to living downtown because of high gas prices and low crime rates in the central business district. Another real estate developer contended the main reason rental units are full in D  e  troit is because so many pe  o  ple have lost their houses in the mortgage crisis that they are renting now. Across Grand Circus Park, the Bro  d  erick Towers are slated to open after a massive renovation, which will bring a new shopping complex and more apartments to this revital-ized neighbo  r  hood.  
  Other neighborhoods of the city are not bouncing back as well as apartment 
units in Grand Circus Park have. Abandoned high-rise buildings called the ghosts of Detroit (Fig. 9.2) are joined by empty single-family homes to account for 10,000 abandoned buildings in the city. The population of Detroit rose and fell with the automobile industry. The population peaked at 1.8 million in 1950, but the 2010 census shows the city’s popul  a  tion falling to 713,777.  
  Empty high-rise ofﬁ  ce buildings, apartments, government buildings, hotels, 
and train depots stand throughout the city like dead trees in a forest. The Lafayette Building (Fig. 9.2) stood across the street from the Book Cadillac Hotel for nearly a century. Once home to the ofﬁ  ces of the Michigan Supreme Court, the Lafa  y  ette closed due to ﬁ  nancial woes and lack of tenants in 1997. In the ﬁ  rst decade of the 2000s, the Book C  a  dillac Hotel received a $200 million renovation, but the Lafayette fell into a greater state of disrepair. I took this photograph in October 2008, the same month that a po  r  tion of the Lafayette fell off the building to the street below. In 2009, the Detroit City Council voted to demolish the Lafayette, and in 2010, the city tore down the building.  
  The Lafayette is not the only building on the chopping block in Detroit. The 
mayor of Detroit a  n  nounced a plan in 2010 to demolish 10,000 abandoned build-ings and houses in D  e  troit by 2014.  c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 289  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 289  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  Geographers are leading the study of cities today through the application 
of scale, globalization, and p  o  litical economy to the city and urbanized spaces. 
Urban geographer Edward Soja urges scholars to think of ci  t  ies, including Detroit, as integral to the development of societies and to change, not as stages upon which humans act. Soja deﬁ  nes   synekism   as the “conditions that derive from 
dwelling together in a partic  u  lar home place or space” (2003, 273). As a result of people dwelling together in cities, a set of conditions occur that make change possible. To Soja, cities do not simply reﬂ  ect changing economies and politics. Rather, cities create the conditions necessary for economies and politics to change.  
   Using the concept of synekism, Grand Circus Park and the Lafayette 
Building in Detroit are not merely reﬂ  ections of the changing political economy 
of Detroit. This block of buildings and the larger city of Detroit created the con-ditions necessary for industrial production to expand to the global scale and are creating the conditions necessary for portions of Detroit to r  e  bound.  
   In our study of urban geography in this chapter, we study the city spatially, 
looking at the forms of cities around the world, the role of people in building and shaping c  i  ties, and changes in cities over space and time.  c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 290  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 290  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 When and Why Did People Start Living in Cities? 291
  Key Questions For Chapter 9  
   1.   When and why did people start living in cities?  
   2.   Where are cities located and why?  
   3.   How are cities organized, and how do they function?  
   4.   How do people shape cities?  
   5.   What role do cities play in globalization?  
  WHEN AND WHY DID PEOPLE START 
LIVING IN CITIES?  
  Worldwide, more people live in urban areas than 
in rural areas today. China, a traditionally rural coun-
try, reached the point where more than 50 percent of its population lived in urban areas in 2010. According to Ch  i  na’s census, the country was 36.1 percent urban 
in 2000. The rapid urbanization of China is due to the migration of millions of people from rural to urban areas since ec  o  nomic liberalization began in 1979.  
  Urban   refers to the built up space of the cen-
tral city and suburbs. Urban areas include   the city and 
 surrounding environs connected to the city. An urban 
place is distinctively nonrural and nona  g  ricultural.  
  For the vast majority of human history, the world 
was largely rural. From the beginnings of human society 
to about 3000 BC, less than 1 percent of people lived in urban areas. With cities established in Mesopot  a  mia, the 
Nile River, Mesoamerica, and Asia, the proportion of the world’s population living in cities rose “only slightly.”  
  After the start of the Industrial Revolution in the 
mid-1700s in Great Britain, urbanization exploded “when 
some states such as Great Britain and the Netherlands became predominantly urban for the ﬁ  rst time” (Soja 
2010, 376).   In western Europe, the United States, Canada, 
and Japan, four out of ﬁ  ve people live in ci  t  ies or towns 
(Fig. 9.3). In China, the ﬁ  gure is ﬁ  ve out of ten, and in 
India, the country’s 2011 census reported nearly 7 out of ten living in rural areas.  
  The agglomeration of people, services, and goods 
in cities affords people the luxury of time to innovate. 
Ci  t  ies are centers of political power and industrial 
might, higher education and technological innovation, 
artistic achievement, and medical advances. They are the great markets, centers of specialization and interac-tion, sources of news and information, suppliers of ser-vices, and providers of sports and entertainment. Ci  t  ies 
are the anchors and instigators of modern culture; urban 
systems and their spokes form the structural skeleton of soc  i  ety. A city is an agglomeration of people and build-
ings clustered together to serve as a center of politics, 
culture, and ec  o  nomics.    In the modern world, urbanization can happen quite 
quickly. A rural area or a small town can be transformed 
into a major metropolitian area. During the latter part of the twentieth century, the Chinese government a  n  nounced 
a major economic development project in Guangdong, a province in southern China. The Chinese government established a special economic zone (SEZ) in Guangdong Province, and business and industry mushroomed. The small ﬁ  shing vi  l  lage of Shenzhen in Guangdong Province 
is adjacent to Hong Kong. Hundreds of industries moved from Hong Kong to Shenzhen to take advantage of lower labor costs. The small ﬁ  shing village of Shenzhen experi-enced extraordinary growth as its population, rus  h  ing to 
the area to ﬁ  nd work, swelled from 20,000 to 8 million 
in just three decades. Shenzhen was quickly transformed: sk  y  scrapers now tower where thatch houses, rice paddies, 
and duck ponds once stood (Fig. 9.4).  
  The urbanization that can happen so quickly today 
took thousands of years to develop originally; indeed, the 
rise of the city is a very recent phenomenon in human his-tory. Human communities have existed for over 100,000 years, but more than 90,000 years passed before people began to cluster in towns. Archae  o  logical evidence indi-
cates that people established the ﬁ  rst cities about 8000 
years ago. However, only in the last 200 years did cities begin to r  e  semble their modern size and structure.  
  The Hearths of Urbanization  
  The switch from hunting and gathering to agriculture 
occurred prior to urbanization. Archaeologists ﬁ  nd evi-
dence of early agriculture between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago. Archaeologists agree that the ﬁ  rst cities came 
“several millennia” after the origins of agriculture (Smith 2009). Geographers Edward Soja and Peter T aylor argue that the ﬁ  rst cities came before agriculture, and they cite the 12,000-year-old settlement of Catal Huyuk as evi-dence (Fig. 9.5). Archaeologists see Catal Huyuk as an agricultural village, not a city.  
  Agricultural villages were relatively small in size 
and in population. Everyone living in an agricultural 
 vi  l  lage was involved in agriculture, and the people lived 
at near-subsistence levels, producing just enough to get by. c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 291  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 291  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
292 Chapter 9  Urban Geography
The dwellings in ancient agricultural villages were about 
the same size and contained about the same nu  m  ber of 
possessions, reﬂ  ecting the egalitarian nature (sharing of 
goods in common among the people) of the s  o  cieties liv-
ing in these early villages. The populations were perma-nent, reﬂ  ected in the dwelling units where people moved 
rocks in, built permanent structures, and laid out ﬂ  oors 
made of plaster. Egalitarian s  o  cieties pe  r  sisted long after 
agriculture began.  
  Scholars are fairly certain that these descriptors accu-
rately depict the agricultural villages in the ﬁ  rst agr  i  cul-
tural hearth, the area of Southwest Asia called the Fertile 
Crescent. Additional archaeological evidence portrays agricultural villages in the later hearths of agricultural 60°

also ﬁ  tting these descriptors. When people establish cit-ies, however, these descri  p  tors become inaccurate. In cit-
ies, people generate personal material wealth, trade over long distances, live in stratiﬁ  ed classes that are usually 
reﬂ ected in the housing, and engage in a diversity of eco-
nomic activ  i  ties—not just agricu  l  ture.  
  T wo components enabled cities to stabilize and 
grow: agricultural surplus and social stratiﬁ  cation.  
A  r  chaeologists, anthropologists, and geographers have 
studied the remains and records of the ﬁ  rst cities, creating 
numerous theories as to how cities came about. Most agree that some series of events led to the formation of an agricul-tural surplus and a leadership class; which came ﬁ  rst varies by c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 292  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 292  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

theory. The series of events spurring these two components 
also varies by theory. One theory maintains that advances in tec  h  nology such as irrigation generated an agricultural sur-
plus, and a leadership class formed to control the surplus and 
the technology that produced it. Another theory holds that a king or priest-king centra  l  ized polit  i  cal power and then 
demanded more labor to generate an agricultural surplus, 
which would help the r  u  ler retain political power.  
  Regardless of how the leadership class was established, 
we do know that once established, it helped generate the sur-
plus and facilitated that control of its distribution. The link between the surplus and the le  a  dership class is clear in early 
cities, where the home of the leaders was often positioned 
close to the grain storage. The leadership class, or urban elite, consisted of a group of decision makers and organi  z-
  ers who controlled the resources, and often the lives, of oth-
ers. The urban elite controlled the food su  p  ply, i  n  cluding 
its production, storage, and distribution. Generating an 
agricultural surplus enabled some people to devote their efforts to pursuits besides agriculture. The urban elite, for instance, did not work the ﬁ  elds. Rather, they devoted time to other pursuits such as religion and philosophy. Out of such pu  r  suits came the concepts of writing and recordkeep-
ing. Writing made possible the codiﬁ  cation of laws and the 
preservation of traditions. Urban elites defended themselves by constructing walls on the ou  t  skirts of the city. However, 
the leadership class collected taxes and tribute from people 
within their co  n  trol beyond the city walls.  20° 20°

1Some scholars argue that there are fewer than ﬁ  ve hearths and attribute 
more urbanization to diffusion.  Some cities grew out of agricultural villages, and 
others grew in places previously unoccupied by sed-
entary people. The innovation of the city is called the ﬁ rst urban revolution, and it occurred independently 
in six separate hearths, a case of independent inven-tion  
1   (Fig. 9.6). In each of the urban hearths, people 
b  e  came engaged in economic activities beyond agricul-
ture, including specialty crafts, the military, trade, and 
 go  v  ernment.  
  The six urban hearths are tied closely to the hearths 
of agriculture. The ﬁ  rst hearth of agriculture, the Fertile 
Crescent, is the ﬁ  rst place archaeologists ﬁ  nd evidence 
of cities, dating to about 3500 bce. This urban hearth is called Mesopotamia, referring to the region of great cit-
ies (such as Ur and Babylon) located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Studies of the cultural landscape and urban morphology of Mesopotamian cities have found signs of social inequality in the varying sizes and ornamentation of houses. Urban elite erected p  a  laces, 
protected themselves with walls, and employed countless 
artisans to beautify their spaces. They also e  s  tablished a 
priest-king class and developed a religious-political ide-
ology to support the priest-kings. Rulers in the cities were both priests and kings, and they levied taxes and demanded tribute from the harvest brought by the agr  i-
  cultural laborers.    Archaeologists, often teaming up with anthro-
pologists and geographers, have learned much about the 
ways ancient Mesopotamian cities functioned by study-ing the urban morphology of the cities. The ancient Mes  o  potamian city was usually protected by a mud wall 
surrounding the entire community, or sometimes a clu  s  ter 
of temples and shrines at its center. T emples dominated the urban landscape, not only because they were the larg-est structures in town but also b  e  cause they were built on 
artiﬁ cial mounds often over 100 feet (30 meters) high.  
  In Mesopotamia, priests and other authorities 
resided in substantial buildings, many of which might c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 294  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 294  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 When and Why Did People Start Living in Cities? 295
be called palaces. Ordinary citizens lived in mud-walled 
houses packed closely together and separated only by na  r  row lanes. Lining the narrow lanes, craftspeople 
set up their workshops. The informal urban housing of Mes  o  potamia surrounded well-planned central cities.  
  The second hearth of urbanization is the Nile River 
Valley, dating back to 3200 bce. The interrelatio  n  ship 
between urbanization and irrigation in this region dis-
tinguishes it from other urban hearths. The might of the rulers of the Nile River Valley is reﬂ  ected in the feats of architecture such as the great pyramids, tombs, and sphinx. T raditional theories hold that slaves built these feats of engineering, but more recent theories in archaeol-ogy claim that ordinary citizens built ancient monuments as part of their tax pa  y  ment.  
  The third urban hearth, dating to 2200 bce, is the 
Indus River Valley, another place where agriculture likely 
diffused from the Fertile Crescent. Unable to decipher ancient Indus writing, scholars are puzzled by H  a  rappa and 
Mohenjo-Daro, the ﬁ  rst cities of the Indus River Valley 
(Fig. 9.7). The intricate planning of the cities points to the 
existence of a leadership class, but the houses continued to be equal in size, with no palaces or monuments appear-ing in the cities. In addition, all the dwellings in the cities had access to the same infr  a  structure, including wastewa-
ter drains and carefully maintained stone-lined wells. The 
cities had thick walls, and the di  s  covery of coins from as far 
away as the Mediterranean found at the gateways to these 
walls points to si  g  niﬁ cant trade over long distances.    The fourth urban hearth arose around the conﬂ  u-
ence of the Huang He (Y ellow) and Wei  (Yangtzi) Valleys 
of present-day China, dating to 1500 bce. The Chinese 
purposefully planned their ancient cities to ce  n  ter on a 
vertical structure in the middle of the city and then built 
an inner wall around it. Within the inner wall, the pe  o  ple 
of this hearth typically placed temples and palaces for the 
leadership class. The urban elite of the Huang He and Wei region demonstrated their power by building enormous, elaborate structures. Around 200 bce, the E  m  peror Qin Xi 
Huang directed the building of the Great Wall of China. 
Like the Egyptians, he also had an elab  o  rate mausoleum 
built for himself. An estimated 700,000 laborers worked 
for over 40 years to craft the intricate faces and weapons, horses, and chariots of an army of over 7000 terracotta warriors who stand guard over his burial place (Fig. 9.8).  
  Chronologically, the ﬁ  fth urban hearth is 
Mesoamerica, dating to 1100 bce. The ancient cities of 
Mes  o  america were religious centers. The Olmec built cit-
ies, including San Lorenzo, on the Gulf Coast of Me  x  ico. 
The Olmec carved stone monuments, and archeaologists believe they moved the volcanic stones 50 miles from the interior of Mexico to the coast. The Olmec civilization died out, but based on cultural teachings of the Olmec, the Maya built cities in the same region also centered on religious temples (including Tikal, Chichén-Itzá, U  x  mal, 
and Copán in Fig. 9.9).

Chavín built cities in Peru dating to 900 bce. The larg-
est settlement, Chavín, was sited at an elevation of 10,530 
feet in the Andean highlands.  
  The Role of the Ancient City in Society  
  Ancient cities not only were centers of religion and 
power, but also served as economic nodes. Cities were the chief marketplaces and bases from which wealthy merchants, land and livestock owners, and traders o  p  er-
ated. As educational centers, residents of cities included 
teachers and philosophers. They also had hand  i  craft 
industries that attracted the best craftspeople and inve  n-
  tors. In all of these roles, ancient cities were the anchors 
of culture and society, the focal points of power, author-ity, and change.  
  How large were the ancient cities? We have only 
estimates because it is impossible to judge from excavated 
ruins the dimensions of a city at its height or the number of people who might have occupied each reside  n  tial unit. 
By modern standards, the ancient cities were not large. The cities of Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley may have had between 10,000 and 15,000 inhabitants after nearly 2000 years of growth and deve  l  opment. That, scholars 
conclude, is about the maximum sustainable size based on existing systems of food production, gathering, dis-tribution, and social organization, These urban places were geographical exce  p  tions in an overwhelmingly rural 
world. The modern city we know today did not emerge until several tho  u  sand years la  t  er.  
  Diffusion of Urbanization  
  Urbanization diffused from Mesopotamia in several direc-
tions. Populations in Mesopotamia grew with the steady food supply and a sedentary lifestyle. People migrated out from the hearth, diffusing their knowledge of agriculture and urbanization. Diffusion from Mesopotamia happened early, even before agriculture deve  l  oped independently in 
some other hearths. In fact, urbanization diffused to the Mediterranean from Mesop  o  tamia (and perhaps the Nile 
River Valley) more than 3500 years ago, at about the same time cities were d  e  veloping in the hearth of the Huang 
He and long before cities originated in Mesoamerica.  H

  Greek Cities  
  Greece is not an urban hearth because agriculture and 
urbanization diffused to Greece from Mesopotamia, r  a  ther 
than being independently innovated in Greece. Greece 
is more accurately described as a   secondary hearth   of 
urbanization because the Greek city form and function dif-
fused around the world centuries later through European colonialism. Greek cities began more than 3500 years ago, when the city of Knossos on the island of Crete became the cornerstone of a system of towns in the Minoan civiliz  a  tion.  
  By 500 bce, Greece had become one of the most 
highly urbanized areas on Earth. The urban  i  zation of 
Ancient Greece ushered in a new stage in the evolution of 
cities. At its height, Ancient Greece enco  m  passed a net-
work of more than 500 cities and towns, not only on the mainland but also on the many Greek islands. Se  a  farers 
connected these urban places with trade routes and carried the notion of urban life throughout the Mediterranean region. Athens and Sparta, often vying with each other for power, soon b  e  came Greece’s leading cities. Athens may 
have been the largest city in the world at the time, with an est  i  mated 250,000 i  n  habitants.  
  With the hilly topography of Greece, the people 
had no need to build earthen mounds on which to perch 
temples; these were provided by nature. Every city had its acropolis (acro   /H11005   high point, polis   /H11005   city), on which 
the people built the most impressive structures—usually 
religious buildings. The Parthenon of At  h  ens remains the 
most famous of all, surviving to this day despite nearly 2500 
years of war, earth tremors, vanda  l  ism, and environmental 
impact (Fig. 9.10). Building this magniﬁ  cent columned 
structure, designed by the Athenian architect-engineer 
Phidias, began in 447 bce, and its rows of tapering columns 
have i  n  spired arch  i  tects ever since.  
  Like the older Southwest Asian cities, Greece’s cities 
also had public places. In the Southwest Asian towns these 
seem to have been rather cramped, crowded, and bustling with activity, but in Ancient Greece they were open, spa-cious squares, often in a low part of town with steps lead-ing down to them (Fig. 9.11). On these steps the Greeks debated, lectured, judged each ot  h  er, planned military 
campaigns, and socialized. As time went on, this public space called the agora (meaning market) also became the 
focus of commercial a  c  tivity.  
  Greece’s cities also had excellent theaters. The 
aristocracy attended plays and listened to philosophical 
di  s  courses, but for many people life in a Greek city was 
miserable. Housing was no better than it had been in the Mesopotamian cities thousands of years earlier. Sanitation and health conditions were poor. And much of the gran-deur designed by Greece’s urban planners was the work of hundreds of thousands of slaves.  
  As a secondary urban hearth, the Greek city had 
global impact. Urbanization diffused from Greece to the 
Roman Empire. Roman urbanization and urban culture diffused through western Europe. The city declined in Europe for a time after the fall of the Roman Empire, but Eur  o  peans eventually carried Western concepts of city 
life (drawn from Greece and Rome) around the world through colonialism and capitalism. From Washington, D.C., to Canberra, Australia, the urban landscape shows the imprints of Greco-Roman urban culture.  
  Roman Cities  
  The great majority of Greece’s cities and towns were 
located near the Mediterranean Sea on peninsulas and islands and linked by sea routes. When the Romans suc-ceeded the Greeks (and Etruscans) as rulers of the r  e  gion, 
their empire incorporated not only the Mediterranean 
shores but also a large part of interior Europe and North Africa (Fig. 9.12). The Roman urban system was the largest yet—much larger than Greece’s domain. The capital, Rome, served as the apex of a hierarchy of settle-ments ranging from small villages to large cities. The Romans linked these places with an extensive transpor-tation network that included hu  n  dreds of miles of roads, 
well-established sea routes, and trading ports along the 
roads, sea, and rivers. R  o  man regional planners dis-
played a remarkable capacity for choosing the site of cit-
ies, for identifying sui  t  able locales for settlements. The 
site of a city is its absolute location, often chosen for its 
advanta  g  es in trade or defense, or as a center for reli-
gious practice.  c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 298  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 298  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 When and Why Did People Start Living in Cities? 299
  The   situation   of a city is based on its role in the 
larger, surrounding context. The site of a city is based on 
an absolute location, such as at the head of navigation of a river or where two rivers converge.   The   situation   of 
a city is its relative location, its place in the region and 
world around it.   The situation of a city changes with the 
times. For example, Rome was the center of the Roman 
Empire, but when the Roman Empire dissolved, the sit-uation of Rome changed, as well. It developed into the center of the Roman Cath  o  lic Church, a role it still plays 
today. But during the Renaissance when Florence ﬂ  our-
ished and during the Industrial Rev  o  lution when Naples 
and points north of Rome grew economically, the situa-
tion of Rome within Italy as a whole shifted. It no longer was the scientiﬁ  c, political and economic focal point of 
the country.  
  Romans were greatly inﬂ  uenced by the Greeks, as 
is evident in Roman mythology and visible in the cul-
tural landscape and   urban morphology   of Roman cities. 
The urban morphology of a city is the layout of the city,

“There can be few spaces of greater signiﬁ  cance 
to the development of Western civilization than 
the Roman Forum. This was the nerve center of a vast empire that transformed the face of western Europe, Southwest Asia, and North Africa. It was also the place where the decisions were made that carried forward Greek ideas about gover-nance, art, urban design, and technology. The very organization of space found in the Roman Forum is still with us: rectilinear street patterns; distinct buildings for legislative, executive, and judicial functions; and public spaces adorned with statues and fountains.”

colonial cities in a rectangular grid pattern, and R  o  mans 
adopted this plan wherever surface conditions made it 
possible.  
  When we add the purpose or use of buildings to the 
map of the morphology of a city, we reveal the   fun  c  tional 
zonation   of the city. The functional zonation reveals 
how different areas or segments of a city serve di  f  ferent 
purposes or functions within the city. For example, the 
Romans took the Greek acropolis (zone of reli  g  ion and 
center of power) and agora (zone of public space and the marketplace) and combined them into one zone: the Forum, which served as the focal point of Roman public life (Fig. 9.13).  
  In Rome, the Forum includes the world’s ﬁ  rst great 
stadium, the Colosseum, which was a much grander ve  r-
  sion of the Greek theater. Before crowds of thousands of 
onlookers, Roman gladiators fought each other or killed wild animals imported from Africa in the Colosseum. After Christianity diffused to Rome, but before the Roman E  m  pire adopted Christianity, Romans even 
forced Christians into the Colosseum where hungry 
lions attacked and ate them. All Roman cities of any size had an arena like the Colosseum where compet  i  tions, 
war games, cer  e  monies, and other public events took 
place.  
  Throughout the Roman Empire, cities were places 
of cultural contrasts. What still stands in ruins in many 
places around the Mediterranean are monumental build-ings, impressive villas, spacious avenues, ingenious aqu  e  ducts and baths, and sewage systems built of stone 
and pipe (Fig. 9.14). What we can no longer see in the ruins of the empire are the thousands of slaves who built these structures (estimates are between one-third and two-thirds of the population of the empire was enslaved) and the wretchedly poor who were crammed into over-crowded tenements and lived in ﬁ  lth. The city of the 
Roman Empire, like the city of today, was home to both c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 300  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 300  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

rich and poor and reﬂ  ected both the greatest achieve-
ments and the worst failings of civilization.  
  Urban Growth after Greece and Rome  
  After the Roman Empire fell in 495 ce, Europe entered an 
era historians called the Middle Ages, which spanned from about 500 to 1300 (or later in parts of Europe). During the ﬁ  rst two-thirds of this period in Europe, little urban 
growth occurred, and in some parts of the continent, urbanism went into sharp decline. The urban growth that did take place during this time o  c  curred on sites of oases 
and resting places along the Silk Route between Europe and Asia. Many of these places grew into towns, and some, such as Bukhara and Samarqand, became major cities. In Asia, Chinese styles of city-building diffused into Korea and Japan, with Seoul beco  m  ing a full-ﬂ  edged city by 
1200 and Kyoto, Japan’s historic capital, growing rapidly after the turn of the ninth century.  
  During Europe’s Middle Ages, urbanization contin-
ued vigorously outside of Europe. In West Africa, trading 
cities developed along the southern margin of the Sahara. By 1350, Timbuktu (part of Mali today) was a m  a  jor 
city—a seat of government, a university town, a market, and a religious center. The Americas also e  x  perienced sig-
niﬁ cant urban growth during Europe’s Middle Ages, espe-
cially within the Mayan and Aztec empires (Fig. 9.15). The largest pre-Columbian city in the Americas was in the Aztec Empire on the Mex  i  can Plateau. The Aztec cap-
ital of T enochtitlán had nearly 100,000 inhabitants when many European cities lay in ruins.    Site and Situation during European Exploration  
  Early Eurasian urban areas extended in a crescent-
shaped zone across Eurasia from England in the west to J  a  pan in the east, including the cities of London, Paris, 
Venice, Constantinople (Istanbul today), and T abriz, 
S  a  marqand, Kabul, Lahore, Amra, Jaunpur, Xian, 
Anyang, Kyoto and Osaka. Before European explora-
tion, most cities in the world were sited on trade routes in the interiors of continents, not just in Eurasia, but also in West Africa and indigenous America. Interior trade routes such as the Silk Route and the caravan routes of West A  f  rica sustained these inland cities and, in many 
cases, helped them prosper.  
  The relative importance of the interior trade routes 
changed, however, when European maritime exploration 
and overseas colonization ushered in an era of oceanic, worldwide trade. With this shift, the situation of ci  t  ies like 
Paris and Xian changed from being crucial in an interior trading route to being left out of an oceanic trade.  
  After European exploration took off during the 
1400s, the dominance of interior cities declined. Other 
ci  t  ies, sited on coasts, gained prominence as their situ-
ations changed. In Asia, coastal cities such as Bombay 
(now Mumbai, India), Madras (Chennai, India), Malacca (Malaysia), Batavia (Jakarta, Indonesia), and T okyo ( J  a  pan) came to the fore. Exploration and oceanic 
trade refocused the situations of cities in West Africa 
as well. Before 1500, urbanization in West Africa was concentrated in a belt extending along the southern margin of the Sahara, including such cities as Timbuktu (Mali), Niani (Guinea), Gao (Mali), Zaria (Nigeria), Kano (Nigeria), and Maiduguri (Nigeria). Here, cross-desert caravan trafﬁ  c met boat trafﬁ  c on the River Niger (where “camel met canoe”), and people exchanged goods from northern deserts for goods from coastal fo  r  ests. Maritime trade di  s  rupted this pattern of trade: 
coastal ports became the leading markets and centers of 
power, and the African ci  t  ies of the interior began a long 
decline.  
  Coastal cities remained crucial after exploration led 
to colonialism. During the colonial p  e  riod key cities in 
international trade networks included the coastal cities of 
Cape T own (South Africa), Lima-Callao (Peru), and New Y ork City.  
  The trade networks European powers commanded 
(including the slave trade) brought u  n  precedented 
riches to Europe’s burgeoning medieval cities, such 
as Amsterdam (the Netherlands), London (England), Lisbon (Portugal), Liverpool (England), and Seville (Spain). Successful merchants built ornate mansions, patro  n  ized the arts, participated in city governance, 
and supported the reconstruction of city centers. As a 
result, cities that thrived during mercantilism took on similar properties whether it was Antwerp (Belgium), c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 301  10/3/11  9:12 PM user f-400c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 301  10/3/11  9:12 PM user f-400 F-400F-400

C  o  penhagen (De  n  mark), Lisbon (Portugal), or Genoa 
(Italy). A central square became the focus of the city, 
fronted by royal, religious, public, and private buildings evincing wealth and prosperity, power and inﬂ    u  ence (Fig. 
9.16). Streets leading to these central squares formed 
arteries of commerce, and the beginnings of “down-towns” emerged.  
  During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, 
European mercantile cities became the nodes of a widen-
ing network of national, regional, and global commerce. So wealthy and powerful were the merchants that, su  p-
  ported by their rulers, they were able to found and expand 
settlements in distant lands. Cities such as Dakar (Senegal), Lourenco Marques (now Maputo, Moçambique), and Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam) were endowed with the ornate trappings of the mercantile cities of Europe, including elaborately inlaid sidewalks, tree-lined avenues, and neo-Gothic architecture.  
  The Second Urban Revolution  
  During the last decades of the eighteenth century, the 
Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain. None of E  u  rope’s cities was prepared for what lay ahead: an ava-
lanche of changes that ripped the fabric of urban life. Around 1800, western Europe was still overwhelmingly rural. As thousands migrated to the cities with i  n  dustr  i-
  alization, cities had to adapt to the mushrooming popu-
lation, the proliferation of factories and supply facilities, the expansion of transport sy  s  tems, and the construction 
of tenements for the growing labor force.  
  A Second Agricultural Revolution  
  Before the second urban revolution could take place, a 
second revolution in agriculture was necessary. Du  r  ing 
the late seventeenth century and into the eighteenth cen-tury, Europeans invented a series of important improv  e-
  ments in agriculture, including the seed drill, hybrid 
seeds, and improved breeding practices for livestock. The second agricultural revolution also improved orga-nization of production, market collabor  a  tion, and stor-
age c  a  pacities. Agricultural laborers migrated to cities in 
hopes of obtaining jobs in the formal economy, which i  n  cluded wages usable in the growing cash-based econo-
mies of Europe. Manufacturers tapped into the new labor force and expanded industrial production (for a further discussion of industrializ  a  tion, see Chapter 12).  
  Not all mercantile cities turned into industrial cities. 
Many industrial cities grew from small villages or along 
canal and river routes. The primary determinant in the location of early industrial cities was proximity to a power source. For textile manufacturing, industrial cities had to be sited near fresh water sources to power the w  a  ter 
loom. In Great Britain, industrial cities involved in textile manufacturing were located in the Pennines, where fresh water ﬂ  owed down the hillsides. Industrial cities involved in iron manufacturing were located around Birmingham Field Note
“The contemporary landscape of Genoa stands as a reminder of the city’s historic importance. Long before Europe became divided up into states, a number of cities in northern Italy freed themselves from the strictures of feudalism and began to function autonomously. Genoa and Venice were two of these, and they became the foci of signiﬁ  cant Mediterranean maritime trad-ing empires. In the process, they also became magniﬁ  cent, wealthy cities. Although most build-
ings in Genoa’s urban core date from a more recent era, the layout of streets and public squares harkens back to the city’s imperial days. Is it a surprise that the city gave birth to one of the most famous explorers of all time: Christo-pher Columbus?”

and Coalbroo  k  dale, easily accessible to Britain’s coal and 
iron ore ﬁ  elds.  
  When industrialization diffused from Great Britain 
to the European mainland, the places most ready for 
i  n  dustrialization had undergone their own second agricul-
tural revolution, had surplus capital from mercantilism and 
colonialism, and were located near coal ﬁ  elds (Fig. 9.17).  
  The Chaotic Industrial City  
  With industrialization, cities became unregulated jum-
bles of activity. Factories engulfed private homes. Open spaces became garbage dumps. Urban dwellers converted elegant housing into overcrowded slums. Sanit  a  tion sys-
tems failed, and water supplies were inadequate and often 
polluted. By the late 1800s, the Industrial Rev  o  lution had 
changed transportation signiﬁ  cantly. The steam engine, powered by coal, not only pumped water from mines for 
coal mining but also p  o  wered the railroad and steamship. 
The diffusion of the railroad gave cities that were not near 
coal ﬁ  elds the chance to industrialize. The central parts of cities like London, Paris, and Amste  r  dam retained their 
preindustrial shape. But with the diffusion of the railroad, 
railroad tracks knifed through long-stable neighborhoods.  
  Living conditions were dreadful for workers in cit-
ies, and working conditions were shocking. Children 
worked 12-hour shifts in textile mills, typically six days a week. In industrial cities, health conditions were worse than they had been in medieval times; the air was polluted and the water contaminated. The grimy, soot-covered cit-ies of the British Midlands were appropriately deemed the “black towns.” Few if any safety mech  a  nisms protected 
the laborers, and injuries were common.  
  In the mid-1800s, as Karl Marx and Frederick Engels

“workers of the world” to unite, conditions in European 
manufacturing cities gradually improved. I  n  dustrialists 
were forced to recognize workers’ rights, and gover  n-
  ments intervened by legislating workers’ rights and intro-
ducing city planning and zo  n  ing. Many manufacturing 
cities in North America never suffered as much as their European predecessors, although living and working conditions for factory workers (and “blue-collar” work-ers generally) were far from satisfactory. American manu-facturing cities did not alt  o  gether escape the problems of 
the European industrial cities. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the American manufactur-ing city grew rapidly, often with inadequate planning and rapid immigr  a  tion leading to the d  e  velopment of slums 
and ghettoes.  
  During the second half of the twentieth century, the 
nature of manufacturing changed, as did its location: cities 
repositioned many factories away from congested, over-crowded, expensive urban areas. Comp  a  nies simply aban-
doned large manufacturing plants, making “rust belts” out of once-thriving industrial di  s  tricts. Many of these plants 
still stand today, overgrown by weeds, with broken win-dows and cracking walls (Fig. 9.18).  
  Although factories and factory jobs are not perma-
nent, the urbanization that went along with indu  s  trializa-
tion is still apparent. Depending on the sometimes vari-
able deﬁ  nition of “urban,” western Europe t  o  day is more 
than 80 percent urb  a  nized, and urbanization has become a 
global phenomenon. Worldwide, more people now live in cities than in rural areas.  
  Archaeologists have found that the houses in Indus River cit-ies, such as Mohenjo-Daro and H  a  rappa, were a uniform size: each house had access to a sewer system, and p  a  laces were absent from the cultural landscape. Derive a theory as to why these conditions were present in these cities that had both a leadership class and a surplus of agricultural goods.  
  WHERE ARE CITIES LOCATED AND WHY?  
  When you look at a map in an atlas of the United 
States or Canada, or at a road map of a State or pro  v  ince, 
you see an array of places of different sizes, with varying 
distances between them. The map looks like a ju  m  ble, yet 
each place is where it is because of some decision, some perception of the site or its situation. Site and situation help explain why certain cities were planned and why cit-ies thrive or fail. T o understand why a conglomeration of Field Note
“The Ruhr Valley long functioned as the incubator of Germany’s industrial economy. Largely destroyed during World War II, the Ruhr rose again to help Germany back to recovery. But as declining transportation costs and ris-ing labor costs prompted heavy industries to move their operations to other parts of the world, factories such as this iron and steel mill on the edge of Duisburg fell silent. Unemployment soared, and the area became depressed. In an effort to rebound, local authorities are now trying to turn a few of these relics into tourist destinations. They are unlikely to compete with the great churches or medieval palaces found elsewhere in Germany, but for the geogra-pher they provide fascinating insights into the urban and economic arrangements that made modern Europe what it is today.”

 Where Are Cities Located and Why? 305
cities is distributed across space the way it is and why cities 
are different sizes, it is nece  s  sary to examine more than 
one city at a time and see how those cities ﬁ  t together, into the region, into the state, and into the globe as a whole.  
  Urban geographers studied the distribution of cities 
in Europe and the Americas during the 1900s, using quan-
titative techniques to determine how many cities and what size cities are needed within a certain space. In studying the size of cities and distances between them, urban geog-raphers explored the trade areas of di  f  ferent size cities. 
Every city and town has a trade area, an adjacent region within which its inﬂ  uence is dominant. Customers from smaller towns and villages come to the city to shop and to conduct other bus  i  ness. An o  n  line survey of approxi-
mately 50,000 people helped one armchair geographer create a map of trade areas for the co  n  tiguous United 
States (Fig. 9.19). The city’s newspapers are read, and its television stations are watched in the surrounding region (Fig. 9.20).  
  Across the multitude of quantitative studies in urban 
geography, three key components arose frequently: popu-
lation, trade area, and distance. The simplest way to think through the relationship among these three var  i  ables is 
to consider your State or province map. On the map, you will see many villages with unfamiliar names, a number of small towns sited on highways, several medium-sized cities where transportation routes converge, and likely one familiar, d  o  minant city. The largest city has the larg-
est trade area, and as a result fewer places rival it as the major trade area: the several medium-sized cities trade in smaller areas of co  m  merce and are scattered apart from 
the major city, small towns house the grocery stores and other necess  i  ties, and ﬁ  nally villages may still have a café 
or a gas station. The trade areas and population combine to give us a hierarchy of urban places, following a pattern commonly called the rank-size rule.  
  Rank and Size in the Urban Matrix  
  The rank-size rule holds that in a model urban hierar-
chy, the population of a city or town will be inversely pro-portional to its rank in the hierarchy. Thus, if the largest city has 12 mi  l  lion people, the second largest will have St. GeorgeSeattle

Broken Arrow, Oklahoma
Many trade areas in the United States are named, and their names typically 
coincide with the vernacular region, the region people perceive themselves as living in. In promoting a trade area, companies often adopt, name, or shape the name of the vernacular region. In Oklahoma, the label Green Country refers to the northeastern quarter of the state, the trade area served by Tulsa. Tourism promoters derived the label in the 1970s, and the Tulsa media have used the name since. Promoters see the label as positive, implying Green Country is a landscape of forests, lakes, rivers, hills, and wealth—a perception that chal-lenges popular notions of Dust Bowl Oklahoma as a treeless, dry, ﬂ  at, windy, 
and impoverished region of the 1930s. Green Country’s popularity is conﬁ  rmed 
by the hundreds of businesses, organizations, and agencies that have adopted the name. In turn, the presence of the trade area name throughout the cultural landscape reinforces the vernacular region, strengthening the importance of the region in the minds of the people.

about 6 million (that is, half the population of the lar  g-
  est city); the third city will have 4 million (one-third); the 
fourth city 3 mi  l  lion; and so on. Note that the size differ-
ences between city levels become smaller at lower levels of the hierarchy, so that the tenth-largest city would have 1.2 million i  n  habitants.  
  Although German Felix Auerbach suggested the 
rank-size rule in 1913, linguist George Zipf is credited 
with establishing the mathematical equation for the rank-size rule in 1941. Since then, scholars across disciplines have tested the rule and questioned when the rule applies and when it does not. Studies in 1966, 1980, and again in 2002 found that the majority of countries they tested had populations with more even distrib  u  tions than the rank-
size rule would predict. Other recent studies have ques-tioned why the rank-size rule ﬁ  ts the cou  n  tries where it 
does ﬁ  t, and these studies have offered answers including 
a combination of random growth (chance) and economies of scale (e  f  ﬁ ciency).  
  The rank-size rule does not apply in all countries, 
especially countries with one dominant city. States often 
focus development in one particular city, such as the capi-tal city, thereby bolstering that city and its popul  a  tion 
above the rest of the cities in the state. In 1939, geogra-pher Mark Jefferson deﬁ  ned a primate city as “a cou  n  try’s 
leading city, always disproportionately large and excep-tionally expressive of national capacity and fee  l  ing.” He 
saw the primate city as the largest and most economically inﬂ uential within the state, with the next largest city in the 
state b  e  ing much smaller and much less inﬂ  uential.  
  Many former colonies have primate cities, as the 
colonial powers often ruled from a single dominant city, 
where economic and political activities were concen-trated. Examples of primate cities in former colonies include Me  x  ico City, Mexico and Manila, the Philippines. 
In the noncolonial context, London and Paris each serve as exa  m  ples of primate cities in the United Kingdom and 
France, respe  c  tively  .  
  Central Place Theory  
  Walter Christaller wrote the classic urban geography 
study to explain where cities, towns, and villages are likely 
to be located. In his book, The Central Places in Southern 
Germany (1933), Christaller laid the groundwork for cen-
tral place theory. He attempted to develop a model to pre-dict how and where central places in the urban hierarchy (hamlets, villages, towns, and cities) would be functionally and spatially di  s  tributed. Christaller began his theory of 
development with a set of assumptions: ﬁ  rst, the surface of 
the ideal region would be ﬂ  at and have no physical barriers; 
second, soil fertility would be the same everywhere; third, 
population and purchasing po  w  er would be evenly distrib-
uted; next, the region would have a uniform transportation 
network to permit direct tr  a  vel from each settlement to the 
other; and, ﬁ  nally, from any given place, a good or service 
could be sold in all directions out to a certain distance.  
  Through his studies, Christaller calculated the ideal 
central place system and then compared his model to 
real-world situations and tried to explain the variations and exceptions. In the u  r  ban hierarchy, the central places 
would be nested, so the largest central place provides the greatest number of functions to most of the region. Within the trade area of the largest central place, a series of larger towns would provide functions to several smaller

places. The smaller places would then provide fewer cen-
tral functions to a smaller-yet se  r  vice area.  
  T o determine the locations of each central place, 
Christaller needed to deﬁ  ne the goods and services pr  o-
  vided. He studied the sale of goods and services and calcu-
lated the distance people would willingly travel to acquire them. Cities, he postulated, would be regularly spaced, with central places where the same product was sold at the same price located a standard distance apart. He reasoned that a person would not be e  x  pected to tr  a  vel 11 miles 
to one place to buy an item if it were possible to go only 9 miles to purchase it at another place. Central place theory maintains that each central place has a surround-ing complementary r  e  gion, an exclusive trade area within 
which the town has a monopoly on the sale of certain goods, because it alone can provide such goods at a given price and within a certain range of travel.  
  Hexagonal Hinterlands  
  Based on this description of Christaller’s theory, you may 
expect the shape of each central place’s trade area to be circular (bullseye shapes surrounding each place). But cir-cles either have to overlap or leave certain a  r  eas u  n  served. 
Hence, Christaller chose perfectly ﬁ  tted hexagonal 
regions as the shape of each trade area (Fig. 9.21).  
  Urban geographers were divided on the relevance 
of his model. Some saw hexagonal systems everywhere; 
others saw none at all. Christaller received support from geographers, who applied his ideas to regions in E  u  rope, 
North America, and elsewhere. In China, both the North China Plain and the Sichuan Basin display the seemingly uninterrupted ﬂ  atness assumed by Christaller’s model. 
When G. William Skinner e  x  amined the distribution 
of villages, towns, and cities there in 1964, he found a spatial pattern closely resembling the one pr  e  dicted by 
Christaller’s model. Studies in the U.S. Midwest sug-gested that while the square layout of the township-and-range system imposed a different kind of regularity on the landscape, the ec  o  nomic forces at work there tended to 
conﬁ rm Christaller’s theory.  
  Christaller recognized that not all his assumptions 
would be met in reality; physical barriers, uneven r  e  source 
distributions, and other factors all modify Christaller’s 
hexagons. Nonetheless, his model yielded a nu  m  ber of 
practical insights. His studies pointed to a hierarchy of urban places that are spatially balanced and also estab-lished that larger cities would be spaced farther from each other than smaller towns or villages. Although Christaller’s model of perfectly ﬁ  t hexagons is not often realized, his studies conﬁ  rm that the di  s  tribution of cities, 
towns, and vi  l  lages in a region is not an accident but is tied 
to trade areas, population size, and distance.  
  Central Places Today  
  When Christaller worked on his spatial model and pro-
jected central place theory to help explain the distrib  u-
  tion of urban areas, the world was a simpler and much less 
populated place than it is today. As many urban geogr  a-
  phers have pointed out during the debate that followed 
Christaller’s publications, new factors, forces, and cond  i  tions  Figure 9.21

not anticipated by his models and theories (including the 
Internet and the interstate system) make them less rel-evant today.  
  Geographer Larry Ford stresses that central place 
notions still have a role in explaining current develop-
ments. T ake, for example, the Sun Belt phenomenon of the past four decades—the movement of millions of Amer  i  cans from northern and northeastern States to the 
South and Southwest. This is not just an internal, volun-tary migration made possible by social security funds and retirement plans; it also results from deliberate gover  n-
  mental economic and social polices that favor “Sun Belt” 
cities through federal spending on military, space, and r  e  search facilities. And even as Northerners moved south-
ward, millions of Middle and South American migrants moved nort  h  ward—into the same urban centers already 
growing for domestic reasons.  
  The overall effect of all this movement was to create 
a changed urban hierarchy in the Sun Belt region. Central 
place theory would predict that some existing cities would respond by increasing their production of hig  h  er-order 
(technological) goods and services, increasing their eco-nomic reach and bypassing others. And this is what hap-pened: Atlanta, Dallas, and Phoenix became headquarters cities for large regions, mo  v  ing up in the urban hierarchy. 
Charlotte, T ampa, San Antonio, and T ucson also rose, but took secondary status. Other centers participated less in the new spatial economy and remained where they were in the u  r  ban hierarchy.  
  As Ford emphasized, central place theory can still 
add “analytical power to the understan  d  ing of patterns 
of urban growth, even in this era of fast and long-distance 
transportation, suburbanization, and multiple urban fun  c  tions.”  
  Sketch a map of your city or town and the cities or towns 
nearby. Make a list of the kinds of goods and se  r  vices avail-able in each of these towns. Do the ideas about central places presented in this section of the cha  p  ter apply to your region?  
  HOW ARE CITIES ORGANIZED, 
AND HOW DO THEY FUNCTION?  
  We all know that cities have certain features in 
common, and we use geographic terms to identify these 
fe  a  tures i  n  cluding downtowns, suburbs, industrial dis-
tricts, and shopping malls. Cities in various geographic regions of the world also have their own, distinct char-
acteristics. Mumbai, India, looks vastly different from Chicago, Ill  i  nois. T okyo, Japan, is distinct from Lagos, 
Nigeria. Cities in South America tend to be graced by 
often magniﬁ      cent plazas not common in Australia or 
Russia.  
  One way to conceptualize the layout of cities is 
through models that illustrate the structures of cities. 
Since the 1920s, urban geographers have studied, charted, and mapped cities to create models that describe the u  r  ban morphology, functional zonation, and overall lay-
out of cities in world regions.  
  City models reveal how cities are purposefully struc-
tured to perform the roles they have as centers of co  m-
  merce, education, transportation, industry, and gover-
nance. The form of cities also reﬂ  ects the historic, sp  a  tial, 
economic, cultural, and political processes that shaped cities in each world region.  
  In this section of the chapter, we discuss a number 
of models that urban geographers have drawn for cities. 
In the next section, we discuss the people and institutions that organize and shape c  i  ties.  
  Models of the City  
  Each model of the city, regardless of the region, is a study 
in   fun  c  tional zonation  —the division of the city into 
 certain regions (zones) for certain purposes (functions). 
Every city in the world is an assemblage of functional zones, orderly designed in some places and jumbled chaos in others. Zones of the city exist and play certain roles in the city’s life, whether to house residents, produce goods, educate students, or acco  m  modate gover  n  ment. Each 
zone or region is part of the larger city.  
  Globalization has created common cultural land-
scapes in the ﬁ  nancial districts of many world cities. 
Until little more than 30 years ago, Shanghai, China, was a vast, low-rise Chinese city centered on a col  o  nial-era 
riverfront with British and French architectural imprints 
that had e  n  dured for more than a century. T oday, you 
might mistake the ﬁ  nancial districts in downtown 
Shanghai for New Y ork City with its forest of skyscra  p-
  ers housing international corporations, banks, hotels, 
and hundreds of thousands of apartment dwellers. Y ou will also see the names of the same corporations and hotels on high-rise buildings in central Mumbai (India), Ban  g  kok (Thailand), Dubai (United Arab Emirates) and 
Singapore.  
  With globalization reﬂ  ected in cultural landscapes 
around the world, are regional models of cities no lon-
ger useful? Quite the opposite: they help us understand the processes that forged cities in the ﬁ  rst place and 
understand the impact of modern linkages and inﬂ  uences 
now chan  g  ing cities. In Shanghai, China, for example, c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 308  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 308  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Are Cities Organized, and How Do They Function?  309
the government chose to preserve the unique c  o  lonial 
riverfront architecture and develop around the colonial 
neighborhood and across the   Huangpu River  . In South 
America, cities are protecting historic plazas against mod-
ernization through regulations that limit high-rise devel-opment to areas outside of the plazas. The city of Paris protects the old city from development of high rises. Instead, Paris concentrates skyscraper development in the technology corridor called La Defense, which is located along the axis of the Avenue Charles de Gaulle a little over 3 miles from the Arc de T riomphe.  
  Models of cities give us context for understanding the 
history and geography of regions and major cities within 
them. Studying the location and interplay of zones within cities and the changing cultural lan  d  scape of cities helps us 
grasp the interplay between cities and globaliz  a  tion.  
  Functional Zones  
  Before examining the models of urban spaces, we must 
deﬁ ne some terms commonly used in referring to parts of 
the city. The term zone is typically pr  e  ceded by a descrip-
tor that conveys the purpose of that area of the city. The models describe zones as areas with a relatively uniform land use, for example, an industrial zone or a res  i  dential 
zone. Most models deﬁ  ne the key economic zone of the 
city (if there is such) as the   central business district   (CBD). 
The American CBD typically has high land values, tall 
buildings, busy trafﬁ  c, converging highways, and mass 
transit sy  s  tems.  
  The term central city describes the urban area that 
is not suburban. In effect, central city refers to the older 
city as opposed to the newer suburbs. A suburb is an out-
lying, functionally uniform part of an u  r  ban area, and is 
often (but not always) adjacent to the central city. Most suburbs are residential, but some have other land uses, including schools, shopping malls, and ofﬁ  ce parks.  
  Suburbanization is the process by which lands that 
were previously outside of the urban environment b  e  come 
urbanized, as people and businesses from the city move to 
these spaces. The process of suburbaniz  a  tion holds special 
interest for human geographers because it involves the transformation of large areas of land from rural to urban uses and affects large numbers of people who can afford to move to larger and more expensive suburban homes. The aesthetic of the suburb reveals the occupants’ ideal-ized living patterns b  e  cause their la  y  out can be planned in 
response to choice and demand.  
  In Contemporary Suburban America (1981), urban 
geographer P . O. Muller offered a thorough analysis of suburbanization, describing how suburbia “evolved into a self-sufﬁ  cient urban entity, containing its own m  a  jor 
economic and cultural activities, that is no longer an appendage to the central city.” Muller found subu  r  ban cities ready to compete with the central city for leading urban economic activities such as telecommun  i  cations, 
high-technology industries, and corporate headquarters. In addition to expanding residential zones, the process of su  b  urbanization rapidly creates distinct urban regions 
complete with industrial, commercial, and educational co  m  ponents.  
  The overall importance of suburban life in the 
United States is underscored by the results of the 2000 
census, which indicated that no less than 50 percent of the entire American population resided in the suburbs (up from 37 percent in 1970); the remaining 50 percent were divided b  e  tween the central cities (30.3 percent) and non-
metropolitan or rural areas (19.7 percent). Of the popu-lation living in metropolitan areas, 62.2 percent r  e  sided 
in the suburbs, which in 2000 had 141 million residents. Thus, the suburbs have become the essence of the mo  d  ern 
American city.  
  Just by using such terms as residential area and cen-
tral business district, people acknowledge the existence 
of a regional structure within cities. When you refer to downtown, or to the airport, or to the city zoo, you are in fact referring to urban regions where certain functions pr  e  vail (business activity, transportation, and recreation, 
in the three just mentioned). All of these urban regions or zones lie near or adjacent to each other and together make up the city. But how are they arranged?  
  Modeling the North American City  
  Urban geographers have constructed a succession of 
models that reﬂ  ect change and growth in the geographic layout of North American cities. The ﬁ  rst model, the concentric zone model (Fig. 9.22A), resulted from soc  i-
  ologist Ernest Burgess’s study of Chicago in the 1920s. 
Burgess’s model divides the city into ﬁ  ve concentric 
zones, d  e  ﬁ ned by their function. As the city grew, land 
was converted in zones around the outside of the city, 
and the co  n  centric zone model emerged. At the center 
is the CBD (1), itself subdivided into several subdistricts 
(ﬁ na  n  cial, retail, theater).  
  The zone of transition (2) is characterized by resi-
dential deterioration and encroachment by business and 
light manufacturing. Zone 3 is a ring of closely spaced but adequate homes occ  u  pied by the blue-collar labor 
force. Zone 4 consists of middle-class residences, and 
Zone 5 is the suburban ring. Burgess described his model as dynamic: as the city grew, inner zones encroached on outer ones, so that CBD functions invaded Zone 2 and the problems of Zone 2 a  f  fected the inner margins of 
Zone 3.  
  In the late 1930s, Homer Hoyt published his sector 
model (Fig. 9.22B), partly as an answer to the limitations 
of the Burgess model. Hoyt focused on residential patterns, c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 309  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 309  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
310 Chapter 9  Urban Geography
explaining where the wealthy in a city chose to live. Hoyt 
argued that the city grows outward from the center, so a low-rent area could extend all the way from the CBD to the city’s outer edge, creating zones that are shaped like a piece of pie. Hoyt found that the pie-shaped pieces describe the high-rent residential, intermediate rent resi-dential, low-rent residential, ed  u  cation and recreation, 
tran  s  portation, and industrial sectors.  
  Researchers studied both theories, and Chauncy 
Harris and Edward Ullman argued that neither the con-
ce  n  tric rings nor the sector model adequately reﬂ  ected 
city structure by the mid-twentieth century. In the 1940s, Harris and Ullman proposed the multiple nuclei model (Fig. 9.22 C). Their model recognizes that the CBD was losing its dominant position as the single nu  c  leus of the 
urban area. Several of the urban regions shown in the ﬁ  g-
ure have their own nuclei.  
  Most urban geographers think these models are 
too simplistic to describe the modern city. With the 
avai  l  ability of personal automobiles and the construc-
tion of ring roads and other art  e  ries around cities in the 1970s and 1980s, suburbanization exploded around new 
transport  a  tion corridors. The outer city grew rapidly and 
became more functionally independent of the central 
city, and suburban downtowns emerged to serve their new local economies. Often located near key freeway intersections, these suburban downtowns developed mainly around big regional shopping centers and attracted industrial parks, ofﬁ  ce complexes, hotels, res-ta  u  rants, entertainment facilities, and even sports stadi-
ums. They became edge cities. Edge cities such as 
T  y  sons Corner, Virginia (outside Washington, D.C.) and 
Irvine, California (outside Los Angeles) ﬂ  ourished. They 
attracted tens of thousands of nearby suburbanites—
offering workplaces, sho  p  ping, leisure activities, and all 
the other elements of a complete urban environment—
thereby loosening r  e  maining ties not only to the central 
city but to other suburban areas as well (Fig. 9.23). As 
early as 1973, American suburbs surpassed the central cities in total employment. By the mid-1980s, in some metropolises in the Sun Belt, the majority of jobs in the m  e  tropolis were in the suburbs.   Figure 9.22

 How Are Cities Organized, and How Do They Function?  311
  Modeling the Cities of the Global Periphery 
and Semiperiphery  
  Cities in the world with millions of inhabitants can now 
be counted in the hundreds; it therefore becomes increas-ingly difﬁ  cult to model, classify, or typify urban centers. In the 1960s, researchers classiﬁ  ed “col  o  nial” cities as urban 
areas where European transplants dominated the form of the city, laying it out with Western styles. Researchers also drew models of “indige  n  ous” cities that remained 
remote from globalizing inﬂ  uences and various forms of 
the Western city.  
  The rapid growth in population and territorial foot-
print of megacities in the developing world has made it 
difﬁ cult to apply city models. Primate cities in developing 
countries are called   m  e  gacities   when the city has a large 
population, a vast territorial extent, rapid in-migration, 
and a strained, inadequate infrastru  c  ture. For e  x  ample, 
Mumbai, India, has more people than the country of Australia. São Paulo, Brazil, covers more land than the country of Belgium. Kinshasa, The Congo, is the fastest growing city in Africa. Jakarta, Indonesia, is the largest city in the world without a su  b  way or metro system.  
  In Middle and South America, Mexico City (Mexico) 
and São Paulo (Brazil) are now the kinds of megac  i  ties that 
make analysis difﬁ  cult. Nonetheless, some cities located in 
South American countries once colonized by Spain have retained a common social-spatial geography. Also, some 
former colonial cities in Subsaharan Africa have mai  n-
  tained the spatial components lost in megacities like 
Lagos (Nigeria) and Kinshasa (The Congo).  
  The South American City  
  In 1980, geographers Ernst Grifﬁ  n and Larry Ford studied 
South American cities and derived a model of the South American city referred to as the Grifﬁ  n-Ford model. 
Grifﬁ  n and Ford found that South American ci  t  ies blend 
traditional elements of South American culture with the forces of globalization that are reshaping the urban scene, combining radial sectors and conce  n  tric zones.  
  Anchoring the model is the thriving CBD, which 
remains the city’s primary business, employment, and 
e  n  tertainment focus. The CBD is divided into a tradi-
tional market sector and a more modern high-rise sec-
tor. Adequate public transit systems and nearby afﬂ  u-
ent residential areas assure the dominance of the CBD. Emanating outward from the urban core along the city’s most prestigious axis is the commercial spine, which is su  r  rounded by the elite residential sector. This widening 
corridor is essentially an extension of the CBD. It features 
ofﬁ ces, sho  p  ping, high-quality housing for the upper and 
upper-middle classes, restaurants, theaters, and such ame-
nities as parks, zoos, and golf courses. At the end of the

elite spine sector lies an i  n  cipient edge city shown as “mall” 
on the model and ﬂ  anked by high-priced residences. This 
reﬂ ects the emergence of suburban nodes from the North 
American model in South America’s c  i  ties.  
  In the Grifﬁ  n-Ford model, the remaining concentric 
zones are home to less well-off residents, who co  m  pose the 
great majority of the urban population. Socioeconomic 
levels and housing quality decrease mar  k  edly with greater 
distance from the city center (Fig. 9.24). The zone of matu-
rity in the inner city contains the best housing outside the spine sector, attracting the middle classes, who invest sufﬁ  -
ciently to keep their solidly built but aging dwellings from deteriorating. The adjacent zone is one of much more modest hou  s  ing. Interspersed with the more modest areas 
are densely populated unkempt areas, which represent a 
tra  n  sition from inner-ring afﬂ  uence to outer-ring poverty. 
The outermost zone of peripheral squatter settl  e  ments is 
home to the impoverished and recent migrants who live in 
shantytowns.   Shantytowns are u  n  planned developments 
of crude dwellings and shelters made mostly of scrap 
wood, iron, and pieces of car  d  board that develop around 
ci  t  ies  . Although the ring of peripheral squatter settlements 
consists mainly of teeming, high-density shantytowns, many residents here are surprisingly optimistic about ﬁ  nd-
ing work and i  m  proving their living conditions.  
  A structural element common among many South 
American cities is the disamenity sector, the very poor-
est parts of ci  t  ies that in extreme cases are not connected 
to regular city services and are controlled by gangs and drug lords. The disamenity sectors in South American cit-ies contain relatively unchanging slums known as barrios 
or fav  e  las. The worst of these poverty-stricken areas often 
include large numbers of people who are so poor that they are forced to live in the streets (Fig. 9.25). There is little in the way of regular law enforcement within such commu-nities, and drug lords often run the show—or battle with other drug lords for dominance. Such cond  i  tions also pre-
vail in places beyond the ring highway or periférico, which is now a feature of most South Amer  i  can cities.  
  Finally, the Grifﬁ  n-Ford model displays two smaller 
sectors: an industrial park, reﬂ  ecting the ongoing co  n  cen-
tration of industrial activity in the city, and a gentriﬁ  cation 
zone, where historic buildings are preserved. Ge  n  triﬁ cation 
remains much less common in South American cities than 
in North America, but it is an emerging phenomenon.  
  T o what extent is the Grifﬁ  n-Ford model a realistic 
portrayal of the South American city? The model r  e  ﬂ ects 
the enormous differences between the spaces of privilege 
and the spaces of abject poverty within the South American city. The model also describes elements of sector d  e  velop-
ment evident in many large South American cities, but the 
concentricity suggested by the model seems to be breaking down. Figure 9.24 i  n  corporates both the original zones of 
the Grifﬁ  n-Ford model and the updates Larry Ford added 
in a 1996 a  r  ticle. Larry Ford’s updated Grifﬁ  n-Ford model 
adds a ring highway (periférico) around the outskirts of the 
city, d  i  vides the downtown business district into a CBD 
and a market, adds a mall near the elite space, and leaves 
space for su  b  urban industrial parks.  
  The African City  
  At the beginning of this century, Subsaharan Africa 
included countries with some of the world’s lowest lev-els of urbanization. In the tropical region of Africa, the majority of the people are fa  r  mers, and most countries in 
the tropics remain under 40 percent urbanized. Outside the tropics, the region is about 57 percent urban. D  e  spite the 
region’s lower levels of overall urbanization than much of the rest of the world, Africa now has the world’s fas  t  est 
growing cities, followed by those in South Asia and main-land East Asia and South and Middle America. In contrast, the cities of North America, southern South America, and Australia are growing more slowly, and those of western Europe are barely growing at all.  
  The imprint of European colonialism can still be seen 
in many African cities. During colonialism, Europeans  Figure 9.24

 How Are Cities Organized, and How Do They Function?  313
Field Note
“February 1, 2003. A long-held hope came true today: 
thanks to a Brazilian intermediary I was allowed to enter and spend a day in two of Rio de Janeiro’s hillslope fave-
las, an eight-hour walk through one into the other. Here live millions of the city’s poor, in areas often ruled by drug lords and their gangs, with minimal or no public services, amid squalor and stench, in discomfort and danger. And yet life in the older favelas has become more comfort-able as shacks are replaced by more permanent structures, electricity is sometimes available, water supply, however haphazard, is improved, and an informal economy brings goods and services to the residents. I stood in the doorway of a resident’s single-room dwelling for this overview of an urban landscape in transition: satellite-television disks symbolize the change going on here. The often blue cis-terns catch rainwater; walls are made of rough brick and roofs of corrugated iron or asbestos sheeting. No roads or automobile access, so people walk to the nearest road at the bottom of the hill. Locals told me of their hope that they will some day have legal rights to the space they occupy. During his campaign for president of Brazil, former president Lula de Silva suggested that long-term inhabitants should be awarded title, and in 2003 his government approved the notion. It will be complicated: as the photo shows, people live quite literally on top of one another, and mapping the chaos will not be simple (but will be made possible with geographic information systems). This would allow the government to tax residents, but it would also allow residents to obtain loans based on the value of their favela properties, and bring millions of Brazil-ians into the formal economy. The hardships I saw on this excursion were often dreadful, but you could sense the hope for and anticipation of a better future. In 2007, Lula da Silva’s government pledged $3.6 billion to bring water, sewage, roads, an d 
improved housing to the 20 percent of the city of Rio de Janeiro who live in the favelas.”

Congo), Nairobi (Kenya), and Harare (Zimbabwe) in the interior, and Dakar (Senegal), Abidjan (Ivory Coast), Luanda (Angola), Maputo (Mozambique), and other ports   along the coast. Africa even has cities that are neither tra-

American models and a veneer of globalization including 
high-rise CBDs and sprawling upper-income suburbs.  
  As a result of this diversity, it is difﬁ  cult to formulate a 
model African city. Studies of African cities indicate that the 
central city often consists of not one but three CBDs (Fig. 9.26): a remnant of the colonial CBD, an informal and some-times periodic market zone, and a transitional business cen-ter where commerce is co  n  ducted from curbside, stalls, or 
storefronts. Vertical development occurs mainly in the for-

Model of the Large Southeast Asian City. A model of land

McGee, The Southeast Asian City, London: Bell, 1967, p. 128.a zone of single-story buildings with some traditional archi-
tecture; and the market zone tends to be open-air, informal, yet still important. Sector development marks the enci  r  cl-
ing zone of ethnic and mixed neighborhoods (often char-
acterized by strong ethnic identities as people of ethnic kin tend to cluster together). Since many African cities began as mining towns, such oper  a  tions still occur in conjunction 
with this zone in some instances. Manufacturing companies, 
originally founded near the labor force concentrated in this zone still function here. Invariably, fast-growing African cit-ies   are enci  r  cled by vast shantytowns rapidly growing as a 
result of vi  r  tually unchecked in-migration.  
  The Southeast Asian City  
  Some of the most populated cities in the world are in 
Southeast Asia. The city of Kuala Lu  m  pur, Malaysia, 
is a complex of high-rise development, including the 1483-foot-tall Petronas T owers, which until recently was the world’s tallest building. The city of Jakarta, Indonesia, called Jabotabek by the locals, is an eno  r  mous conurb  a-
  tion of Bogor, T angerang, and Bekasi.  
  In 1967, urban geographer T . G. McGee studied the 
medium-sized cities of Southeast Asia and found that they 
exhibit similar land-use patterns, creating a model referred to as the McGee model (Fig. 9.27). The f  o  cal point of the 
city is the old colonial port zone combined with the largely 
commercial district that su  r  rounds it. McGee found no 
formal central business district; rather, he found the ele-
ments of the CBD present as sep  a  rate clusters surround-
ing the old colonial port zone: the government zone; the 
Western commercial zone (practically a CBD by itself); the alien commercial zone, dominated by Chinese merchants whose res  i  dences are attached to their places of business; 
and the mixed land-use zone that contains miscellaneous 
ec  o  nomic activities, including light industry. The other 
nonresidential areas are the market-gardening zone at the 
outskirts of the u  r  ban area and, still farther from the city, a 
recently built industrial park or “estate.”  
  The residential zones in McGee’s model are similar 
to those in the Grifﬁ  n-Ford model of the   South   American 
city. Other similarities between the McGee and Grifﬁ  n-
Ford model are the hybrid structure of sectors and zones, 
an elite residential sector that includes new suburbs, an inner-city zone of middle-income hou  s  ing, and peripheral 
low-income squatter settlements. One main difference is that the McGee model includes middle-income hous-ing in a suburban zone, reﬂ  ecting the larger middle class in these cities of the global semiperip  h  ery and the small 
middle class in   South   American cities.  
  Regardless of the region or city, we recognize that 
models do not explain how or why cities are organized the 
way they are. A model of a city shows us an end product, whether planned or not and suggests the forces that cre-ated that end product.  
  Employing the concepts deﬁ  ned in this section of the chap-
ter, draw a model of the city with which you are most famil-iar. Label each section of the city accordingly. After read-ing through the models described in this section, determine which model best corresponds to the model you drew and hypothesize as to why it is so.  
  HOW DO PEOPLE SHAPE CITIES?  
  People and institutions make places, and the city 
is no exception to this rule. The roles individual people, 
go  v  ernments, corporations, developers, ﬁ  nancial lend-
ers, and realtors play in shaping cities varies across the world. Government planning agencies can directly affect the layout of cities by restricting the kinds of d  e  velopment 
allowed in certain regions or zones of cities.  
  Through   zoning     laws  , cities deﬁ  ne areas of the city 
and designate the kinds of development allowed in each c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 314  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 314  9/19/11  11:15 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

zone. For example, Portland, Oregon, is often described 
as the best planned city in North America because it is built around free transportation in the central city to dis-courage the use of cars. Portland is a co  m  pact city with 
ofﬁ ce buildings and residential zones in close proximity 
to encourage walking, biking, and public transpo  r  tation. 
On the other hand, Houston, T exas, is the only large city that does not have zoning laws on the books. Houstonites voted against the creation of zoning laws three different times (most recently in 1993).  
  In addition to government planning and zoning 
laws, people shape cities by choosing to live in certain 
neighborhoods and by opening stores, houses of worship, and even sporting ﬁ  elds that reﬂ  ect the values of their cul-ture. If you wander through neighborhoods of any city and pay close attention, you can see diffe  r  ences in   the 
existence of single-family or multifamily homes, in par-ticular styles of construction and buil  d  ing materials, in the 
distance between houses, in the nature and style of vegeta-tion around houses, in the di  s  tance between the houses 
and the streets, and even in the amount of space devoted to autom  o  bile movement and storage.  
  Comparing and contrasting the urban cultural 
landscapes of two cities helps us understand the different 
s  o  cial and cultural forces at play. Compare Figure 9.28

Manila, the Philippines
I passed through cargo shipping piers in Manila, 
the Philippines, and encountered row after row of hand-built squatter houses. I was struck by the scale of the settlements and the sheer number of people who inhabit them. I was shocked at the level of squalor in people’s living conditions. The garbage scavengers in this picture wore cotton gloves and held prods to dig through the trash for items they can use, trade, or sell. The poor and destitute live throughout the city because housing stocks are inadequate, underlying pov-erty persists, and thousands ﬂ  ock to Manila daily recognizing that petty services and even trash picking often offer more opportunity than life in the rural provinces.

city is located in a wealthy country in the world and which is l  o  cated in a poor country. What factors can 
you consider? Y ou may look at the presence or absence 
of high-rise buildings, the aesthetics of the buildings, the transportation, and the distance between houses, and after doing so, you may guess that Fi  g  ure 9.28 is 
in the wealthy country. Look again. This time, look 
for whether there are     telephone and electrical wires, 
and at the building materials used. Figure 9.28 is actu-
ally in a poorer cou  n  try; it is the city of Lomé, T ogo 
in Subsaharan Africa. Figure 9.29 is part of a suburb 
of T okyo, Japan. Jap  a  nese houses in this middle-class 
neighborhood are on top of each other because the city is 
so densely populated that land is at a premium. In Lomé, the high rises are part of the central business district, and they and the houses immediately surrounding them are where the wealthy live. The houses in the for  e  ground are 
where the poor live. Here the roofs are tin or cardboard, 
the houses are makeshift, and utility lines are lacking. Notice that in this picture of Lomé, we see no evidence of a middle class; this is common in cities of the per  i  ph-
ery where there are the “haves” and the “have-nots” and 
little in between.    Shaping Cities in the Global Periphery 
and Semiperiphery  
  Many of the world’s most populous cities are located in 
the less prosperous parts of the world, including São Paulo (Brazil), Mexico City (Mexico), Mumbai (India), Dhaka (Bangladesh), and Delhi (India). Across the world, people continue to migrate to cities in response to “pull” fa  c  tors 
that are often more imaginary than real; their expecta-tions of a better life mostly fail to m  a  terialize.  
  Particularly in the economic periphery, new arrivals 
(and many long-term residents, too) are crowded t  o  gether 
in overpopulated apartment buildings, dismal tenements, 
and teeming slums (Fig. 9.30). New arrivals come from other cities and towns and from the rural countryside, often as large families; they add to the ci  t  ies’ rate of nat-
ural growth. Housing cannot keep up with this massive inﬂ ow. Almost overnight huge   sha  n  tytowns   developed 
around these cities. The overcrowding and dismal con-ditions do not deter additional u  r  ban migration, and as a 
result millions of people spend their entire lives in urban housing of wretched qua  l  ity.

© Erin H. Fouberg.  Cities in poorer parts of the world generally lack 
enforceable   zoning laws.   Without zoning laws, cities in 
the periphery have mixed land use throughout the city. For 
example, in cities such as Madras, India (and in other cities in India), open space between high-rise buildings is often occupied by squatter settlements (Fig. 9.31). In Bangkok, Thailand, elementary schools and noisy, polluting facto-ries stand side by side. In Na  i  robi, Kenya, hillside villas 
overlook some of Africa’s worst slums. Over time, such 
incongruities may disa  p  pear, as is ha  p  pening in many cit-
ies in East Asia. Rising land values and greater demand for 
enforced zoning regulations are transforming the central cities of East Asia. But in South Asia, Subsaharan Africa, Southwest Asia, North A  f  rica, and Middle and South 
America, unregulated, helter-skelter growth continues.  
  Across the global periphery, the one trait all major 
cities display is the stark contrast between the wealthy and 
poor. Sharp contrasts between wealthy and poor areas can be found in major cities all over the world—for example, homeless people sleeping on heating grates half a block from the White House in Washington, D.C. Y et the inten-sity and scale of the contrast are greater in cities of the periphery. If you stand in the ce  n  tral area of Cairo, Egypt, 
you see what appears to be a modern, Mediterranean 
metropolis (Fig. 9.32). But if you get on a bus and ride it toward the city’s outskirts, that impression fades almost immediately as paved streets give way to dusty alleys, apartment buildings to harsh tenements, and sidewalk cof-fee shops to br  o  ken doors and windows (Fig. 9.33). T rafﬁ  c-
choked, garbage-strewn, polluted Cairo is home to an esti-
mated 12.5 million people, more than one-ﬁ  fth of Egypt’s 
population; the city is bursting at the seams. And still people continue to arrive, seeking the better life that pulls countless m  i  grants from the countryside year after year.  
  Shaping Cities in the Global Core  
  The goals people have in making cities have changed 
over time. One way people make cities is by remaking them, reinventing neighborhoods, or changing layouts to reﬂ ect current goals and aesthetics. During the se  g  rega-
tion era in the United States, realtors, ﬁ  nancial lenders, 
and city governments deﬁ  ned and segregated spaces in 
urban environments. For example, before the civil rights movement of the 1960s, ﬁ  nancial instit  u  tions in the busi-
ness of lending money could engage in a practice known as redlining. They would identify what they co  n  sidered 
to be risky neighborhoods in cities—often predominately black neighborhoods—and refuse to offer loans to anyone purchasing a house in the neighborhood encircled by red lines on their maps. This practice, which is now illegal, worked against those living in poorer neighborhoods and helped to pr  e  cipitate a downward spiral in which poor neighborhoods became increasingly rundown because funds were not available for upkeep or to purchase homes for sale.  
  Before the civil rights movement, realtors could pur-
posefully sell a house in a white neig  h  borhood at a very low 
price to a black buyer. In a practice called blockbusting,  
realtors would solicit white residents of the neig  h  borhood 
to sell their homes under the guise that the neighborhood 
was going downhill because a black person or family had moved in. This produced what urban geographers 
and sociologists call white ﬂ  ight—movement of whites 
from the city and adjacent neighborhoods to the outly-ing suburbs. Blockbusting led to signiﬁ  cant tur  n  over 
in housing, which of course beneﬁ  ted real estate agents 
through the commissions they earned as representatives 
of buyers and sellers. Blockbusting also prompted land-owners to sell their prope  r  ties at low prices to get out of 
the neighborhood quickly, which in turn allowed devel-opers to subdivide lots and build tenements. T yp  i  cally, 
developers did not maintain tenements well, dropping the property values even further.  
  Developers and governments are also important 
actors in shaping cities. In cities of the global core that 
have experienced high levels of suburbanization, people have left the central business district for the suburbs for a number of reasons, among them single-family homes, yards, better schools, and safety. With suburbaniz  a  tion, 
city governments lose tax revenue, as middle- and upper-class taxpayers leave the city and pay taxes in the suburbs instead. In order to counter the suburbanization trend, c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 317  10/17/11  6:55 AM user f-400c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 317  10/17/11  6:55 AM user f-400 F-400F-400

“Moving out from central Cairo, evidence of the 
city’s rapid growth is all around you. These hast-ily built housing units are part of the (often los-ing) effort to keep up with the city’s exploding growth. From a city of just one million people in 1930, Cairo’s population expanded to six mil-lion by 1986. And then high growth rates really kicked in. Although no one knows the exact size of the contemporary city, most estimates sug-gest that Cairo’s population has doubled in the last 20 years. This growth has placed a tremen-dous strain on city services. Housing has been a particularly critical problem—leading to a land-scape outside the urban core dominated by hast-ily built, minimally functional, and aesthetically non-descript housing projects.”

“Central Cairo is full of the multistory buildings, transportation arteries, and commercial signs that characterize most contemporary big cities. Outside of a number of mosques, few remnants of the old medieval city remain. The ﬁ  rst blow 
came in the nineteenth century, when a French-educated ruler was determined to recast Cairo as a world-class city. Inspired by the planning ideas of Paris’s Baron von Hausman, he transformed the urban core into a zone of broad, straight streets. In more recent years the forces of modern inter-national capitalism have had the upper hand. There is little sense of an overall vision for cen-tral Cairo. Instead, it seems to be a hodge-podge of buildings and streets devoted to commerce, administration, and a variety of producer and consumer services.”
city governments are encouraging co  m  mercialization of 
the central business district and gentriﬁ  cation of neigh-
borhoods in and around the central bus  i  ness district.  
  The plans that city governments draft to revive cen-
tral cities usually involve cleaning streets, sidewalks, and 
buildings; tearing down old, abandoned buildings; and building up commercial offerings and residences. City 
governments have often created programs to encourage commercialization   of central business di  s  tricts  , which 
entails transforming the central business district into an 
area attractive to residents and tourists alike.

“In 2008, downtown Fort Worth, Texas looked quite different than 
it did when I ﬁ  rst visited in 1997. In that eleven year period, business leaders in the City of Fort Worth gentriﬁ  ed the downtown. The Bass family, who has a great deal of wealth from oil holdings and who now owns about 40 blocks of downtown Fort Worth, was instrumental in the city’s gentriﬁ  cation. In the 1970s and 1980s, members of the Bass family looked at the empty, stark, downtown Fort Worth, and sought a way to revitalize the downtown. They worked with the Tandy fam-ily to build and revitalize the spaces of the city, which took off in the late 1990s and into the present century. The crown jewel in 
the gentriﬁ  ed Fort Worth is the beautiful cultural center called the 
Bass Performance Hall, named for Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass, which opened in 1998.”

waterfront “theme” areas to attract vi  s  itors. These areas 
include festival marketplaces, parks with exotic sculptures 
and play areas, and amusement zones occupying former industrial sites. Cities including Detroit and Minneapolis commercialize their central business districts by building or using tax incentives to attract professional sports stadiums to the central bus  i  ness district. Ventures have been success-
ful in attracting tourists and in generating business, but they 
alone ca  n  not revive downtowns because they cannot attract 
what the core of the city needs most: permanent residents 
with a stake in its future. The newly commercialized down-towns often stand apart from the rest of the ce  n  tral city.  
  Beginning in the 1960s, central-city neighborhoods 
located conveniently close to central business districts, but 
run down as a result of out-migration of residents, began to attract buyers who were willing to move back into the city to rehabilitate run-down houses and live in central-city neighborhoods. A process called   gentriﬁ  c  a  tion—  the 
rehabilitation of houses in older neighborhoods—took 
hold in the central-city neighborhoods of many cities.  
  In the United States, g  entriﬁ  cation began in cit-
ies with a tight housing market and deﬁ  ned central-city neighborhoods, including San Francisco, Portland, and 
Chicago. Gentriﬁ  cation slowed in the 1990s but is grow-
ing again, as city governments are encouraging gentriﬁ  ca-
tion through beautiﬁ  cation programs and si  g  niﬁ cant tax 
breaks to people who buy up abandoned or dilapidated 
housing. The growing interest in central-city housing has resulted in part from the changing character of American society: the proportion of childless couples (heterosexual and homosexual) is growing, as is the number of single people in the population. Chil  d  less couples and singles 
often choose to live in cities because the suburbs do not 
look as attractive as they typ  i  cally do to families with young 
children. Gentriﬁ  ed central-city neighborhoods attract 
residents who want to live within walking distance of their workplace and close to cultural, entertainment, and r  e  c-
reational amenities, nightlife, and restaurants (Fig. 9.34).  
  One consequence of gentriﬁ  cation is increased hous-
ing prices in central-city neighborhoods. In many cities, 
gentriﬁ  cation has displaced lower income residents because 
property taxes rise as land values rise and the costs of goods and services in the neighborhood, from parking to restau-rants, rises as well. For urbanites di  s  placed by gentriﬁ  ca-c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 319  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 319  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

tion, the consequences can be s  e  rious. Rising housing costs 
associated with gentriﬁ  cation have played a key role in the 
growing problem of homeles  s  ness in American cities.  
  The suburb is not immune to gentriﬁ  cation. In sub-
urbs that are close to the city or directly connected by 
commuter rail, people purchase smaller or older homes with the intention of tearing the house down and buil  d-
  ing a much larger home. The homes intended for sub-
urban demolition are called teardowns. In their place, suburbanites build newer homes that often are super-sized and stretch to the outer limits of the lot. New man-sions that are supersize and have a sim  i  lar look are called 
  McMansions   (Fig. 9.35).  
  Like gentriﬁ  cation in the city, the teardown phe-
nomenon changes the landscape and increases average 
hou  s  ing values, tax revenue for the city, and the average 
household income of the neighborhood. Unlike gentriﬁ    -
  cation, with teardowns, the original houses are destroyed 
instead of preserved. Also unlike gentriﬁ  cation, teardowns 
often occur in middle-class and wealthy suburbs, includ-ing Greenwich, Connecticut, and Hin  s  dale, Ill  i  nois.  
  Greenwich, a high-end neighborhood in Fairﬁ  eld 
County, Connecticut, just outside of New Y ork City. 
i  s  sued 138 permits for teardowns in 2004 (56 more than it 
did the year before). The collapse of the housing ma  r  ket 
brought a decline in the number of teardowns in Fairﬁ  eld 
County starting in 2007, but in May 2010 the   Wall Street 
Journal   reported that teardown permits had begun ris-
ing again in Fai  r  ﬁ eld County. The rise in permits was 
not in Greenwich, however. According to the   Wall Street 
Journal  , “  The most expensive corners of Fairﬁ  eld County, including Greenwich, haven’t seen much of a pickup in 
teardowns, local brokers say. A surplus of homes priced at more than $2 million, and difﬁ  culties in getting ﬁ  nancing 
for these purchases, has kept that activity to a minimum.”  
  In Hinsdale ( just outside Chicago), one-third of the 
suburb’s houses have been torn down since 1986. Those in 
favor of teardowns argue that the phenomenon slows urban sprawl by r  e  placing existing homes with new homes, rather 
than converting farmland to residential lots. Those opposed 
to teardowns see the houses as too large for their lots, dwarf-ing the neighboring houses, and destroying the character of the street by demolis  h  ing the older homes on it.  
  Urban Sprawl and New Urbanism  
  As populations have grown in certain areas of the United 
States, such as the Sun Belt and the West, urban a  r  eas 
have experienced urban sprawl—unrestricted growth of 
housing, commercial developments, and roads over large expanses of land, with little concern for urban planning. Urban sprawl is easy to spot as you drive down major road-ways in any urbanized part of the country. Y ou will see strip malls, big box stores, chain re  s  ta  u  rants, huge intersections, 
and numerous housing developments, all spread out over 
many acres (Fig. 9.36). Sprawl is a phenomenon of the automobile era. Cities that grew before the automobile typically grew “up” instead of “out.” For instance, Boston grew around the marketplace and port, but it grew before the autom  o  bile, resulting in development over smaller 
areas. If you walk through the central city of Boston t  o  day,

you can walk where you need to go or take the T (metro). 
Places are built up vertically, and curving, narrow streets and commercial developments with a ﬂ  avor of the old city 
(Quincy Market) give the city a cozy, int  i  mate feel.  
  Does population growth explain which cities expe-
rience the most urban sprawl? In a study of sprawl from 
1960 through the 1990s, Leon Kolankiewicz and Roy Beck (two antisprawl writers) used United States Ce  n  sus data on 
urbanized areas and found that urban sprawl happened even 
in urban areas without signiﬁ  cant population growth. In the United States, urban sprawl is more rampant in the Sun Belt of the South (A  t  lanta) and in the West (Houston) in 
urban areas whose population is rapidly growing (T able 9.1). 
Y et, even in ci  t  ies such as D  e  troit and Pittsburgh, where 
urban populations fell during the study period—by 7 per-
cent in Detroit and 9 percent in Pittsburgh—urban sprawl increased the urbanized areas of the cities by 28 percent and 30 percent, respe  c  tively. For urban sprawl to happen, farm-
lands and old industrial sites are razed, and roads are built or 
w  i  dened, strip malls are erected, and housing developments 
monopolize the horizon.  
  T o counter urban sprawl, a group of architects, urban 
planners, and developers (now numbering over 2000 in 
more than 20 countries) outlined an urban design vision they call new urbanism. Forming the Congress for the New Urbanism in 1993, the group deﬁ  nes new urban-
ism as development, urban revitalization, and subu  r  ban 
reforms that create walkable neighborhoods with a diver-
sity of housing and jobs. On their website, the Congress for the New Urbanism explains that “New Urbanists support regional planning for open space, appr  o  priate architecture 
and planning, and the balanced development of jobs and 
housing. They believe these strategies are the best way to reduce how long people spend in trafﬁ  c, to increase the 
supply of affor  d  able housing, and to rein in urban sprawl.” New urbanists want to create neighborhoods that promote 
a sense of community and a sense of place.  
  The most famous new urbanist projects are cit-
ies that new urbanists designed from the ground up, 
including Seaside, Florida (featured in the movie The 
Truman Show), West Laguna, California, and Kentlands, Mar  y  land. When new urbanists build a town, the design 
is remini  s  cent of Christaller over a much smaller area. 
The planners choose the central shopping areas and open spaces and develop the neighborhoods around them, with housing clustered around the central space, so that people can walk to the shopping area within ﬁ  ve minutes. One 
goal of new urbanist designs is to build housing more densely, to take up less space. Along with that, ma  k  ing 
shopping and other amenities walkable decreases depen-dency on the automobile, in the process helping the envi-ronment.  
  Although some see new urbanist designs as manu-
factured communities and feel disconnected in a new 
urba  n  ist space, others see these designs as superior to 
sprawl. Celebration, Florida, is a remarkable new urban-ist space: it is adjacent to Walt Disney’s theme parks, was envisioned by Walt Disney himself, and is owned by the Disney Company (Fig. 9.37). Built in 1994, Celebration is centered on Market Street, a shopping district with res-taurants (including a 1950s-style diner and a pizza place), a town hall, banks, a post ofﬁ  ce, and a movie theater with a nostalgic marquee (Fig. 9.38). The town includes schools, a health center, a ﬁ  tness ce  n  ter, and churches. The Disney 
Company chose certain architectural styles for the houses in Celebration, and builders offer homes and townhouses in a price range from $300,000 to over $1 million. T o meet the new u  r  banist goal of incorpora  t  ing diverse people in a 
community, Celebration includes apartments for rent and condominiums for sale.

322 Chapter 9  Urban Geography
  For geographers, new urbanism is seen as a redeﬁ  ni-
tion of space in the city. Public spaces become privatized 
for the enjoyment of the few (the residents of the neigh-borhood). Geograp  h  ers Stuart Aitken, Don Mitchell, and 
Lynn Staeheli note that as new urbanism strives to turn 
neighborhoods back in time, “spaces and social fun  c  tions 
historically deemed public (such as parks, neighborhood 
centers, shopping districts)” are privatized. The houses with porches that encourage neighbors to talk and the parks that are within walking distance for the res  i  dents cre-
ate “mythic landscapes that are ingratiating for those who 
can afford them and exclusionary for those who cannot.”  
  Noted geographer David Harvey offers one of the 
strongest critiques of new urbanism, explaining ﬁ  rst 
that most new urbanist designs are “greenﬁ  eld” projects 
designed for the afﬂ  uent to make the suburbs more liv-
able. This fact is evidence, Harvey argues, that the new 
urbanism movement is a kind of “spatial determinism” that does not recognize that “the fundamental difﬁ  culty 
with modernism was its persistent habit of privileging spatial forms over social processes.” Harvey, and others who critique new urbanism, claim that new urbanism does nothing to break down the social conditions that privilege some while disadvantaging others; that new urbanist proj-ects take away much of the grittiness and character of the city; and that the “communities” that new urba  n  ists form 
through their projects are exclusionary communities that deepen the racial s  e  gregation of cities.  
  Despite the critiques against new urbanism, devel-
opments in the new urbanist tradition are attracting a 
gro  w  ing number of people, and when they are situated 
within cities, they can work against urban sprawl.  
  Gated Communities  
  As you drive through urban spaces, suburban and central 
city alike, you will note more and more neighbo  r  hoods 
being developed or redesigned to align with new urban-ist principles. In your inventory of landscapes, even more overwhelming will be the proliferation of gated commu-nities. Gated communities are fenced-in neighborhoods TABLE 9.1

Field Note
“When I visited Celebration, Florida in 1997, I 
felt like I was walking onto a movie or televi-sion set. The architecture in the Walt Disney-designed new urbanist development looked like the quintessential New England town. Each house has a porch, but on the day I was there, the porches sat empty—waiting to wel-come the arrival of their owners at the end of the work day. We walked through town, past the 50s-style movie marquee, and ate lunch at a 50s-style diner. At that point, Celebration was still growing. Across the street from the ‘Bank of Celebration’ stood a sign marking the future home of the ‘Church in Celebration.’”

with controlled access gates for people and automobiles. 
Often, gated communities have s  e  curity cameras and 
security forces (privatized police) keeping watch over the community, as the main obje  c  tive of a gated community 
is to create a space of safety within the uncertain urban world. A secondary obje  c  tive is to maintain or i  n  crease 
housing values in the neighborhood through enforcement of the neighborhood associ  a  tion’s bylaws that control 
everything from the color of a house to the character and size of additions.  
  During the late 1980s and early 1990s, developers in 
the United States began building gated communities in 
urban areas around the country. In a 2001 census of hous-ing, the United States government reported that 16 mil-lion people, or about 6 percent of Americans, live in gated communities. The urban design of gating communities has diffused around the globe at record speed, with gated communities in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  
  In poorer countries, where cities are divided 
between wealthy and poor, gated communities provide 
another layer of comfort for the city’s wealthy. In the large cities of Latin America and Africa, you commonly see walls around individual houses, walling in yards and pools and kee  p  ing out crime. During the last ten years, many 
neighborhoods in these cities have added gates around the neighborhoods in addition to the walls. Walled houses and gated communities in the wealthy northern suburbs of Johannesburg, South A  f  rica, are threatening the deseg-
regation of the post-Apartheid city. White, wealthy resi-dents fear crime in the city with a murder rate, along with neighboring Pretoria, of 5000 per year (in an area with about 5 million people). In response to their fear of crime, people in the suburbs of Johannesburg blocked off over 2500 streets and posted guards to control access to these streets by 2004. Many fear that the gated communities are a new form of segregation. Since the vast majority of the crimes in the city occur in poor black tow  n  ships or 
in the central city, the concern is that these developments only worsen the plight of less well-off segments of soc  i  ety.  
  In China, gated communities have taken off, now 
crossing socioeconomic classes and creating a ubiquitous 
fe  a  ture on the urban landscape (Fig. 9.39). Like the gated 
communities in Europe and North America, the gated communities of China privatize spaces and exclude out-siders with gates, security cameras, and restricted access. Ho  w  ever, the gated communities in China are ﬁ  ve to ten 
times more densely populated than gated communities in Europe and North America. Geographer Y ouqin Huang has found other differences between gated commun  i  ties 
in China and those in North America and Europe. China has a long history of gated communities, dating back to the ﬁ rst Ch  i  nese cities and persisting since. Huang argues 
that the “collectivism-oriented culture and tight political control” in China explain why the Chinese government built gated communities during the socialist p  e  riod and 
why a proliferation of gated communities has occurred by private developers since China’s housing r  e  form in 1998 
promoted ind  i  vidual home ownership.

 How Do People Shape Cities? 325
  In Europe and North America, gated communities 
are not only for the wealthy and privileged. Especially since 
September 11, people have a growing desire to feel safe at home, and this is just as true of middle and lower classes as it is of the rich. Some urban planners have encouraged govern-ments to recast low-income housing as small communities, gated from each other, in order to reduce the ﬂ  owthrough 
trafﬁ c and crime associated with it. Cities have torn down 
the enormous high rises, typically ridden with crime and referred to as “the projects” such as C  a  brini Green in 
Chicago and Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis, in an effort to remake 
the spaces of the poor into “defensible” spaces (Fig. 9.40).  
  Urban planners want to gate middle-income and 
low-income neighborhoods in order to create a sense of 
community and to make the spaces “defensible” from undesired activities such as drug dealing and prostit  u  tion. 
One of the best-documented cases of gating a middle-
income community is the Five Oaks district of Dayton, Ohio, a neighborhood that is about 50 percent African American and 50 percent white and has a high rate of rent-als. Urban planner Oscar Newman encouraged planners in Dayton to divide the 2000 hous  e  holds in the Five Oaks 
district into ten smaller, gated communities with restricted 
access. The city turned most of the reside  n  tial streets in 
each of these mini-neighborhoods into cul-de-sacs. They 
have experienced a serious reduction in crime, along with an increase in housing sales and housing values.  
  Ethnic Neighborhoods in the European City  
  Ethnic neighborhoods in European cities are typi-
cally afﬁ  liated with migrants from former colonies. For e  x  ample, Algeria was a colony of France, and now Paris 
and other French cities have distinct Algerian neighbo  r-
  hoods. Similarly, London (the United Kingdom) has a 
Jamaican neighborhood, and Madrid (Spain) has a dis-tinct Moroccan neighborhood, reﬂ  ecting their c  o  lonial 
ties with these now sovereign countries. Other European countries cultivated relationships with countries outside of Europe after the colonial era. For example, after World War II, Germany invited young men from T urkey to migrate to Germany as guest workers (see Chapter 3). Cities in Germany, such as Frankfurt, have distinct T urkish neighborhoods. Current imm  i  gration to countries in 
Europe typically focuses on the cities. And most of the migrants to European cities come from the global p  e  riph-
ery or from eastern Europe, not from other countries in western Europe.  
  Migration to Europe is constrained by government 
policies and laws. Many western European cities have 
pu  b  lic housing zones that were built after World War II 
following the devastation of the war years. Governments in Europe are typically much more involved in the social rights of people, such as health care and hou  s  ing than the 
United States government. European cities are also much older than American cities, and when the cities were laid out they were designed for foot and horse trafﬁ  c, not auto-mobiles. Thus, European cities are typ  i  cally more com-
pact, densely populated, and walkable than American cit-ies. European cities also have hi  s  toric city centers where 
much of the city’s history took place and is preserved and to which tourists are attracted t  o  day. Rather than the sky-
scrapers that are typically the focal point of downtown in American cities, a historic city center is the focal point of downtown in European cities and skyscrapers are reserved

the image of this public housing project as a failure.

for developments on the outskirts of town. Housing in the 
European city is often co  m  bined with places of work, with 
work spaces on the bottom ﬂ  oors of buildings and hous-
ing above. Large zones of housing in Europe typically begin in a ring around the outside of the city center, in what Ernest Burgess called the zone of transition. After the war, many European go  v  ernments built public hous-
ing structures in the spaces leveled by bombing around the 
city center.  
  Government Policy and Immigrant 
Accommodation  
  Immigration is changing the spatial-cultural geography 
of European cities. As immigrants have settled in large numbers in the zone of transition, locals have moved out. Walking from the city center of Paris out through immi-grant neighborhoods, one can see the cultural landscape change to reﬂ  ect the signiﬁ  cant number of i  m  migrants 
from the “Maghreb” of Africa, the region of North Africa 
around Algeria and Morocco. Maghrebis are by far the most numerous inhabitants in the tough, hardscrabble immigrant neighborhoods around Paris, where unemplo  y-
  ment is high, crime is widespread, and resentment festers.  
  Whether a public housing zone is divided into eth-
nic neighborhoods in a European city d  e  pends in large 
part on government policy. Urban geographers Christian 
Kesteloot and Cees Cortie studied housing policies and zones in Brussels, Belgium, and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. They found that Brussels has very little pub-lic housing and that immigrants live in privately owned rentals throughout the city. Kesteloot and Cortie also found that immigrant groups in Brussels who came from a distinct region of their home country (especially rural regions), such as the T urks in Brussels, tend to cluster in ethnic neighborhoods. In contrast, the r  e  searchers 
r  e  ported that immigrant groups who came from cities, 
such as the Moroccans in Brussels, chose rental units sca  t-
  tered throughout the city and therefore did not establish 
ethnic neighborhoods in Brussels.  
  Amsterdam is quite different from Brussels: 
Amsterdam has a great deal of public housing and few 
ethnic neighborhoods within the public housing units. When immigration to Amsterdam from former colonies (Indon  e  sia, Surinam) and noncolonies (Morocco and 
T urkey) increased in the 1960s, Amsterdammers moved from the transition zone of public housing to neighbor-ing towns such as Almere. The Dutch government then impl  e  mented a policy in the public housing zone that 
slowed the creation of ethnic neighborhoods. The Dutch go  v  ernment allots public hou  s  ing to legal immigrants by 
assigning homes on a sequential basis in the city’s zone of transition, where some 80 pe  r  cent of the housing stock 
is public housing. As a result of government assignment of housing, if you walk through the public housing zone of Amsterdam, you will ﬁ  nd a family from Suriname liv-
ing next to an Indonesian family and a Moroccan family, not just other Surinamese. The housing and neighbor-hoods are multicultural. The ethnic groups maintain their local cultures through religious and cultural orga-nizations rather than through residential se  g  regation. In 
Amsterdam, the call to Friday prayer for Muslims rings out all over the immigrant areas, as Muslims from various countries are spread throughout the city.  
  Ethnic Neighborhoods in the Global Periphery 
and Semiperiphery City  
  In cities of the periphery and semiperiphery, a sea of 
slum development typically begins where the perm  a-
  nent buildings end, in some cases engulﬁ  ng and dwarﬁ  ng 
the central city. If you stand on a hill outside Lima (Peru) 
or overlooking the Cape Flats near Cape T own (South Africa), you see an unchanging panorama of makeshift shacks built of every conceivable material, vying for every foot of space, extending to the hor  i  zon. Y ou will 
n  o  tice few, if any, trees, and you will see narrow foot-
paths leading to a few unpaved streets that go into the 
central city.  
  Millions of migrants travel to such ominous envi-
ronments every year. The total number of people living 
in these types of slum developments is uncertain because government control is impossible and enumeration i  m  practical. In Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), the migrants build 
their dwellings on dangerous, landslide-prone slopes; in Port Moresby (Papua New Guinea), the migrants sink stilts in the mud and build out over the w  a  ter, risking wind 
and waves. In Calcutta (India), thousands of migrants do not even try to erect shelters: there and in many other cit-ies they live in the streets, under bridges, even in storm drains. City governments do not have the r  e  sources to 
adequately educate, medicate, or police the burgeoning populations, let alone to provide even min  i  mal housing 
for most.  
  Even the people living in the squalid conditions of 
shanty settlements are not really squatters—they pay rent. 
When the settlements expand outward from the central city, they occupy land owned by previous residents, fami-lies who farmed what were once the rural areas beyond the city’s edge. Some of the farming fam  i  lies were favored 
by the former colonial administration; they moved into the cities but continued to own the lands their farms were on. As shanty deve  l  opments encroached on their lands, 
the landowners began to charge people rent for living on the dilapidated housing the new residents built on the land. 
After establishing an owner-tenant relationship, the land-owners steadily raise rents, threatening to destroy the ﬂ imsy shacks if residents fail to pay. In this way, powerful c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 326  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 326  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Do People Shape Cities? 327
long-term inhabitants of the city exploit the weaker, more 
recent arr  i  vals.  
  The vast slums of cities in poorer parts of the world 
are typically ethnically delineated, with new arrivals pre-
car  i  ously accommodated. For example, Nairobi, Kenya, 
has a large slum area, one of the worst in Subsaharan Africa in terms of amenities, called Kibera. Much of the land where Kibera is located is owned by Nubians, who are of Sudanese descent. The Sudanese Nubians settled in the area of Kibera during the colonial era. Many of the Nub  i  ans have become businesspeople in the city of 
Nairobi. The modern tenants of the shanty settlements 
in Kibera are largely Luo from western Kenya and Luhya from northwestern Kenya. During the fall of 2001, some of the Kiberian tenants were unable to pay the latest increase in rents. The Nubian landowners came to evict them, and in the ﬁ  gh  t  ing that followed, a number of 
people were killed. Groups of Luo, Luhya, and others 
even took to ﬁ  ghting among themselves. The government 
intervened to stabilize the situation. The latest rent increases   were withdrawn, but the fu  n  damental problems—
crowding, unemployment, unsanitary conditions, hunger, 
and lack of education—remain, and the ethnic groups 
living in the neighborhoods of Kibera will likely experi-ence ﬁ  ghting again.  
  Power and Ethnicity  
  Geography plays a major role in the relationships among 
ethnic components of a former colonial city. The se  t  tle-
ment patterns of cities developed during the colonial period often persist long after. In a study of the city of Mombasa, Kenya, during the 1960s, H. J. de Blij found that the central city, in effect the island on which Mo  m  basa 
was built, was informally partitioned among m  a  jor ethnic 
groups. Apart from the Swahili who occupied the Old T own and adjacent historic po  r  tions of the built-up area, 
the spatial pattern of occupance by ethnic groups in the city of Mombasa mirrored the status of the ethnic groups in the country of Kenya as a whole. The port of Mombasa, the country’s largest, was the city’s major employer. The Kikuyu, whose historic homeland lies far away from Mombasa to the north of Nairobi, were privileged by the British during colonial times. B  e  cause of their important 
position during colonialism, Kikuyu workers and their families living in Mombasa r  e  sided closest to the port and 
to the center of economic power. Although the most pow-erful workers lived closest to the central commercial dis-trict, the Asians (often from India and thus referred to as Indians in Mombasa) who controlled the city’s commerce were concentrated on the opposite side of the island, away from the port. A  n  other powerful ethnic group, the 
Kamba, occupied a zone farther outward from the port. The Mijikenda, a less powerful African ethnic group, migrated from off-island villages to work in Mombasa and lived farther from the comme  r  cial center.  
  In recent times, as the city’s population has grown 
seven times larger than it was in the 1960s, the spatial pat-
tern of Mombasa still reﬂ  ects the power of ethnic groups. The most recent imm  i  grants, desperate for jobs, crowd 
the outer zone of the city, off of the island, and in the shanty se  t  tlements.  
  How do the many millions of urban immigrants 
living in the slum-ridden rings and pockets of the cit-
ies of the global periphery and semiperiphery survive? Extended families share and stretch every dollar they manage to earn; when one member of the family has a salaried job, his or her income saves the day for a dozen or more rel  a  tives. When a member of the family (or several 
members of a larger community) manages to emigrate to a core country or an island of development and makes good money there, part of that income is sent back home and b  e  comes the mainstay for those left behind. Hundreds 
of millions of dollars are transferred this way every year; r  e  mittances make a critical difference in the poorer coun-
tries of the world (see Chapter 3).  
  The Informal Economy  
  In the vast slums, barrios, and favelas, those who are job-
less or unsalaried are not idle. Everywhere you look peo-ple are at work, inside or in front of their modest habi-tats, ﬁ  xing things, repairing broken items for sale, sor  t  ing 
through small piles of waste for salvageable items, trading and selling goods from makeshift stands. What prevails here is referred to as the informal economy—the econ-omy that is not taxed and is not counted toward a country’s gross national income. What is generated in the informal economy can add up to a huge total in unr  e  corded mon-
etary value. The informal economy worries governments because it is essentially a recordless eco  n  omy and no taxes 
are paid. Remittances are usually delivered in cash, not via Western Union or a bank. T yp  i  cally, a trusted community 
member (who might pay a comparatively small bribe at the airport when passing through immigration) carries remi  t  tances to family members.  
  From Colonial to Global CBD  
  Even as the informal economy thrives among the millions 
in the shantytowns, the new era of globalization is making a major impact in the major cities founded or fostered by the colonial powers. In 2002, geographers Richard Grant and Jan Nijman documented this transformation in for-mer colonial port cities, including Mu  m  bai, India. In this 
city, formerly called Bombay, colonial rule produced an 
urban landscape marked by strong segregation of for-eign and local activities, commercial as well as  residential c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 327  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 327  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

(Fig. 9.41), and high levels of fun  c  tional specialization 
and concentration. Adjacent to the port area was a well-
demarcated European business di  s  trict containing for-
eign (mostly British) companies. Most economic activities 
in this European commercial area involved trade, trans-port, banking, distribution, and insurance. Zoning and building codes were strictly e  n  forced. Physically sepa-
rated from this European district were the traditional 
markets and bazaars of the so-called Native T own, a densely pop  u  lated mix of commercial and residential 
land uses.  
  In this era of globalization, a new spatially demar-
cated foreign presence has arisen. The city now has 
a global CBD at the heart of the original colonial city, housing mostly foreign corporations and multinational comp  a  nies and linked mainly to the global economy. 
The former European T own has a large presence of big dome  s  tic companies and a pronounced orientation to 
the national (Indian) economy. And the Native T own 
now has a high concentration of small domestic company headquarters and the strongest orientation to the imme-diate u  r  ban area.

 What Role Do Cities Play in Globalization? 329
  WHAT ROLE DO CITIES PLAY 
IN GLOBALIZATION?  
  Globalization, as we deﬁ  ned the term in the ﬁ  rst 
chapter, is a set of processes and outcomes that occur 
on the global scale, circumventing and leaping over state boundaries to affect the world. In the processes of globa  l  ization, cities are taking over in ways we barely 
understand. Most statistics about economic activity at the global scale are gathered and disseminated by states. Nonetheless, many of the most important processes o  c  cur 
among and between cities, not states as a whole, masking the integral role world cities play in globaliz  a  tion. World 
cities function at the global scale, beyond the reach of 
the state borders, functioning as the se  r  vice centers of the 
world economy.  
  Contending that models of cities and hierarchies 
of cities within states (such as Christaller) no longer rep-
resent what is happening with the city, T aylor and Lang maintain that the city has become “something else” than a si  m  ple CBD tied into a hierarchy of other cities within the 
state. The world city is a node in globalization, reﬂ  ecting 
pro  c  esses that have “redrawn the limits on spatial inter-
action,” according to Felsenstein, Schamp, and Shachar. A node is a place through which a  c  tion and interaction 
occur. As a node, a world city is connected to other cit-ies, and the forces sha  p  ing globalization pulse across these 
connections and through the cities.  
  Most lists of world cities provide a hierarchy of the 
most important nodes, the most important world cities, 
then the next most important, and so forth. Virtually all agree that New Y ork, London, and T okyo are the most impo  r  tant world cities, but beyond that point, the deﬁ  -
nition of what makes a world city and the list of world 
cities changes d  e  pending on the perspective of the 
researcher. Geographers Jon Beaverstock and Peter J. 
T aylor and their Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network have produced nearly 200 research papers, cha  p  ters, and books on the geography of world 
cities over the past few years. By studying which cities 
provide pr  o  ducer services (integral to the processes of 
globalization) in the areas of banking, law, advertising, 
and accoun  t  ing, these geographers have produced an 
inventory of world cities mapped in Figure 9.42. They 
delineate 10 A  l  pha, 10 Beta, and 35 Gamma world cit-
ies. The Alpha cities (London, Paris, New Y ork, T okyo, 
Chicago, Fran  k  furt, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Milan, 
and Singapore) have a global capac  i  ty to provide services 
in the world-economy.  
  World cities do not exist merely to service players in 
the global economy. Major world cities such as Lo  n  don 
and Paris are also capital cities. States concentrate devel-
opment and encourage interconnectedness b  e  tween cer-tain cities and the rest of the world. Even though Lo  n  don 
and Paris are a short distance apart, both function as world cities in part because of the role they play within their respective states: each became a magnet for economic and political activ  i  ty within its state, and then the globe.  
  Some countries such as the United States and 
Germany have two or more world cities within their state 
borders. They thus do not have a single, distinct pri-mate city. T o understand the role of cities in glob  a  lization, 
the services cities provide to places and peoples around the 
world and the interconnectedness among cities must also be co  n  sidered. Geographers are now working to uncover 
the globalized ﬂ  ows and processes occurring across world 
 ci  t  ies, bringing them closer together.  
  Cities as Spaces of Consumption  
  In addition to being nodes in globalization, cities are 
also products of globalization. Major changes in cities, such as the redevelopment of New Y ork’s Times Square and the remaking of Berlin’s Potsdamer Platz, are the result of global processes. Frank Roost has found that “the global media industry is becoming the driving force in the reshaping of cities” such as New Y ork and Berlin, turning city centers into spaces of consum  p  tion. Global 
media giants such as Time Warner, Viacom, and Walt 
Disney use cross promotion to encourage the co  n  sump-
tion of their products. It is no accident that characters 
on television sit-coms produced and aired on ABC (a television channel owned by Walt Disney) visit Disney theme parks or host Disney Princess-themed birthday parties on a given episode. These same media companies are investing heavily in urban centers in order to create entertainment spaces, places where tourists can go to consume their products. M  e  dia corporations are hel  p-
  ing transform urban centers into major entertainment 
districts (“variations on a theme park”) where items are consumed.  
  For example, in New Y ork City, government entities 
began to try to redevelop Times Square in the early 1980s. 
At that time, this area of the city was known for its neon lights, pornography movie houses, prostit  u  tion, and other 
illicit economic activities. The city sought to push these 
businesses out of Times Square and return the business district to a conglomeration of restaurants, hotels, bars, and entertainment spaces (as it had been before World War II). Over the decade of the 1980s, the city closed hundreds of small businesses in Times Square. In 1995, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani reached a deal with Michael Eisner, CEO of Walt Di  s  ney. The mayor promised to 
remove the remaining sex shops, and Eisner committed to 
renovating the New Amsterdam Theater, a focal point in Times Square (Fig. 9.43, left and right).

Disney set the new course for a  family-friendly entertain-
ment district in New Y ork. The restored New Amsterdam Theater hosts Di  s  ney musicals such as The Lion King and 
Beauty and the Beast (both based on Disney movies). The 
Times Square area is assuredly a space of consumption and a variation on a theme park: themed restaurants (Hard Rock Café, ESPN Zone), cross-promoting themed stores (Warner Brothers Store, Disney Store), and retail stores that cater to families (an enormous T oys R Us with a ferris wheel inside).  
  In 2009, New Y ork Mayor Michael Bloomberg 
closed portions of Broadway in Times Square to traf-
ﬁ c and created an urban esplanade with lawn chairs and seating to advance his goal of making the city more liv-able. New Y orkers and tourists took to the new seating and moved in with laptops in hand. Times Square and the Hi-Line Walkway in New Y ork now have bleacher-style seating as well as chairs to encourage New Y orkers to sit a spell and enjoy the city.  
  Potsdamer Platz in Berlin is also becoming a new 
space of consumption in the city center. Prior to the 
bom  b  ing of Berlin during World War II, Potsdamer 
Platz was a center of entertainment for Berlin’s middle 
class. After the war, little was left of the area. Soon, a 500-yard border zone and the Berlin Wall occupied the c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 330  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 330  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

fo  r  merly vibrant area of the city. After reuniﬁ  cation, 
the city divided Potsdamer Platz and sold the land. The 
two largest owners are the German comp  a  ny Daimler-
Benz and the Japanese company Sony. Sony built a 
huge entertainment structure called the Sony Center for cross promotion. According to Roost, much of the Daimler-Benz structure, Daimler City, is a space of consumption, with entertainment venues, restaurants, bars, and h  o  tels.  
  Although the tourist will be focused on the theme park 
atmosphere of these spaces of consumption, the renov  a-
  tions of the districts in both of these cities have also brought 
spaces of media production to the cities. Sony has placed its European headquarters in Berlin, Warner Brothers moved its ofﬁ  ces to Times Square, and new o  f  ﬁ ce towers around 
Times Square house many other media companies.  
  Thinking through the challenges to the state presented in 
Chapter 8, predict whether and under what circu  m  stances world cities could replace states as the basic and most pow-erful form of political organization in the world.  c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 331  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 331  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  The city is an ever changing cultural landscape, its layers reﬂ  ecting grand plans by gov-
ernments, impassioned pursuits by individuals, economic decisions by corporations, and 
processes of globalization. Geographers who study cities have a multitude of topics to examine. From gentriﬁ  cation to teardowns, from favelas to McMa  n  sions, from spaces of 
production to spaces of consumption, from ancient walls to gated communities, c  i  ties have 
so much in common, and yet each has its own pulse, its own feel, its own spatial structure, 
its own set of realities. The pulse of the city is undoubtedly created by the peoples and cultures who live there. For it is the people, whether working independently or as part of global institutions, who continuously create and re-create the city and its geography.  c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 333  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501c09UrbanGeography.indd Page 333  9/19/11  11:16 AM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

335  Development  10     CHAPTER
  Field Note    Geography, Trade, and Development  
  Walking down one of the major streets of Timbuktu, Mali (Fig. 10.1), I could hardly 
believe I was in the r  e  nowned intellectual, spiritual, and economic center of the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries. At that time, the place had a great reputation for wealth, which spurred the ﬁ  rst European explorations along the African coast. What survives is a relatively impoverished town of some 35,000 people providing central place fun  c  tions for the surrounding area and seeking to attract some tour-ist business based on its legendary name.  
  What happened to Timbuktu? The city’s wealth many centuries ago derived 
from its ability to control the trans-Sahara trade in gold, salt, ivory, kola nuts, and slaves. But when trade patterns shifted with the deve  l  opment of sea trade routes    Figure 10.1  
  Central Square, Timbuktu, Mali.     Sited along the Niger River on the edge of the Sahara 
Desert, Timbuktu was once a major trade center. Goods from the north carried on camels were 
traded with goods from the south brought in on boats. The development of sea trade routes in the sixteenth century allowed traders to circumvent Timbuktu. In turn, the city’s central trade role declined.

336 Chapter 10   Development
along the west coast of Africa, Timbuktu lost its strategic position and a long 
p  e  riod of decline set in.  
  Timbuktu’s story serves as a reminder that where a place is located in rela-
tion to patterns of economic d  e  velopment and exchange can be as important as, or even more important than, the commodities found in that place. Indeed, there are many examples of places where the presence of a valuable commod-ity does not translate into improved economic lives for those living nearby. The people working on the oil booms in G  a  bon or Nigeria or workers chopping down rare hardwood trees in Thailand or Malaysia, for example, are not the ones who beneﬁ  t from most of the wealth associated with demand for the goods they help 
produce. I  n  stead, international corporations or the wealthiest families in a place, those who own the industry, are the principal beneﬁ  c  i  aries.  
  To understand how the production of a good creates wealth for some and 
not for others, we must understand the concept of a commodity chain and the role of places in the chain of production. A   commodity chain   is a series of 
links connecting the many places of production and distribution and result-ing in a commodity that is then e  x  changed on the market. The generation of wealth differs along the commodity chain. Each link along the chain adds a certain value to the commodity, producing differing levels of wealth for the place and the pe  o  ple where production o  c  curs.  
  What Timbuktu had to offer was the ability to coordinate and facilitate trade 
based on its ge  o  graphic site where the Niger River turned north at the edge of the Sahara Desert. The river was the last major water source for those crossing the S  a  hara from south to north across what is now Mali and Algeria. Timbuktu was a break-of-bulk location, where goods traded on one mode of transport, camel, were transported to another mode of transport, boat. The commodity chain the production of a good follows and the points along the chain where materials and goods are traded changes over time, directly impacting the economic situation of places.    
  Places along a commodity chain do not all beneﬁ  t equally from the production 
of a good. The generation of wealth depends on how production occurs at each step. In Chapter 8 we introduced the concepts of core and periphery. Sophist  i  cated 
technology, high skill lev els, extensive research and development, and high sala-
ries tend to be assoc  i  ated with the segment of global commodity chains located in the core. The segments located in the perip  h  ery, by contrast, tend to be associ-ated with low technology, less education, little research and development, and lower wages.     
  The concept of development is both about being nodes along commod-
ity chains and also about transforming peripheral processes into core ones, or red  i  recting the proﬁ  t generated through core processes to improve the periph-
ery. As the twenty-ﬁ  rst century unfolds, coun  t  less governments, academics, nongovernmental organizations, and international ﬁ  nancial institutions offer ideas about how to lift up the poorer parts of the world. The theories, meth-ods, and recommendations vary, but they all focus on the illusive concept of develo  p  ment.  
  In this chapter, we review how development is deﬁ  ned and measured and 
some of the theories of develo  p  ment. We also examine how geography affects development, considering the structures of the world eco  n  omy. We look at the geographical barriers to and costs of development within countries, and we ask why uneven deve  l  opment occurs not just across the globe, but within states.  c10Development.indd Page 336  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 336  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Is Development Deﬁ  ned and Measured? 337
  HOW IS DEVELOPMENT DEFINED 
AND MEASURED?  
  The economic and social geography of the con-
temporary world is a patchwork of almost inconceivable 
co  n  trasts. On the simple ﬁ  elds of shifting cultivators in 
equatorial American and African forests, farmers grow 
root crops using ancient methods and rudimentary tools. On the Great Plains of North America, in Ukraine, and in eastern Australia, farmers use expensive, mod-ern machines to plow the land, plant seeds, and harvest grains. T oolmakers in the villages of Papua New Guinea still fashion their implements by hand, as they did many centuries ago; whereas, factory workers in Japan or South Korea produce automobiles by the shi  p  load for distr  i  bu-
tion to markets thousands of miles away. Between these extremes, the range and variety of productive activities are virtually en  d  less.  
  These contrasts point to a major issue in understand-
ing development: wealth does not depend solely on   what 
is produced  ; it depends in large part on   how and where it is 
produced  . People can grow agricultural co  m  modities with 
rudimentary tools or with expensive combines. Is one or 
the other necessary for development to occur? The idea of development is everywhere, but rarely do we pause to ask exactly what deve  l  opment means or how we can measure 
it (Fig. 10.2).  
  Development implies progress, and in the modern 
world progress usually means improvements in techno  l-
  ogy and production, as well as improvements in the social 
and economic welfare of people. T o say a country is   devel-
oping  , then, is to say progress is being made in technol-
ogy, production, and socioeconomic well- being. Our 
modern notion of development is related to the Industrial Revolution and the idea that technology can i  m  prove the 
lot of humans. Through advances in technology, people 
can produce more food, create new pro  d  ucts, and accrue 
material wealth. But these things do not necessarily bring 
happiness (see chapter 14), social stability, or enviro  n  men-
tal sustainability, which makes development a narrow, and 
sometimes controversial, indicator of the human condition.    Gross National Income  
  Ways of measuring development ﬁ  t into three major 
areas of concern: development in economic welfare, d  e  velopment in technology and production, and devel-
opment in social welfare. Beginning with the 1960s, the 
most common way of comparing development in eco-nomic welfare was to use the index economists cr  e  ated 
to compare countries, the gross national product.   Gross 
national product (GNP)   is a measure of the total value 
of the ofﬁ  cially recorded goods and services produced 
by the citizens and corporations of a cou  n  try in a given 
year. It includes things produced both inside and out-
side the country’s territory, and it is ther  e  fore broader 
than   gross domestic product (GDP)  , which encom-
passes only goods and services produced within a coun-
try during a gi  v  en year.  
  In recent years, economists have increasingly turned 
to   gross national income (GNI)  , which calculates the 
monetary worth of what is produced within a country plus 
income received from investments ou  t  side the country 
minus income payments to other countries around the world. GNI is seen as a more accurate way of measuring a country’s wealth in the context of a global economy. In order to compare GNI across countries, economists must standardize the data. The most common way to standard-ize GNI data is to d  i  vide it by the population of the coun-
try, yielding the   per capita GNI  . In Japan the per capita 
gross n  a  tional income in U.S. dollars in 2008 was $34,600. 
In the United States it was $45,850. In Lu  x  embourg it 
was $64,400. But in India it was $2740, in Nigeria it was 
$1770, and in Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, it was $3580. This enormous range across the globe in per capita GNI reﬂ  ects the o  f  ten-searing con-
trasts b  e  tween rich and poor.  
  Although the map of per capita GNI clearly shows 
the startling contrasts between rich and poor in the world, 
the statistic has several shortcomings. GNI is a limited measure because it only includes transactions in the   formal 
economy  , the legal economy that governments tax and 
monitor. Quite a few countries have per ca  p  ita GNI of less 
than $1000 per year—a ﬁ  gure so low it seems impossible   Key Questions   For Chapter 10  
   1.   How is development deﬁ  ned and measured?  
   2 .    How does geographical situation affect development?  
   3.   What are the barriers to and the costs of development?  
   4.   How do political and economic institutions inﬂ  uence uneven development 
within states?  c10Development.indd Page 337  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 337  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
that people could survive. A key co  m  ponent of survival in 
these countries is the   informal economy  , the uncounted 
or illegal economy that gover  n  ments do not tax and keep 
track of, including everything from a garden plot in a yard 
to the black market to the illegal drug trade. The infor-mal economy is a signiﬁ  cant element in the economies 
of many countries, but GNI stati  s  tics omit the informal 
economy entirely.  
  GNI per capita also masks extremes in the distribu-
tion of wealth within a country. The Middle Eastern oil 
countries of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have per capita GNIs over $24,000, a le  v  el higher than 
that of several European countries. These ﬁ  gures give us 
no hint of the degree of overall partic  i  pation in the coun-
try’s economy, the average citizen’s material standard of living, or gaps between genders or among regions. Eco-nomic production and the wealth it generates are not dis-tr  i  buted evenly across the seven emirates that make up the 
United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi, the emirate that domi-nates the petroleum industry, generated over half of the country’s GDP in 2010. Dubai, the next largest emirate, ge  n  erated about a quarter of the GDP , and the Qaywayn 
emirate generated less than 1 percent of the country’s gross GDP .    Another limitation of GNI per capita is that it mea-
sures only outputs (i.e., production). It does not take into 
account the nonmonetary costs of production, which take a toll on the environment through resource depl  e  tion and 
po  l  lution of air and water. Per capita GNI may even treat 
such externalities as a plus. For example, the sale of ciga-rettes augments GNI. If cigarette use causes sickness and hospitalization is required, the GNI ﬁ  gure is boosted fur-ther. Conversely, the use of energy-efﬁ  cient devices can 
actually lower GNI.  
  The limitations of GNI have prompted some 
analysts to look for alternative measures of economic 
develo  p  ment, ways of measuring the roles technology,

can be measured using the percentage of workers 
employed in various sectors of the economy. A high per-centage of laborers engaged in the production of food staples signals a low overall level of development, as conve  n  tionally deﬁ  ned, and a high percentage of work-

a high level of development.   Productivity per worker     is

  My own research is based on ﬁ  eldwork in 
Indonesia as well as ongoing engagement with 
students in the United States. The women pictured here collaborated with me on a research/activism project for migrant women wor  k  ers in Indonesia. The woman on the left (“Rina”) had returned from working in Saudi Arabia as a domestic worker for two years. She wanted to return to Saudi Arabia for another contract to earn more money for herself and her family, but she was concerned about her rights and her safety. She had been e  m  ployed by a person she considered fair and reasonable, but she had heard from friends and neighbors that many migrants had exper  i  enced serious abuses while abroad. The woman pictured on the right (“Sorani”) is an Indonesian activist who works in support of migrant rights. She discussed with Rina and me her strategies for mobilizing political change, and she helped us to see possibilities for building transnational alliances among American and Indon  e  sian workers, students, and activists. Based on these interviews, as well as many years of working with migrant women working in factories in Indonesia, my own research has i  n  creasingly sought to understand the ways in which we in the United States, as scholars, students, workers, and consumers, can better serve global justice.

 How Is Development Deﬁ  ned and Measured? 339
examined by summing production over the course of a 
year and dividing it by the total number of persons in the labor force. A more productive workforce points to a higher level of mechanization in production. T o mea-sure access to technology, some analysts use   transpo  r-
  tation and communications facilities per person  , which 
reduces railway, road, airline co  n  nections, telephone, 
radio, television, and so forth to a per capita index and 
reﬂ ects the amount of infrastructure that exists to f  a  cili-
tate economic activity. Figure 10.3 highlights some of 
the extraordinary disparities in communications access around the world.  
  Other analysts focus on social welfare to measure 
development. One way to measure social welfare is the 
  dependency ratio  , a measure of the number of depen-
dents, young and old, that each 100 employed people 
must support (Fig. 10.4). A high dependency ratio can result in signiﬁ  cant economic and social strain. Y et, as we saw in Chapter 2, the aging countries of Europe have high dependency ratios and also very high per cap-ita GNIs. We can employ countless other statistics to measure social welfare, including literacy rates, infant mo  r  tality, life expectancy, caloric intake per person, 
percentage of family income spent on food, and amount 
of sa  v  ings per capita.  
  Looking through all of the maps that measure devel-
opment, we gain a sense that many countries come out in 
approximately the same position no matter which of these measures is used. Each map and each statistic shares one limit with per capita GNI: they do not capture differences in development   within   countries, a question we consider 
at the end of this chapter.  
  Development Models  
  This discussion of ways of measuring development takes 
us back to another problem with terminology. The word   developing   suggests that all countries are improving their 
place in each of these indicators, increasing literacy, 
improving communications, or increasing productiv-ity per worker. Beyond the problem of term  i  nology, the 
very effort to classify countries in terms of levels of devel-
opment has come under increasing a  t  tack. The central 
concern is that development suggests a single trajectory 
through which all countries move. The development model, then, does not take geographical differences very seriously. Just because Japan moved from a rural, agrarian state to an urbanized, industrial one does not mean that Mali will, or that it will do so in the same way. Another criticism of the development model is that the conceptu-alization of deve  l  opment has a Western bias. Critics argue 
that some of the measures taken in poorer countries that 
the West views as progress, such as attracting industry and mechanizing agriculture, can lead to worsened social and environmental cond  i  tions for many people in the 
poorer countries. Still others criticize the development 
model because it does not consider the ability of some countries to inﬂ  uence what happens in other cou  n  tries, 
or the different positions countries occupy in the world 
economy. Instead, the development model treats coun-tries as autonomous units moving through a process of development at di  f  ferent speeds.  
  The classic development model, one that is subject 
to each of these criticisms, is economist Walt Rostow’s 
  modernization model  . Many theories of development 
grew out of the major decolonization movements of the 
1960s. Concerned with how the dozens of newly indepen-dent countries in Africa and Asia would survive ec  o  nomi-
cally, Rostow looked to how the economically powerful countries had gotten where they were.  
  Rostow’s model assumes that all countries fol-
low a similar path to development or modernization, 
advancing through ﬁ  ve stages of development. In the CountryInternet Users

  Dependency Ratio.     The dependency ratio is a measure of the number of people under the age 
of 15 and over the age of 65 that depends on each working-age adult. The working-age adults in 
the formal economy contribute to a country’s tax base, thereby supporting the young and old in the country. The higher the number, the more “dependents” (under 15 or over 65) each working age adult supports through taxes.

activity is su  b  sistence   farming. The social structure 
is rigid, and technology is slow to change. The second 
stage brings the   preconditions of takeoff  . New leadership 
moves the country toward greater ﬂ  exibility, openness, 
and divers  i  ﬁ cation. These changes, in turn, will lead to 
the third stage,   takeoff  . Now the country experiences 
something akin to an industrial revolution, and sustained 
growth takes hold. Urbanization increases, industrializa-tion proceeds, and technological and mass-production breakthroughs occur. Next, the economy enters the fourth stage, the   drive to maturity  . T echnologies dif-
fuse, industrial specialization occurs, and international 
trade expands. Mo  d  ernization is evident in key areas of 
the country, and population growth slows. In Rostow’s 
model, some countries reach the ﬁ  nal stage,   high     mass 
consumption  , which is marked by high i  n  comes and wide-

  Another name for Rostow’s model (and other models 
derived from it) is the   ladder of development  . Vis  u  ally, we 
can see his ﬁ  ve stages of development as rungs on a lad-
der (Fig. 10.5), with each country climbing the ladder 
one rung at a time. In addition to the general criticisms of development models, the major pro  b  lem with Rostow’s 
model is that it provides no larger context to development. 
Is a climb up the ladder truly dependent on what happens within one country? Or do we need to take into account all of the other cou  n  tries, their places on the ladder, and how 
their actions as well as global forces affect an individual 
cou  n  try’s movement on the ladder? The theory also misses 
the forces that can inﬂ  uence development decisions within an individual country, leaving us to wonder where cultural 
and political differences ﬁ  t into the pi  c  ture.  
  Because it is descriptive of the experiences of some 
countries, Rostow’s model is still inﬂ  uential, despite all of 
these criticisms. Even the notion of calling wealthy coun-
tries “industrialized” and saying poor countries need to “industrialize” implies that economic development can be achieved only by climbing the same la  d  der of develop-
ment wealthier countries have already climbed. Y et if a 
poor country quickly industrialized today through foreign investment, it might not reap much economic beneﬁ  t, but 
it could experience severe enviro  n  mental consequences. 
It is also interesting to note that the “industrial” countries c10Development.indd Page 341  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 341  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

of today are really “postindu  s  trial,” in that industrial pro-
duction has now shifted away from some of the wealthiest 
parts of the planet (Cha  p  ter 12).  
  
  
  Is the idea of economic development inherently Western? If 
the West (North America and Europe) were not encouraging the “developing world” to “develop,” how would people in the regions of the “developing world” think about their own economies?  
  HOW DOES GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION 
AFFECT DEVELOPMENT?  
  Development happens in   context  : it reﬂ  ects what is 
happening in a place as a result of forces operating co  n-
  cu  r  rently at multiple scales. T o understand why some 
countries are poor and others are wealthy, we need to co  n-
  sider the context not only at the state scale, but also at the 
local, regional, and global scales.    At the global scale, European ideas of the state and 
economic exchange diffused throughout the world via 
colonialism, bringing much of the world into the capi-talist world-economy. The Industrial Revolution and colonia  l  ism made colonies dependent on the colonizers 
and brought wealth to the colonizers. Even after the 
end of c  o  lonization, the economic, political, and social 
interlinkages of the world economy persist. In the 
capitalist world economy, the ﬂ  ow of capital changed little after decolonization. Many development schol-ars argue that today the poor are experiencing   neo-
colonialism  , whereby the major world powers continue 
to control the economies of the poorer countries, even 
though the poorer countries are now politically ind  e-
  pendent states.  
  Development scholars have produced a number of the-
ories that take into account the context of neo-colonialism; 
  these theories are called structuralist theories. A   struc-
turalist theory   holds that difﬁ  cult-to-change, large-scale 
economic arrangements shape what can happen in fun-
damental ways. The development of the global economy brought into being a set of structural circumstances, such as the concentration of wealth in certain areas and u  n  equal relations among places, that make it very difﬁ  cult 
for poorer regions to improve their economic situation. Structuralists argue that these countries face a very differ-ent set of development circumstances than those faced by the countries of western Europe that Rostow looked at in constructing his modern  i  zation model.  
  Dependency Theory  
  Structuralists have developed a major body of develop-
ment theory called   dependency theory  , which holds 
that the political and economic relationships between 
countries and regions of the world control and limit the economic development possibilities of poorer areas. Dependency theorists note, for example, that colo-nia  l  ism cr  e  ated political and economic structures that 
caused the colonies to become dependent on the colo-
nial powers. They further argue that such dependency helps sustain the prosperity of dominant regions and the p  o  verty of other regions, even after decolonization 
occurs.  
  Many poorer countries tie their currency to a 
wealthy country’s currency, either by tying the value of 
their currency to the wealthy country’s currency or by completely adopting the wealthy country’s currency as their own, creating a signiﬁ  cant link between the poor and wealthy countries’ economies. For example, El Sa  l  vador went through a process of   dollarization  , 
whereby the country’s currency, the colon, was aba  n-
  doned in favor of the dollar (Fig. 10.6). For the peo-
ple of El Salvador, dollarization made sense because the    Figure 10.5

all countries can reach the same level of development and that 
all will follow a similar path.   Adapted with permission from:    P . J.

 How Does Geographical Situation Affect Development? 343
economies of the two countries were tied long before 
dollarization occurred. Over 2 million Salvadorians live in the United States, and in 2010, they sent $3.5 billion in remittances to El Salvador. With this ﬂ  ow of American dollars to El Salvador, many transactions occurred in dollars long before the ofﬁ  cial switch. The United Nations Development Program estimates that 22.3 per-cent of families in El Salvador receive remi  t  tances. In 
addition, over two-thirds of El Salvador’s exports go to 
the United States. When the Federal R  e  serve Board in 
the United States controls the supply of dollars by alter-
ing the interest rates, the ramiﬁ  cations are felt directly in El Salv  a  dor.  
  Dependency theory contends that economic pros-
perity is extremely difﬁ  cult to achieve in regions and cou  n-
  tries that have traditionally been dominated by external 
powers. Y et some traditionally “dependent” regions have made economic gains. Like modernization theory, depen-dency theory is based on generalizations about economic change that pay relatively little attention to geographi-cal differences in culture, politics, and soc  i  ety. Although 
both models provide some i  n  sights into the development 
process, neither is greatly concerned with the spatial and cultural situation of particular places—central elements of geograph  i  cal analysis.  
  Geography and Context  
  As geographers, economists, and other social scientists 
came to realize that studying economic development divorced from political and social context did not reﬂ  ect 
reality, geographers began to search for a develo  p  ment the-
ory that encompassed geography, scale, place, and culture. 
Immanuel Wallerstein’s   world-systems theory   provided 
a useful framework for many. We discussed world-systems 
theory in Chapter 8, focusing on how the theory provides insights into the political organization of space. In this chap-ter, we focus on how world-systems theory helps us under-stand the geography of development.  
  Many geographers are drawn to world-systems 
theory because it is sensitive to the relationships among 
d  e  velopment processes that occur in different places. 
Speciﬁ  cally, W allerstein’s division of the world into a   three-
tier structure  —the core, periphery, and semiperiphery—
helps explain the interconnections between places in the 
global economy. As discussed in more detail in Chapter 8, core processes gene  r  ate wealth in a place because they 
require higher levels of education, more sophisticated 
technologies, and higher wages and beneﬁ  ts. When core 
processes are embedded in a place (such as the T elecom corridor in Richardson-Plano, T exas), wealth is gener-ated for the people in that place. Peripheral processes, on the other hand, r  e  quire little education, lower tech-
nologies, and lower wages and beneﬁ  ts. Core regions are 
those that have achieved high levels of socioeconomic 
prosperity and are dominant players in the global eco-nomic game. When peripheral processes are embed-ded in a place (such as banana growers in Ecuador), the processes o  f  ten generate little wealth for the people in 
that place. Periphery regions are poor regions that are 
d  e  pendent in signiﬁ  cant ways on the core and do not 
have as much control over their own affairs, economi-
cally or p  o  litically. The semiper  i  phery exhibits both 
core and peripheral processes, and semiperipheral places 
serve as a buffer between the core and periphery in the world-economy. Countries of the semiperiphery exert more power than peripheral regions but remain heavily inﬂ uenced by core regions.  
  Dividing the world into cores, semiperipheries, and 
peripheries might seem to do little more than replace 
developed, developing, and underdeveloped with a new    Figure 10.6

set of terms. But the core–periphery model is fu  n  damentally 
different from the modernization model because it holds 
that not all places can be equally wea  l  thy in the capital-
ist world-economy. World-systems theory also makes the power relations among places expl  i  cit and does not 
assume that socioeconomic change will occur in the same way in all places. It is thus sensitive to geograph  i  cal con-
text, at least in economic terms.  
  Geographer Peter J. T aylor uses the analogy of a 
school of tadpoles to demonstrate these ideas. He env  i-
  sions different places in the world as tadpoles and explains 
that not all tadpoles can survive to develop into toads. Rather, those who dominate survive, and the others per-ish. World-systems theorists see domination (explo  i  ta-
tion) as a function of the capitalist drive for proﬁ  t in the 
global economy. Thus, capitalists can move pr  o  duction 
quickly from one place to another around the globe to enhance proﬁ  ts, but places that lose a produ  c  tion facility 
can suffer. Moreover, their coping capacity can be small if, as is often the case, they earlier abandoned trad  i  tional 
ways and shifted to an export economy when external investment ﬁ  rst arrived.  
  World-systems theory is applicable at scales beyond 
the state. A core–periphery relationship can exist within 
a region, a state (country), or a local area. For example, Los Angeles can be described as the core of the Sout  h  ern 
California region; the Johannesburg area can be described as the core of the South African state; or the Central Business District can be described as the core of São Paulo, Brazil.  
  
  
  Compare and contrast Rostow’s ladder of development with Wallerstein’s three-tier structure of the world economy as models for understanding a significant eco-nomic shift that has occurred in a place with which you are familiar.   
  WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS TO AND THE 
COSTS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT?  
  International organizations and governments 
measure development and then create programs to 
help i  m  prove the condition of humans around the 
world, especially in the poorest countries of the world. 
By mea  s  uring h  u  man development, organizations and governments hope to discern how to break down barri-
ers to development and improve the human condition globally.  
  One of the most widely referenced measurements 
of development today is the United Nations Human 
D  e  velopment Index (Fig. 10.7). According to the 
United   Nations, the Human Development Index goes 
b  e  yond ec  o  nomics and incorporates the “three basic 
dimensions of human development: a long and healthy 
life, kno  w  ledge and a decent standard of living.” Several 
statistics, including per capita GDP , literacy rates, 
school enrollment rates, and life expectancy at birth, factor into the calculation of the Human Development Index.  
  In 2000, the United Nations held a high-proﬁ  le 
summit, during which 189 world leaders adopted the 
United Nations Millennium Declaration, with the goal of improving the condition of the people in the coun-tries with the lowest standards of human development. At the summit, world leaders recognized the principal ba  r  riers to economic development and identiﬁ  ed eight 
key development goals to be achieved by the year 2015. 
They were:  
   1.     Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.  
   2.     Achieve universal primary education.  
   3.     Promote gender equality and empower women.  
   4.     Reduce child mortality.  
   5.     Improve maternal health.  
   6.     Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.  
   7.     Ensure environmental sustainability.  
   8.     Develop a global partnership for development.  
  These   Millennium Development Goals   rep-
resent a fairly high degree of consensus about the key 
conditions that need to be changed if economic devel-opment is to be achieved. As 2015 approaches, however, it is b  e  coming increasingly clear that many of the goals 
will not be met. For example, HIV infection rates remain 
high, and extreme poverty is still the plight of countless millions.  
  Barriers to Economic Development  
  As described in the last section of this chapter, the struc-
tures and geography of the world-economy i  n  hibit eco-
nomic development in the periphery. Numerous factors serve as barriers to the economic deve  l  opment of the 
periphery. In Chapter 1, we discussed the causes of mal-nutrition, and in Chapter 2, we examined how AIDS has ravaged Subsaharan Africa. In Chapter 13, we discuss the vulnerability to natural hazards that exist in many periph eral c10Development.indd Page 344  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 344  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

countries, including the lack of infrastructure to cope with 
those hazards. It is clear that the world economic system often works to the disadvantage of the perip  h  ery but that 
the system is not the only obstacle that p  e  ripheral coun-
tries face.  
  Conditions within the periphery, such as high 
population growth rates, lack of education, foreign debt, 
aut  o  cra  t  ic (and often corrupt) leadership, political insta-
bility, and widespread disease hamper development. It is 
possible to get into the chicken-or-the-egg debate here: did the structures of the world-economy create these conditions, or do these conditions help to create the structures of the world-economy? Many think that nei-ther a  r  gument can stand alone, but understanding both 
structures and conditions is important if you are to form 
your own opi  n  ion.  
  Regardless of which came ﬁ  rst, numerous people 
throughout the periphery are burdened with familial, 
ec  o  nomic, cultural, and political hardships. In this sec-
tion of the chapter, we discuss several of the conditions 
that affect the economic development prospects of peo-ple in the poorest countries of the world, including many fa  c  tors outlined in the United Nations Millennium 
Development Goals.  
  Social Conditions  
  Countries in the periphery face numerous demographic, 
economic, and social problems. Most of the less well-off countries have relatively high birth rates and low life expectancies at birth (see Chapter 2). Across the global periphery, as much as half the population is 15 years old or younger, making the supply of adult, taxpaying l  a  borers 
low relative to the number of dependents. Low life expec-tancies and high infant and child mortality rates stem from inadequate nutrition (protein deﬁ  ciency is a com-
mon problem). Many in the global economic periphery also lack public sewage systems, clean drinking water, and access to health care, ma  k  ing economic deve  l  opment all 
the more difﬁ  cult.  
  Lack of access to education is also a major problem 
in the periphery. In some places, even the poorest fam  i  lies 
pay for their children to attend school. As a result, large 
numbers of school-age children do not go to school, and illiteracy rates are high. Moreover, access to education in the periphery is often gendered, with boys attending school longer than girls. Girls often stop attending school and instead work in the city to pay for their brothers’ school fees.  
  Lack of education for girls is founded on and com-
pounded by the widespread assumption (not just in the 
p  e  riphery but in most of the world) that girls will leave 
their homes (and communities) when they marry, no 
longer bringing income to the family. In parts of the periphery, trafﬁ  cking in children, especially girls, is co  m  mon. Mike Dottridge, a modern antislavery activ-
ist, explains that   trafﬁ cking   happens when “adults and 
chi  l  dren ﬂ  eeing poverty or seeking better prospects are 
manipulated, deceived, and bullied into working in con-
d  i  tions that they would not choose.” This phenomenon 
is not considered slavery because the family does not sell 
a child; instead the child is sent away with a recruiter in the hopes that the recruiter will send money and the child will earn money to send home. The trafﬁ  cked chil-
dren are often taken to neighboring or nearby countries that are wealthier and in demand of domestic servants. Others are trafﬁ  cked across the world, again typically to work as domestic servants. Dottridge explains that the majority of trafﬁ  cked children are girls and that the m  a  jority of girls are “employed as domestic servants or 
street vendors,” although some girls are “trafﬁ  cked into 
prostitution.”  
  Some countries are working to change access to 
primary education in order to make education unive  r-
  sally available. In 2000, the Millennium Development 
Report prompted the government of Rwanda to improve access to education. In 2003, fees for primary educa-tion were eliminated, and two years later schools started receiving revenues based on the number of students they were educating. Rwanda’s goal was to make pri-mary education available to all by 2010. Progress has been made, but it is difﬁ  cult to assess whether the goal 
was achieved. Moreover, access and completion are two different things; of the almost two million children cur-rently in primary schools, only half reach the sixth year of school. Moreover, without adequate funding to sup-port the growing student population, some of Rwanda’s st  u  dents meet under trees and many convene in swelling 
classrooms. Aid is ﬂ  owing in from outside, but sustaining 
support for the country’s educational sector remains an 
ong  o  ing challenge.  
  Foreign Debt  
  Complicating the picture further is the foreign debt 
crisis that many periphery and semiperiphery coun-tries face. Shortly after the decolonization wave of the 1960s, banks and other international ﬁ  nancial institu-
tions began lending large sums of money to the newly independent states, money earmarked for development projects. By the 1980s and 1990s, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were len  d  ing 
si  g  niﬁ cant amounts of money to peripheral and semi-
peripheral countries, but with strings attached. T o 
secure the loans, countries had to agree to implement economic or governmental reforms, such as privati  z-
  ing government entities, opening the country to for-
eign trade, reducing tariffs, and encouraging foreign d  i  rect inves  t  ment. These loans are known as   structural 
adjustment loans  .  c10Development.indd Page 345  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 345  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  Once peripheral countries owe money to the IMF , 
the World Bank, and private banks and lending instit  u-
  tions, they need to repay their debts. Spending a large 
part of the country’s budget on debt repayment makes it difﬁ  cult for a country to invest in more development projects. For many countries the cost of servicing their debts (that is, the cost of repayments plus interest) exceeds revenues from the export of goods and se  r  vices 
(Fig. 10.8). Meanwhile, in many countries, the returns 
on development projects have been much lower than c10Development.indd Page 346  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 346  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  Structural adjustment loans were part of a larger 
trend toward   neoliberalism   in the late twentieth ce  n  tury. 
Neoliberalism derives from the neo-classical economic i  dea that government intervention into markets is i  n  ef-
ﬁ cient and undesirable, and should be resisted wherever 
possible. These ideas were at the heart of the conditions 
that were attached to loans and reﬁ  nancing programs, but

of economic control from states to the private sector. This 
development, in turn, fostered economic globalization while shrinking the size of the public sector in a number of cou  n  tries. The trade-off, however, was the expansion of 
corporate control and the erosion of the ability of regional and state governments to control their economic destinies. 
Hence, the neoliberal turn has been highly conte  n  tious.

on a privatized export sector that left the country vulner-
able when shifts in the global economy weakened the competitiveness of Argentinian e  x  ports. But go  v  ernment 
spending also was also unsustainably high, and corruption was rampant (Fig. 10.9).    By 2005, internal economic growth and aid from 
Venezuela put Argentina in a position to work out a co  m-
  plex debt restructuring plan that has pulled the country 
back from the brink. Argentina’s agricultural economy bounced back in 2010 with the rise of corn and soy  prices. SLOVENIA

Argentina’s economy is stabilizing, but in cases where 
countries are facing imminent econo  m  ic, political, and 
social meltdown, the only alternative may be to default on loans. Defaulting countries then ﬁ  nd themselves in a 
severely disadvantaged position when it comes to attract-ing f  u  ture external investment. And if a substantial num-
ber of countries were to default at the same time, a global economic crisis could ensue that would work to the disad-vantage of almost everyone.  
  Disease  
  Those living in the global economic periphery experience 
comparatively high rates of disease and a corr  e  spon  d  ing lack 
of adequate health care. These circumstances directly affect 
economic development, making survival difﬁ  cult for many 
people, orphaning children, and weakening the labor force.  
  As highlighted in Chapters 1 and 2, the high concen-
tration of HIV/AIDS cases in parts of the periphery pr  e  s-
ents a signiﬁ  cant obstacle to development—particularly in 
parts of Subsaharan Africa. Moreover,   vectored diseases   —
those spread by one host (person) to another by an interme-
diate host or vector—are a scourge in warm, humid parts of the periphery and semiperiphery. The warm, moist cli-mates of tropical environments e  n  hance biological activity. 
Vectors abound in such environments, and infectious dis-
eases spread rapidly through host populations.  
  Development experts look at malaria as a “silent tsu-
nami” in the periphery, comparing its death toll to the tsu-
nami that ravaged South and Southeast Asia in late 2004. That tsunami killed some 300,000 people (i  n  cluding 
children)   at once  . Malaria kills about   150,000 children   in the global periphery   each month  .   Malaria   is an infectious 
disease spread by mosquitoes that carry the parasite in 
their saliva. Scientists did not dete  r  mine the role of mos-
quitoes in the diffusion of the disease until the late eigh-teenth century. T oday, the s  e  quence of the disease is well 
known. The mosquito stings an infected host and sucks up some of the di  s  ease agents. In the mosquito’s stomach, the 
parasites reproduce and multiply, eventually reaching its saliva. When the mosqu  i  to stings the next person, some of 
the parasites are injected into that person’s bloodstream. The person who has been stung deve  l  ops malaria and 
becomes a host.  
  The disease manifests itself through recurrent fever 
and chills, with associated symptoms such as anemia and 
an enlarged spleen. Nearly one million people in the world die of the disease each year. Malaria is a m  a  jor fac-
tor in infant and child mortality, as most of the victims are children age 5 or younger. If a person su  r  vives the dis-
ease, he or she will develop a certain degree of immunity. However, many infected by malaria are weak, lack energy, and face an increased risk of other diseases taking hold in their weakened body.  
  Malaria occurs throughout the world, except in 
higher latitudes and altitudes, and drier environments. 
A  l  though people in the tropical portions of Africa suffer 
most from this disease, malaria is also prevalent in India, Sout  h  east Asia, parts of southern China, and the tropical 
Americas.  
  Several types of malaria spread throughout these 
regions, with some being more severe than others. In 
add  i  tion to humans, various species of monkeys, rats, 
birds, and even snakes can be affected by the disease. In   Field Note  
  “Arriving in Argentina during the political and economic upheavals that had begun in 2001, I saw signs of dislocation and trouble everywhere. Beggars pursued pedestrians on the once-fashionable Avenida Florida. Banks had installed protec-tive shutters against angry crowds demanding return of their frozen and devalued d  e  posits. A bus trip on the Patagonian Highway turned into an adventure when masked protesters carrying rocks and burning rags stopped vehicles and threat-ened their occupants. Newspapers carried reports of sta  r  va-tion in T  u  cumán Province—in a country capable of producing seven times the food its population needs.”

 What Are the Barriers to and the Costs of Economic Development? 351
Subsaharan Africa, malaria’s virulence results from the 
effectiveness of its vectors—three African mosqu  i  toes 
(  An  o  pheles gambiae, A. arabiensis  , and   A. funestus  ). Whole 
populations are afﬂ  icted, and entire regions have been 
abandoned because of the prevalence of the disease.  
  Antimalarial drugs exist, but to defeat malaria, 
afﬂ icted regions must eliminate the vector: the mosquito. 
During the 1940s, the government of Sri Lanka (then 
Ceylon) launched a massive attack on the mo  s  quito with 
the aid of a pesticide called   dichloro diphenyl trichloroeth-
ane   (DDT). The results were dramatic. The mosquito was 
practically wiped out, and the rate of deaths attributable 
to malaria fell markedly. In 1945, Sri Lanka’s death rate overall had been 22 per 1000; in 1972, it reported a death rate of only 8 per 1000. The ﬁ  gure was fu  r  ther reduced 
to 5 per 1000 by 2004 and then rose again to 7 in 2009, as reﬂ ected in Figure 10.10.  
  The conquest of malaria produced a new set of 
problems, however. DDT proved to be highly carcino-
genic and to have negative health and environmental consequences of its own. Also, the lowered death rate through malaria eradication led to a substantial rise in the population growth rate, creating new pro  b  lems for 
Sri Lanka. By the time the birth rate dropped (it is 19 
per 1000 today), the island had experienced a popul  a-
  tion e  x  plosion.  
  Success in combating major vectored diseases often 
is only temporary. Following the Sri Lankan exper  i  ment, 
India initiated a massive assault against the malaria mos-
quito, and the number of new cases of m  a  laria declined 
dramatically. But ten years after the program was intro-
duced, India reported that 60 million people were infected with malaria, more than half the number who had the disease before the antimalaria campaign began. This example proved the mosquito population’s ability to rebound quickly after even the most inte  n  sive applic  a-
  tion of pesticides.  
  T oday the war against malaria is taking a new tack: 
genetic interference with the mosquito so that its capa  c  ity 
to transmit the malaria parasite,   Plasmodium  , is destroyed. 
By introducing “engineered” mosquitoes into the gen-
eral population, health experts hope that the number of nonvirulent mosquitoes will rise si  g  niﬁ cantly. A number 
of programs also focus on distributed insecticide-laden mosquito nets to surround sleeping qua  r  ters and protect 
people from the mosquitoes that are most active at night (Fig. 10.11).  
  Political Corruption and Instability  
  Although not addressed in the Millennium Development 
goals, political corruption and instability can greatly impede economic development as well. Establishing a sta-ble, legitimate government that can mai  n  tain control over and lead a low-income country can be a daunting task. In peripheral countries, a wide d  i  vide often exists b  e  tween 
the very wealthy and the poorest of the poor. In Kenya, for example, the wealthiest 10 percent of the population controls nearly 50 percent of the country’s wealth, and the poorest 10 percent control less than 1 percent of Kenya’s wealth. The disenfranchisement of the poor and the com-petition among the rich for control of the government (and the potential spoils that go along with that) can lead to extreme political instability within a state—as Kenya experienced in 2007–2008. Add to these factors i  n  volve-
ment from outside the country, especially by powerful countries, and the political instability can ea  s  ily escalate, 
yielding horrid conditions in which military dictators, selﬁ sh megalomaniacs, and corrupt go  v  ernments can 
come to power.  
  Countries of the core have established democracies 
for themselves; since World War II, they have held reg-
ularly scheduled democratic elections. But countries in the periphery and semiperiphery have had a much harder time establishing and maintaining democracies. In the process of decolonization, the colonizing countries typi-cally left governments that reﬂ  ected political and social 
hierarchies during the c  o  lonial period. Some failed, some 
were overthrown by military coups, and some saw the 
consolidation of power around a di  c  tatorial strongman. 
Many countries in the periphery and semiperiphery have 
alternated repeatedly between qu  a  si-democratic and 
military governments. Some argue that without consid-
erable wealth, maintaining a liberal democracy is all but impossible.  
  Opening the homepage of any major newspaper on 
any given day will reveal a story somewhere in the world 
that demonstrates the link between economic stability and political stability. In post-T aliban Afghanistan, eco-nomic woes represent one of the greatest threats to the stability of the United States-supported gover  n  ment 
in Kabul. More than half of the population is impover-
ished, and the government lacks the funds to i  n  vest in 
deve  l  opment. Foreign aid—much of it from the United 
States—has provided some help, but the ﬂ  ow of aid has 
been variable and its amount insufﬁ  cient to address the country’s searing economic problems. Many an  a  lysts 
see this as a key impediment to achieving stability in 
Afghanistan. As the   Economist   put it in 2006, “p  o  verty 
helps the T aliban.”  
  In places where poverty is rampant, politicians often 
become corrupt, misusing aid and exacerbating the plight 
of the poor. In Zimbabwe, the year 2002 left many people starving, as poor weather cond  i  tions created a meager

A potential challenger, Morgan T svangirai, emerged in 
2008. Me  m  bers of his opposition party were killed and 
the challenger was harassed, but after a contested elec-
tion that many believe T svangirai won, a power-sharing agreement came into effect that kept Mugabe as presi-dent and made T svangirai the prime minister. Some sta-bility returned to the country, but continuing tensions make it difﬁ  cult to address Zimbabwe’s enormous ec  o-

when this type of aid reaches its intended beneﬁ  ciaries, it 
is rarely sufﬁ  cient to meet basic needs or reverse the tra-
je  c  tory of hardship in the country.  
  Costs of Economic Development  
  Economic development changes a place. T o increase 
productivity, whether industrial or agricultural, pe  o-
  ple transform the environment. When a country goes 
through intensiﬁ  cation of   industrial production,   air 
and surface water are often polluted. Pollution is not 
conﬁ ned to industry. With intensiﬁ  cation of   agricul-
tural produ  c  tion  , the introduction of pesticides and 
herbicides can have deleterious impacts on the soil and 
groundw  a  ter.   T ourism   can be just as difﬁ  cult on the 
environment—taxing the existing infrastructure beyond 
its c  a  pacities. The costs of tourism often stretch far 
beyond the environment, affecting ways of life and fun-
d  a  mentally altering the cultural lan  d  scape.  
  Industrialization  
  In their efforts to attract new industries, the governments 
of many countries in the global periphery and semip  e-
  riphery have set up special manufacturing export zones 
called   export processing zones (EPZs),   which offer 
f  a  vorable tax, regulatory, and trade arrangements to for-
eign ﬁ  rms. By the early 2000s, more than 60 cou  n  tries had 
established such zones, and many of these had become 
major manufacturing centers (Fig. 10.12). T wo of the best known of these zones are the Mexican   maquilado-
ras   and the   special ec  o  nomic zones   of China (di  s  cussed in Chapter 9). Governments locate such zones in places 
with easy access to export markets. Thus, the maqu  i  la-
dora zone in Mexico is situated directly across the border 
from the United States, and the special economic zones of China are located near major ports. These zones typi-cally attract a mix of manufacturing operations, depend-ing on the skill levels of the labor force and the available infrastructure.  
  The maquiladora program started in 1965 when the 
Mexican government designated the region of nort  h  ern 
Mexico as a maquiladora district, making it a place where 
raw materials could be shipped into Mexico, manufactured into goods, and then sent back to the United States free of import tariffs. U.S. corporations rel  o  cated manufacturing 
plants to Mexico to take advantage of the program.  
  Although the maquiladora phenomenon started in 
1965, it did not really take off until the 1980s. During the 
1980s, American companies recognized the expanding wage and beneﬁ  t differences between the Uni  t  ed States 
and Mexican worker and began relocating to the maqui-ladora district in northern Mexico. Although competition from other parts of the world has led to the closing of some plants, today some 3000 maqu  i  ladoras continue to func-
tion, employing 1 million workers and accounting for 50 percent of Mexico’s e  x  ports. The maquiladora plants pro-
duce goods such as electronic equipment, electrical appli-ances, autom  o  biles, textiles, plastics, and furniture. The 
plants are controversial both in Mexico and the United States, as corporations that have r  e  located there avoid the 
employment and environmental regulations that are in force just a few miles to the north. Many m  a  quiladora fac-
tories hire young women and men for low pay and few if    Figure 10.11

the wetlands became breeding grounds for the mos-
quitoes that carry malaria. This baby sleeps u  n  der

  These 
efforts are having some dramatic impacts in parts of Africa, but malaria r  e  mains a scourge of the poorer 
peoples living in low latitudes, which is an impediment to economic develo  p  ment.

any beneﬁ  ts, putting them to work in repetitive jobs, often 
in environmentally questionable co  n  ditions.  
  In 1992, the United States, Mexico, and Canada 
established the   North American Free Trade 
Agre  e  ment (NAFTA)  , which prompted further indus-
trialization of the border region. NAFTA took effect 
January 1, 1994. In addition to manufacturing plants, NAFTA has facilitated the movement of service indus-tries from the United States to Mexico, including data processing operations. Most of the new plants are located in two di  s  tricts: Tijuana on the Paciﬁ  c Coast—linked to 
San Diego across the border—and Ciudad Juarez on the 
Rio Grande across from El Paso, T exas. In recent years the socioeconomic and environmental contrasts b  e  tween 
cities on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border have 
become increasingly stark. Violent crime has b  e  come a 
particularly serious problem in Juarez, even as El Paso 
remains comparatively safe, and the slums of Tijuana are a world apart from much of San Diego. Although NAFTA was designed to foster increased int  e  raction in 
North America, cross-border disparities have worked 
together with growing U.S. concerns over illegal imm  i-
  gration and the inﬁ  ltration of foreign terrorists to make 
the U.S.-Mexico border more tightly co  n  trolled and 
more difﬁ  cult to cross than in prior decades.  
  Agriculture  
  In peripheral countries, agriculture typically focuses 
on personal consumption or on production for a large agricultural conglomerate. Where zones of larger-scale, modernized agriculture have developed in the p  e  riph-
ery, foodstuffs are produced for the foreign market and 
often have minimal impact on the impoverished condi-tions of the surrounding lands. Little is produced for the local marketplace because distribution sy  s  tems are poorly 
organized and because the local population is typically 
unable to pay for foodstuffs. If the local population owns land, their landholdings are usually fragmented, creating small plots of land that are difﬁ  cult to farm in a ma  n  ner 
that produces much income. Even on larger plots of land, 
most farmers are equipped with outdated, inefﬁ      cient 
tools and equipment. The main crops tend to be grains 
and roots; farmers produce little protein because high-protein crops typically have lower yields than grain crops. On the farms in the periphery, yields per unit area are low, subsistence modes of life prevail, and many families are co  n  stantly in debt.  
  Impoverished farmers can ill afford such luxuries 
as fertilizers, and educational levels are typically too low 
to achieve widespread soil conservation. As a result, soil erosion is commonplace in most peripheral areas. S  e  vere 
soil erosion in areas with dry or semiarid climates around deserts results in extreme degradation of the land and the spread of the desert into these lands. Although the expan-sion and contraction of deserts can occur naturally and cyclically, the process of   desertiﬁ  cation   is more often 
exacerbated by humans destroying veg  e  tation and ero  d-
  ing soils through the overuse of lands for livestock grazing 
or crop production.     Figure 10.12

  Desertiﬁ  cation has hit Africa harder than any of the 
other continents (Fig. 10.13). More than half of Africa is 
arid or semiarid, and many people farm the marginal, dry lands of the continent. Land ownership pa  t  terns, the need 
for crops and protein sources (both for local consumption and for export), and power di  f  ferences among groups of 
people lead some farmers and ranchers to turn marginal, semiarid lands into farm and ranch lands. Lands that are available for farming or ranching may be used more inten-sively in order to increase agricultu  r  al production (see 
Chapter 13). In semiarid regions, the decision to farm more intensively and increase agricultural production has the unintended consequence of eroding the land, e  n  cour-
aging out-migration, and creating conﬂ  ict.  
  In Subsaharan Africa over the last 50 years, more 
than 270,000 square miles (700,000 square kilometers) 
of farming and grazing land have become desert, extend-ing the Sahara Desert to the south. Some of the African c10Development.indd Page 356  10/21/11  12:18 PM user f-400c10Development.indd Page 356  10/21/11  12:18 PM user f-400 F-400F-400

desertiﬁ  cation may be caused by climatic ﬂ  uctuations, but 
overgrazing, woodcutting, soil exhaustion, and misuse 
have u  n  doubtedly accelerated the process.  
  Tourism  
  All development strategies have pros and cons, as is well 
illustrated by the case of tourism. Peripheral island coun-tries in the Caribbean region of Middle America and in other parts of the world have become leading dest  i  na-
tions for millions of tourists from richer states. T ourism is now one of the major industries in the world and has sur-passed oil in its overall economic value, and it sometimes brings some wealth and e  m  ployment to these countries 
(see Chapter 12). T ourism may also have serious negative effects on cultures and environments.  
  In economic terms, to develop tourism the “host” 
country must make a substantial investment. Sometimes c10Development.indd Page 357  10/21/11  12:18 PM user f-400c10Development.indd Page 357  10/21/11  12:18 PM user f-400 F-400F-400
358 Chapter 10   Development
imports of building materials and equipment strain the 
country’s supply system, and funds are diverted to hotel construction that could have been spent on other needs such as housing for citizens. Moreover, many hotels and other tourist facilities are owned not by the host country but by large multinational corporations. These corpora-tions earn enormous proﬁ  ts, most of which are sent back 
to owners, shareholders, and exec  u  tives.  
  Countries that do earn substantial income from tour-
ism include Thailand, Kenya, Barbados, and Fiji.   Much of 
the income a country receives from tourism revenues are 
reinvested in the construction of ai  r  ports, cruise-ports, and 
other infrastructure that supports more tourism. T ourism 
can create local jobs, but they are often low-paying and have little job security. In tourist zones, many employees work two or three jobs in o  r  der to break even. T ourism can 
bring wealth to owners, shareholders, and executives out-
side of tourist destinations.  
  T ourism frequently strains the fabric of local com-
munities as well. The invasion of poor communities by 
wea  l  thier visitors can foster antipathy and resentment. 
T ourism can also have the effect of altering, and even debasing, local culture, which is adapted to suit the visi-tors’ taste. In many instances tourism fosters a “de  m  on-
stration effect” among locals that encourages them to behave in ways that may please or interest the vis  i  tors but 
that is disdained by the larger local community. Some tourism workers consider emplo  y  ment in the tourist 
industry dehumanizing because it demands displays of friendliness and servitude that locals ﬁ  nd i  n  sulting.  
  A ﬂ  ood of afﬂ  uent tourists may be appealing to 
the government of a poor country whose elite may have 
a ﬁ     nancial stake in the hotels where they can share the 
pleasures of the wealthy, but local entrepreneurs often 
take a different view. Indeed, powerful multinational cor-porations and national governments may intervene to limit the opportunities of local, small-scale operators in favor of mass, prearranged tourist destinations (“excl  u-
  sive” resorts) that isolate the tourist from local society. 
Overreliance on tourism can also leave an economy vul-ner  a  ble if shifting economic circumstances cause a sharp 
decline in the number of tourists or if natural disasters hit. Because many tourist destinations in poorer countries are beach attractions, natural ha  z  ards such as the 2004 tsu-
nami in Southeast Asia can destroy the lynchpin of a coun-try’s economy (we di  s  cuss the tsunami and other na  t  ural 
hazards in greater detail in Chapter 13). Suffering the loss of thousands of people; dealing with the after-effects of sewage, homelessness, orphans, and the destitute; and coping with rebuilding the tourist destinations must occur while the ﬂ  ow of tourist-related income has stopped.  
  The cultural landscape of tourism is frequently a 
study in harsh contrasts: gleaming hotels tower over mo  d-
  est, often poor housing; luxury liners glide past poverty-
stricken villages; opulent meals are served in hotels while, down the street, children suffer from malnutrition. If the tourist industry offered real prospects for economic prog-ress in low-income countries, such circumstances might be viewed as temporary, unfortunate by-products. However, the evidence too often points in the other direction.  
  
  
  Think of a trip you have made to a poorer area of the coun-try or a poorer region of the world. Describe how your expe-rience in the place as a tourist was fundamentally different from the everyday lives of the people who live in the place.  
  HOW DO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
INSTITUTIONS INFLUENCE UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT WITHIN STATES?  
  In our globalized world, poverty is not conﬁ  ned to 
the periphery. Core countries have regions and peoples 
that are markedly poorer than others. On the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the northern Great Plains of the United States, unemployment hovers at 80 percent, and more than 60 percent of the people live in poverty with a per capita income of just over $6000. Other countries of the core have similar regions where peoples’ ec  o  nomic 
lives do not improve when the country’s economy grows. In Europe, areas of isolation and stagnation persist—particularly in the east. At the same time, some places in peripheral countries are experiencing rapid economic growth. The local conditions in these places differ sharply from those prevailing in surrounding a  r  eas. Recent eco-
nomic growth on the Paciﬁ  c Rim of East Asia has created huge regional disparities in ec  o  nomic conditions between 
some coastal provinces of China and distant interior prov-inces. Such regional ec  o  nomic contrasts have signiﬁ  cant 
polit  i  cal as well as social consequences.  
  As noted at the beginning of this chapter, regional 
contrasts in wealth are a reminder that per capita GNI 
does not accurately represent the economic development of individual places. Any statistic that is derived for an entire country or State hides the variety of economic situ-ations within. Peripheral countries are not  o  riously marked 
by severe regional disparities. In Chapter 9 we discussed 
the stark contrasts between wealthy and poor within Latin American and African cities. When viewed at the scale of the State, major cities (particularly capitals) and their surroundings often look like islands of prosperity, with c10Development.indd Page 358  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 358  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Do Political and Economic Institutions Inﬂ  uence Uneven Development Within States?  359
modern buil  d  ings, factories on the outskirts, and modern 
farms nearby. In some cases roads and rails lead to a bustling 
port, where luxury automobiles are unloaded for use by the privileged elite and raw materials or agricultural products from the cou  n  try are exported to points around the world. 
In these core areas of countries, the rush of “progress” may 
be ev  i  dent. If you travel a few miles into the countryside or 
into a different neighborhood in the city, however, you will 
likely see a very different picture. The contrasts between rich and poor areas are not simply the result of differences in the economic endowments of places. Government policy fr  e  quently affects development patterns as well. Hence, 
in this section of the chapter we turn to how gover  n  ments 
collaborate with corporations to create islands of develop-
ment, and consider how people try to gene  r  ate growth in 
the periphery of the per  i  phery.  
  The Role of Governments  
  The actions of governments inﬂ  uence whether, how, and 
where wealth is produced. This is because the di  s  tribution 
of wealth is affected by tariffs, trade agreements, taxation structures, land ownership rules, env  i  ronmental regula-
tions, and many other manifestations of governmental authority. Government policies play an important role at the interstate level, but they also shape patterns of devel-opment within States—not just between u  r  ban and rural 
areas, but within each of these sectors.  
  Of course, governments alone do not determine pat-
terns of wealth and poverty, but they are almost always 
part of the picture. Consider the case of the Ninth Ward in New Orleans, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. On its surface, what happened to the Ninth Ward was the result of a natural disaster. But the ﬂ  ooding of that part of New Orleans was also the result of government decisions decades ago to build levies and settle ﬂ  ood-prone 
areas. The concentration of people living there was also the product of inn  u  merable pol  i  cies affecting housing, the 
construction of businesses, and the like. Once the hurricane 
hit, many looked to government to rebuild the devastated section of the city. The limited nature of the governmental response is evident in the landscape today (Fig. 10.14).  
  At a somewhat larger scale, consider the contrasts 
between parts of rural Wisconsin and rural Appalachia in 
the United States. In rural Wisconsin, many of the sur-viving family farmers are educated at land-grant un  i  versi-
ties in plant and animal sciences and in agribusiness. They may well be running a highly mechanized dairy farm. On such farms, the farmer equips each cow with a barcode

  “Walking through New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward more than two years after Hurricane Katrina, it seemed as if the natural disaster had just happened. Street after street of devastated, vacant buildings was all the eye could behold—many still bearing the mark-ings of the emergency crews that had moved through the neighborhood in the wake of the hurricane, showing whether anyone had died inside. It struck me that r  e  construction would r  e  quire a public commitment on the order of what occurred in Europe after World War II, when cities reduced to rubble by bombing were rebuilt almost from scratch. No such commitment ever materialized, but some prog-ress has been made in recent years. Recent census data shows a city that is slightly smaller and slightly richer than the pre-Katrina city, with a somewhat reduced black population, and a mod-estly expanding number of Hispa  n  ics.”

and keeps a range of data about that particular cow. The 
data include any medical attention the cow has needed, how much milk the cow is pr  o  ducing, and when the cow 
last calved. The farmer then feeds the cow a diet geared toward improving or maintaining milk production. When the cow ambles over to the trough to feed, a sensor reads the cow’s ba  r  code and automatically mixes the correct bal-
ance of proteins, carbohydrates, and nutrients for the cow, di  s  pensing them into the trough for the cow to eat. If the 
cow has already eaten that day, the computer di  s  penses 
nothing into the trough, and the cow is left to a  m  ble away.  
  In parts of rural Appalachia, by contrast, hardscrab-
ble farming is the norm. Farmers have limited educ  a  tion, 
and there is little mechanization. In short, life in some of 
the poorest parts of rural Appalachia is a world apart from life on a modern Wisconsin dairy farm. Some of those dif-ferences can be attributed to geographic situation and eco-nomic swings. But others are the product of government policies that inﬂ  uence educational opportunities, provide subsidies for particular agricultural pursuits, and promote the development of partic  u  lar technologies. Every policy 
has a geographical expression, meaning that some regions are favored whereas others are disadvantaged as a result of the implementation of that policy. When policies come t  o  gether to favor some regions over others, uneven devel-
opment is the result. And uneven develo  p  ment can easily 
be exacerbated over time as the wealthy grow wealthier.  
  Government policy can also help alleviate uneven 
development. In the case of Appalachia, the U.S. Co  n  gress 
created an Appalachian Regional Commission in 1965 
to address poverty in the region. The Commi  s  sion has 
orchestrated a program of government investment in 
roads, schools, health-care facilities, and water and sewer systems that has fostered development in parts of the region. Signiﬁ  cant parts of App  a  lachia have b  e  neﬁ ted from 
these policies, although pockets of deep poverty remain.  
  Looking at commodity chains can also help us 
understand the role of governments in uneven develop-
ment both within and between states. In her 2005 book   The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy   , econ  o  mist 
Pietra Rivoli described the signiﬁ  cant inﬂ  uences gov-
ernments have on the distribution of wealth b  e  tween 
and within states. Rivoli grabs a T-shirt out of a bin at a 
Walgreens in Florida, buys it, and then traces its pr  o  duc-
tion back through the commodity chain to see how it ends up in her hands. The cotton for her T-shirt was grown in West T exas, where the cotton lobby (the political arm of America’s cotton producers) has effectively politicked for governmental labor programs and price supports that help the lobby grow cotton and sell it at pr  e  dictable prices.  
  From West T exas, the cotton bale reaches China by 
ship. There it is spun into thread and woven into fabric. 
Women from rural China work in state-owned factories set up in regions that are slated for economic develo  p-
  ment—  cutting and sewing T-shirts and keeping the tex-
tile machines in good repair. The women are considered cheap labor at the global scale, earning about $100 per month. Rivoli reports that over 40,000 garment fact  o  ries 
operate in China alone.  
  The T-shirts are then shipped to the United States 
for sale. In an attempt to protect T-shirts produced in 
America with higher labor costs from those produced in China, the U.S. government has established quotas on how many items from various clothing categories can be imported into the United States from China and other countries. An unintended consequence of the quota system has been a “quota ma  r  ket” that allows 
countries to buy and sell their U.S. quota numbers to 
producers in other countries (an illegal but rampant pra  c  tice). Instead of trading in quotas, some production 
facilities have moved to places where quotas and cheap 
labor are available—places such as Sri Lanka, Poland, and Lesotho. Rivoli describes how one pr  o  ducer of cot-
ton shirts has moved around the world:  
  The Esquel Corporation, today the world’s largest pro-
ducer of cotton shirts, started in Hong Kong in the late 1970s, but, unable to obtain quota to sell to the United States, shifted production to mainland China. When the United States tightened Chinese shirt quotas in the early 1980s, Esquel moved production to M  a  laysia. When 
Malaysian quota also became difﬁ  cult to obtain, Esquel 
moved yet again, this time to Sri Lanka. The globe hop-ping continued, with the Chinese shirt producer setting up operations in Mauritius and Maldives.  
  The point is that quota laws, like other policies 
made by governments, regional trade organizations, and 
i  n  ternational political regimes (such as the World T rade 
Organization and the International Labor Organiz  a  tion), 
affect whether and how regions can produce and exchange goods on the world market.  
  Islands of Development  
  In both periphery and core, governments often priori-
tize the creation of wealth in the seat of governmental authority: the capital city. In most states, the capital city is the political nerve center of the country, its n  a  tional 
headquarters and seat of government. Capital cities 
are home to government buildings and jobs; they often house universities, museums, heritage centers, conven-tion centers, and the headquarters of large corp  o  ra-
tions. After gaining independence, many former colonial 
states spent lavishly on their capitals, not because such spending was essential to political or economic success but because the states wanted to showcase their ind  e-
  pendence, their futures, and create a national treasure. 
The European colonizers who focused their wealth and treasures on their capital cities, such as Great Britain’s London, France’s Paris, and the Nethe  r  lands’ c10Development.indd Page 360  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501c10Development.indd Page 360  9/19/11  12:05 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

Amsterdam, served as mo  d  els for the newly independent 
states (just as the state system itself did).  
  In many countries of the global economic periphery 
and semiperiphery, the capital cities are by far the lar  g  est 
and most economically inﬂ  uential cities in the state (i.e., 
primate cities, discussed in Chapter 9). Some newly inde-pendent states have built new capital cities, away from the colonial headquarters. Their goals in doing so are to sepa-rate the  m  selves from their colonizers, to bring together 
diverse groups into one state with a city built to reﬂ  ect 
their common culture, to extend economic development into the interior of the state, or to help esta  b  lish control 
over a region with a population whose loyalties might not be to the state.  
  Nigeria, for example, moved its capital from Y oruba-
dominated Lagos along the coast to an ethnically ne  u  tral 
territory in the center of the state: Abuja. Malawi moved 
its capital from Zomba, deep in the south, to more ce  n  tral 
Lilongwe. Pakistan moved the capital from the colonial headquarters of Karachi to Islamabad in the far north to symbolize the country’s reorientation toward its his-torically important interior and north. Brazil moved its capital from coastal Rio de Janeiro to centrally located Brasilia in order to direct attention to the huge, sparsely populated, yet poorly integrated interior. More recently, Kazakhstan moved its capital from Alm  a  ty in the south 
to Astana in the north, partly to be closer to Russia and the center of the possibly restless Russian population. Malaysia has also recently moved its capital from the colo-nial capital of Kuala Lumpur to a completely new center called Putrajaya, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) to the south. The M  a  laysian government decided to build a new, ultramodern seat of government to symbolize the coun-try’s rapid economic growth (Fig. 10.15).  
  Corporations can also make cities focal points of 
development by concentrating corporate activities in a 
pa  r  ticular place. Often, corporations build up the cities 
near the resources they are extracting or near manufa  c  tur-
ing centers they have built. Multinational oil companies create subsidiaries in countries of the periphery and semi-periphery, creating or expanding cities near oil reserves. For example in Gabon, Elf and Shell, two oil companies based in Europe, run ElfGabon and ShellGabon in the Central African country. The oil co  m  panies took the 
small colonial town of Port Gentile in Gabon and turned it into a city that the locals call “oil city.” The oil co  m  pa-
nies built housing, roads, and stores, and provide much of the employment in the town (Fig. 10.16).  
  When a government or corporation builds up and 
concentrates economic development in a certain city or 
small region, geographers call that place an   island of devel-
opment  . In Chapter 3, we identiﬁ  ed islands of develo  p  ment 
in the periphery and semiperiphery and discussed why peo-
ple migrate to these cities from rural areas and other poorer cities. The hope for a job drives many migrants to move to these islands of comparative prospe  r  ity.  
  Creating Growth in the Periphery of the Periphery  
  One of the greatest challenges to development is creating 
  development opportunities outside of islands of deve  l  op-
ment.     In the most rural, impoverished regions of less pros-
perous countries, some nongovernmental organiz  a  tions    Figure 10.15

try to improve the plight of people.   Nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs)   are not run by state or local gov-
ernments. Rather, NGOs operate independently, and the 
term is usually reserved for e  n  tities that operate as non-
proﬁ ts. Thousands of NGOs operate in the world today, 
from churches to charities such as Heifer International. 
Each NGO has its own set of goals, depending on the pri-mary concerns ou  t  lined by its founders and ﬁ  nanciers.  
  Some countries have so many NGOs operating 
within them that they serve as what the   Economist   calls “a 
parallel state, ﬁ  nanced by foreigners and accountable to 
nobody.” For example, more than 20,000 NGOs o  p  erate 
within the country of Bangladesh at any time, focusing 
mainly on the rural areas and villages of the state. But the NGO phenomenon can be a bit of a mirage, masking the depth of problems some places face. In the wake of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, one respected British newspaper, the   Guardian  , reported that there was approximately 1 NGO 
per 1000 people in Haiti, but that much of the money fun-
neled through these NGOs was misappropriated.  
  One particular kind of program by NGOs that has 
found success in South Asia and South America is the 
m  i  crocredit program. The idea behind a   microcredit 
program   is simple: give loans to poor people, partic  u  larly 
women, to encourage development of small businesses. 
Programs either have women in the village guarantee each other’s credit, or they make future lending to oth-ers contingent on repayment by the ﬁ  rst bo  r  rowers. With 
repayment rates hovering at 98 percent, microcredit pro-grams can ﬁ  nance themselves, and many NGOs offer the pr  o  grams (Fig. 10.17).    By providing microcredit to women, NGOs can alter 
the gender balance in a region, giving more ﬁ  scal power 
to women. Some microcredit programs are credited with 
lowering birth rates in parts of developing countries and altering the social fabric of cultures by diminishing men’s positions of power. Successful m  i  crocredit programs also 
help alleviate malnourishment, as women with incomes can feed themselves and their children.  
  Microcredit programs have been less successful in 
places with high mortality rates from diseases such as AIDS. 
If the borrower is unable to work or if the family has medical and funeral bills, the borrower is much more lik  e  ly to default 
on the microcredit loan. When people in the periphery of 
the periphery (the poorest regions of p  e  ripheral countries) 
experience a multitude of challenges, such as disease, cor-
rupt governments, high mortality rates, high fertility rates, and disruptions from natural hazards, the goal of economic deve  l  opment takes a bac  k  seat to daily survival.  
  Find something in your house (an item of clothing, an elec-
tronic device, etc.) and, using the Internet, try to trace the commodity chain of production. What steps did the item and its components go through before reac  h  ing you? Consider the types of economic processes that were oper-ating at each step and consider the roles go  v  ernments and international political regimes played along the way.    Field Note  
  “Before the 1970s, Gabon’s principal exports were manganese, hardwoods, and uranium ores. The discovery of oil off the Gabonese coast changed all that. This oil storage tank at the edge of Port Gentil is but one r  e  minder of a development that has transformed Gabon’s major port city—and the economy of the cou  n  try as a whole. Oil now accounts for 80 percent of Gabon’s export earnings, and that ﬁ  gure is climbing as oil prices rise and new discoveries are made. But how much the average citizen of Gabon is beneﬁ  ting from 
the oil eco  n  omy remains an open question. Even as health care and infrastructure needs remain unmet, the French public  a  tion   L’Autre Afrique   listed Gabon’s recently deceased ruler as the African leader with the largest real estate hold-ings in Pa  r  is.”

  Summary  
  The idea of economic development is relatively new; it implies a sense of progres-
sively improving a cou  n  try’s economic situation. The idea took hold in the wake of 
the Industrial Revolution. Geographers focus on the spatial structure of the economy, assessing how that structure inﬂ  uences the ability of states and regions to reach greater levels of economic development. Geographers also recognize that economic develop-ment in a single place is based on a multitude of factors, including the situation within the global eco  n  omy, the link the place plays in commodity chains, the efﬁ  cacy of gov-
ernment, the presence of disease, the health and well-being of the population, the pres-ence and amount of foreign debt, the success or failure of government policies, and the inﬂ  uence of nongovernmental programs. Geographers also realize that all of these pro  c  esses are operating concurrently across scales, making a country’s journey toward 
economic development much more complicated than climbing a la  d  der.

Driving across the semiarid ranchlands of western South Dakota, I noticed the 
presence of a crop in the landscape that was recently found only in the eastern, moister region of the state: soybeans (Fig. 11.1).
I called a colleague who works in agriculture at South Dakota State University 
to ask, “When did the cattle ranchers of western South Dakota start growing soy-beans?” He replied, “When the soy biodiesel plants started popping up in Nebraska and Kansas and when genetically modiﬁ  ed soybeans made it possible to grow the crop here.” He explained the development of Roundup Ready soybeans, a particu-lar genetically modiﬁ  ed soybean that can grow in more arid regions of the country.

366 Chapter 11   Agriculture
First, you plant the soybean; then you use an airplane to spray Roundup, a com-
mon weed killer that is manufactured by the company that produces the Roundup Ready soybeans, over the ﬁ  eld. The application of Roundup over the entire ﬁ  eld 
saves a lot of time and energy for the farmers because the genetically modiﬁ  ed 
soybeans are resistant to the Roundup, but the weeds are killed. Monsanto, the company that produces Roundup, has developed soybeans, corn, cotton, and other crops that are resistant to Roundup.
Counter to the genetically modiﬁ  ed Roundup Ready crops, organic 
agriculture—the production of crops without the use of synthetic or industrially produced pesticides and fertilizers—is also on the rise in North America. In wealthier parts of the world, the demand for organic products has risen exponen-tially in recent years. Sales of organic food in the United States, for example, went from under $200 million in 1980 to $1.5 billion by the early 1990s to over $10 billion by 2003 and $24.8 billion in 2009. Organic foods are now just under 4 percent of all food sales in the country. The growth rate is so strong that some predict organic sales will approach 10 percent of total U.S. food sales within a decade. Parts of western Europe are already approaching that ﬁ  gure—notably Denmark, Sweden, 
Finland, and parts of Germany.
Agricultural ﬁ  elds are devoted to organic agriculture in the core, semi-periphery, 
and periphery. Fields devoted to organic agriculture produce all kinds of foodstuffs, including fruits, vegetables, coffee, tea, grains, nuts, and spices. Compared to all agri-cultural land, the organic segment is still quite small and relatively scattered, but a farmer who can gain organic certiﬁ  cation from a government or an internationally recognized third party is increasingly at a competitive advantage (Fig. 11.2).
Although organic crops are grown everywhere, most organic foods are sold in 
the global economic core: in the United States, Canada, Japan, Europe, and Australia. The best-selling organic crops in the United States are fruits and vegeta-bles, accounting for 39 percent of organic food sales, followed by nondairy bever-ages at 15 percent and dairy at 13 percent. Organic products typically cost more than conventional products in the grocery store. Nonetheless, a 2002 report issued by the United States Department of Agriculture explains that in 2000 organic foods crossed a threshold, moving out of health food stores and into supermarkets: “for the ﬁ  rst time, more organic food was purchased in conven-tional supermarkets than in any other venue.” Organic foods are sold in 54 percent of conventional grocery stores in the United States, with increasing demands for organic animal products such as meats and dairy.
Organic agriculture is an increasingly important part of agricultural produc-
tion and consumption in wealthier countries. In the core, organic farming has helped some farmers extract themselves to a degree from the control of large, external corporate interests by tapping a niche market. The role of organic agricul-ture in the periphery and semi-periphery is similar to that of other major cash crops: production is almost entirely for export to the global economic core. Yet, in the periphery and semi-periphery, when organic agriculture bears a fair trade certi-ﬁ cation, more wealth typically goes directly to the producers (see the discussion 
of fair trade coffee in the last section of this chapter).
The organic movement has some clear environmental beneﬁ  ts, particularly 
in reducing levels of synthetic chemicals in soil and water. The putative health and taste advantages of organic produce help ensure the continued growth of the organic movement. The continually increasing demand for organic products has led the United States Department of Agriculture to certify organic products in the country, giving some degree of standardization to organic agriculture.c11Agriculture.indd Page 366  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 366  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

In this chapter, we examine the origins of agriculture and trace the geography of 
changes in the production of food and the raising of livestock from the earliest domes-
tication of plants to such contemporary developments as genetic modiﬁ  cation and 
the turn toward large-scale agribusiness. In the process, we describe the early hearths of agriculture, the geography of technological changes in agriculture, the global pattern of agricultural production, and the imprint of agriculture on the cultural landscape.

368 Chapter 11   Agriculture
WHAT IS AGRICULTURE, AND WHERE DID 
AGRICULTURE BEGIN?
Agriculture is the deliberate tending of crops and 
livestock to produce food, feed, ﬁ  ber, and fuel. When we 
think about agriculture, we tend to think about the pro-duction of foodstuffs for humans. Grain is also used for feed, grains fed directly to livestock. Raising livestock for their milk, eggs, or meat makes up a large segment of U.S. agriculture. Feed also comes from the remnants of biofuel production, and in 2009, 25 percent of all grain produced in the United States was used to produce fuel for cars, not for human or animal consumption.
A common way of classifying economic activities is to 
focus on what is being produced. Economic activities that involve the extraction of economically valuable products from the earth, including agriculture, ranching, hunting and gathering, ﬁ  shing, forestry, mining, and quarrying, are called primary economic activities. Both the growing of food or feed and the raising of livestock are considered primary eco-nomic activities. Activities that take a primary product and change it into something else such as toys, ships, processed foods, chemicals, and buildings are secondary economic activities. Manufacturing is the principal secondary eco-nomic activity. Tertiary economic activities are those ser-vice industries that connect producers to consumers and facilitate commerce and trade or help people meet their needs. People who work as bankers, lawyers, doctors, teach-ers, nurses, salespeople, clerks, and secretaries belong to the tertiary sector. Some analysts separate specialized services into quaternary and quinary economic activities, distin-
guishing between those services concerned with information or the exchange of money or goods (quaternary) and those tied to research or higher education (quinary). In this chap-ter, however, for simplicity’s sake we limit ourselves to three categories: primary, secondary, and a broadly conceived ter-tiary or service sector.
By classifying economic activities into sectors and 
analyzing the percentage of the population employed in each sector, we can gain insight into how the production of goods is organized, as well as the employment struc-tures of different societies. As we explained in our discus-sions of world-systems theory in Chapters 8 and 10, the story of any product (such as wheat or rice) can be better illuminated by focusing on how the good is produced (the kinds of technology, research, wages, and education that go into its production), rather than focusing simply on what is produced. Examining the proportion of people employed in a given economic sector gives us a basic idea of how the good is produced. For example, in Guatemala the agriculture sector accounts for 13.5 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), yet 50 percent of the labor force is employed in agriculture. Contrast that with Canada, where the agriculture sector accounts for 2.3 percent of GDP and only 2 percent of the labor force is employed in agriculture. The tertiary sector in Canada accounts for 75 percent of the labor force and over 71 percent of GDP , and the tertiary sector in Guatemala accounts for 35 percent of the labor force and 62 percent of the country’s GDP .
These data do not tell us exactly how goods are pro-
duced, but they are revealing. The high proportion of the labor force involved in agriculture in Guatemala (relative to the role of agriculture in the GDP) tells us that agriculture is still quite labor dependent in Guatemala, implying a lack of mechanization. In Canada, the United States, and the rest of the global economic core, agriculture is produced on a large scale for commercial consumption. When agricul-tural goods are produced in these ways, the number of peo-ple working directly in the ﬁ  eld is quite small. In the United States, less than 2 percent of the workforce is involved in agricultural production. Thousands of others participate in supporting agricultural production by working in the ter-tiary sector as research scientists for universities, seed com-panies, or chemical (antibiotics, pesticides, and herbicides) producers; as lobbyists for industry groups such as wheat producers or cattle ranchers; as engineers who design farm implements; as the people who sell and repair the imple-ments; and as owners and clerks at retail establishments where farmers buy other farm and nonfarm goods.
In the United States, total agricultural production is at 
an all-time high, but the proportion of the labor force in agri-culture is at an all-time low. Mechanization and efﬁ  ciencies 
created by new technologies have led to a signiﬁ  cant decrease 
in the number of workers needed in agricultural production. In 1950, one farmer in the United States produced enough to feed 27 people; today, one farmer in the United States pro-duces enough to feed 135 people. The mechanization of agriculture goes beyond machinery such as combines and harvesters. New technologies include hybrid seeds and genetically engineered crops, pesticides, and herbicides, all of which are designed to increase yields. The drive toward economic efﬁ  ciency has meant that the average size of farms (acres in production) in the United States has been growing, regardless of the kind of agricultural good produced. The U.S. Department of Agriculture keeps data showing the dol-lar value of agricultural production. The farms with the highest total production have at least $500,000 in annual production in 2007 dollars. These high-producing farms accounted for 53.7 percent of agricultural goods produced in 2007 (compared with 28.9 percent in 1989).
Agriculture in the United States has changed enor-
mously in the last decade. A recent study by the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences identiﬁ  es four major issues that affect food security world-
wide: “1) varying abilities to balance production and con-sumption across regions and countries, 2) accelerating conversions of agricultural land to urban uses, 3) increas-ingly energy-intensive food production methods in a world c11Agriculture.indd Page 368  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 368  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

of shrinking fossil fuel resources, and 4) expanding use of 
food crops for biofuel production.” Agricultural production changes rapidly as farmers worldwide react to price ﬂ  uctua-
tions in fossil fuels, seeds, fertilizers, crops, and land.
T o set the stage for understanding the contemporary 
agriculture picture, in the next section of the chapter, we discuss how people lived before the origins of agriculture and the circumstances that gave rise to the domestication of plants and animals many millennia ago.
Hunting, Gathering, and Fishing
Before the advent of agriculture, hunting, gathering, and ﬁ shing were the most common means of subsistence 
throughout the world. Of course, what people hunted or gathered depended on where they lived. North America provides a good example of the diversity of regional special-izations among hunter-gatherers. The oak forests of parts of North America provided an abundant harvest of nuts, sometimes enough to last more than a full year; American Indian communities living in and around these forests therefore collected and stored this food source. Other American Indians living near the Paciﬁ  c Ocean became adept at salmon ﬁ  shing. The bison herds of the Great Plains provided sustenance, and so bison served as a focal point for many plains cultures. In the colder climates of North America, people followed the migrations of the caribou herds. In the north, in the coastal zone stretching from present-day Alaska to Russia, the Aleut developed special-ized techniques for ﬁ  shing and for sea mammal hunting.
The size of hunting and gathering clans varied 
according to climate and resource availability. Hunting and gathering communities in areas of abundance could support larger populations. People living on the margins of forests could gather food in the forest when hunting yielded poor results and then return to hunting when cir-cumstances improved.
Terrain and Tools
Before developing agriculture, hunter-gatherers worked on perfecting tools, controlling ﬁ  res, and adapting environ-ments to their needs. The ﬁ  rst tools used in hunting were simple clubs—tree limbs that were thin at one end and thick and heavy at the other. The use of bone and stone and the development of spears made hunting far more effective. The fashioning of stone into hand axes and, later, handle axes was a crucial innovation that enabled hunters to skin their prey and cut the meat; it also made it possible to cut down trees and build better shelters and tools.
The controlled use of ﬁ  re was another important early 
achievement of human communities. The ﬁ  rst opportuni-
ties to control ﬁ  re were offered by natural conditions (light-ning, spontaneous combustion of surface-heated coal). Archaeological digs of ancient settlement sites suggest that people would capture a ﬁ  re caused accidentally and would work to keep the ﬁ  re burning continuously. Later, people learned that ﬁ  re could be generated by rapid hand rotation of a wooden stick in a small hole surrounded by dry tinder. Fire became the focal point of settlements, and the camp-ﬁ re took on symbolic and functional importance. It was a 
means of making foods digestible, and it was used to drive animals into traps or over cliffs.
In addition to hunting game on land, humans har-
vested shellﬁ  sh, trapped ﬁ  sh by cutting small patches of 
standing water off from the open sea, and invented tools to catch ﬁ  sh, including harpoons, hooks, and baskets.
Using tools and ﬁ  re, human communities altered their 
environments, which helped to establish more reliable food supplies. Along with hunting and gathering, early humans were adept at keeping track of the migration cycles of ﬁ  sh 
and other animals. American Indians along the Paciﬁ  c Coast 
and on Arctic shores, the Ainu of Japan and coastal East Asia, and communities in coastal western Europe caught salmon as they swam up rivers and negotiated rapids and falls. Archaeologists have found huge accumulations of ﬁ  sh 
bones at prehistoric sites near salmon runs.
Hunter-gatherers migrated to take advantage of cycli-
cal movements of animals and to avoid exhausting the supply of edible plants in any one area. After the summer salmon runs, people hunted deer during the fall and again in the spring, taking advantage of seasonal movements to trap deer where they crossed rivers or in narrow valleys. During the winter, people lived off dried meat and other stored foods.
The First Agricultural Revolution
Out of areas of plenty came agriculture, the deliberate tend-ing of crops and livestock to produce food, feed, ﬁ  ber, and 
fuel. Geographer Carl Sauer believed the experiments nec-essary to establish agriculture and settle in one place would occur in lands of plenty. Only in such places could people afford to experiment with raising plants or take the time to capture animals and breed them for domestication. Sauer studied the geography of the First Agricultural Revolution, focusing on the location of agriculture hearths and what kinds of agricultural innovations took place in those hearths.
Where did plant domestication begin? Sauer, who 
spent a lifetime studying cultural origins and diffusion, suggested that Southeast and South  Asia may have been 
the scene, more than 14,000 years ago, of the ﬁ  rst domesti-
cation of tropical plants. There, he believed, the combina-tion of human settlements, forest margins, and fresh water streams may have given rise to the earliest planned cultiva-tion of root crops—crops that are reproduced by cultivat-ing either the roots or cuttings from the plants (such as tubers, including manioc or cassava, yams, and sweet pota-toes in the tropics). A similar but later development may have taken place in northwestern South America.c11Agriculture.indd Page 369  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 369  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
370 Chapter 11   Agriculture
The planned cultivation of seed crops, plants that 
are reproduced by cultivating seeds, is a more complex 
process, involving seed selection, sowing, watering, and well-timed harvesting. Again, the practice seems to have developed in more than one area and at different times. Some scholars believe that the ﬁ  rst domestication of seed plants occurred in the Nile River Valley in North Africa, but the majority view is that this crucial development took place in a region of Southwest Asia (also called the Fertile Crescent), through which ﬂ  ow the two major rivers of 
present-day Iraq: the Tigris and the Euphrates (Fig. 11.3). The cultivation of seed crops marked the beginning of what has been called the First Agricultural Revolution.
Archaeologists note that a number of changes 
occurred in Southwest Asia along with plant domestica-tion. First, the plants themselves changed because peo-ple would choose seeds from the largest, heartiest plants to save for planting, yielding domesticated plants that grew larger over time than their counterparts in the wild. Archaeologists in Southwest Asia have found pre-served seeds, which tell them which plants were being domesticated and when. The grain crops wheat and bar-ley grew well in the warm Southwest Asian climate. Soon, people found that the river-inundated plains of Mesopotamia provided irrigable ﬁ  elds for farming. Agriculture provided a reliable food source, and grain surpluses enabled people to store grain for long-term distribution and use and to settle permanently in one place. In the process, the population of settlements began to increase.

 What Is Agriculture, and Where Did Agriculture Begin? 371
Figure 11.4 depicts the global distribution of plant 
domestication hearths. In Southeast Asia (Region 1), taro, 
yams, and bananas were the leading food plants. In Southwest Asia (Region 4), plant domestication centered on wheat, barley, and other grains. In the Mesoamerican region (Region 6), the basic plants were maize (corn), squashes, and several kinds of beans.
Archaeologists continually ﬁ  nd new sites to excavate, 
and as places are analyzed further, academics revise their assumptions about the timing of the emergence of agricul-tural hearths. The Central China hearth (Region 7) has recently attracted greater attention because new evidence supports a much earlier development of agriculture in this region—so early, in fact, that Chinese farmers may have been among the world’s ﬁ  rst. Another agricultural source region lies in West Africa (Region 9). Archaeological research on agriculture in this area is relatively recent, and analysts are not certain whether agriculture developed independently there.
T able 11.1 may be overwhelming at ﬁ  rst glance, but 
it is worth careful attention. It reveals the enormous range of crops that were cultivated around the world, as well as how, at various times and in different locales, particular groups of crops became the mainstays of life. Soon the knowledge needed to farm such crops diffused outward from these agricultural hearths. For example, both millet and sorghum diffused from the West African region—millet to India and sorghum to China.In many cases, what we now think of as centers of 
production of particular crops are not the places where those crops were originally domesticated. The corn (maize) we associate with the American Corn Belt diffused from Mesoamerica (Region 6) into North America. Later, the Portuguese brought it across the Atlantic, and corn became a staple in much of Africa. The white potato we associate with Ireland and Idaho came originally from the Andean highlands but was brought to Europe in the 1600s where it became a staple from Ireland to the eastern expanses of the North European Plain. The banana we associate with Mesoamerica came from Southeast Asia, as did a variety of yams. Diffusion of crops and seeds was greatly accelerated by worldwide trade and communica-tions networks established with the development of mer-cantilism and European colonialism.
Domestication of Animals
Some scholars believe that animal domestication began earlier than plant cultivation, but others argue that animal domestication began as recently as 8000 years ago—well after crop agriculture. Whichever is the case, goats, pigs, and sheep became part of a rapidly growing array of domes-ticated animals, and in captivity they changed considerably from their wild state. As with the growing of root crops, the notion of animal domestication must have emerged over time, in stages.

 What Is Agriculture, and Where Did Agriculture Begin? 373
The process of animal domestication began as peo-
ple became more sedentary. People kept animals for cer-
emonial purposes as well as for pets or for other reasons. Quite possibly, animals attached themselves to human settlements as scavengers (foraging through garbage near human settlements) and even for protection against predators, thus reinforcing the idea that they might be tamed and kept. Orphaned young probably were adopted as pets; some wild animals were docile and easily penned up. Goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains (in the Fertile Crescent) as long as 10,000 years ago; sheep some 9500 years ago in Anatolia (T urkey); and pigs and cattle shortly thereafter. The advantages of ani-mal domestication—their use as beasts of burden, as a source of meat, and as providers of milk—stimulated the rapid diffusion of this idea among interlinked places and gave the sedentary farmers of Southwest Asia and else-where a new measure of security.
Archaeological research indicates that when animals 
such as wild cattle are penned in a corral, they undergo physical changes over time. In a pen, animals are pro-tected from predators, allowing the survival of animals that would have been killed in the wild. Our domestic ver-sions of the goat, the pig, the cow, and the horse differ considerably from those ﬁ  rst kept by our ancestors. In 
early animal domestication, people chose the more docile, often smaller animals to breed. Archaeologists discern the beginnings of animal domestication in a region by inspect-ing the bones of excavated animals. They look for places where bones get smaller over time, as this usually indi-cates early domestication.
As with plant domestication, archaeologists can 
use the combination of bone fragments and tools to identify general areas where the domestication of par-ticular animals occurred. In Southwest Asia and adja-cent parts of the Mediterranean basin, people domesti-cated the goat, sheep, and camel. Southeast Asians domesticated several kinds of pigs, the water buffalo, chickens, and some water fowl (ducks, geese). In East India and West Burma (South Asia), people domesti-cated cattle, and cattle came to occupy an important place in the regional culture. In Central Asia, people domesticated the yak, horse, some species of goats, and sheep. In the Mesoamerica and the Andean Highlands, early Americans domesticated the llama and alpaca, along with a species of pig and the turkey.
Some species of animals may have been domesti-
cated almost simultaneously in different places. The water buffalo, for example, was probably domesticated in both Southeast and South Asia during the same period. Camels were domesticated in both western and eastern ends of Southwest Asia. The pig was domesticated in numerous areas. Different species of cattle were domesticated in regions other than South Asia. Dogs and cats attached themselves to human settlements very early (they may have been the ﬁ  rst animals to be domesticated) and in widely separated regions. Single, speciﬁ  c hearths can be 
pinpointed for only a few animals, including the llama and the alpaca, the yak, the turkey, and the reindeer.
Efforts to domesticate animals continue today. In East 
Africa, people are attempting to domesticate the eland, to serve as a source of meat in a region where a stable protein source is greatly needed. Several experimental stations in the savanna are trying to ﬁ  nd ways to domesticate Africa’s 
wildlife. They have had some success with a species of eland, but less so with various species of gazelles; they have been unable to domesticate the buffalo (Fig. 11.5). In fact, throughout the world only some 40 species of higher ani-mals have ever been domesticated—and most of these were domesticated long ago. Jared Diamond, author of Guns, 
Germs, and Steel, explains that only ﬁ  ve domesticated mam-mals are important throughout the world: the cow, sheep, goat, pig, and horse. According to Diamond, if we select only the big (over 100 pounds), herbivorous, terrestrial ani-mals, we have 148 species that meet these criteria in the “wild.” Only 14 of those 148 have been domesticated suc-cessfully, and each of these 14 was domesticated at least 4500 years ago. Modern attempts at animal domestication, even those driven by knowledgeable geneticists, have failed because of problems with the animal’s diet, growth rate, breeding, disposition, or social structure.
Thus, the process of animal domestication, set in 
motion more than 8000 (and perhaps as long as 14,000) years ago, continues. The integrated use of domesticated plants and domesticated animals eased the work burden for early farmers. Animal waste fertilized crops, animals pulled plows, and crops fed animals. The ﬁ  rst place where domesticated plants and animals were successfully inte-grated was Southwest Asia (the Fertile Crescent).
Subsistence Agriculture
Subsistence agriculture—growing only enough food to survive—was the norm throughout most of human his-tory. Subsistence farmers often hold land in common; sur-pluses are shared by all the members of the community; accumulation of personal wealth is restricted; and indi-vidual advancement at the cost of the group as a whole is limited. Subsistence agriculture declined during the 1900s with the diffusion of industrialized agriculture and the goal of constantly increasing production both to feed growing populations and to sell more agricultural goods. The United States and other industrialized countries sought to move farmers “beyond” subsistence into indus-trialized production as part of development programs begun in the 1960s (see Chapter 10).
A return to subsistence agriculture has taken hold in 
parts of the world where farmers feel production for the global market has not beneﬁ  ted them either ﬁ  nancially or 
culturally. For example, indigenous people in the southern c11Agriculture.indd Page 373  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 373  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
Mexican states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Guerrero have 
largely returned to subsistence agriculture. The Nation  
reported in 2010 that Zapatista farmers have “in effect chosen to withdraw from the national economy, some weaning themselves off expensive chemical fertilizers and 
subsisting on corn they can grow , harvest, and barter.”
Some subsistence farmers are sedentary, living in one 
place throughout the year, but many others move from place to place in search of better land. The latter engage in a form of agriculture known as shifting cultivation. This type of agriculture is found primarily in tropical and subtropical zones, where traditional farmers had to abandon plots of land after the soil became infertile. Once stripped of their natural vegetative cover and deprived of the constant input of nutri-ents from decaying vegetative matter on the forest ﬂ  oor, soils 
in these regions can quickly lose their nutrients as rain water leaches out organic matter. Faced with these circumstances, farmers move to another parcel of land, clear the vegetation, turn the soil, and try again. Shifting cultivation gave ancient farmers opportunities to experiment with various plants, to learn the effects of weeding and crop care, to cope with envi-ronmental vagaries, and to discern the decreased fertility of soil after sustained farming.
With shifting cultivation, parcels of land are worked 
successively. The farmers ﬁ  rst clear vegetation from a par-cel of land. Next they plant crops that are native to the region: tubers in the humid, warm tropical areas, grains in the more humid subtropics, and vegetables and fruits in cooler zones. When the village grows too large and the distance to usable land becomes too great, part of the vil-lage’s population may establish a new settlement some distance away. Population densities in areas of shifting agri-
culture cannot be very high; therefore, shifting cultivation continues only in areas where population densities are low.
One speciﬁ  c kind of shifting cultivation is slash-and-
burn agriculture (also called swidden, milpa, or patch Field Note
“Attempts to tame wildlife started in ancient times, and still continue. At Hunter’s Lodge on the Nairobi-Mombasa road, we met an agricultural ofﬁ  cer who reported that an animal domestication experiment station was located not far into the bush, about 10 miles south. On his invitation, we spent the next day observing this work. In some herds, domestic animals (goats) were combined with wild gazelles, all penned together in a large enclosure. This was not work-ing well; all day the gazelles seek to escape. By comparison, these eland were docile, manageable, and in good health. Importantly, they also were reproducing in captivity. Here, our host describes the program.”

agriculture), reﬂ  ecting the central role of the controlled use 
of ﬁ re in places where this technique is used. T rees are cut 
down and all existing vegetation is burned off. In slash-and-burn, farmers use tools (machetes and knives) to slash down trees and tall vegetation, and then burn the vegetation on the ground. A layer of ash from the ﬁ  re settles on the ground and contributes to the soil’s fertility.
As we discuss in the next section, agriculture has fun-
damentally changed since shifting cultivation was the global norm, but hundreds of millions of farmers continue to practice some form of subsistence agriculture.
Settling down in one place, a rising population, and the switch to agriculture are interrelated occurrences in human history. Hypothesize which of these three happened ﬁ  rst, 
second, and third and explain why.
HOW DID AGRICULTURE CHANGE 
WITH INDUSTRIALIZATION?
For the Industrial Revolution (see Chapter 12) to 
take root, a Second Agricultural Revolution had to take 
place—one that would move agriculture beyond subsis-tence to generate the kinds of surpluses needed to feed thousands of people working in factories instead of in agricultural ﬁ  elds. Like the Industrial Revolution, the 
Second Agricultural Revolution was composed of a series of innovations, improvements, and techniques, in this case initially in Great Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, and other neighboring countries.
By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European 
farming underwent signiﬁ  cant changes. New crops came into Europe from trade with the Americas, including corn and potatoes. Many of the new crops were well suited for the cli-mate and soils of western Europe, bringing new lands (previ-ously deﬁ  ned as marginal) into cultivation.
The governments of Europe helped create the condi-
tions necessary for the Second Agricultural Revolution by passing laws such as Great Britain’s Enclosure Act, which encouraged consolidation of ﬁ  elds into large, single-owner 
holdings. Farmers increased the size of their farms, pieced together more contiguous parcels of land, fenced in their land, and instituted ﬁ  eld rotation. Methods of soil prepara-tion, fertilization, crop care, and harvesting improved.
New technologies improved production as well. The 
seed drill enabled farmers to avoid wasting seeds and to plant in rows, making it simpler to distinguish weeds from crops. By the 1830s, farmers were using new fertilizers on crops and feeding artiﬁ  cial feeds to livestock. Increased agricultural output made it possible to feed much larger urban populations, enabling the growth of a secondary (industrial) economy. In 1831, Cyrus McCormick, a farmer in Lexington, Virginia, perfected his father’s design for a mechanical reaper (Fig. 11.6). At the time, farmers

were limited in their production not by what they could 
sow (plant), but what they could reap (harvest) because harvesting required much more time and labor than plant-ing. Harvesting involved laborers cutting grain with a scythe followed by more laborers who bundled the grain into bales. McCormick’s mechanical reaper, which was pulled by horses, both cut and bundled grain. His inven-tion took off in the 1840s purportedly increasing yields of individual farmers by at least ten times. McCormick’s com-pany eventually became International Harvester and now Case IH, one of the largest agriculture implement compa-nies in the world today.
Advances in breeding livestock enabled farmers to 
develop new breeds that were either strong milk produc-ers or good for beef. The most common breeds of dairy cattle found in North America today trace their lineage back to the Second Agricultural Revolution in Europe. In the 1700s and 1800s, European farmers bred dairy cattle to adapt to different climates and topography. For exam-ple, the black and white Holstein dairy cow came from the Netherlands and is well suited to graze on grass and pro-duce high quantities of milk. Scottish farmers bred the red and white Ayrshire breed of dairy cattle to produce milk well suited for butter and cheese and to forage for food in rough, rocky topography.
Innovations in machinery that occurred with the 
Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s and early 1900s helped sustain the Second Agricultural Revolution. The railroad helped move agriculture into new regions, such as the United States’ Great Plains. Geographer John Hudson traced the major role railroads and agriculture played in changing the landscape of that region from open prairie to individual farmsteads. The railroad companies advertised in Europe to attract immigrants to the Great Plains region, and the railroads took the new migrants to their new towns, where they would transform lands from prairie grass to agricultural ﬁ  elds. Later, the internal com-
bustible engine made possible the invention of tractors, combines, and a multitude of large farm equipment. New banking and lending practices helped farmers afford the new equipment.
Understanding the Spatial Layout of Agriculture
When commercial agriculture is geared to producing food for people who live in a nearby town or city, a geo-graphichal pattern of land use based on the “perishability” of products and cost of transportation often emerges. In the 1800s, Johann Heinrich von Thünen (1783–1850) experienced the Second Agricultural Revolution ﬁ  rst-
hand: he farmed an estate not far from the town of Rostock, in northeast Germany. Studying the spatial pat-terns of farming around towns such as Rostock, von Thünen noted that as one moved away from the town,  Figure 11.7

noted that this process occurred without any visible change in soil, climate, or terrain. When he mapped this pattern, he found that each town or market center was surrounded by a set of more-or-less concentric rings within which particular commodities or crops dominated.
Nearest the town, farmers produced commodities 
that were perishable and commanded high prices, such as dairy products and strawberries. In this zone, much effort would go into production in part because of the value of the land closer to the city. In von Thünen’s time, the town was still surrounded by a belt of forest that provided wood for fuel and building; but immediately beyond the forest the ring-like pattern of agriculture continued. In the next ring crops were less perishable and bulkier, including wheat and other grains. Still farther out, livestock raising began to replace ﬁ  eld crops.
Von Thünen used these observations to build a 
model of the spatial distribution of agricultural activities around settlements (Fig. 11.7). As with all models, he had to make certain assumptions. For example, he assumed that the terrain was ﬂ  at, that soils and other environmen-tal conditions were the same everywhere, and that there were no barriers to transportation to market. Under such circumstances, he reasoned, transport costs would govern c11Agriculture.indd Page 376  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 376  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

the use of land. He reasoned that the greater the distance 
to market, the higher the transport costs that had to be added to the cost of producing a crop or commodity.
The Von Thünen model (including the ring of for-
est) is often described as the ﬁ  rst effort to analyze the spa-tial character of economic activity. The Thünian patterns discerned in many parts of the world are not solely the result of the forces modeled by von Thünen. Differences in climate type and soil quality weigh heavily on the kinds of goods produced in a place. Y et if you drive east out of Denver, heading for Nebraska, you cannot miss a certain concentric zonation that puts dairying and market gar-dening nearest the city, cash grains such as corn (plus soy-beans) in the next “ring,” more extensive grain farming and livestock raising beyond, and cattle ranching in the outermost zone.
Geographer Lee Liu studied the spatial pattern of 
agricultural production in one province of China, giving careful consideration to the intensity of the production methods and the amount of land degradation. Liu found that the farmers living in a village would farm lands close to the village as well as lands far away from the village with high levels of intensity. However, the methods used varied spatially, resulting in land improvements close to the vil-lage and land degradation farther from the village. In lands close to the village, farmers improved lands through “decades of intensive care,” in particular putting organic material onto the ﬁ  elds, which made the grasslands close to the village “fertile and productive.” In lands more remote from the village, farmers tended to use more “chemical fertilizer, pesticides, and herbicides” and fewer conservation tactics, resulting in land degradation, whereby “the originally fertile remote land became degraded.” Liu argued that this pattern in modern China occurs in large part because farmers live in the village, not in the remote ﬁ  elds, and therefore put most of their time 
and energy into the ﬁ  elds closest to them.
Even when agricultural production does not conform 
to the concentric rings of von Thünen’s model, his under-lying concern with the interplay of land use and transpor-tation costs frequently still explains agricultural patterns. The fresh ﬂ  owers grown in the Caribbean for sale in New Y ork City could be viewed as the application of the von Thünen model on a larger scale, for it is less expensive to grow ﬂ  owers in the Caribbean and ship them to New Y ork 
City than it is to grow them in other locations.
The Third Agricultural Revolution
The Third Agricultural Revolution, also called the 
Green Revolution, dates as far back as the 1930s, when agricultural scientists in the American Midwest began experimenting with technologically manipulated seed varieties to increase crop yields. In the 1940s, American philanthropists funded research on maize (corn) produc-tion in Mexico, trying to ﬁ  nd a hybrid seed that would grow better. They did, and by 1960 Mexico was no longer importing corn because production within the country was high enough to meet demand. In the 1960s, the focal point of the Green Revolution shifted to India, when sci-entists at a research institution in the Philippines crossed a dwarf Chinese variety of rice with an Indonesian variety and produced IR8. This new rice plant had a number of desirable properties: it developed a bigger head of grain, and it had a stronger stem that did not collapse under the added weight of the bigger head. IR8 produced much bet-ter yields than either of its parents, but the researchers were not satisﬁ  ed. In 1982 they produced IR36, bred from 
13 parents to achieve genetic resistance against 15 pests and a growing cycle of 110 days under warm conditions, thus making possible three crops per year in some places. By 1992, IR36 was the most widely grown crop on Earth, and in September 1994, scientists developed a strain of rice that was even more productive than IR36. In addition to improving the production of rice, the Green Revolution brought new high-yield varieties of wheat and corn from the United States to other parts of the world, particularly South and Southeast Asia.
Coming at a time of growing concern about global 
hunger, the increased yields of the Green Revolution were truly extraordinary. In subsequent decades, most famines resulted from political instability rather than failure in production. India became self-sufﬁ  cient in grain produc-
tion by the 1980s, and Asia as a whole saw a two-thirds increase in rice production between 1970 and 1995. These drastic increases in production stemmed not only from new seed varieties but also from the use of fertilizers, pes-ticides, irrigation in some places, and signiﬁ  cant capital 
improvements.
The geographical impact of the Green Revolution 
is highly variable, however. Its traditional focus on rice, wheat, and corn means that it has had only limited impact throughout much of Africa, where agriculture is based on different crops and where lower soil fertility makes agriculture less attractive to foreign investment. But innovations are continually being developed. Researchers at the International Rice Research Institute, for example, are working to breed a genetically modiﬁ  ed 
“super rice” that will not have to be transplanted as seed-lings but can be seeded directly in the paddy soil. It may yield nearly twice as much rice per acre than the average for strains in current use. The charting of the genome of rice (the 12 chromosomes that carry all of the plant’s characteristics) may make it possible to transform rice genetically so that it will continuously acquire more desirable properties. Not only could yields improve; so could resistance to diseases and pests.
Increasingly, researchers are turning their attention 
to new agricultural products, and this could expand the c11Agriculture.indd Page 377  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 377  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

geographical impact of the Green Revolution. Research 
has already led to methods for producing high-yield cas-sava and sorghum—both of which are grown in Africa. Beyond Africa, research on fattening livestock faster and improving the appearance of fruits is having an impact in North and South America.
The promise of increasing food production in a 
world in which almost a billion people are malnourished has led many people to support genetically engineered foods. Others, however, question whether gene manipula-tion could create health risks and produce environmental hazards. Environmentalists have speculated about the impacts of pollen dispersal from genetically modiﬁ  ed 
plants and the potential for disease-resistant plants to spur the evolution of super-pests. Moreover, the large-scale monocropping that is often part of Green Revolution agriculture can make farms vulnerable to changes in cli-mate or the infestation of particular pests. One vocal opponent of the Green Revolution in India, Vandana Shiva, argues that
[t]he Green Revolution has been a failure. It has led to reduced genetic diversity, increased vulnerability to pests, soil erosion, water shortages, reduced soil fertility, micronu-trient deﬁ  ciencies, soil contamination, reduced availability of nutritious food crops for the local population, the displace-ment of vast numbers of small farmers from their land, rural impoverishment and increased tensions and conﬂ  icts. 
The beneﬁ  ciaries have been the agrochemical industry, large petrochemical companies, manufacturers of agricul-tural machinery, dam builders and large landowners.
It is no easy matter to weigh the enormous increases in food production that have occurred in places that have adopted Green Revolution approaches against the types of social and environmental issues highlighted by Shiva.
There is growing concern that higher inputs of 
chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides associated with Green Revolution agriculture can lead to reduced organic matter in the soil and to groundwater pollution. Moreover, the Green Revolution has worked against the interest of many small-scale farmers who lack the 
resources to acquire genetically enhanced seeds and the necessary chemical inputs to grow them.
A 2005 report in Scientiﬁ  c American explains that the 
Green Revolution has done little to alleviate poverty in areas where most farmers still work small plots of land: “The supply-driven strategies of the Green Revolution, however, may not help subsistence farmers, who must play to their strengths to compete in the global market-place. The average size of a family farm is less than four acres in India, 1.8 acres in Bangladesh and about half an acre in China.” Smaller farmers are in a poor competitive position, and their position is further undermined by the fact that a few large corporations with the seed patents for genetically modiﬁ  ed grains and a virtual monopoly of the 
needed chemical inputs can have tremendous power over the agricultural production process. In addition, the need for capital from the West to implement Green Revolution technologies has led to a shift away from production for local consumers toward export agriculture. In the process, local places become subject to the vicissitudes of the global economy, where a downward ﬂ  uctuation in the 
price of a given crop can create enormous problems for places dependent on the sale of that crop.
New Genetically Modiﬁ  ed Foods
An entire ﬁ  eld of biotechnology has sprung up in con-
junction with the Third Agricultural Revolution, and the development of genetically engineered crops (GE) or genetically modiﬁ  ed organisms (GMOs) is its principal 
target. Since the origin of agriculture, people have experi-mented with hybrid crops and cross-breeding of animals. T oday, according to the Grocery Manufacturers of America, genetically modiﬁ  ed organisms are found in 75 
percent of all processed foods in the United States. The United States leads the world in the production of geneti-cally engineered crops, with 88 percent of all acres in corn (up from 25 percent in 2000) and 94 percent of all acres in soybeans (up from 54 percent in 2000) sown with geneti-cally engineered seeds.
Some regions have embraced genetically engineered 
crops, and others have banned them. Many of the poorer countries of the world do not have access to the necessary capital and technology. Moreover, ideological resistance to genetically engineered foods is strong in some places—particularly in western Europe. Agricultural ofﬁ  cials in 
most west European countries have declared genetically modiﬁ  ed foods to be safe, but in many places, the public has 
a strong reaction against them based on combined concerns about health and taste. Such concerns have spread to less afﬂ uent parts of the world as well. In many poorer regions, 
seeds are a cultural commodity, reﬂ  ecting agricultural 
lessons learned over generations. In these regions, many resist the invasion of foreign, genetically engineered crops.
Regional and Local Change
Recent shifts from subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture have had dramatic impacts on rural life. Land-use patterns, land ownership arrangements, and agricul-tural labor conditions have all changed as rural residents cope with shifting economic, political, and environmental conditions. In Latin America, dramatic increases in the production of export crops (or cash crops such as fruits and coffee) have occurred at the expense of crop production for local consumption. In the process, subsistence farming has been pushed to ever more marginal lands. In Asia, c11Agriculture.indd Page 378  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 378  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
where the Green Revolution has had the greatest impact, 
the production of cereal crops (grains such as rice and wheat) has increased for both foreign and domestic mar-kets. Agricultural production in this region remains rela-tively small in scale and quite dependent on manual labor. In Subsaharan Africa, total commercialized agriculture has increased, but overall agricultural exports have decreased. As in Asia, farm units in Subsaharan Africa have remained relatively small and dependent on intensi-ﬁ ed manual labor.
What this regional-scale analysis does not tell us is 
how these changes have affected local rural communities. These changes can be environmental, economic, and social. A recent study in the small country of Gambia (West Africa) by Judith Carney has shown how changing agricultural practices have altered not only the rural envi-ronment and economy, but also relations between men and women (Fig. 11.8). Over the last 30 years, interna-tional developmental assistance to Gambia has led to ambitious projects designed to convert wetlands to irri-gated agricultural lands, making possible production of rice year-round. By the late 1980s, virtually all of the country’s suitable wetlands had been converted to year-round rice production. This transformation created ten-sions within rural households by converting lands women traditionally used for family subsistence into commercial-ized farming plots. In addition, when rice production was turned into a year-round occupation, women found them-selves with less time for other activities crucial for house-hold maintenance.
This situation underscores the fact that in Africa, as 
in much of the rest of the less industrialized world, agri-cultural work is overwhelmingly carried out by women. In Subsaharan Africa and South Asia, 60 percent of all employed females work in the agriculture sector. A geo-graphical perspective helps to shed light on how changes in agricultural practices throughout the world not only alter rural landscapes but also affect family and commu-nity relationships.

I am interested in women and rural develop-
ment in Subsaharan Africa. In 1983, I went to Gambia to study an irrigated rice project that was being implemented to improve the availability of rice, the dietary staple. What grabbed my attention? The donors’ assur-ance that the project would beneﬁ  t women, 
the country’s traditional rice growers. Imag-ine my surprise a few months after project implementation when I encountered hun-dreds of angry women refusing to work because they received nothing for their labor from the ﬁ  rst harvest.
In registering women’s traditional rice 
plots as “family” land, project ofﬁ  cials effec-
tively sabotaged the equity objectives of the donors. Control now was concentrated under male heads of household who reaped the income produced by female labor. Contemporary economic strategies for Africa depend increasingly upon labor intensiﬁ  -
cation. But whose labor? Human geography provides a way of seeing the signiﬁ  cance of gender in the power relations that mediate culture, environment, and economic development.

change their livelihoods. In many cases, the state places 
pressures on hunter-gatherers to settle in one place and farm. Cyclical migration by hunter-gatherers does not mesh well with bounded, territorial states. Some nongov-ernmental organizations encourage settlement by digging wells or building medical buildings, permanent houses, or schools for hunter-gatherers. Even hunter-gatherers who continue to use their knowledge of seeds, roots, fruits, berries, insects, and animals to gather and trap the goods they need for survival do so in the context of the world-economy.
Unlike hunting and gathering, subsistence farming 
continues to be a relatively common practice in Africa, Middle America, tropical South America, and parts of Southeast Asia (Fig. 11.9). The system of cultivation has changed little over thousands of years. The term subsis-
tence can be used in the strictest sense of the word—that is, to refer to farmers who grow food only to sustain them-selves and their families, and ﬁ  nd building materials and 
ﬁ rewood in the natural environment, and who do not 
enter into the cash economy at all. This deﬁ  nition ﬁ  ts 
farmers in remote areas of South and Middle America, Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. Y et many farm fam-ilies living at the subsistence level sometimes sell a small quantity of produce (perhaps to pay taxes). They are not subsistence farmers in the strict sense, but the term subsis-tence is surely applicable to societies where farmers with small plots periodically sell a few pounds of grain on the market but where poverty, indebtedness, and tenancy are ways of life. For the indigenous peoples of the Amazon Basin, the sedentary farmers of Africa’s savanna areas, vil-lagers in much of India, and peasants in Indonesia, subsis-tence is not only a way of life but a state of mind. Experience has taught farmers and their families that sub-sistence farming is often precarious and that times of comparative plenty will be followed by times of scarcity.
Subsistence farming has been in retreat for centu-
ries. From 1500 to 1950, European powers sought to “modernize” the economies of their colonies by ending subsistence farming and integrating farmers into colonial systems of production and exchange. Sometimes their methods were harsh: by demanding that farmers pay some taxes, they forced subsistence farmers to begin selling some of their produce to raise the necessary cash. They also compelled many subsistence farmers to devote some land to a crop to be sold on the world market such as cot-ton, thus bringing them into the commercial economy. The colonial powers encouraged commercial farming by conducting soil surveys, building irrigation systems, and establishing lending agencies that provided loans to farm-ers. The colonial powers sought to make proﬁ  ts, yet it was difﬁ cult to squeeze very much from subsistence-farming 
areas. Forced cropping schemes were designed to solve this problem. If farmers in a subsistence area cultivated a certain acreage of, say, corn, they were required to grow a speciﬁ  ed acreage of a cash crop as well. Whether this crop 
would be grown on old land that was formerly used for grain or on newly cleared land was the farmers’ decision. If no new lands were available, the farmers would have to give up food crops for the compulsory cash crops. In many

areas, severe famines resulted and local economies were 
disrupted.
Subsistence land use continues to give way to more 
intensive farming and cash cropping—even to mecha-nized farming in which equipment does much of the actual work. In the process, societies from South America to Southeast Asia are being profoundly affected. Land that was once held communally is being parceled out to individuals for cash cropping. In the process, small land-owners are often squeezed out, leaving the land in the hands of wealthier farmers and the owners of commercial-ized farming operations.
For too long, the question has been how “to tempt 
[subsistence farmers] into wanting cash by the availability of suitable consumer goods,” as A. N. Duckham and G. B. Maseﬁ  eld wrote in Farming Systems of the World in 1970. 
In the interests of “progress” and “modernization,” sub-sistence farmers were pushed away from their traditional modes of livelihood even though many aspects of subsis-tence farming may be worth preserving. Regions with shifting cultivation do not have neat rows of plants, care-fully turned soil, or precisely laid-out ﬁ  elds. Y et shifting cultivation conserves both forest and soil; its harvests are often substantial given environmental limitations; and it requires better organization than one might assume. It also requires substantially less energy than more modern techniques of farming. It is no surprise, then, that shifting cultivation and speciﬁ  cally slash-and-burn agriculture 
have been a sustained method of farming for thousands of years.
Many arguments have been raised about the impacts of the Green Revolution, both pro and con. How might the scale at which the Green Revolution is examined affect the arguments that are made about it? What types of fac-tors are likely to be considered if the question is, “has the Green Revolution been good for Asia” as opposed to “has the Green Revolution been good for a village or a particular agricultural community in India?”
WHAT IMPRINT DOES AGRICULTURE MAKE 
ON THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE?
Flying from the West Coast of the United States to 
the East Coast, if you have a window seat you will see the 
major imprint agriculture makes on the American cultural landscape. The green circles standing out in the grain belts of the country are places where center-pivot irrigation systems circle around a pivot, providing irrigation to a circle of crops. The checkerboard pattern on the land-scape reﬂ  ects the pattern of land survey system and land ownership in much of the country.
The pattern of land ownership seen in the landscape 
reﬂ ects the cadastral system—the method of land survey 
through which land ownership and property lines are deﬁ ned. Cadastral systems were adopted in places where 
settlement could be regulated by law, and land surveys were crucial to their implementation. The prevailing sur-vey system throughout much of the United States, the one that appears as checkerboards across agricultural ﬁ  elds, is 
the rectangular survey system. The U.S. government 
adopted the rectangular survey system after the American Revolution as part of a cadastral system known as the township-and-range system. Designed to facilitate the movement of non-Indians evenly across farmlands of the United States interior, the system imposed a rigid grid 
like pattern on the land (Fig. 11.10). The basic unit was the 1 square mile section—and land was bought and sold in whole, half, or quarter sections. The section’s lines were drawn without reference to the terrain, and they thus imposed a remarkable uniformity across the land. Under the Homestead Act, a homesteader received one section of land (160 acres) after living on the land for ﬁ  ve years 
and making improvements to it. The pattern of farms on the landscape in the interior of the United States reﬂ  ects 
the township-and-range system, with farms spaced by sec-tions, half sections, or quarter sections.
The imprint of the rectangular survey system is evi-
dent in Canada as well, where the government adopted a similar cadastral system as it sought to allocate land in the Prairie Provinces. In portions of the United States and Canada different cadastral patterns predominate, how-ever (Fig. 11.11). These patterns reﬂ  ect particular notions 
of how land should be divided and used. Among the most signiﬁ  cant are the metes and bounds survey approach 
adopted along the eastern seaboard, in which natural fea-tures were used to demarcate irregular parcels of land. One of the most distinct regional approaches to land divi-sion can be found in the Canadian Maritimes and in parts of Quebec, Louisiana, and T exas where a long-lot survey system was implemented. This system divided land into narrow parcels stretching back from rivers, roads, or canals. It reﬂ  ects a particular approach to surveying that was common in French America.
Many parts of the world do not have cadastral sys-
tems, so ﬁ  eld patterns are irregular. But whether regular or irregular, societies with property ownership have par-cels of land divided into neat, clearly demarcated seg-ments. The size and order of those parcels are heavily inﬂ uenced not just by land partition schemes, but also by 
rules about property inheritance. In systems where one child inherits all of the land—such as the traditional Germanic practice of primogeniture in which all land c11Agriculture.indd Page 381  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 381  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

passes to the eldest son—parcels tend to be larger and 
farmers work a single plot of land. This is the norm in Northern Europe and in the principal areas of Northern European colonization—the Americas, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.
In areas where land is divided among heirs, however, 
considerable fragmentation can occur over time. The lat-ter is the norm throughout much of Asia, Africa, and Southern Europe, as well as most of the allotted Indian reservations in the United States, meaning that farmers living in villages in these areas tend a variety of scattered small plots of land. In some places, land reform initiatives have consolidated landholdings to some degree, but frag-mentation is still common in many parts of the world.
Villages
Throughout this book we take note of various core-periphery contrasts our world presents. Such contrasts are prominent in rural as well as urban areas. T raditional farm-village life is still common in India, Subsaharan Africa, China, and Southeast Asia. In India, farming, much of it subsistence farming, still occupies over 60 percent of the population. As we have seen, however, in the world’s core areas agriculture has taken on a very dif-ferent form, and true farm villages, in which farming or providing services for farmers are the dominant activi-ties, are disappearing. In the United States, where farm-ing once was the leading economic activity, only some 2 percent of the labor force remains engaged in agricul-ture, and the population of most rural villages and towns is a mix of farmers and people who commute to 
work in urban areas.
T raditionally, the people who lived in villages either 
farmed the surrounding land or provided services to those who did the farming. Thus, they were closely connected to the land, and most of their livelihoods depended, directly or indirectly, on the cultivation of nearby farm-land. As such, they tended to reﬂ  ect historical and envi-
ronmental conditions. Houses in Japanese farming villages, for example, are so tightly packed together that only the narrowest passageways remain between them. This village form reﬂ  ects the need to allocate every possi-ble square foot of land to farming; villages must not use land where crops could grow.
Unlike Japan, in the United States Midwest individ-
ual farmhouses lie quite far apart in what we call a dispersed settlement pattern; the land is intensively cultivated but by machine rather than by hand. In the populous Indonesian island of Java, villages are located every half mile or so along a rural road, and settlement there is deﬁ  ned as 
nucleated. Land use is just as intense, but the work is done by people and animals. Hence, when we consider the den-sity of human settlement as it relates to the intensity of land use, we should keep in mind the way the land is culti-vated. Nucleated settlement is by far the most prevalent 
rural residential pattern in agricultural areas (Fig. 11.12). When houses are grouped together in tiny clusters or hamlets, or in slightly larger clusters we call villages, their spatial arrangement also has signiﬁ  cance.
In the hilly regions of Europe, villages frequently are 
clustered on hills, leaving the level land for farming. Often

an old castle sits atop the hill, so in earlier times the site 
offered protection as well as land conservation. In many low-lying areas of western Europe, villages are located on dikes and levees, so that they often take on linear charac-teristics (Fig. 11.13A). Villages oriented along roads also have this characteristic. Where there is space, a house and outbuildings may be surrounded by a small garden; the farms and pasturelands lie just beyond. In other cases, a village may take on the characteristics of a cluster (Fig. 11.13B). It may have begun as a small hamlet at the 
intersection of two roads and then developed by accre-tion. The European version of the East African circular village, with its central cattle corral, is the round village or rundling (Fig. 11.13C). This layout was ﬁ  rst used by Slavic farmer-herdsmen in eastern Europe and was later modi-ﬁ ed by Germanic settlers.
In many parts of the world, farm villages were forti-
ﬁ ed to protect their inhabitants against marauders. T en 
thousand years ago, the ﬁ  rst farmers in the Fertile 
Crescent faced attacks from the horsemen of Asia’s steppes and clustered together to ward off this danger. In Nigeria’s Y orubaland, the farmers would go out into the surround-ing ﬁ  elds by day but retreat to the protection of walled villages at night. Villages, as well as larger towns and cities in Europe, were frequently walled and surrounded by moats. When the population became so large that people had to build houses outside the original wall, a new wall would be built to protect them as well. Walled villages  (Fig. 11.13D) still exist in rural areas of many countries—
reminders of a turbulent past.
More modern villages, notably planned rural settle-
ments, may be arranged on a grid pattern (Fig. 11.13E). Grid patterns are not, however, a twentieth-century invention. Centuries ago the Spanish invaders of Middle America laid out grid villages and towns, as did other colo-nial powers elsewhere in the world. In urban Africa, such imprints of colonization are pervasive.
Although the twentieth century has witnessed unprec-
edented urban growth throughout the world, half of the world’s people still reside in villages and rural areas. As total world population increases, total population in rural areas is increasing in many parts of the world (even though the proportion of the total population in rural areas may be stagnant or declining). In China alone, approximately 50 percent of the more than 1.3 billion people live in rural areas. In India, with a population over 1 billion, about 70 percent of the people live in places the government deﬁ  nes 
as nonurban. Small rural settlements are home to most of the inhabitants of Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and other countries of the global economic periphery, includ-ing those in Africa. The agrarian village remains one of the most common forms of settlement on Earth.
In some places, rural villages have changed as the 
global economy has changed. For example, Mexico has experienced rapid economic change since passage of the North American Free T rade Act (NAFTA) in 1992. Along

 What Imprint Does Agriculture Make on the Cultural Landscape?  385
with major shifts in industrial production (see Chapter 12), 
major changes in agricultural production and village life have occurred in Mexico. Before the passage of NAFTA, the Mexican government protected corn production because white corn in a staple crop used to make tortillas, the main bread source, in Mexico. Through protection, Mexico’s corn prices were higher than in the United States. With the passage of NAFTA, Mexico entered a 15-year transition away from protecting its corn production. Economists believed the price of corn in Mexico would fall and in turn Mexicans would produce less corn.
What happened instead is that corn prices in Mexico 
ﬂ uctuated over time, tortilla prices rose, and then produc-
tion of corn in Mexico increased. T ortilla prices rose in response to higher prices for corn in the United States as a result of corn being used for fuel. Mexican farmers increased corn production both because of a higher demand for corn in the United States and Mexico and also because indigenous farmers in the south switched to sub-sistence farming of corn to provide for their families and to remove themselves from the ﬂ  uctuating global agricul-ture market and the uncertainties of NAFTA.
Functional Differentiation within Villages
Villages everywhere display certain common qualities, including evidence of social stratiﬁ  cation and differentia-tion of buildings. The range in size and quality of houses, representing their owners’ wealth and standing in the com-munity, reﬂ  ects social stratiﬁ  cation. Material well-being is 
the chief determinant of stratiﬁ  cation in Western commer-cial agricultural regions, where it translates into more elab-orate homes. In Africa, as in most other places, a higher social position in the community is associated with a more impressive house. The house of the chief or headman may not only be more elaborate than others but may also be in a more prominent location. In India, caste still strongly inﬂ  u-
ences daily life, including village housing; the manors of landlords, often comprising large walled compounds, stand in striking contrast to the modest houses of domestic ser-vants, farm workers, carpenters, and craftspeople. The poorest people of the lowest castes live in small one-room, wattle-and-thatch dwellings. In Cambodia, the buildings in stilt villages built throughout the Mekong Basin look simi-lar (Fig. 11.14). The building along the pond in the left foreground of Figure 11.14 has a different function—it is an outhouse. Its location on the pond accounts for a major part of the pollution problem in this village: waste from the outhouses drains directly into the pond, which has become mosquito-infested and severely polluted.
The functional differentiation (like the functional 
zonation of cities whereby different areas of the village play different roles and function differently) of buildings within farm villages is more elaborate in some societies than in

others. Protection of livestock and storage of harvested 
crops are primary functions of farm villages, and in many villages where subsistence farming is the prevailing way of life, the storage place for grains and other food is con-structed with as much care as the best-built house. Moisture and vermin must be kept away from stored food; containers of grain often stand on stilts under a carefully thatched roof or behind walls made of carefully maintained sun-dried mud. In India’s villages, the paddy-bin made of mud (in which rice is stored) often stands inside the house. Similarly, livestock pens are often attached to houses, or, as in Africa, dwellings are built in a circle surrounding the corral.
The functional differentiation of buildings is greatest 
in Western cultures, where a single farmstead may contain as many buildings as an entire hamlet elsewhere in the world. A prosperous North American farm is likely to include a two-story farmhouse, a stable, a barn, and various outbuildings, including a garage for motorized equipment, a workshop, a shed for tools, and a silo for grain storage (Fig. 11.15). The space these structures occupy can exceed that used by entire villages in Japan, China, and other agrarian regions where space is at a greater premium.
Think of an agricultural region where you have visited or lived. Describe the imprint of agriculture on the landscape and consider what the cultural landscape tells you about how agriculture is produced in this region or how produc-tion has changed over time.HOW IS AGRICULTURE CURRENTLY 
ORGANIZED GEOGRAPHICALLY, AND HOW HAS AGRIBUSINESS INFLUENCED THE CONTEMPORARY GEOGRAPHY OF AGRICULTURE?
Understanding global agricultural patterns requires 
looking at more than market location, land use, and trans-
portation costs—the factors analyzed by von Thünen. We must also consider the effects of different climate and soil conditions, variations in farming methods and technol-ogy, the role of governments and social norms, and the lasting impacts of history. Decisions made by colonial powers in Europe led to the establishment of plantations from Middle America to Malaysia. The plantations grew crops not for local markets but for consumers in Europe; similarly, U.S. companies founded huge plantations in the Americas. Over the past few centuries, the impact of this plantation system transformed the map of world agricul-ture. The end of colonial rule did not signal the end of the agricultural practices and systems that had been imposed on the former colonial areas. Even food-poor countries must continue to grow commercial crops for export on some of their best soils where their own food could instead be harvested. Long-entrenched agricultural systems and patterns are not quickly or easily transformed.
Commercial farming has come to dominate in the 
world’s economic core, as well as some of the places in the semi-periphery and periphery. Commercial farming is 
the agriculture of large-scale grain producers and cattle ranches, mechanized equipment and factory-type labor  Figure 11.15

forces, of plantations and proﬁ  t. It is a world apart from 
the traditional farms of Asia and Africa.
The spatial expansion of modern commercial agri-
culture began in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when Europe became a market for agricultural products from around the world: Moreover, European countries manufactured and sold in their colonies the ﬁ  nished prod-
ucts made from imported raw materials. Thus, cotton grown in Egypt, Sudan, India, and other countries colo-nized by Europe was bought cheaply, imported to European factories, and made into clothes—many of which were then exported and sold, often in the very colo-nies where the cotton had been grown in the ﬁ  rst place.
Major changes in transportation and food storage, 
especially refrigeration, further intertwined agricultural production and food processing regions around the world during the twentieth century (Fig. 11.16). The beef indus-try of Argentina, for example, secured a world market when the invention of refrigerated ships made it possible to transport a highly perishable commodity over long dis-tances. European colonial powers required farmers in their colonies to cultivate speciﬁ  c crops. One major impact of 
colonial agriculture was the establishment of monocul-
ture (dependence on a single agricultural commodity) throughout much of the colonial world. Colonies became known for certain crops, and colonizers came to rely on those crops. Ghanaians still raise cacao; Moçambiquans still grow cotton; and Sri Lankans still produce tea. The production of cash crops in poorer countries is still per-petuated by loan and aid requirements from lending coun-tries, the World T rade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank (see Chapter 10).The World Map of Climates
Before we can study the distribution of agriculture in the world today, we need to examine Figure 11.17, the distri-bution of climate zones. All of the elements of weather, absorption of the sun’s energy, rotation of the Earth, cir-culation of the oceans, movement of weather systems, and the jet stream, produce a pattern of climates represented in the map—and those climate patterns have a profound impact on what can be grown where. We owe this remark-able map to Wladimir Köppen (1846–1940), who devised a scheme called the Köppen climate classiﬁ  cation 
system  for classifying the world’s climates on the basis of 
temperature and precipitation.
Köppen’s map provides one means of understanding 
the distribution of climatic regions (areas with similar climatic characteristics) across the planet. The legend looks complicated, but it really is not; here is one of those maps worth spending some time on. For present pur-poses, it is enough to get a sense of the distribution of the major types of climate. The letter categories in the legend give a clear indication of the conditions they represent.
The (A) climates are hot or very warm and generally 
humid. The “no dry season” (Af) regions are equatorial 
rainforest regions. The “short dry season” (Am) climate is known as the monsoon climate. And if you can envisage an African savanna, you know what the (Aw, savanna) desig-nation means.
Once you realize that the yellow and light brown 
colors on the map represent dry climates (BW, desert and BS, steppe), it becomes clear how much of the world has 
limited water availability. Nonetheless, some very large Field Note
“The technology of refrigeration has kept pace with the containerization of seaborne freight trafﬁ  c. When we sailed into the port of Dunedin, New Zealand, I was unsure of just what those red boxes were. Closer inspection revealed that they are refrigeration units, to which incoming containers are attached. Meats and other perishables can thus be kept frozen until they are transferred to a refrig-erator ship.”

population clusters have developed in these water-
deﬁ cient regions, especially at lower (and warmer) lati-
tudes. The world faces a long-term water crisis, and the Köppen map helps show why.
The (C) climates also have familiar names. The (Cf) 
climate, represented by dark green, prevails over the southeastern United States. If you know the local climate in Atlanta or Nashville or Jacksonville, you understand why this climate is often called “humid temperate.” It is moist, and it does not get as cold as it does in Canada or as warm (continuously, anyway) as in the Amazon Basin. If you have experienced this kind of climate, the map gives you a good idea of what it’s like in much of eastern China, southeastern Australia, and a large part of southeastern South America.
The “dry summer” (C) climates are known as 
Mediterranean climates (the small s in Cs means that sum-mers are dry). This mild climate occurs not only around the Mediterranean Sea, and thus in the famous wine coun-tries of France, Italy, and Spain, but also in California, Chile, South Africa’s Cape, and southern parts of Australia. So you know what kind of climate to expect in Rome, San Francisco, Santiago, Cape T own, and Adelaide.
Farther toward the poles, the planet gets rather cold. 
Note that the (D) climates dominate in the United States’ upper Midwest and Canada, but it gets even colder in 2

Siberia. The “milder” (Da) climates (here the key is the 
small a, which denotes a warm summer) are found only in limited parts of Eurasia. Winters are very cold in all the (D) climates and downright frigid (and long) in the (Dfb) and (Dfc) regions. (D) climates are generally continental, on the interior of continents, instead of on coasts. Continental locations make (D) climates generally drier than (C) climates. The continentality of (D) climates also contributes to the large range of temperatures found across the year because land heats and cools much faster than water.
Polar climates, where tundra and ice prevail, are 
found poleward of (D) climates. The polar location of (E) climates means temperatures are cold throughout the year. As a result, plant life does not break down and nour-ish the soil during the year, and also a layer of permafrost (frozen ground) exists year round.
The World Map of Agriculture
When comparing the world map of agriculture (Fig. 11.18) with the distribution of climate types across the world (Fig. 11.17), we can see the correlation between climate and agriculture. For example, drier lands rely on livestock ranching, whereas moister climates are marked with grain SOUTHERN OCEANATLANTIC

production. Understanding the major agricultural zones 
shown in Figure 11.18 requires looking at both environ-mental and social variables.
Cash Crops and Plantation Agriculture
Colonialism profoundly shaped nonsubsistence farming in many poorer countries. Colonial powers implemented agri-culture systems to beneﬁ  t their needs, a practice that has tended to lock poorer countries into production of one or two “cash” crops. Cash farming continues to provide badly needed money, even if the conditions of sale to the urban-industrial world are unfavorable. In the Caribbean region, for example, whole national economies depend on sugar exports (sugar having been introduced by the European col-onists in the 1600s). These island countries wish to sell the sugar at the highest possible price, but they are not in a posi-tion to dictate prices. Sugar is produced by many countries in various parts of the world, as well as by farmers in the global economic core (Fig. 11.18). Governments in the core place quotas on imports of agricultural products and subsi-dize domestic production of the same commodities.
Occasionally, producing countries consider forming 
a cartel in order to present a united front to the importing countries and to gain a better price, as  oil-producing 
states did during the 1970s. Such collective action is dif-ﬁ cult, as the wealthy importing countries can buy prod-
ucts from countries that are not members of the cartel.  Figure 11.18

may stimulate domestic production among importers. For example, although cane sugar accounts for more than 70 percent of the commercial world sugar crop each year, farmers in the United States, Europe, and Russia produce sugar from sugar beets. In Europe and Russia, these beets already yield 25 percent of the annual world sugar har-vest. Collective action by countries producing sugarcane could easily cause that percentage to increase.
When cash crops are grown on large estates, we use 
the term plantation agriculture to describe the produc-tion system. Plantations are colonial legacies that persist in poorer, primarily tropical, countries along with sub-sistence farming. Figure 11.18 shows that plantation agriculture (7 in the legend) continues in Middle and South America, Africa, and South Asia. Laid out to pro-duce bananas, sugar, coffee, and cocoa in Middle and South America, rubber, cocoa, and tea in West and East Africa, tea in South Asia, and rubber in Southeast Asia, these plantations have outlasted the period of decoloni-zation and continue to provide specialized crops to wealthier markets. Many of the most productive planta-tions are owned by European or American individuals or corporations.
Multinational corporations have tenaciously pro-
tected their economic interests in plantations. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Guatemalan government began an agrarian reform program. The plan entailed renting unused land Tropic of Cancer

from foreign corporations to landless citizens at a low 
appraised value. The United Fruit Company, an American ﬁ rm with extensive holdings in the country, was greatly 
concerned by this turn of events. The company had close ties to powerful individuals in the American government, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, CIA director Allen Dulles (the two were brothers), and Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs John Moors Cabot. In 1954, the United States supported the over-throw of the government of Guatemala because of stated concerns about the spread of communism. This ended all land reform initiatives, however, leading many commenta-tors to question the degree to which the United Fruit Company was behind the coup. Indeed, with the exception of President Dwight Eisenhower, every individual involved in the decision to help topple Guatemala’s government had ties to the company. This example illustrates the inextrica-ble links between economics and political motivations—and it raises questions about the degree to which multina-tional corporations based in wealthy countries inﬂ  uence 
decisions about politics, agriculture, and land reform in other parts of the world.
Commercial Livestock, Fruit, 
and Grain Agriculture
As Figure 11.18 shows, by far the largest areas of commer-
cial agriculture (1 through 4 in the legend) lie outside the tropics. Dairying (1) is widespread at the northern mar-gins of the midlatitudes—particularly in the northeastern United States and in northwestern Europe. Fruit, truck, and specialized crops (2), including the market gardens von Thünen observed around Rostock, are found in the eastern and southeastern United States and in widely dis-persed small areas where environments are favorable. In Central Asia and the Sahara, major oases stand out as commercial agriculture on the map.
Mixed livestock and crop farming (3) is widespread in 
the more humid parts of the midlatitudes, including much of the eastern United States, western Europe, and western Russia, but it is also found in smaller areas in Uruguay, Brazil, and South Africa. Commercial grain farming (4) prevails in the drier parts of the midlatitudes, including the southern Prairie Provinces of Canada, in the Dakotas and Montana in the United States, as well as in Nebraska, Kansas, and adja-cent areas. Spring wheat (planted in the spring and harvested in the summer) grows in the northern zone, and winter wheat (planted in the autumn and harvested in the spring of the following year) is used in the southern area. An even larger belt of wheat farming extends from Ukraine through Russia into Kazakhstan. The Argentinean and Australian wheat zones are smaller in area, but their exports are an important component of world trade.
Even a cursory glance at Figure 11.18 reveals the wide 
distribution of livestock ranching (12), the raising of domesticated animals for the production of meat and by-products, such as leather and wool. In addition to the large cattle-ranching areas in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, much of eastern Brazil and Argentina are devoted to ranching, along with large tracts of Australia and New Zealand, as well as South Africa. Y ou may see a Thünian pattern here: livestock ranching on the periphery and con-sumers in the cities. Refrigeration has overcome the prob-lem of perishability, and high volume has lowered the unit cost of transporting beef, lamb, and other animal products.
Subsistence Agriculture
The map of world agriculture labels three types of subsis-tence agriculture: subsistence crop and livestock farming; intensively subsistence farming (chieﬂ  y rice); and inten-sively subsistence farming (chieﬂ  y wheat and other crops). 
In some regions that are labeled as subsistence, that label does not tell the whole story. For example, in Southeast Asia, rice is grown on small plots and is labor-intensive, so that subsistence and export production occur side by side. Despite the region’s signiﬁ  cant rice exports, most 
Southeast Asian farmers are subsistence farmers. Thus, Southeast Asia appears on the map as primarily a subsis-tence grain-growing area.
Mediterranean Agriculture
Only one form of agriculture mentioned in the legend of Figure 11.18 refers to a particular climatic zone: Mediterranean agriculture (6). As the map shows, this kind of specialized farming occurs only in areas where the dry summer Mediterranean climate prevails (Fig. 11.17): along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, in parts of California and Oregon, in central Chile, at South Africa’s Cape, and in parts of southwestern and southern Australia. Farmers here grow a special combination of crops: grapes, olives, citrus fruits, ﬁ  gs, certain vegetables, dates, and oth-
ers. From these areas come many wines; these and other commodities are exported to distant markets because Mediterranean products tend to be popular and command high prices.
Drug Agriculture
There are important agricultural activities that cannot easily be mapped at the global scale and therefore do not appear in Figure 11.18. One of those is the cultivation of crops that are turned into illegal drugs. Because of the high demand for drugs—particularly in the global eco-nomic core—farmers in the periphery often ﬁ  nd it more 
proﬁ table to cultivate poppy, coca, or marijuana plants 
than to grow standard food crops. Cultivation of these plants has increased steadily over the past several decades, and they now constitute an important source of revenue c11Agriculture.indd Page 392  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 392  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

for parts of the global economic periphery. Coca, the 
source plant of cocaine, is grown widely in Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. Over half of the world’s cultivation of coca occurs in Colombia alone.
Heroin and opium are derived from opium poppy 
plants, grown predominantly in Southeast and South Asia, especially in Afghanistan and Myanmar. In the 2008 World Drug Report, the United Nations reported that 92 percent of the world’s opium production took place in Afghanistan. The United States-led overthrow of the T aliban in Afghanistan in 2001 created a power vacuum in the country and an opportunity for illegal drug produc-tion to quickly rebound (the austere T aliban government had virtually eradicated opium production in Afghanistan by 2001). Most opium production in Afghanistan today occurs in ﬁ  ve unstable southern provinces.
United States government policies have affected 
production of illegal drugs in Latin America. During the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. government worked with local authorities to crack down on coca production in Colombia. With this crackdown, much of the drug pro-duction and trafﬁ  cking moved north to northern Mexico. 
In June 2005, the Economist quoted one American ofﬁ  cial 
as reporting that “Mexican criminal gangs ‘exert more inﬂ uence over drug trafﬁ  cking in the U.S. than any other 
group.’ Mexicans now control 11 of the 13 largest drug markets in the United States.” Marijuana and opium pro-duction in Mexico is on the rise, and the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) is concerned about the high potency of marijuana coming out of Mexico and Canada. Although more than 90 percent of the world’s opium production is in Afghanistan, most heroin (which is derived from opium) coming into the United States comes from Mexico or Colombia. The heroin consumed in the western United States comes from opium grown in Mexico, whereas the heroin consumed in eastern United States comes from opium grown in Colombia.
Drug cartels that oversee the drug trade have 
brought crime and violence to the places where they hold sway (Fig. 11.19). There are areas in Rio de Janeiro

where the ofﬁ  cial police have little control, and drug 
lords have imposed reigns of terror over swaths of the countryside in parts of Central and South America, Southwest Asia, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere. The drug trade depends on the voracious appetite for mind-altering substances in North America and Europe in particular.
The supply of marijuana in the United States tra-
ditionally comes from Mexico and Canada, as the DEA has reported. But an increasing amount of marijuana consumed in the United States is grown in the United States. Since 1996, a total of 16 states in the United States have legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes. In addition to Alaska, Hawaii, Michigan, Maine, Vermont, New Jersey and Rhode Island, most of the states with medicinal marijuana are in the western United States. Marijuana production for legal and ille-gal consumption in the United States is estimated to be “the largest cash crop in the United States.” An April 2011 article in the New York Times valued marijuana 
production at $40 billion, “with California, T ennessee, Kentucky, Hawaii and Washington the top ﬁ  ve produc-
tion states,” despite the fact that medicinal marijuana is not legal in T ennessee or Kentucky.
Marijuana production has more than a monetary 
impact. Energy analyst Evan Mills distributed a study in April 2011 that estimates the energy consumed in pro-ducing marijuana in the United States costs about $5 bil-lion a year and accounts for 1 percent of all power con-sumed in the United States. Marijuana grown outdoors has much lower energy costs than marijuana grown indoors. Growers plant crops on public lands, especially in the west, because the remote location of public lands makes detection less likely for growers. Also, the land is public and therefore not owned by any one person to whom a crop could be traced. Marijuana grown indoors consumes massive amounts of electricity. The cost of indoor production includes grow lamps that are the kinds used in operating rooms, dehumidiﬁ  ers, air condi-tioners, electric generators, water pumps, heaters, carbon dioxide generators, ventilation systems, and electrical control systems.
Informal Agriculture
Small-scale informal agricultural activities are also miss-ing from maps of global agricultural patterns, yet these play an important role in the contemporary world. Millions of people cultivate small plots of land in and around their homes for domestic consumption or to trade informally with others. These activities are not captured by formal agricultural statistics, but the food that is grown in this fashion plays a vital role in the lives of literally billions of people. Even city dwellers in many parts of the world are involved in small-scale agricultural activities—cultivating or raising livestock in small plots of land around their dwellings, on rooftop gardens, or in community gardens. Such practices are encouraged in some places—notably China—but more often they are ignored, or even discouraged. Y et the contribution urban agriculture can make to the food security of city dwellers is attracting growing attention, and it is likely to grow in importance in the coming years.
Political Inﬂ  uences on Agriculture
As we noted above, the European colonial period provides a stunning example of the impact of political circum-stances on agriculture. Consider, for example, one of the most signiﬁ  cant contemporary cash crops: cotton. 
Colonialism encouraged the production of plantation-scale cotton in many regions of the world (e.g., India), and colonial powers established a trading network that led to the globalization of the cotton industry.
Cotton cultivation expanded greatly during the 
nineteenth century, when the Industrial Revolution pro-duced machines for cotton ginning, spinning, and weav-ing that increased productive capacity, brought prices down, and put cotton goods within the reach of mass markets. As with sugar, the colonial powers laid out large-scale cotton plantations, sometimes under irrigation. Cotton cultivation was also promoted on a smaller scale in numerous other countries: in Egypt’s Nile Delta, in the Punjab region shared by Pakistan and India, and in Sudan, Uganda, Mexico, and Brazil. The colonial pro-ducers received low prices for their cotton, and the European industries prospered as cheap raw materials were converted into large quantities of items for sale at home and abroad.
Wealthier countries continue to buy cotton, and cot-
ton sales remain important for some former colonies. But they now compete with cotton being grown in the United States, Northeast China, and Central Asia. Moreover, cotton is in competition today with synthetic ﬁ  bers such 
as nylon and rayon. As global supply and demand shifts in response to changing markets and new alternatives, econ-omies that have been built around cotton production can go through wrenching adjustments.
Even as countries emerged from colonial control, 
they were left with a legacy of large landholdings owned or controlled by wealthy individuals or business entities. That legacy contributed to uprisings among the rural poor in places such as Mexico, Cuba, and Guatemala. Efforts on the part of governmental authorities in some ex-colonies to confront this situation provide a different c11Agriculture.indd Page 394  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 394  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Is Agriculture Currently Organized Geographically, and How Has Agribusiness Inﬂ  uenced the Contemporary Geography of Agricu lture?    395
example of the impact of politics on agriculture. In some 
cases governments enacted policies that perpetuated preexisting inequalities; in others land reforms were introduced that served to redistribute land to individuals or communities. The latter were common in parts of Central and South America, leading to a substantial reorganization of the rural landscape—sometimes spreading wealth more broadly. Pressure for land reform continues in many countries, and land issues are at the heart of many social movements in the global economic periphery and semi-periphery.
A more mundane, but common, way in which gov-
ernments inﬂ  uence agriculture is through tax regulations 
and subsidies favoring certain land uses. The U.S. gov-ernment currently spends more than $10 billion subsidiz-ing large-scale farmers. Pushed by a strong farm lobby, these subsidies guarantee ﬂ  oor prices for staple crops and 
protect farmers in bad years. They give large-scale agri-culture an advantage over smaller scale alternatives. But in the past 60 years perhaps the most dramatic examples of politics affecting agriculture have come from the com-munist world. The governments of the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, and Maoist China initiated far-reaching land reforms that led to the creation of large collective farms and agricultural communes. This giant experiment resulted in the massive displacement of rural peoples and irrevocably altered traditional rural social systems. T oday farming privatization is under way in both Russia and China.
Socio-cultural Inﬂ  uences on Agriculture
Agriculture is also affected by social and cultural factors. As incomes rise, many people start consuming more meat and processed foods, seek out better quality fruits and vegetables, or demand fresh produce year round. Consider the case of coffee, one the most important lux-
ury crops  in the modern world. Coffee was ﬁ  rst domesti-
cated in the region of present-day Ethiopia, but today it is grown primarily in Middle and South America, where approximately 70 percent of the world’s annual produc-tion is harvested.
In the early eighteenth century, coffee was virtually 
unknown in most of the world. Y et, after petroleum, cof-fee is now the second most valuable legally traded com-modity in the world. The United States buys more than half of all the coffee sold on world markets annually, and western Europe imports most of the rest. A well-known image of coffee production in North America is Juan Valdez, portrayed as a simple yet proud Colombian peas-ant who handpicks beans by day and enjoys a cup of his own coffee by night. This image is quite contrary to the reality of much coffee production in Latin America, however. In most cases coffee is produced on enormous, foreign-owned plantations, where it is picked by local laborers who are hired at very low wage rates. Most cof-fee is sent abroad; and if the coffee pickers drink coffee, it is probably of the imported and instant variety.
Recently, however, coffee production has under-
gone changes as more consumers demand fair trade coffee and more coffee producers seek fair trade certi-fication. CNN reports that “Retailers who are certi-fied Fair T raders return up to 40 percent of the retail price of an item to the producer.” Once a producer meets the requirements of organic coffee production and a few other criteria, that producer can be regis-tered on the International Fair T rade Coffee Register. Coffee importers then purchase the fair trade coffee directly from the registered producers. Being regis-tered guarantees coffee producers a “fair trade price” of $1.40 per pound of coffee (plus bonuses of $0.30 per pound for organic). Over 1.2 million farmers and workers in 58 countries, mainly in the periphery and semi-periphery, are connected to the 827 fair trade certiﬁ  ed producer organizations worldwide (Fig. 11.20). 
The fair trade campaign pressured Starbucks into sell-ing fair trade coffee, and in 2010, Starbucks committed to doubling the amount of fair trade coffee it pur-chases, which accounts for 40 percent of the fair trade coffee imported into the United States. Other retailers have followed suit; for example, all espresso sold at Dunkin’ Donuts in North America and Europe is fair trade certified. Fair trade coffee is available at large

retail outlets and under corporate brands at T arget, 
Wal-Mart, and Sam’s Club.
The push for fair trade production shows how social 
movements can inﬂ  uence agriculture. And fair trade goes 
beyond coffee. Dozens of commodities and products, ranging from tea, bananas, fresh cut ﬂ  owers, and choco-
late to soccer balls, can be certiﬁ  ed fair trade. According 
to Fair T rade Labeling Organizations International, con-sumers spent more than $4.84 billion on fair trade certi-ﬁ ed products in 2008.
People’s changing tastes also shape the geography of 
agriculture. T ea is a rather recent addition to the Western diet. It was grown in China perhaps 2000 years ago, but it became popular in Europe only during the nineteenth century. The colonial powers (mainly the British) estab-lished enormous tea plantations in Asia and thus began the full-scale ﬂ  ow of tea into European markets. T ea pro-duction, both the fair trade and the traditionally traded varieties, is on the rise globally to meet the increasing demand.
Even as social preferences shape agricultural pro-
duction, the consumption of particular products can have social consequences. Just a few decades ago, city dwellers in West Africa primarily consumed grains grown from nearby ﬁ  elds. Over the past three decades, relatively cheap 
imported rice from Malaysia and Thailand has become an important food source, and many locals came to prefer the taste of the imported rice. This set of circumstances left West Africa vulnerable when the price of imported grains skyrocketed in 2008. Local riots broke out and a food crisis ensued.
Agribusiness and the Changing Geography 
of Agriculture
The commercialization of crop production and the 
associated development of new agricultural technolo-gies have changed how agricultural goods are grown and have sparked the rapid growth of agribusiness. Agribusiness is an encompassing term for the busi-nesses that provide a vast array of goods and services to support the agricultural industry. Agribusiness serves to connect local farms to a spatially extensive web of pro-duction and exchange. At the same time, it fosters the spatial concentration of agricultural activities. Both of these trends are revealed in the development of the poultry industry in the United States.
Early in the twentieth century, poultry production in 
the United States was highly disaggregated, with many farmers raising a few chickens as part of a multifaceted farming operation. Over the past 50 years, however, poul-try production has fundamentally changed. T oday, the farmers on the Delmarva Peninsula account for 8 percent of poultry production in the United States, and they do so by contracting and working directly with four major poul-try companies. In an article on modern agriculture, David Lanegran summarized the impact of this transformation as follows:
T oday, chickens are produced by large agribusiness com-panies operating hatcheries, feed mills, and process-ing plants. They supply chicks and feed to the farm-ers. The farmers are responsible for building a house and maintaining proper temperature and water sup-ply. Once a week the companies ﬁ  ll the feed bins for the 
farmers, and guarantee them a price for the birds. The companies even collect market-ready birds and take them away for processing and marketing. Most of the nation’s poultry supply is handled by a half dozen very large corporations that control the process from chicks to chicken pieces in stores.
Lanegran goes on to show how selective breeding has produced faster growing, bigger chickens, which are housed in enormous broiler houses that are largely mechanized.
Broiler houses are concentrated in northwestern 
Arkansas, northern Georgia, the Delmarva Peninsula (Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia) east of Washington, D.C., the Piedmont areas of North Carolina, and the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia (Fig. 11.21). Lanegran shows that in many respects the “farmers” who manage these operations are involved in manufacturing as much or more than farming. They are as likely to spend their time talking to bank ofﬁ  cers, overseeing the repair of 
equipment, and negotiating with vendors as they are tend-ing their animals. As such, they symbolize the breakdown between the rural and the urban in wealthier parts of the world—as well as the interconnections between rural places and distant markets.
The poultry example is not unusual. During the 
1990s, hog production on the Oklahoma and T exas pan-handles increased rapidly with the arrival of corporate hog farms. John Fraser Hart and Chris Mayda described the quick change with statistics. In 1992, the U.S. Census of Agriculture counted just over 31,000 hogs marketed in T exas County, Oklahoma, and just four years later “the panhandle was plastered with proliferating pork places, and T exas County alone produced 2 million hogs. It was the epicenter of an area that produced 4 million hogs, 4 percent of the national total and one-seventh as many ﬁ nished hogs as the entire state of Iowa.” The availability 
of both inexpensive water and natural gas on the Oklahoma panhandle was enticing for corporate hog farms, which require both. Hart and Mayda explain that the “reasonable” price of land and the accessibility to “growing metropolitan markets of the South and the West” also made the region attractive for hog produc-tion. Similar to poultry production, a corporation built a c11Agriculture.indd Page 396  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 396  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

processing plant, and production (both by farms owned 
by the corporation and those owned privately) increased to meet the demand (Fig. 11.22).
Because of agribusiness, the range and variety of 
products on the shelves of urban supermarkets in the United States is a world apart from the constant quest for sufﬁ cient, nutritionally balanced food that exists in some 
places. A global network of farm production is oriented to the one-ﬁ  fth of the world’s population that is highly urbanized, wealthy, and powerful. Few farmers in distant lands have real control over land-use decisions, for the better off people in the global economic core continue to decide what will be bought at what price. The colonial era may have come to an end, but, as the map of agricultural regions reminds us, its imprint remains strong.Environmental Impacts of Commercial 
Agriculture
Commercial agriculture creates signiﬁ  cant environmen-
tal change. The growing demand for protein-rich foods 
and more efﬁ  cient technologies are leading to overﬁ  sh-
ing in many regions of the world. In many places ﬁ  sh 
stocks are declining at an alarming rate. From mid-cen-tury to the late 1980s, the ﬁ  sh harvest from oceans and seas increased ﬁ  vefold, and there seemed to be no limit to it. Countries quarreled over ﬁ  shing rights, poorer countries leased ﬁ  shing grounds to richer ones, and ﬂ eets of trawlers plied the oceans. International attempts 
to regulate ﬁ  shing industries failed. Then in the 1970s and 1980s, overﬁ  shing began destroying ﬁ  sh stocks.

cod ﬁ  sheries on Canada’s Grand Banks off Newfoundland 
collapsed. In 1975 biologists estimated the Atlantic blue-ﬁ n tuna population at 250,000; today the western stock is 
listed as critically endangered, and the stock in the Mediterranean is listed as endangered. From ocean perch and king crabs off Alaska to rock lobsters and roughies off New Zealand, ﬁ  sh and shellﬁ  sh populations 
are depleted. The total annual catch is also declining and may already be beyond the point of recovery. Much of the damage has already been done, and ﬁ  shing industries 
in many parts of the world have reported dwindling har-vests and missing species.
If you travel to Mediterranean Europe today you will 
see a landscape that reﬂ  ects the clearing of forests in ancient times to facilitate agriculture and trade. Look carefully at many hillslopes and you will see evidence of terraces cut into the hills many centuries ago. The indus-trialization and commercialization of agriculture has accelerated the pace and extent of agriculture’s impact on the environment in recent times. More land has been cleared, and the land that is under cultivation is ever more intensively used.
Signiﬁ  cant agriculturally driven changes to the envi-
ronment go far beyond the simple clearing of land. They range from soil erosion to changes in the organic content of soils to the presence of chemicals (herbicides, pesti-cides, even antibiotics and growth hormones from live-stock feces) in soils and groundwater. In places where large commercial crop farms dominate, the greatest con-cerns often center on the introduction of chemical fertil-izers and pesticides into the environment—as well as soil erosion.

genetically modiﬁ  ed crops carries with it another set of 
environmental concerns.
The growth of organic farming (discussed at the 
beginning of the chapter) and the move toward the use 
of local foods in some communities can beneﬁ  t the envi-ronment. Y et such initiatives have had only modest impacts on the majority of the world’s peoples and places. A telling sign is that the organic movement has had little effect on the production of the staple foods on which billions of people depend. Moreover, large cor-porate entities are playing an increasingly prominent role in the organic movement—raising controversies about standards and rendering illusory the ideal of an independent organic farmer engaged in “sustainable” agriculture. Nonetheless, better regulated organic farming and local food initiatives are clearly on the rise. Their proponents argue that they are priced out of the market by subsidies favoring large farms and by the failure of most agribusiness to incorporate the environmental and health costs of large-scale, intensive farming. And such arguments are gaining traction.
The environmental impacts of large-scale intensive 
agriculture can be particularly severe when agriculture moves into marginal environments, as has happened with the expansion of livestock herding into arid or semiarid areas (see the map of world climates, Fig. 11.17). The nat-ural vegetation in these areas cannot always sustain the herds, especially during prolonged droughts. As a result, ecological degradation and, in some areas, desertiﬁ  cation 
(see Chapter 10) are the result.
In recent decades, the popularity of fast-food chains 
that serve hamburgers has led to the deforestation of wooded areas in order to open up additional pastures for beef cattle, notably in Central and South America. Livestock ranching is an extremely land-, water-, and energy-intensive process. Signiﬁ  cant land must be turned 
over to the cultivation of cattle feed, and the animals themselves need extensive grazing areas. By stripping away vegetation, the animals can promote the erosion of river banks, with implications for everything from water quality to wildlife habitat.
The Challenge of Feeding Everyone
Food riots that break out in low-income countries and stories of famine in countries including Somalia, Sudan, Malawi, and Zimbabwe remind us that food security remains a challenge for millions of people around the globe. Although food production has expanded in some parts of the world, food production per capita has actually declined in Africa over the past decade. Worldwide, nearly 1 billion people are malnourished. Currently, enough food is produced worldwide to feed Earth’s population, but in the face of inadequate distribution systems and a widespread poverty, food security looms as a signiﬁ  cant 
issue for the twenty-ﬁ  rst century.
As cities expand outward, some of the most fertile, 
productive farmlands are lost to housing and retail devel-opments (Fig. 11.23). Many cities were established amid productive farmlands that could supply the needs of their inhabitants. Now the cities are absorbing the productive farmlands as they expand. Between 1987 and 1992, China lost more than one million hectares of farmland to urban-ization. In the United States, the American Farmland T rust, identiﬁ  ed 12 U.S. areas where farmland was giving way to urban uses at a rapid rate in the 1990s, including California’s Central Valley, South Florida, California’s coastal zone, North Carolina’s Piedmont, and the Chicago–Milwaukee–Madison triangle in Illinois–Wisconsin. These 12 areas represent only 5 percent of U.S. farmland, but they produce 17 percent of total agricultural sales, 67 per-cent of all fruit, 55 percent of all vegetables, and one-quarter of all dairy products. Figures for other countries in the richer parts of the world (such as Japan) as well as for poorer countries (such as Egypt) prove that urban expansion into productive farmland is a global problem with serious implications for the future.
The conversion of farmlands into housing develop-
ments is not conﬁ  ned to areas close to major cities that could become suburbs. Expendable wealth and the desire to have a place to “get away from it all” have led highly productive commercial agricultural areas to be converted into regions for second homes. On the Delmarva Peninsula in the United States, where poultry production is concentrated, the price of land has risen as urbanites from Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Maryland, and New Y ork bought land on the eastern shore to build second homes. Many of the new residents on the peninsula are demanding higher envi-ronmental standards. Rising land prices and stricter envi-ronmental standards are placing a squeeze on the cost of chicken production. T yson Foods closed its production facility in spring 2004, and the Washington Times reported 650 lost jobs. As urban population continues to grow and expendable wealth increases for the wealthiest of the popu-lation, more agricultural lands will be converted to housing developments, especially lands in beautiful areas with recre-ational amenities such as the eastern shore of Maryland (the Delmarva Peninsula) and its Chesapeake Bay.
Population growth and the loss of agricultural land 
help to explain why global food prices have been on the rise for more than a decade. Putting further pressure on food prices are consumption increases in countries experiencing rapid developments (e.g. China) and a trend toward using food crops for biofuel production. These factors were behind an almost 50 percent surge in global food prices between April 2007 and March 2008. Food riots broke out in some cities, and the specter of large-scale famine grew. Another more recent spike in food prices was one factor in the outbreak of revolutions in North c11Agriculture.indd Page 399  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 399  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

Africa and Southwest Asia in spring 2011. A convergence 
of changing land use, increasing use of grains for fuel, cor-rupt governments, and environmental impacts works against the provision of adequate food at reasonable prices for the world’s poor.
Despite the severity of the situation, in today’s world 
it is possible for many people to put farming largely out of their minds. As a result of industrialization of agriculture and improvements in transportation, consumers come in contact with farmers much less frequently than did previ-ous generations. On a freezing cold winter day in Cincinnati, Ohio, consumers can purchase fresh straw-berries grown in Chile. Consumers can also purchase highly processed foods with long shelf lives and forget where the item was purchased, much less think of the farm work that went into the ingredients, when they get around to consuming it.
As a result of the growing distance between farmers 
and consumers, geographers have sought to draw attention to food deserts, which are areas with limited access to 
fresh, nutritious foods (Fig. 11.24). Urban food deserts are typically found in low-income neighborhoods where con-sumers have little access to medium-size and large grocery stores and instead have access to small grocery stores ﬁ  lled 
mainly with processed, energy-dense but nutrient poor food. British geographer Hilary Shaw found (2006) that consumers in urban food deserts were more likely to purchase processed, energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods because of the lower expense of these foods relative to fresh fruits and vegetables and also to avoid wasting food.c11Agriculture.indd Page 400  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 400  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 Summary 401
Summary
Agricultural production has changed drastically since the First Agricultural Revolution. 
T oday, agricultural products, even perishable ones, are shipped around the world. Agriculture has industrialized, and in many places, food production is dominated by large-scale agribusiness. A major commonality between ancient agriculture and modern agriculture remains: the need to change. T rial and error were the norms of early plant and animal domestication. Agriculture makes distinct impressions on the cultural land-scape, from how land surveys, to land ownership, to land use. In the globalized economy, what is produced where depends on many factors, from climate and government regula-tion to technology and worldwide demand for crops. Figure 11.24

closed” and replaced with larger national chains in regional 
trade centers. Michimi and Wimberly also found a differ-ence between food deserts in metropolitan and nonmetro-politan areas of the United States. In metropolitan areas, obesity rates increased and the rate of fruit and vegetable consumption decreased with increasing distance from gro-cery stores. They did not ﬁ  nd the same correlation in non-metropolitan areas, however.Geographers Akihiko Michimi and Michael Wimberly 
found that rural food deserts lack not only access to larger grocery stores but also public transportation to reach larger grocery stores. In their study of food deserts and access to fruits and vegetables, the geographers found that since the 1980s in rural areas of the United States a “restructuring of food retail industries has occurred such that local grocery 
stores that once served small rural communities have been c11Agriculture.indd Page 401  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501c11Agriculture.indd Page 401  9/19/11  12:09 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  Field Note    Branding the Backboard  
  Walking through a relatively poor neighborhood in Skopje, Macedonia, with the 
midday Muslim call to prayer ringing in my ears, the last thing I expected to see was something from my home State of Oregon (Fig. 12.1). But there it was—the unmistakable Nike swoosh on the backboard of a basketball hoop where the local kids play pick-up games!  
  As ubiquitous as the Nike brand of athletic shoes and its trademark swoosh 
are on the landscape, the cultural landscape does not tell us where Nike shoes are produced. University of Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman and one of his former runners, Phil Knight, founded Nike in 1961. Knight designed the wafﬂ  e sole to cre-ate more traction for runners, and Nike sold $8000 in footwear in its ﬁ  rst year. 
Nike has grown to be a giant in the shoe and apparel business with sales of over $19 billion in 2009. With headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, a suburb of Portland, the company is far more than an Oregon concern. Although several thousand    Figure 12.1

 people work for Nike in Beave  r  ton, not a single individual in Oregon is directly 
involved in the process of putting a shoe together. Worldwide, some 30,000 people work directly for Nike t  o  day, and according to Nike, upwards of 800,000 workers are employed by Nike’s almost 700 contract factories in 52 countries. Nike began production in the 1960s by contracting with an Asian ﬁ  rm to manufa  c  ture its 
shoes. In 1974, Nike set up its ﬁ  rst domestic shoe manufacturing facility in the 
small town of Exeter, New Ham  p  shire. By the end of that year, Nike’s workforce was still modest in number. The Oregon contingent concentrated on ru  n  ning the company and expanding sales, while the New Hampshire and the Asian contin-gents focused primarily on the produ  c  tion of shoes.  
  As Nike grew to become the world’s leading manufacturer of athletic shoes 
with almost a 40 percent share of the world’s athletic shoe market, its employ-ment numbers skyrocketed and many new manufacturing plants were established in Asia and beyond. This transformation did not translate into manufacturing jobs in Beave  r  ton, Or  e  gon, however. The employment opportunities now provided by Nike at its world headquarters are for the ﬁ  nancial administrators, marketing and sales specialists, information technology directors, computer techn  i  cians, law-yers, and support personnel needed to run an international company with over $19 billion in annual revenues. The local social and economic geography of Beaverton bears little resemblance to what one might have expected in a town housing an important shoe company 85 years ago.  
  Eighty-ﬁ  ve years ago, economic geographer J. Russel Smith reported that 
“three hundred shoe factories have sales ofﬁ  ces located within a few blocks of 
each other in Boston.” In a leather district close to the city, hides were imported from around the world, and tanneries prepared the hides. In a ring of suburbs around Boston, great “shoe towns” such as Haverhill, Brockton, and Lynn had fac-tories specializing in both men’s and women’s shoes. Writing in 1925, Smith described the process of shoe production in the shoe factory town of Lynn:  
  Walking the streets of Lynn one realizes what concentration an industry can have; the 
signs upon the places of business read—heels, welts, insoles, uppers, eyelets, thread, etc., etc. It is an astonishing proof of the degree to which even a simple commodity like a shoe, so long made by one man, can be subdivided and become the work of scores of industries and thousands of people.  
  Shoe salespeople periodically ﬂ  ocked to shoe company headquarters in   Boston to 
learn about the company’s newest offerings and ﬁ  lled their sample suitcases with shoes to show their clients as they made the rounds of their sales territories.  
  Today, the production and marketing of Nike shoes and apparel involves an elab-
orate global  network of intern  a  tional manufacturing and sales. The global processes have local consequences, as each node of the Nike ne  t  work is functionally specialized, dependent on other nodes, and inﬂ  uenced by the niche it occupies in the ne  t  work.  
  The contemporary geography of industry and services is a product of shifting 
forces that have shaped produ  c  tion and consumption over time. In this chapter, we begin by looking at the origins of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain and its diffusion into mainland Europe. In addition, we look at the rise of manufactur-ing belts in Europe, Asia, and North America. We then explore how industrializa-tion has changed, focu  s  ing on the emergence of global labor networks and such concepts as ﬂ  exible production and the global division of labor. We also consider how the expanding service economy is changing the nature of emplo  y  ment and the economic bases of many places.  c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 404  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 404  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 Where Did the Industrial Revolution Begin, and How Did It Diffuse? 405
  WHERE DID THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
BEGIN, AND HOW DID IT DIFFUSE?  
  The manufacturing of goods began long before the 
Industrial Revolution. Families and communities pro-
duced goods in workshops, and merchants traded manu-factured products throughout the world. For example, in the towns and villages of India, workshops produced goods made of iron, gold, silver, and brass. India’s carpenters were artists as well as art  i  sans, and their work was in 
demand wherever it could be bought. India’s textiles, made 
on individual spinning wheels and hand looms, were con-s  i  dered the best in the world. These industries were sus-
tained both by local aristocrats and by international trade. 
Within individual homes in rural villa  g  es of Great Britain, 
rural residents spun thread or wove fabric into textiles dur-
ing the winter months. The quality of production varied a  c  cording to place. India’s textiles were so ﬁ  nely produced 
that British textile makers rioted in 1721, demanding legis-
lative protection against i  m  ports from India.  
  China and Japan also possessed a substantial indus-
trial base long before the Industrial Revolution. European 
industries, from the textile makers of Flanders and Britain to the iron smelters of Thüringen, had become su  b  stantial 
operations. However, in price and quality, Europe’s prod-ucts could not match those of other parts of the world. Commercial companies, including the Dutch and British East India Companies, laid the groundwork for Europe’s colonial expansion. Europeans gained control over local indu  s  tries in India, Indonesia, and elsewhere, proﬁ  ting 
from political chaos that ensued in the wake of European intervention, and pi  t  ted local factions against one another. 
British merchants imported tons of raw ﬁ  ber for their 
expanding textile industries. With the eve  n  tual develop-
ment of technologies that allowed for mass production, the British were able to bury local industries in Asia and Africa by ﬂ  ooding the market with inexpensive products and forcing their colonies to purchase i  m  ported goods.  
  The Industrial Revolution  
  During the eighteenth century, markets for European 
goods were growing, especially in the colonies. Producers urgently needed better machines, especially for spinning and weaving. The ﬁ  rst steps in the   Industrial Revol  u  tion   
did not involve a revolutionary ene  r  gy source; improved 
spinning wheels were powered by foot pedals, and new 
water looms were driven by water running dow  n  slope.  
  The eighteenth century was marked with a series of 
inventions that brought new uses for known energy 
sources (coal) and new machines to improve efﬁ  ciencies 
(steam engines), which in turn enabled other new i  n  ven-
tions including water pumps and railroads. Funding inven-
tions and supporting inventors and inventions required money. The eighteenth century was marked by an expand-ing trade network focused on western Europe that brought wealth to those in a position to take advantage of changing circumstances (Fig. 12.2). These develo  p  ments enabled 
investors to fund inventors and to perfect inventions. For 
example, James Watt is credited with impro  v  ing the steam 
engine by creating a separate chamber to house the steam 
and by perfecting the pistons and getting them to perform correctly. The invention did not happen overnight: a series of attempts over a few de  c  ades ﬁ  nally worked when Watt 
partnered with toymaker and metal worker Ma  t  thew 
Boulton who inherited great wealth from his wife. Boulton 
ﬁ nanced the ﬁ  nal trials and errors that made Watt’s steam 
engine fun  c  tional and reli  a  ble.  
  During the Industrial Revolution, innovations in 
iron manufacturing enabled the production of the steam 
engine and a variety of other products. In Coalbrookdale, England, in 1709, iron worker Abraham Darby found a way to   smelt   iron. By burning coal in a vacuum-like envi-
ronment, the English already knew they could cook off 
impurities, leaving behind coke, the high-carbon po  r-
  tion of coal. In 1709, Darby put iron ore and coke in a 
blast furnace, and then pushed air into the furnace, a combination that allowed the furnace to burn at a much higher temperature than wood charcoal or coal allowed. Mixing the iron ore with limestone (to attract impuri-ties) and water and smelting it with coke enabled iron workers to pour melted iron ore into molds (instead of shaping it with anvils), yielding   cast iron  . The use of 
molds allowed more consistency in iron parts and 
increased production of iron components. As the top-onym indicates, the residents of Ironbridge, a town neighboring Coalbrookdale, still take pride in their   Key Questions   For Chapter 12

town’s bridge, the ﬁ  rst in the world to be co  n  structed 
entirely from cast iron in 1779 (Fig. 12.3).  
  The steam engine, with its multitude of uses, also 
had a dramatic impact on industry. It was used to pump 
water out of coal mines, enabling coal workers to reach deeper coal seams, to power spinning wheels that spun 100 plus spools of thread at a time, to power dozens of looms in a factory all at once, and to create a new mode of transportation: the railroad. In 1830, Manchester, a ce  n  ter of textile manufacturing, was connected by rail to 
the nearby port of Liverpool, a westward-facing port 
that linked Britain with the colonies. In the next several de  c  ades, thousands of miles of iron and then steel track 
were laid. Ocean shipping also entered a new age when 
the ﬁ  rst steam-powered vessel crossed the Atlantic in 1819.  
  With the advent of the railroad and steam ship, 
Great Britain enjoyed even greater advantages over the 
rest of the world than it did at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Not only did the British hold a near-monopoly over the production of many pro  d  ucts that were in demand around the world, but it alone 
 possessed the skills necessary to make the machines that 
manufactured them. Continental Europe and America wanted railroads and locomotives, and England had the know-how, the experience, and the capital to supply them. Soon, Bri  t  ish inﬂ  uence around the world was 
reaching its peak.  
  Meanwhile, the spatial pattern of modern Europe’s 
industrial development began to take shape. In the early 
part of the Industrial Revolution, before the railroad connected nodes of industry and reduced the transpor-tation costs of coal, manufactu  r  ing needed to be located 
close to coalﬁ  elds. Manufacturing plants also needed to 
be connected to ports, where raw materials could a  r  rive 
and ﬁ  nished products could depart. In the ﬁ  rst decades 
of the Industrial Revolution, plants were usually con-
nected to ports by a broad ca  n  al or river system. In 
Britain, densely populated and heavily urbanized indus-
trial regions developed near the coal ﬁ  elds (Fig. 12.4). The lar  g  est such r  e  gion was the Midlands of north-
central England.     Figure 12.2

  Diffusion to Mainland Europe  
  In the early 1800s, as the innovations of Britain’s Industrial 
Revolution diffused into mainland Europe, the same set of locational criteria for industrial zones applied: prox-imity to coal ﬁ  elds and connection via water to a port remained crucial to industrial development. A belt of major coal ﬁ  elds extends from west to east through main-land Europe, roughly along the southern margins of the North Eur  o  pean Lowland—across northern France and southern Belgium, the Netherlands, the German Rühr, western Bohemia in the Czech R  e  public, and Silesia in 
Poland. Colonial empires gave France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and, later, Germany, access to the ca  p  ital 
necessary to fuel industrialization and in some cases the raw materials necessary for production. Iron ore is dis-persed along a sim  i  lar belt, and the map showing the 
pattern of diffusion of the Industrial Revolution into 
Europe reﬂ  ects the resulting concentr  a  tions of economic 
activity (Fig. 12.5).

 Where Did the Industrial Revolution Begin, and How Did It Diffuse? 409
  Industrial developments in one area, such as the 
Rühr area of present-day Germany (Germany was not 
consolidated into a single cou  n  try until the 1870s) 
changed the port cities to which they are linked—in this case Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The Rhine River ﬂ ows through the Rühr area and enters the sea at 
Rotterdam. Over the last 200 years, the Dutch have radi-cally altered the port of Rotterdam to facilitate transpor-tation and make it the most important port in Europe and a hub of global commerce.  
  Once the railroads were well established, some 
manufacturing moved to or expanded inside of existing 
urban areas with large markets, such as London and Paris. London was a particularly attractive site for indus-try because of its port location on the Thames River and, more importantly, because of its major role in the ﬂ  ow of 
regional and global capital. By locating itself in London, an industry put itself at the center of Bri  t  ain’s global net-
work of inﬂ  uence. Paris was already continental Europe’s 
greatest city, but like London, it did not have coal or iron 
d  e  posits in its immediate vicinity. When a railroad system 
was added to the existing network of road and waterway 
connections to Paris, however, the city became the larg-est local market for manufactured products for hundreds of miles. Pa  r  is attracted major industries, and the city, 
long a center for the manufacture of luxury items (jew-
elry, perfumes, and fashions), experienced substantial growth in such industries as metallurgy and chemical manufa  c  turing. With a ready labor force, an ideal 
regional position for the distr  i  bution of ﬁ  nished prod-
ucts, the presence of governmental agencies, a nearby 
ocean port (Le Havre), and France’s largest domestic market, Paris’s deve  l  opment as a major industrial center 
was no accident.  
  London and Paris became, and remain, important 
industrial complexes not because of their coal ﬁ  elds but 
b  e  cause of their commercial and political connectivity to 
the rest of the world (Fig. 12.6).   Germany still ranks 
among the world’s leading producers of both coal and 
steel and remains Europe’s leading industrial power (T   a  ble 12.1). By the early twentieth century, industry 
began to diffuse far from the original European hearth 
to such places as northern Italy (now one of Europe’s major industrial regions), Catalonia (anchored by Barcelona) and northern Spain, southern Sw  e  den, and 
southern Finland.  
  Diffusion beyond Europe  
  Western Europe’s early industrialization gave it a huge 
economic head start and put the region at the center of a developing world economy in the nineteenth century. But, it was not long before industrialization began to   Field Note  
  “Paris and the Paris Basin form the industrial as well as agricul-tural heart of France. The city and region are served by the Seine Ri  v  er, along which lies a string of ports from Le Havre at the mouth to Rouen at the head of navigation for oceango-ing ships. Rouen has become a vital center on France’s indus-trial map. As we a  p  proached on the river, you could see the famous cathedral and the city’s historic cultural landscape to the left (north), but on the right bank lay a major industrial com-plex i  n  cluding coal-ﬁ  red power 
facilities (although France leads Europe in nuclear energy), petro-chemical plants, and oil installa-tions. It is all part of the indus-trial region ce  n  tered on Paris.”

di  f  fuse beyond Europe’s western fringe. The   primary 
industrial regions   that stand out on the world map of 
i  n  dustrial centers by the 1950s were western Europe, east-
ern North America, western Russia and Ukraine, and East 
Asia (Fig. 12.7).  
  North America  
  By the beginning of the twentieth century, the only seri-
ous rival to Europe was a territory settled predominantly by Europeans and with particularly close links to Britain, which provided links to the capital and innova-tions that fueled industrialization there: North America. Manufacturing in North America began in New England du  r  ing the colonial period, but the northeastern States 
were not especially rich in mineral resources. North Ame  r  ica, however, beneﬁ  ted from the ability of its com-
panies to acquire needed raw materials from overseas 
sources. Industries developed along the Great Lakes where canal, river, and lakes connected with ra  i  lroads on 
land to move resources and goods in and out of industrial centers. There was no need to go abroad in search of energy, ho  w  ever. Coal was the chief fuel for industries at 
the time, and there was never any threat of a coal shortage in the United States: U.S. coal reserves are among the world’s largest and are widely distributed, being found from Appalachian Pennsylvania to the northwestern Great Plains (Fig. 12.8).    Russia and Ukraine  
  The St. Petersburg region is one of Russia’s oldest manu-
facturing centers. T sar Peter the Great planned and con-structed the city not only to serve as Russia’s capital but also to become the country’s industrial core. Peter the Great encouraged western European artisans with skills and specializations to migrate to the region, and he imported high-quality machine building, optical prod-ucts, and medical equipment. The St. Petersburg region soon attracted industries including shipbuilding, chemical production, food processing, and textile making. A  f  ter 
World War I, the newly formed Soviet Union annexed Ukraine and used the rich resources and industrial poten-tial of Ukraine, especially the coal-rich Donbass region, to become an industrial power. The Soviet Union (and Russia today) was resource rich. Soviet leaders directed an economic plan to industrialize the Moscow r  e  gion. 
Communist leaders developed industries in Nizhni Novg  o  rod, southeast of Moscow, which came to be known 
as the “Soviet Detroit.”  
  East Asia  
  In less than a century after the beginning of the Industrial 
Revolution, Japan became one of the world’s leading industrial countries. With limited natural resources, man-ufacturing in Japan depended upon raw materials TABLE 12.1

 How Have the Character and Geography of Industrial Production Changed? 411
i  m  ported from other parts of the world. In the late 1800s 
and early 1900s, Japan colonized Korea, T aiwan, and por-
tions of mainland China, which brought capital and resources for industry.   Japan’s dominant region of i  n  dus-
trialization and urbanization is the   Ka  n  to Plain   (Fig. 12.7), 
which contains about one-third of the nation’s population 
and includes the T okyo–Y okohama–Kawasaki metropoli-tan area.   Japan’s second largest indu  s  trial complex extends 
from the eastern end of the Seto Inland Sea to the Nagoya 
area and includes the Kobe–Kyoto–Osaka triangle, which is a vast industrial region with steel mills, a major chemical industry, automobile man  u  facturing, shipbuilding, textile 
factories, and many other types of production.  
  Examine the map of diffusion of the Industrial Revolution into Europe (Fig. 12.5) and hypothesize what other charac-teristics (aside from the presence of coal) were necessary for industrialization to take hold in these regions.  
  HOW HAVE THE CHARACTER 
AND GEOGRAPHY OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION CHANGED?  
  Economic geography provides context for under-
standing a multitude of human geographic developments. 
In this book, we have already made reference to economic geography to help explain globaliz  a  tion in Chapter 1, 
local and popular cultures in Chapter 4, identities and scale in Chapter 5, language loss and toponyms in Cha  p  ter 7, 
c  o  lonialism and political disputes in Chapter 8, and the 
geography of development in Chapter 10. In this section 
of the chapter, we incorporate economic geography principles we introduced in earlier chapters with other economic geography concepts to provide a context for understanding changes in the character and geo  g  raphy of 
manufacturing and service industries since World War II.  
  In Chapter 1, we deﬁ  ned   globalization   as a set of 
processes that are increasing interactions, deepening rela-
tio  n  ships, and heightening interdependence without 
regard to country borders. We e  x  plained that globaliza-
tion is also a set of outcomes that are felt from these global processes—outcomes that are unevenly distributed and di  f  ferently manifested across the world. Improvements in 
transportation and communication technologies are at the root of globalization. The i  m  provement of sailing 
ships and navigation methods helped establish global trade routes and the ﬁ  rst wave of colonialism (Chapter 8). 
The advent of the steam ship, the diffusion of rai  l  roads, 
and the telegraph and then telephone quickened global trade and connected empires in the second wave of colo-nialism. Through colonialism and trade, capitalism became the economic foundation of the world-economy (Chapter 8).  
  Fordist Production  
  The manufacturing boom of the twentieth century can be 
traced in part to early innovations in the production pro-cess. Perhaps the most signiﬁ  cant of these innovations was 
the mass-production assembly line pioneered by Henry Ford, which allowed for the inexpensive pr  o  duction of 
consumer goods at a single site on a previously unknown scale. So signiﬁ  cant was Ford’s idea that the dominant mode of mass production that endured from 1945 to 1970 is known as   Fordist  . In addition to of its role in facilitating 
mass production, economic geogr  a  phers also see the 
Fordist system as encompassing a set of political-economic 
structures (corporations and p  o  litical institutions sup-
porting each other) and ﬁ  nancial orders (such as the Bretton Woods arrangement, under which countries adopted the gold standard, agreeing to peg the values of their currency to the price of gold) that supported mass production by corporations.  
  The Fordist period is marked by a surge in both mass 
production and mass consumption. On the Ford assembly 
line, machines replaced people, and unskilled workers instead of craftsmen worked on the assembly lines. Ford paid his workers a good wage, and droves of job seekers migrated to the Detroit area to work in the automobile industry (see Chapter 9). Ford’s goal was to mass produce goods at a price point where his workers could afford to purchase them. Production of automobiles at Ford’s River Rouge plant in Dearborn, Michigan (Fig. 12.9) e  x  empli-
ﬁ ed the   vertical integration   of production common dur-
ing the Fordist period. Ford imported raw mat  e  rials, from 
coal to rubber to steel, from around the world and brought 
them to his plant on the River Rouge in Dea  r  born, just west 
of Detroit. The massive River Rouge Ford plant is better 
described as an industrial complex. The Henry Ford Foundation d  e  scribes Ford’s goal in building the complex 
of 93 buildings with more than 120 miles of conveyor belts that covered an area 1 by 1.5 miles as follows: “Henry Ford’s ultimate goal was to achieve total self-sufﬁ  ciency 
by owning, operating and coordinating all the resources needed to produce complete automobiles.” The River Rouge complex included a power plant, boat docks, ﬁ  re 
stations, a police department, and a rai  l  road.  
  Under Fordist production, distance was a major con-
sideration in the location of industry. For example, in the c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 411  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 411  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
412 Chapter 12   Industry and Services
United States, furniture manufacturing shifted from Boston 
in 1875 to Cincinnati by 1890 and then Grand Ra  p  ids, 
Michigan by 1910. Furniture man  u  facturing took off in 
North Carolina when northern entrepreneurs built manu-
facturing plants there in the early 1900s to take advantage of North Carolina’s “abundance of lumber, low-cost labor combined with Reconstruction era wood-working skills and attitudes, and infrastructure providing good proximity” to customers as well as a humid climate (Walcott 2011, 10). High Point and other furniture centers clustered together to take advantage of not only the location and resources but also the services and i  n  frastructure that grew to accommo-
date and aid furniture manufacturers in the region.  
  Finished furniture is a bulky commodity. Whenever 
furniture manufactures have considered locating outside 
of North Carolina and the Piedmont region or moving operations abroad, one of the key issues has been the   fri  c-
  tion of distance  : the increase in time and cost that usually 
comes with increased distance over which commod  i  ties 
must travel. If a raw material has to be shipped hundreds of 
miles to a factory, rather than being manufa  c  tured right 
next door, the friction of distance increa  s  es. A corollary to    Figure 12.7

the concept of the friction of distance is what geographers 
call distance decay (see Chapter 4), which assumes that the impact of a function or an activity will decline as one moves away from its point of origin. Distance decay suggests that manufacturing plants will be more concerned with serving the markets of nearby places than more distant places. This basic principle is important in understanding the locational dynamics of furniture manufacturing. The vast majority of North Carolina’s furniture customers were in the northeast or in the southeast. Either way, furniture could be trucked to customers in less than a day.    Agglomeration  
  British economist Alfred Marshall (1842–1924), a leader in 
economic theory who is often credited with pi  o  neering the 
ﬁ eld of industrial location theory, argued that a particular 
industry, whether automobile manufactu  r  ing or furniture 
production, clusters in an area. He called this process local-
ization. Marshall held that localized industries would attract 
workers with i  n  dustry-speciﬁ  c skills, share information, 
and attract industry-speciﬁ  c support services.

(1868–1958) developed a basic model explaining where 
industries would cluster. Weber helped develop loc  a  tional 
studies in economic geography by focusing on the loca-tion of manufacturing facilities. In   Theory of the Location of 
Industries   (1909), Weber focused on speciﬁ  c factors that 
would pull industry to particular locations.  
  Weber’s   least cost theory   focused on a factory own-
er’s desire to minimize three categories of costs. The ﬁ  rst 
and most important of these categories was   transportation  . 
Weber suggested that the site where transportation costs are lowest is the place where it is least expensive to bring 
raw materials to the point of production and to distribute ﬁ nished products to consumers. The second cost was that 
of   labor  . Higher labor costs tend to reduce the margin of 
proﬁ t, so a factory might do better if it is farther away 
from raw mat  e  rials and markets if cheap labor compen-
sates for the added transport costs.  
  The third factor in Weber’s model was similar to 
Marshall’s theory of localization. Weber described the 
adva  n  tages afforded by like industries clustering, which    Figure 12.8

he termed   agglomeration  . When a substantial number of 
e  n  terprises cluster in the same area, as happens in a large 
industrial city, Weber held that the industries can assist 
each other through shared talents, services, and facil  i  ties. 
For example, all manufacturers need ofﬁ  ce furniture and 
equipment. One or more ofﬁ  ce equipment store in a city could provide supplies for all industries in the area. As such, agglomeration can make a big-city location more attractive, potentially overcoming higher transport  a  tion 
or labor costs.  
  Flexible Production and Product Life Cycle  
  Fordist production was based on both mass production 
and mass consumption. Money ﬂ  owed through the world-
economy as consumers purchased like items often manu-factured in large-scale complexes. As the global economy became more integrated and transportation costs decreased, the advantages of concentrating produ  c  tion in 
large-scale complexes declined. As a result, in the latter third of the twentieth century many enterprises began moving toward a post-Fordist, ﬂ  exible production model. The post-Fordist model refers to a set of pr  o  duction pro-
cesses in which the components of goods are made in dif-ferent places around the globe and then brought t  o  gether as needed to meet customer demand. The term   ﬂ exible 
production systems   is used to describe this state of affairs 
because ﬁ  rms can pick and choose among a multitude of 
suppliers and production strategies in distant places, and 
then quickly shift their choices in response to adjustments in production costs or consumer demand. These systems are thus designed to respond to consumers who want the newest/best/greatest offering or a custom offering that helps distinguish them from other co  n  sumers.  
  Capitalism continues as an economic system not 
only because people consume but also because produ  c  ers 
continue to promote and respond to consumer demand. 
They do this by adapting to changing consumer pre  f  er-
ences and by commodifying goods. Through the process of   commodiﬁ  cation  , goods that were not previously 
bought, sold, and traded gain a monetary value and are 
bought, sold, and traded on the ma  r  ket. A new good, such 
as a mobile tablet, starts at a high price and becomes somewhat of a status symbol because of its high cost. The longer the mobile tablet is on the market and the greater the number of ﬁ  rms producing mobile tablets, the lower 
the price drops. Eventually, companies move the pro-duction of mobile tablets to lower the price of pr  o  duction 
and thus the price of the good, in order to compete. Changes in the production of a good over time take place as part of a   product life cycle  .     Figure 12.9

416 Chapter 12   Industry and Services
  Following the production of televisions around the 
globe gives us insight into the workings of the pro  d  uct life 
cycle, the global division of labor, and shifts in production 
that occur as goods become standard co  m  modities of trade. 
Commercial produ  c  tion of television sets began after 
World War II, with a variety of small and medium-sized 
ﬁ rms in Europe, Asia, and North America involved in pr  o-
  duction. Firms in the United States, including  Zenith, 
were the dominant producers of televisions until the 1970s. During the 1970s and 1980s a dr  a  matic shift occurred, with 
a small number of large Asian producers—particularly in 
Japan—seizing a much la  r  ger percentage of the market and 
with a few European ﬁ  rms increasing their position as well. 
By 1990, ten large ﬁ  rms were responsible for 80 percent of the world’s color television sets; eight of them were Japanese and two European. Only one ﬁ  rm in the United States, 
Zenith, remained, and its share of the global market was rel  a  tively small.  
  The television production industry has three key 
elements: research and design; manufacture of compo-
nents; and assembly. Research and design was and contin ues 
to be located in the home countries of the major telev  i  sion 
manufacturers. During the 1970s, the major ﬁ  rms began 
to move the manufacture of components and a  s  sembly 
out of the country. U.S. ﬁ  rms moved these functions to the   maquiladora   of Mexico (discussed in Cha  p  ter 10) and 
the special economic zones of China (described in 
Chapter 9); Japanese ﬁ  rms moved component manufac-
turing and assembly to T aiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and South Korea. Because the assembly stage was the most labor intensive, television manufacturers tapped into labor pools around the world, locating a  s  sembly plants 
not just in Mexico, China, and Southeast Asia, but also in India and Brazil. By the 1990s, telev  i  sion manufacturing 
methods had changed to employ greater mechanization in the production and assembly process. Starting in the 1980s, the major television producers in Japan (by then dominating the market) moved a number of their offshore production sites to Europe and the United States, regions with suitable i  n  frastructure, skilled labor, and accessible 
markets. Recently, the process began again, with research and development in high-deﬁ  nition and plasma televi-
sions leading to production of these high-end televisions in Japan—and more recently into Ch  i  na and South Korea.  
  The Global Division of Labor  
  T racing the production of televisions throughout the 
world over time helps us see how the   global division of 
labor   currently works. Under this arrangement, labor is 
concentrated in the global economic periphery and semi-
periphery to take adva  n  tage of lower labor costs, whereas 
research and development is primarily located in the core. But nothing is ﬁ  xed, and as methods of a  s  sembly and products themselves change, production may be moved to take advantage of infrastructure, skilled labor, and acces-sible markets.  
  Geographically, the concept of time–space compres-
sion is the easiest way to capture the dramatic temporal 
and spatial changes taking place in the contemporary global economy. Time–space compression is based on the idea that developments in communication and transporta-tion technologies have accelerated the speed with which things happen and made the distance between places less signiﬁ  cant (see Chapter 4). David Harvey, who coined the 
term   time–space compression  , argues that modern capitalism 
has so accelerated the pace of life and so changed the 
nature of the relationship between places that “the world seems to collapse inwards upon us.” Flu  c  tuations in the 
T okyo stock market affect New Y ork just hours later. 
Overnight, marketing ca  m  paigns can turn a product inno-
vation into a fad in far-ﬂ  ung corners of the globe. Kiwis 
picked in New Zealand yesterday can be in the lunch boxes 
of boys and girls in Canada tomorrow. And decisions made in London can make or break a fast-developing deal over a transport link between Kenya and T anz  a  nia.  
  Time–space compression has fundamentally altered 
the division of labor. When the world was less interco  n-
  nected, most goods were produced not just close to raw 
materials, but close to the point of consumption. Thus, the major industrial belt in the United States was in the Northeast both because of readily available coal and other raw materials and because the major concentration of the North American population was there. With   just-in-time 
delivery   this has changed. Rather than keeping a large 
inventory of components or products, companies keep just 
what they need for short-term production and new parts are shipped quickly when needed. In turn, corporations can draw from l  a  bor around the globe for di  f  ferent components 
of production.  
  Advances in information technologies and shipping 
coupled with the global division of labor enable compa-
nies to move production from one site to another based on calculations of the “new place-based cost advantages” in a decision process ge  o  grapher David Harvey has called a 
  spatial ﬁ  x   (Walcott 2011, 7). In choosing a production 
site, location is only one consideration. “Distance is nei-
ther determinate nor insigniﬁ  cant as a factor in produ  c-
  tion location decisions” today (Walcott 2011, 9).  
  Major global economic players, including General 
Motors, Philips, Union Carbide, and Exxon, take advan-
tage of low transportation costs, favorable governmental regulations, and expanding information technology to co  n  struct vast economic networks in which different fac-
ets of production are carried out in different places in 
order to beneﬁ  t from the advantages of speciﬁ  c loca-
tions. Publicly traded companies, whose stock you can buy or sell publicly on the stock exchange, are pressured by shareholders to grow their proﬁ  ts annually. One way c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 416  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 416  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Have the Character and Geography of Industrial Production Changed? 417
to grow proﬁ  ts is to cut costs, and labor (wages, beneﬁ  ts, 
insurance) makes up a sizable proportion of pr  o  duction 
costs. Most multinational corporations have moved the 
labor-intensive manufacturing, particularly a  s  sembly 
activities, to peripheral countries where labor is cheap, 
regulations are few, and tax rates are low. The manufac-turing that remains in the core is usually highly mecha-nized. T echnologically sophisticated manufactu  r  ing also 
tends to be sited in the core because both the expertise 
and the infr  a  structure are there.  
  Where to produce or assemble a good is only one 
small aspect of decisions made in a commodity chain (see 
Chapter 10) for any good produced in an economy based on ﬂ  exible production. A large part of business dec  i  sion 
making today focuses on sourcing, on where to get the component parts that are eventually assembled. Business magazines and textbooks discuss nimble sourcing deci-sions, proving that not only is production ﬂ  ex  i  ble, but the 
sourcing is too.  
  China and other lower wage countries are major 
recipients of industrial work that is   outsourced   or moved 
  of  f  shore  . Each of the steps in commodity production that 
used to take place within the conﬁ  nes of a single factory is 
now often outsourced to suppliers, which focus their pro-duction and offer cost savings. When outsourced work is located outside of the country, it is said that it takes place   offshore  . 
Research and development a  c  tivities tend to be con-
centrated in the core, where high levels of education and 
access to technology are the norm. The global division of labor has reshaped the role different economic sectors play within countries. With mechanized, highly efﬁ  cient 
agriculture (see Chapter 11) and with the move of manu-facturing jobs to the semi-periphery and periphery, core countries now have large labor forces e  m  ployed in the ter-
tiary (service) sector of the economy.  
  Supporting the global division of labor are elaborate 
trading networks and ﬁ  nancial relations. T rade itself is a 
tertiary economic activity of considerable importance to 
the global economy. Regardless of where goods are pro-duced, consumption is still concentrated in the core and, increasingly, among the wealthy and middle classes of the semi-periphery. Newly industrializing countries of the semi-periphery send manufactured goods to the core  . 
T rade ﬂ  ows among countries in the periphery are typi-cally low because, for peripheral countries, the dominant ﬂ ow of goods co  n  sists of e  x  ports to the core.  
  Made in America or Designed in America?  
  In 2011, ABC World News featured a segment called 
“Made in America,” where journalists knocked on doors and challenged homeowners to look at every item in their home for the “made in” sticker. The news crew then helped families move all goods not “Made in America” onto the street so the fa  m  ily could visualize how much of 
what is in their home is made in the America and how much is made elsewhere in the world. The ABC World News crew then, according to their website, “took on the challenge of trying to ﬁ  ll three rooms in a home entirely with 100 percent American-made pro  d  ucts.”  
  Would an iPod get to stay in the house redesigned by 
ABC World News? When you open a new iPod or other 
Apple product, a sticker greets you that says “Designed in California.” “Designed in” instead of “Made in?” The iPod would not pass the ABC “made in” test, but we should ask whether it is better for the American eco  n  omy 
for a good to be made in or designed in America. Three authors asked this exact question in the journal   Communications of the ACM   in 2009. Linden et al. asked 
who captures the va  l  ue in a $299 iPod touch.  
  Using published sources on computer machinery 
and component parts, the authors ﬁ  gured out the iPod 
supply chain and calculated the value added at each step in 
the commodity chain (Fig. 12.10). The components of an iPod are produced by companies in Japan, Korea, T aiwan, and China. The most expensive component in the iPod is the hard drive, which is produced and designed by T oshiba, a Japanese company. One component that sets the iPod apart from other MP3 players is the microchip that controls access to songs and movies on the iPod. The microchip is housed in a wheel on the iPod classic and iPod nano and is pr  o  duced by PortalPlayer, a Ca  l  ifornian 
company with ofﬁ  ces in India.

418 Chapter 12   Industry and Services
  In his piece on PortalPlayer called “The World in an 
iPod,” journalist Andrew Leonard explains that Po  r  talPlayer 
has a 24-hour development cycle because eng  i  neers in 
California and in India can work around the clock (with 
time zones 12 hours apart) to design and redesign the microchip. The actual microchips are created in T aiwan. The commodity chain for PortalPlayer (Figure 12.11) reveals how people and places around the world intercon-nect to design and create the company’s microchip.  
  Linden et al. estimate that the PortalPlayer compo-
nent is a small fraction of the cost of an iPod but that the 
r  e  search and development that goes into PortalPlayer and 
other innovative components that differentiate the iPod 
from its competitors receive more va  l  ue from the sale of one 
iPod than does Invotec, the company that actually assembles 
the iPod. Linden et al. concluded that “While the iPod is manufactured offshore and has a global ro  s  ter of suppliers, 
the greatest beneﬁ  ts from this innovation go to Apple, an 
American company, with predom  i  nantly American employ-
ees and stockholders who reap the beneﬁ  ts” (2009, 143) and 
that the second greatest beneﬁ  t goes to the two Japanese companies that produce components that help differentiate the iPod, the hard drive and the di  s  play screen.    The act of consumption is an end point of a com-
modity chain. It is also the beginning of the product’s 
afterlife. What happens when you discard or donate the item? What are the costs or beneﬁ  ts created by the funds (whether funds for a charity or proﬁ  ts for a corporation) generated by your purchase? Corporations such as A  p  ple, 
which sells the iPod, work to reduce consumer waste by recycling iPods and computers, and by offering di  s  counts 
to consumers who recycle their old iPods. Nonetheless, in many global cities in poorer parts of the world, adults and children work in garbage dumps to recover valuable cop-per wire and other components of computers and related electronic devices made by Apple and its competitors.  
  T racing the commodity chain of the iPod demon-
strates that rarely does the consumption of a particular 
product have an unambiguous positive or negative conse-quence. In addition to the fact that components are made all over the world and assembly is only one small part of the commodity chain, we should consider the environmental consequences of steps in commodity chains. Jobs created by industry in one place can cause environmental da  m  age 
in another. Consumption, or pu  r  chasing an item, is the end 
point in a commodity chain that affects places in a variety of Hsinchu, TaiwanSeoul, Korea

different ways. The importance of studying the geography 
of commodity chains is that such an unde  r  taking sheds light 
on the or  i  gins of products and helps explain why produc-
tion occurs where and how it does and how production 
affects places and peoples at each step in the chain.  
  Major Inﬂ  uences on the Contemporary 
Geography of Manufacturing  
  As the iPod example illustrates, multinational corporations 
frequently subcontracts many of the steps in the produc-tion and retailing process to outside companies or su  b  sid-
iaries, including the extraction of raw materials, manufac-
turing, marketing, and distribution. As such, industrial location is not just inﬂ  uenced by wage rates. The other key 
variables include transportation costs and options, regula-tory constraints, expertise, and access to energy.  
  Transportation  
  Relatively inexpensive transportation is one of the foun-
dations on which the ﬂ  exible production system rests. Whereas a century ago the cost of transportation accounted for half or more of the ﬁ  nal price of many goods traveling over signiﬁ  cant distances, that ﬁ  gure is now down to ﬁ  ve 
percent or less. In an era of vastly improved infrastructure, relatively cheap oil, and container ships, spatially disaggre-gated production systems are cost e  f  fective.  
  Efﬁ cient transportation systems enable manufactur-
ers to purchase raw materials from distant sources and to 
distribute ﬁ  nished products to a widely dispersed popula-
tion of consumers. Cost is not the only issue. Manufacturers also consider the availability of alternative systems in the event of emergencies (e.g., truck routes when rail service is interrupted). Since World War II, major developments in transportation have focused on improving   intermodal conne  c  tions  , places where two or 
more modes of transportation meet (including air, road, 
rail, barge, and ship), in order to ease the ﬂ  ow of goods 
and reduce the costs of transportation.  
  The current volume of resources and goods shipped 
around the globe daily could not be supported without the 
invention of the container system, whereby goods are packed in containers that are picked up by special, mecha-nized cranes from a container ship at an intermodal con-nection and placed on the back of a semitrailer truck, on a barge, or on a railroad car. This innovation lowered costs and increased ﬂ  exibility, permitting many manufacturers 
to pay less attention to transportation in their location decisions. Refrigerated containers also ease the shipment of perishable goods around the globe.  
  Jacques Charlier has studied the major changes to the 
Benelux (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) 
seaport system and the role containerization played in these changes. Charlier stressed the importance of co  n-
  tainerization to the growth of sea trade in the Benelux 
ports and explained the locational advantage of Rotte  r  dam, 
which is no more than six hours by rail or truck from 
85 percent of the population of western Europe.  
  The container system and the growth in shipping at 
Rotterdam and other Benelux ports have combined to foster 
the development of other industries in the region, helping to make the Netherlands, in Charlier’s words, a war  e  house 
for Europe. The Netherlands is now home to more than 
1800 U.S. ﬁ  rms, including call centers, distrib  u  tion centers, 
and production centers, esp  e  cially for food. Over 50 per-
cent of all goods entering the European Union pass through 
Rotterdam or Amsterdam (also in the Net  h  erlands).  
  Regulatory Circumstances  
  Regional trade organizations such as the North American 
Free T rade Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union (EU) have trade agreements that inﬂ  uence where 
imported goods (and components of goods) are pr  o  duced. 
Similarly, governments have individual agreements with each other about production and imports, and most gov-ernments (153 as of 2011) are part of the World T rade Organization (WTO), which works to negotiate rules of trade among the member states.  
  The WTO promotes freer trade by negotiating 
agreements among member states, agreements that push 
the world in the direction of free trade, typically dismiss-ing import quota systems and discouraging protection by a country of its domestically produced goods. Agreements negotiated under the WTO are typically enacted in steps in order to avoid a major shock to a state’s economy. In 2001 when Europe and the United States agreed to allow China to become a member of the WTO, they also agreed to remove the quota system that restricts the importation of Chinese goods into Europe and the United States (dis-cussed in Chapter 10). Soon after these quotas were elimi-nated, both the United States and the European Union issued “safeguard quotas” against ce  r  tain Chinese imports. 
These quotas buffered the impact of Chinese goods on domestic producers. But most of the quotas have now expired, paving the way for mass exports from China to the United States and Europe.  
  In addition to the growth of the purview of the 
WTO, the proliferation of regional trade associations in 
the last two decades is unprecedented. The list of acro-nyms for regional trade associations is almost over-whelming: EU, NAFTA, MERCOSUR, SAFTA, CARICOM, ANDEAN AFTA, COMESA, to name but a few (see Chapter 8). The World T rade Organization estimates that close to 300 regional trade organizations are in existence. R  e  gional trade organizations are similar 
to bilateral agreements on trade between two countries, 
although they i  n  volve more than two countries. Most c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 419  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 419  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
420 Chapter 12   Industry and Services
regional trade agreements encourage movement of pro-
duction within the trade region and promote trade by diminishing (or deleting) trade quotas and tariffs among member countries. A regional trade agreement sets up a special free trade agreement among parties to the associ-ation, leaving no  n  member countries to trade through the 
rules of the WTO or an existing bilateral agreement. 
Whether regional or global, trade agreements directly affect the location of pr  o  duction and even what is pro-
duced in a place.  
  Regulations at the state and local scales matter as 
well. Not infrequently, the location of industrial opera-
tions is inﬂ  uenced by a range of state and local regulations that inﬂ  uence the cost of production. These range from tax regulations to environmental and safety standards. In many cases, governments actively seek to recruit industry through incentives that include tax breaks, subsidies, and exemptions from particular bureaucratic requirements. Export processing zones such as the   maquiladoras   dis-
cussed in Chapter 10 pr  o  vide a case in point. There are 
now many hundreds of such zones around the world, and 
they are shaping the global geography of industry.  
  Energy  
  During the mid-twentieth century, the use of coal as an 
energy source in industry increasingly gave way to oil and gas. Dependence on external fuel supplies affects three of the four world industrial regions that were the principal regions of industrial development during the mid-twentieth century. Despite discoveries of oil and gas in the North Sea, Europe still depends on foreign shipments of petro-leum. The United States has two neighbors with substan-tial fossil fuel reserves (Mexico’s oil and gas may rank among the world’s largest), but its own supplies are far too limited to meet demand. Japan is almost totally dependent on oil from distant sources.  
  The role of energy supply as a factor in industrial 
location decisions has changed over time. Earlier in the 
chapter, we explained that at the start of the Industrial Revolution manufacturing plants were often established on or near coal ﬁ  elds; today major industrial complexes 
are not conﬁ  ned to areas near oil ﬁ  elds. I  n  stead, a huge 
system of pipelines and tankers delivers oil and natural 
gas to manufacturing regions throughout the world. For some time during and after the global oil supply crises of the 1970s, fears of future rises in oil costs led some indus-tries that r  e  quire large amounts of electricity to move to 
sites where energy costs were low. When the crisis waned, 
national energy-conservation goals were modiﬁ  ed, and in 
the early 2000s the United States’ reliance on foreign energy resources was even greater than it had been in the 1970s. Energy supply has become a less signiﬁ  cant factor 
in industrial loc  a  tion, but securing an energy supply is an 
increasingly important national priority.    U.S. consumption of petroleum and natural gas 
today is about 20 percent of the annual world total. By 
2007, the United States required more than 20.6 million barrels of petr  o  leum per day to keep its power plants, 
machinery, vehicles, aircraft, and ships functioning. However, U.S. production of oil in r  e  cent years has aver-
aged about 10 percent of the world total, and even includ-ing the known Alaskan potential, U.S. oil reserves are est  i-
  mated to amount to only about 4 percent of the world 
total. More so than many countries, the United States taps the oil that it has. In 2009 the country was the third largest oil producer in the world (Fig. 12. 12). Even with this level of production, the United States remains heavily depen-dent on foreign oil supplies, with all the uncertainties that involves. There is, consequently, a push for the United States to expand offshore dril  l  ing in the hope of expand-
ing its production of oil. Many oppose the idea on envi-ronmental grounds, however, pointing to the major BP oil spill that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 as an example of what can happen when offshore oil resources are exploited without careful safeguards.  
  The United States leads world demand and con-
sumption not just in oil, but in natural gas as well. As 
Figure 12.8 shows, natural gas often occurs in association with oil deposits. The use of natural gas has increased eno  r  mously since World War II. One result of the 
increased use of natural gas is the proliferation of pipe-lines shown on the map. In North America in 2006, there were over 4 million kilometers (2.5 million miles) of pipe-lines, including parts of a new pipeline designed to carry Alaskan natural gas across Canada to the U.S. market.  
  Countries with large reserves of oil and natural 
gas—Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Russia, and others—
occupy a special position in the global economic pic-ture. None of these countries except Russia is a major industrial power, but they all played a key role in the industrial boom of the twentieth century. And while oil has brought wealth to some in Southwest Asia, it has also ensured that outside powers such as the United States and Great Britain are involved and invested in what happens in the region. This set of circumstances has produced an u  n  easy relationship (at best) between 
countries in the oil producing region and the major 
industrial powers of the “West.”  
  New Centers of Industrial Activity  
  As a result of advances in ﬂ  exible production, over the last 
30 years many older manufacturing regions have exper  i-
  enced   deindustrialization  , a process by which companies 
move industrial jobs to other regions, leaving the newly 
deindustrialized region to work through a period of high unemployment and, if poss  i  ble, switch to a service econ-
omy (see the last major section of this chapter). At the same c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 420  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 420  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

time, the places with lower labor costs and the right mix of 
laws attractive to businesses (often weak enviro  n  mental 
laws and pro-free trade laws) have become newly industrial 
regions. The new industrial regions emerge as shifts in politics, laws, capital ﬂ  ow, and labor availability o  c  cur.  
  East Asia has become a particularly important new 
region of industrialization. Some of the economic policies 
we discussed in Chapter 10, such as structural adjustments and import quotas, help encourage foreign direct i  n  vest-
ment, and many draw industrial developers seeking to take advantage of economic breaks and inexpensive labor. From T aiwan to Guangdong and from South Korea to Sing  a  pore, the islands, countries, provinces, and cities 
fronting the Paciﬁ  c Ocean are caught up in a frenzy of 
industrialization that has made the geographic term   Paciﬁ c 
Rim   synonymous with ma  n  ufacturing.  
  The Rise of East Asia  
  Throughout the better part of the twentieth century, 
Japan was the only global economic power in East Asia, and its regional dominance seemed beyond doubt. Other nodes of manufacturing existed, but these were no threat, and certainly no match, for Japan’s industrial might. The picture began to change with the rise of the so-called Four Tigers of East and Southeast Asia: South Korea, T aiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore in the 1960s and 1970s. Beneﬁ  ting from the shift of labor-intensive industries to 
areas with lower labor costs, government efforts to pro-tect developing industry, and government investment in education and training, the tigers emerged as the ﬁ  rst 
  newly industrializing countries (NICs)  . South Korea 
developed signiﬁ  cant manufacturing di  s  tricts exporting 
products ranging from automobiles and grand pianos to 
calculators and computers. One of these districts is cen-tered on the capital, Seoul (with 10 million inhabitants), and the two others lie at the southern end of the penin-sula, anchored by Pusan and Kwangju, respectively. T aiwan’s economic planners promoted high-technology industries, including personal computers, telecommuni-cations equipment, precision electronic i  n  struments, and 
other high-tech products. More recently the South Koreans have moved in a similar dire  c  tion.  
  Just a trading colony ﬁ  ve decades ago, Hong Kong 
exploded onto the world economic scene during the 1950s 
with textiles and light manufactures. The success of these industries, based on plentiful, cheap labor, was fo  l  lowed 
by growing production of electrical equipment, appli-ances, and other household products. Hong Kong’s situa-tional advantages contributed enormously to its ec  o  nomic 
fortunes. The colony became mainland China’s gateway to the world, a bustling port, ﬁ  nancial center, and   break-
of-bulk point, where goods are transferred from one 
mode of transport to another.   In 1997 China took over the 
government of Hong Kong from the British, and a show-place of capitalism came under Chinese communist con-
trol. But the Chinese can ill afford to undercut Hong Kong’s economic dynamism. Hence, Hong Kong has the status of a Special Administrative District in China, which gives it a high degree of autonomy from the mainland.  
  The industrial growth of Singapore also was inﬂ  u-
enced by its geographical setting and the changing global 
ec  o  nomic division of labor. Strategically located at the 
tip of the Malay Peninsula, Singapore is a small island 
i  n  habited by a little over 4 million people, mos  t  ly ethnic 
Chinese but with Malay and Indian minorities. Fifty years 
ago, Singapore was mainly an entrepôt (transshipment point) for such products as rubber, timber, and oil; today, the bulk of its foreign revenues come from exports of manufactured goods and, incre  a  singly, high-technology 
products. Singapore is also a center for quaternary indus-tries, selling services and expertise to a global market.  
  Rapid economic growth entails risks, and in 1997 
risky lending practices and government investment deci-
sions caused Thailand’s currency to collapse, followed by its stock market; banks closed and bankruptcies abounded. Soon Malaysia and Indonesia were affected, and by early 1998 one of the Four Tigers, South Korea, required a massive infusion of dollars (provided by the International Monetary Fund, a Washington-based 
bank) to prevent economic chaos. But the reforms that allowed the region to overcome these economic troubles served to strengthen East and Southeast Asia’s econo-mies, and the Four Tigers continue to exert a powerful regio  n  al—and international—economic role.  
  The Chinese Juggernaut  
  Although some industrial growth occurred in China dur-
ing the period of European colonial inﬂ  uence, and later 
during the Japanese occupation, China’s major industrial expansion occurred during the communist period. When communist planners took over in 1949, one of their lead-ing priorities was to develop China’s r  e  sources and indus-
tries as rapidly as possible.  
  China is a vast country and has a substantial resource 
base. The quality of its coal is good, the quantity eno  r-
  mous, and many of the deposits are near the surface and 
easily extracted. China’s iron ores are not as productive and are generally of rather low grade, but new ﬁ  nds are 
regularly being made.  
  Until the early 1960s, Soviet planners helped pro-
mote China’s industrial development. China was spatially 
co  n  strained by the location of raw materials, the develop-
ment that had taken place before the 1949 communist tak  e  over, the pattern of long-term urbanization in the 
country, the existing transport network, and the location of the population, which was clustered mostly in the east of the country. Like their Soviet allies, China’s rulers were determined to speed up the industrialization of the c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 421  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 421  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

economy, and their dec  i  sions created several major and 
lesser industrial districts.  
  Under state planning rules, the   Northeast district   
(formerly known as Manchuria and now called Dongbei) 
b  e  came China’s industrial heartland, a complex of heavy 
industries based on the region’s coal and iron deposits located in the basin of the Liao River. Shenyang became the “Chinese Pittsburgh,” with metallurgical, machine-making, engineering, and other large industries. Anshan, to the south, emerged as China’s leading iron- and steel-producing center. Harbin to the north (China’s northern-most large city, with more than 5.4 million inhab  i  tants) 
produced textiles, farm equi  p  ment, and light manufac-
tures of many kinds (Fig. 12.13).  
  The second largest industrial region in China, the 
  Shanghai and the Chang Jiang district  , developed in and 
around the country’s biggest city, Shanghai. The Chang 
Jiang district, containing both Shanghai and Wuhan, rose to prominence and, by some measures, exceeded the Northeast as a contributor to the national economy. Another industrial complex that developed farther u  p  stream, along the Chang Jiang River, focused on the    Figure 12.12

city of Chongqing. The Chang Jiang district has become a 
pacesetter for Chinese industrial growth, if not in terms of iron and steel production, at least in terms of its diversi-ﬁ ed production and local specializ  a  tions. Railroad cars, 
ships, books, foods, chemicals—an endless variety of pro  d  ucts—come from the Chang Jiang district.  
  China’s large labor force has attracted hundreds of 
international companies. In addition to the enormous 
labor force, wages are comparatively low, one factor in why ﬁ rms have relocated their manufacturing to China. Rather 
than move entire companies, however, the production and sourcing of goods is typically outsourced to China, largely in order to lower the cost of pr  o  duction. China’s special 
economic zones have transformed cities and towns in the 
region by attracting corporations seeking a favorable busi-ness cl  i  mate.

Xiamen, and Shenzhen, pollution-belching smokestacks

  “Beijing, Shanghai, and other Chinese cities are being trans-
formed as the old is swept away in favor of the new. Locals, powerless to stop the process, complain that their neigh-borhoods are being destroyed and that their rel  o  cation to remote apartment complexes is a hardship. Urban planners argue that the ‘historic’ neighborhoods are often dilapi-dated, deca  y  ing, and beyond renovation. The housing shown in Figure 12.13 (top) was demolished to make room for what is going up in Figure 12.13 (bottom), a scene repeated count-less times throughout urba  n  izing China.”

tile roofs on the outskirts of the expan  d  ing city must make 
way for often faceless tenements (Fig. 12.13). Decaying 
remnants of the old city stand amid the glass-encased tow-ers that symbolize the new economic order. Modern sky-scrapers now dominate the skyline of the cities at the top of the Chinese urban-economic and administrative hierar-chy—including Beijing, Shanghai, and cities in SEZs. 
China’s major cities now play host to gleaming new air-ports, daring architecture, spectacular public projects, and the terminuses of efﬁ  cient high speed rai  l  roads.  
  At the same time, the Northeast has become China’s 
“Rust Belt.” Many of its state-run factories have been sold 
or closed, or are operating below capacity. Unemployment is high, and economic growth has stalled. Event  u  ally, the 
Northeast is likely to recover because of its resources and its favorable geographic site, but under the state’s new economic policies, the dynamic eastern and southern provinces have grown into major manufactu  r  ing belts and 
have changed the map of this part of the Paciﬁ  c Rim.  
  T oday, the Chinese government is pushing industri-
alization into the interior of the country, with new inves  t-
  ment ﬂ  owing into poorer parts of the central and western 
portions of the country. China is also looking to take advantage of its proximity to South and Southeast Asia through efforts to deepen transnational economic coo  p-
  eration. From a global perspective, what is particularly 
striking is the magnitude and inﬂ  uence of the Chinese 
economic juggernaut. On August 15, 2010, China ofﬁ  -
cially surpassed Japan as the world’s second largest eco  n-
  omy. China has become the world’s largest exporter, and 
its energy and raw materials demands are now affec  t  ing 
the global supply of key resources. T oday more passenger vehicles are purchased in China each year than in the United States, and Ch  i  na invests more domestically than 
any other country in the world.  
  None of the foregoing means that China will inevi-
tably become the dominant power of the twenty-ﬁ  rst cen-
tury. China’s economy still depends heavily on exports and 
foreign investment, and China’s GDP per capita, while on the rise, is 10 times smaller than J  a  pan’s and 12.5 times 
smaller than that of the United States. Moreover, there are potentially destabilizing social and environmental costs to China’s rapid rise, and with labor costs growing in China relative to Southeast Asia, China could be vulnera-ble to some of the very forces that gave it an adva  n  tage 
over other places not long ago.  
  The Wider World  
  Other newly industrializing countries have become 
increasingly signiﬁ  cant global nodes of production. Over 
the past decade manufacturing has surged in South and Southeast Asia, in South Africa, and in parts of Central and South America. Br  a  zil, Russia, India, China, and 
South Africa are increasingly grouped under the acronym c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 424  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 424  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

BRICS (each letter standing for one of these countries) 
because these are the countries that are evidence of a shift in global economic power away from the traditional ec  o-
  nomic core. As we have seen, China is currently leading 
the way, but India has recently become the world’s sixth largest economy. A  l  though industrial production in India 
is modest in the context of the country’s huge size and enormous popul  a  tion, major industrial complexes have 
developed around Calcutta (the Eastern district, with engineering, chem  i  cal, cotton, and jute industries, plus 
iron and steel based on the Chota Nagpur reserves), Mumbai (the Western district, where cheap electricity helps the cotton and chemical industries), and Chennai (the Southern district, with an emphasis on light engi-neering and te  x  tiles) (Fig. 12.15).  
  India has no major oil reserves, so it must spend 
heavily on oil energy. On the other hand, the country has 
a great deal of hydroelectric potential and access to ample coal. Its Bihar and Karnataka iron ore reserves may be   Field Note  
  “Humen is one of the Pearl River Delta cit-ies that has been transformed by the rise of China. The small textile factory I visited pr  o  vided insights into the opportunities and challenges that are confronting China today. The 40 or so employees were mostly young, but there were a few older folks. They were making women’s clothes for the French ma  r-  ket. Most of them made the clothes from start to ﬁ  nish, although there were a few unskilled laborers who were ironing the fab-ric, cutting off loose ends of thread, and so on. Into each of the items of clot  h  ing was sewn a label with a fancy-sounding Italian name. The clothes are sold in Humen for the equivalent of $1.50–$2.50 each, but most of them were destined for France, where they would be sold for 20 times that amount. The employees work under a contract that stipu-lates a 9 hour day and a base wage of about $275/month plus basic room and board. They can work more hours, however, and are compensated based on how much they produce during the extra hours. Apparently, almost all employees choose to work extra hours—typically seven days a week, with breaks only on Sunday evenings and one day at the beginning of each month. If they work that hard, they can earn the equivalent of close to $500/month. The main workroom had decent lighting and ventilation (it was hot, of course). The manager told me there had been signiﬁ  cant upward pressure on the wages of employees in the last few years, making it harder for him to earn much of a proﬁ  t. He worried about factories relocating to lower-wage countries. In addition, he said that he was having an increasingly difﬁ  cult time recruiting employees. He also noted with some mixture of amus  e  ment and annoyance that the people who had made out the best in his part of the city were the former farmers, who either had received substantial co  m  pensation (in the form of apartments) for being displaced or who were getting some share of rent for buildings co  n  structed on the land they used to farm.”

  Where from Here?  
  The diffusion of manufacturing activity to the semi-
periphery and periphery and the associated sensation of a shrin  k  ing world have led a few commentators to suggest 
that we are entering an era characterized by the “end of geo  g  raphy.” Alvin T ofﬂ  er ﬁ rst suggested this idea in his 
  Future Shock   (1970). More recently, Richard O’Brien 
a  d  vanced a similar idea in   Global Financial Integr  a  tion: The 
End of Geography   (1992) and Thomas Friedman suggested 
  The World Is Flat   (2005). Each author argues that a combi-
nation of technological changes and deve  l  opments in the 
global economy have reduced the signiﬁ  cance of location 
and made place differences increa  s  ingly insigniﬁ  cant. c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 425  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 425  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  HOW HAVE DEINDUSTRIALIZATION AND 
THE RISE OF SERVICE INDUSTRIES ALTERED GLOBAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY?  
  Service industries (tertiary industries) do not gener-
ate an actual, tangible product; instead, they encompass 
the range of services that are found in modern societies. So many different types of activities can be thought of as “service activities” that, as we saw in Cha  p  ter 11, special-
ized aspects of the service economy were given their own designations:   quaternary industries   for the collection, pro-
ces  s  ing, and manipulation of information and capital 
(ﬁ nance, administration, insurance, legal services, com-
puter services) and   quinary industries   for activ  i  ties that 
facilitate complex decision making and the advancement 
of human capacities (scientiﬁ  c research, higher education, 
high-level management).  
  Distinguishing among types of services is useful, 
given the extraordinary growth in the size and complexity 
of the service sector. In the global economic core, service industries employ more workers than the primary and secondary industries combined, yet these service indus-tries range from small-scale retailing to tourism services to research on the causes of cancer. Placing all of these activities in a single category seems unwarranted.  
  Speciﬁ  city in terminology is also useful in high-
lighting different phases in the development of the ser-
vice sector. In the early decades of the twentieth  century, 
the domestic and quasi-domestic tertiary industries were experiencing rapid growth in the industrialized world. With the approach of World War II, the quater-nary sector began expanding rapidly, and this expansion continued after the war. During the last three decades, both the quaternary and quinary sectors have experi-enced very rapid growth, giving greater meaning to the term   postindustrial  .  
  The expanding service sector in the core economies 
is only one aspect of the changing global economy. 
A  c  companying, and in some cases driving, this expansion 
are several other developments that have already been mentioned: the increasing mechanization of production, particularly in manufacturing enterprises operating in the core; the growth of large multinational corporations; and the dispersal of the production process.  Geographers who study industrial production recognize that the nature and meaning of loc  a  tion and place have 
changed greatly in recent times, but they also note that 
these changes do not create a ge  o  graphically undifferenti-
ated world. Hence, what is needed is a greater understand-
ing of how places have changed as a result of new produc-tion methods, new co  r  porate structures, and new patterns 
of industry, as well as an examination of how the interplay 
between global processes and local places is creating oppo  r-
  tunities and constraints for different parts of the planet.  
   Think about a cutting-edge, high-technology product that 
is still quite expensive to purchase and not yet broadly used (perhaps something you have read about but not even c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 426  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 426  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Have Deindustrialization and the Rise of Service Industries Altered Global Economic Activity? 427
  Geographical Dimensions of the 
Service Economy  
  Deindustrialization and the growth of the service economy 
unfolded in the context of a world-economy that was already characterized by wide socioeconomic disparities. Only areas that had industry could deindustrialize, of course, and at the global scale the wealthier industrial regions were the most successful in establishing a posti  n-
  dustrial service economy. Deindustrialization did little to 
change the basic di  s  parities between core and periphery 
that have long characterized the global economy. Even in 
the man  u  facturing realm, the availability of capital, mech-
anization, and innovative production strategies allowed 
the core industrial regions to retain their dominance. In the ﬁ  rst decade of the twenty-ﬁ  rst century, eastern Asia, 
western Russia and Ukraine, western E  u  rope, and North 
America still account for well over 75 percent of the world’s 
total output of manufactured goods.  
  Despite its continued dominance in the manufactur-
ing arena, the core has experienced some wrenching 
changes associated with the economic shifts of the past four decades. Anyone who has ever spent time in northern Ind  i  ana, the British Midlands, or Sil  e  sia (southern Poland 
and northeastern Czech Republic) knows that there are 
pockets of signiﬁ  cant hardship in relatively prosperous 
countries (Fig. 12.16). These are the result of large-scale deindustrialization. In the United Kingdom, the major industrial zones of Newcastle, Liverpool, and Manche  s  ter 
lost much of their industrial bases during the 1960s and 
1970s. Similarly, the industrial zone of the northeastern 
United States (around the Great Lakes) lost much of its industrial base in the same time period, with steel manufac-turing jobs moving to areas of the world with lower wages. This region of the United States, which used to be called the Manufacturing Belt, is now commonly called the Rust 
Belt, evoking the image of long-abandoned, rusted-out steel factories (Fig. 12.17). More recently, the global eco-nomic downturn that began in 2008 has resulted in devas-tating job losses in communities dependent on both se  c-
  ondary and tertiary industries. These examples serve to 
remind us that not all deindustrialized regions ﬁ  nd their 
niche easily in the new service eco  n  omy and that a tertiary 
economy, once established, does not necessarily buffer 
places from recessionary trends.  
  Nonetheless, some secondary industrial regions 
have made the transition to a viable service economy 
fairly su  c  cessfully. The   Sun Belt   is the southern region 
of the United States, stretching through the Southeast 
to the Southwest. Both the population and economy of this region have grown over the last few decades, as ser-vice sector businesses have chosen to locate in areas such as Atlanta and Dallas where the climate is warm and the local laws welcome their presence. The eastern part of the Sun Belt served as an early indu  s  trial region, 
with Birmingham developing an iron and steel econ-
omy and Atlanta an industrial economy around cotton, tobacco, and furniture. In recent decades, high-tech and ﬁ  nancial indu  s  tries changed the economy and land-
scape of the Sun Belt, as can be seen in the toponyms of 
stadiums in the region, such as Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Flo  r  ida; Bank of America Stadium in 
Cha  r  lotte, North Carolina; and American Airlines 
Center in Dallas, T exs.     Figure 12.16   
  Liverpool, England, United Kingdom.     With the 
deindustrialization of the Liverpool region, the city 
has lost thousands of jobs and the city’s population has decreased by one-third. Abandoned streets, such as this one, are a re  ﬂ    ection of the city’s industrial 
decline.

428 Chapter 12   Industry and Services
  New Patterns of Economic Activity  
  With the striking growth of the service sector and infor-
mation technologies, new factors have come into play that are affecting patterns of economic activity. Most ser-vice industries are not tied to raw materials and do not need large amounts of energy. Hence, those factors of production are markedly less important for service indu  s-
  tries than for traditional manufacturing concerns. Market 
accessibi  l  ity is more relevant for the service sector, but 
advances in telecommunications have rendered even that 
factor less important for some types of service i  n  dustries.  
  T o understand the inﬂ  uences that shape the location of 
services, it is useful to go back to our distinction among 
 tertiary, quaternary, and quinary industries. T ertiary services 
related to transportation and communication are closely tied to population patterns and to the location of primary and secondary industries. As the basic facil  i  tators of interac-
tion, they are strongly linked to the basic geography of 
 production and consumption. Other te  r  tiary services—
restaurants, hotels, and retail establishments—are inﬂ  u-enced mainly by market considerations. If they are located 
far from their consumers, they are unlikely to succeed.  
  Employing technologies such as Geographic 
Information Systems (GIS) (see Chapter 1), geographers 
can model the best locations for new businesses, ofﬁ  ce 
complexes, government centers, or transportation conne  c-
  tions. Major retailers not only shape the lan  d  scapes of the 
places where they choose to put stores, but they also change 
the economic prospects and physical landscapes of the places where their headquarters are located. Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, provides a particu-larly striking example. If producers of co  n  sumer products 
want to sell their goods in Wal-Mart stores, they must 
travel to Bentonville, Arkansas, to neg  o  tiate deals with 
Wal-Mart. In order to provide low prices to consumers, 
Wal-Mart negotiates very low prices with major producers. T o create lower-priced products, companies have moved production abroad, and to create good relationships with the world’s number one retailer (with sales of $405 billion in ﬁ  scal year 2010), a variety of companies have moved into 40°

Arkansas (Fig. 12.18). Those companies, along with an 
a  r  ray of other business supporting their activities (hotels, 
resta  u  rants, copy centers, delivery services), have funda-
mentally transformed the city.  
  The locational inﬂ  uences on quaternary services—
high-level services aimed at the collection, processing, 
and manipulation of information and capital—are more diverse. Some of these services are strongly tied ge  o-
  graphically to a particular locus of economic activity. 
Retail banking and various types of administrative se  r-
  vices require a high level of interpersonal contact and 
therefore tend to be located near the businesses they are serving. Other types of quaternary services can operate almost anywhere as long as they have access to digital processing equipment and telecommunications. When you send in your credit card bill, it is unlikely to go to the city where the headquarters of the issuing bank is located. Instead, it is likely to go to North Dakota, South Dakota, N  e  braska, or Colorado. Similarly, many “back-ofﬁ  ce” tasks related to insurance are performed in places such as 
Des Moines, Iowa, not Chicago or Hartford. Many of the call centers for technical help for computers and related industries (software, hardware) are l  o  cated in India and 
the Philippines. With relatively high levels of college 
education, vast numbers of English speakers, and phones routed through the Internet, “help desks” need not be located down the hall or even down the street. These locational curiosities occur b  e  cause technological 
advances in the telecommunications sector have made it 
possible for all sorts of quaternary industries to be located far away from either producers or consumers. What mat-ters most is infrastructure, a workforce that is sufﬁ  ciently 
skilled but not too expensive, and favorable tax rates.  
  Those who work in the quinary sector tend to be 
concentrated around governmental seats, universities, 
and corp  o  rate headquarters. Corporate headquarters 
tend to be located in large metropolitan areas, whereas 
seats of gover  n  ment and universities can be found in   Guest Field Note  
  Fayetteville, Arkansas  
  For most geographers, the simple act of 
daily observation of the world around them becomes a profoundly sati  s  fying habit. For the last 17 years, my daily observations have been of the rapidly changing urban/ eco-nomic landscape of northwest Arkansas, one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States. Wal-Mart originated in Bentonville, Arkansas, and as it became increasingly successful, it remained commit-ted to its home in this affordable, rural cor-ner of the mid-South. By the early 1990s the company’s growth had fueled the growth of other service industries and had contributed to the retention of several other major cor-porations. A recent decision to require Wal-Mart suppliers to locate ofﬁ  ces in the region 
has similarly boosted growth in the area. Procter & Gamble put its ofﬁ  ce in Fayetteville only 25 miles from Wal-Mart’s 
home in Bentonville. Do  z  ens of other major corporations have a presence in the r  e  gion as well. The results have been bo th 
positive and negative. Property prices have risen, with rising tax revenues and better public service provision, and the  corp  o  rations have proven to be generous philanthropists. However, sprawl, congestion, overc rowded schools, and s  e  rious 
waste disposal issues have also followed. This once-rural corner of America has become a metropolitan growth pole,  complete with national coffee shops, rush hour congestion, and sprawling golf-course subdivisions of 6000- square-foot “Eur  o  pean” mansions.

places that were chosen long ago as appropriate sites 
for administrative or educational activities based on cultural values or political compr  o  mises. The American ideal of the 
 “university town” (which originated in Germany) led to 
the establishment of many universities at a di  s  tance 
from major commercial and population centers, in such 
towns as Champaign-Urbana, Illinois; Norman, Oklahoma; and Eugene, Oregon. Political compro-mises led to the establishment of major seats of govern-ment in small towns. O  t  tawa, Canada, and Canberra, 
Australia, are examples of this phenomenon. The point 
is that historical location d  e  cisions inﬂ  uence the geog-
raphy of the quinary sector. And it is not just university 
professors and government ofﬁ      cials who are affected. 
All sorts of high-level research and development activi-
ties are located on the fringes of universities, and a host of specialized consultants are concentrated around governmental centers. These then b  e  come major nodes 
of quinary activity.  
  High-Technology Clusters  
  A high-technology corridor is an area designated by local 
or state government to beneﬁ  t from lower taxes and high-technology infrastructure, with the goal of providing high-technology jobs to the local population. The goal of a high-technology corridor is to attract designers of com-puters, semiconductors, telecommunications, sophisti-cated medical equipment, and the like.  
  California’s Silicon Valley is a well-known example 
of a high-technology corridor. Several decades ago a 
nu  m  ber of innovative technology companies located 
their research and development activities in the area 
around the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University near San Francisco, California. They were attracted by the prospect of developing links with existing research communities and the availability of a highly educated workforce. Once some high-technology businesses located in the Silicon Valley,  others were drawn to the area as well. The area became 
what geographers call a   growth pole  , not just because 
other high-technolgy bus  i  nesses came to Silicon Valley, 
but because the concentration of these businesses 
spurred economic development in the surrounding area  .   T oday, the Silicon Valley is home to dozens of 
computer companies, many of which are familiar to the 
computer literate (such as Cisco Systems, Adobe, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, IBM, and Ne  t  scape). The 
resulting collection of high-technology industries pro-
duced what Manuel Castells, Peter Hall, and John Hutriyk call a   technopole  , an area planned for high 
technology where agglom  e  ration built on a synergy 
among technological companies occurs. A similar sort of technopole developed outside Boston, where the 
co  n  centration of technology-based businesses close to 
Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of 
T ec  h  nology gave rise to what is called the Route 128 
high-technology corridor. The Route 128 corridor has 
been largely supported by the federal government rather than the local government, which supports many other tec  h  nopoles.  
  T echnopoles can be found in a number of countries 
in western Europe, eastern Asia, North America, and 
Au  s  tralia. Few are on the scale of Silicon Valley, but they 
are noticeable elements of the economic landscape. 
Many of them have sprung up on the edges of good-sized cities, particularly near airports. In Brussels (Belgium), for example, the route into the city from the airport passes an array of buildings occupied by com-puter, commun  i  cation, and electronics ﬁ  rms. In 
Washington, D.C., the route from Dulles International 
Airport (located in the Virginia suburbs) to the city passes buildings housing the headquarters of companies such as AOL, MCI, and Orbital Sciences (the Dulles Corridor). In the T elecom Corridor of Plano-Richardson (just outside of Dallas, T exas), telecom com-panies such as Nortel and Ericsson have taken root, but so too have numerous high-technology companies that are not telecom related (Fig. 12.19). In each of these technopoloes, the presence of major multinational com-panies attracts other startup companies ho  p  ing to 
become major companies, provide services to major 
companies, or be bought by major companies.  
  Many of the technology ﬁ  rms are multinationals, 
and like their counterparts in other countries, they func-
tion in an information environment and market their products all over the world. Being near raw materials or even a particular market is unimportant for these ﬁ  rms; 
what matters to them is proximity to major networks of tran  s  portation and communication. High-technology 
industries have become such an important symbol of the 
pos  t  industrial world that local, regional, and national 
governments often pursue aggressive policies to attract 
ﬁ rms in this sector. Bidding wars sometimes develop 
between localities seeking to attract such industries. Although high-technology industries often bring a vari-ety of economic beneﬁ  ts, they have some drawbacks as well. Communities that have attracted production facili-ties ﬁ  nd that the manufacture of computer chips, sem  i-
  conductors, and the like requires toxic chemicals and 
large quantities of water. And even more research-ori-ented establishments sometimes have negative environ-mental impacts in that land must be cleared and buil  d-
  ings constructed to house them. Despite these 
drawbacks, the high-technology sector is clearly here to stay, and areas that can tap into it are likely to ﬁ  nd them-
selves in an advantageous economic position in the com-ing years.  c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 430  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501c12IndustryandServices.indd Page 430  9/19/11  12:13 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
 How Have Deindustrialization and the Rise of Service Industries Altered Global Economic Activity? 431
  Tourism Services  
  Every service industry has its own locational characteris-
tics, but tourism is almost in a class by itself due to its geographical extent and economic signiﬁ  cance. Once a rela-tively small activity conﬁ  ned to a set of specialized locations, tourism is now the world’s largest service sector industry.  
  T ourism grew dramatically during the second half of 
the twentieth century. The tourism boom began in the 
global economic core as incomes and leisure time increased for a rapidly expanding segment of the population. Over the past three decades, the number of East and Southeast Asian tourists has risen much faster than the global average, reﬂ ecting the economic boom in many of the Paciﬁ  c Rim 
cou  n  tries. The combination of a weakening global econ-
omy and concerns over political stability caused noticeable 
dips in travel at the begi  n  ning and end of the ﬁ  rst decade of 
the twenty-ﬁ  rst century, but absent a major economic or 
geopolitical crisis, tourism is likely to continue to expand.  
  In Chapter 10 we looked at some of the social and 
cultural impacts of tourism, but it is important to recog-
nize that tourism is a major industry as well. Communities all over the world have worked hard to promote tourism, and many are now notably reliant on tourist receipts. The tourist industry has transformed downtowns, ports, hin-terlands, parks, and waterfronts. High-rise, ultramodern hotels dominate urban skylines from Boston to Bri  s  bane. 
The Port of Miami and Fort Lauderdale’s Port Everglades 
have been reconstructed to serve the cruise i  n  dustry, and 
many ports from T okyo to T ampa have added cruise termi-
nals complete with shopping malls and re  s  taurants. Theme 
parks such as Disney’s establishments near Orlando, Paris, 
T okyo, and Los Angeles draw millions of visitors and d  i  rectly and indirectly employ thousands of workers. 
Dubai has constructed an indoor ski run in the Mall of the 
Emirates in an effort to attract more visitors. Once-remote wildlife parks and nature reserves in East Africa and South Asia now receive thousands of visitors, requiring expanded facil  i  ties and sometimes causing ecological damage. 
Formerly isolated beaches are now lined by high-rise 
hotels and resorts; in the Caribbean and the Paciﬁ  c, some 
entire islands have been taken over by tour oper  a  tors.  
  The economic impacts of tourist-related development 
are far-reaching. The monetary value of goods and se  r  vices 
associated with tourism is now conservatively estimated at 
more than $2 trillion—and if spillover effects are taken into consideration, the ﬁ  gure could be twice as large. With the growing middle class in China and India and with increases in average life expectancy, the ﬁ  gure is likely to continue to grow, affecting the prospects of places all over the world.  
  Place Vulnerabilities in a Service Economy  
  Every type of economy carries with it potential vulnera-
bilities. In the early stages of industr  i  alization the eco-
n  o  mic destinies of places was tied to the manufacturing 
operations established in those places. As a result, such places were vulnerable to wrenching adjustments when demand shifted for the goods produced by local manufac-turers or when the changing costs of transportation or labor lead business owners to downscale or shift produc-tion elsewhere. Many older industrial areas in the United States and Europe exper  i  enced such adjustments, and 
their best hope for rebuilding often lay in the service economy. Thus, in Dui  s  burg—a city at the heart of

Germany’s Ruhr Valley—abandoned steel mills were 
turned into tourist attractions and warehouses were con-verted into retail establishments, restaurants, and o  f  ﬁ ces 
(Fig. 12.20).  
  Service economies have their own vulnerabilities. 
T ourism can fall off in the face of economic downturns or 
natural hazards, and ofﬁ  ce work can be outsourced to dis-tant places. Mechanization can also have a negative impact. We usually think of manufacturing jobs b  e  ing affected by 
mechanization, but service jobs are vulnerable as well. In 
recent decades countless jobs in the travel planning industry have been lost to the Internet, scanning machines in s  u  per-
markets have reduced the need for employees, and auto-
mated answering services have taken the place of live voices in many businesses. Changes of this sort can create the same sorts of hardships and pressures for ec  o  nomic rea  d  justment 
that communities reliant on secondary industries face.  
  At a different spatial scale, the very geographical struc-
ture of large-scale service economies can affect the fo  r  tunes 
of places, regions, countries, and even the globe. Places 
dominated by the service sector cannot exist without exten-sive connections with other places because those living in such places still need food and material products, and they often need a large market to sustain their services. Hence, the dramatic shift away from the primary and secondary sec-tors that has taken place in some parts of the world is ine  x  tri-
cably tied to economic globalization. But economic decision 
making in a globalized economy can easily become discon-nected from the fate of individual places and regions.  
  The burgeoning ﬁ  nancial service industry provides a 
case in point. That industry has grown explosively over the past few decades with the development of increasingly inno-
vative products and arrangements. Some people made spec-tacular amounts of money in the process, but in recent decades key ﬁ  nancial instruments and proc  e  dures were 
developed based on unrealistic assumptions about concrete 
circumstances. Banks made loans they should not have made, and mortgages were issued to people who were unlikely to be able to meet their pa  y  ments. These practices 
helped to bring about the dramatic economic downturn that 
began in 2008, when a hou  s  ing slump precipitated high lev-
els of defaults on so-called subprime mortgages. A banking 
crisis ensued that rippled throughout the eco  n  omy and, in 
our interconnected world, affected the fortunes and pros-
pects of places near and far. The crisis serves as a reminder of the continuing vulnerabilities of places in a service economy, even in the absence of any direct challenge to the speciﬁ  c 
service industries on which particular local econ  o  mies are 
based. It also raises a key question with a geographical foun-
dation: what are the consequences of d  i  vorcing the develop-
ment of wealth in a knowledge economy from the fate of 
individual places, regions, or cou  n  tries?  
  How does a place change when deindustrialization occurs? 
Consider a place that has experienced deindustrial  i  zation, and research recent news articles on the Internet to ﬁ  nd out 
how the economy of the place has changed since the loss of industry. What has ha  p  pened to the place and its economy?

  Summary  
  The Industrial Revolution transformed the world economically, politically, and socially. 
Many of the places where industrialization ﬁ  rst took hold have since become deindus-trialized, both with the relocation of manufacturing plants and with the outsourcing of steps of the production process domestically and offshore. With changing ec  o  nom-
ics, places change. Some now look like ghost towns, serving merely as a reminder that industrialization took place there. Others have booming economies and are thriving, having kept industry or having successfully deve  l  oped a service economy. Still other 
places are redeﬁ  ning themselves. In the next chapter, we consider another las  t  ing effect 
of industrialization and deindustrialization: environmental change.

  Watching the horrors of the tsunami of December 26, 2004 unfold on screen 
(Fig. 13. 1), I found it quite e  e  rie to see such devastation in places where earlier I

  A few weeks later I began to hear and read stories about an English girl named 
  Tilly   Smith, who had been vacationing with her parents at a hotel on the beach at   Phuket   and was on   Maikhao   Beach when she saw the water suddenly recede into the distance.   Tilly   had just taken a geography class in her school not far from London, and her teacher, Mr. Andrew Kearney, had told the class what happens when a tsu-nami strikes: the huge approaching wave ﬁ  rst sucks the water off the beaches and 
then the sea foams, rises and returns as a massive, breaking wall that crashes over and inundates the whole shoreline.   Tilly   saw what was happening and alerted her par-ents, her father told hotel security, and they ran back and forth, screaming at beach-goers to seek shelter on higher ground in the hotel behind them. About a hundred people followed the Smith family into the   building  , and they all survived. Of those who stayed behind, none did. Being aware of some of the basics of physical geog-raphy has its advantages, and Mr. Kearney clearly had the attention of his students.  
  Newspaper editors could use some of this awareness. Many headlines referred 
to the tsunami as a tidal wave, but a tsunami has nothing to do with the tides that affect all oceans and seas. A tsunami results from an undersea earthquake involv-ing a large displacement of the Earth’s crust. Most submarine earthquakes do not generate tsunamis, but in some cases, fortunately relatively rare ones, a large piece of crust is pushed up or pulled under (or both), and this causes the water overhead to pile up and start rolling away in all directions. If you were on a cruise ship some-where in the middle of the ocean, nothing catastrophic would mark the passing of this tsunami wave; your ship would be lifted up and then lowered, but it would not overturn. But when such a huge wave reaches a beach, it does what all waves do: it breaks. Most of us have seen this happen with waves several feet (or even tens of feet) high. But imagine a wave over 200 feet high approaching a beach. As it begins to break, it pulls the water away, exposing wide swaths of muddy bottom. Then it comes crashing into the shore, pushing deep inland.  
  Tsunamis of the magnitude of 2004 are not common, but as the deadly tsu-
nami that struck the northeast coast of Japan in 2011 reminds us, the hazard is  continuous. As the Earth’s human population has grown, so have the numbers of people vulnerable to such a calamity. As we learn more about the submarine zones where earthquakes are most likely to occur, we can begin to determine where the hazards are greatest. Here we combine two major ﬁ  elds of study in geography, phys-ical geography and human geography. Ge  o  graphers who work in this arena study human-environmental relationships—the reciprocal relationships between human societies and natural environments. Both, clearly, are dynamic. The environment is not a passive stage, and environmental change affects human societies. At the same time, humans have an impact on their natural environments. The study of hazards, not just from tsunamis but also from volcanic eruptions, terrestrial earthquakes, landslides, ﬂ  oods, avalanches, and other threats, is a key part of this research.  
  The tsunami that struck coasts along the Indian Ocean from Indonesia to 
Somalia and from Thailand to the Maldives resulted from a violent earthquake measuring more than 9.0 on the (10-point) Richter scale off the west coast of the island of Sumatra (Indonesia).  
  There, two of the planet’s tectonic plates are colliding, forcing one beneath 
the other (Fig. 13.2). A series of tremors and quakes affects the crust in such   sub-duction   zones, but sometimes a major shock occurs. In this case, the towering wave generated by the December 26 earthquake had but a short distance to travel to reach northern Sumatra, where it struck in full force. By the time it had done its c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 435  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 435  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

damage in remote Somalia (in Africa), it had claimed approximately 300,000 lives 
and ruined the livelihoods of millions more. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami illus-trated one consequence of the tourist indu  s  try: drawing millions of tourists and workers to coasts makes them more vulnerable to coastal hazards.   
  Geography is a discipline in which the relationship between humans and the 
environment is a primary concern. One of the most inﬂ  uential nineteenth-century 
texts on this relationship,   Man and Nature    (1865), was written by the geographer 
George Perkins Marsh. In 1955, geographers were centrally involved in an inter-national interdisciplinary symposium on “Man’s Role in Changing the Face of the Earth.” This symposium, like Marsh’s earlier book, focused primarily on local and regional changes. More recently, a symposium led by geographers on “The Earth as Transformed by Human Action” picked up where the 1955 discussion left off, addressing global env  i  ronmental changes. The geographer’s concern with how things are organized on Earth and how places are connected provides an analytical platform from which to consider human-induced environmental change.  
  As the study of environmental change has moved forward, one of the most 
important lessons we have learned is that global environmental systems are inter-connected at numerous temporal and spatial scales. For example, the release of   chloroﬂ  uorocarbons   (CFCs) in the northern hemisphere contributed to a hole in 
the Earth’s ozone layer over Antarctica. Industrial production in the Netherlands and Germany contributes to acid rain in Scandinavia. The use of water from the Rio Grande for irrigation in northern New Mexico affects the amount and quality of the river’s water that ﬂ  ows along the Texas-Mexico border. Human actions—the activities we undertake individually and collectively—are increasingly important factors in all sorts of global environmental changes. To confront these changes, we must consider the complex relationship between humans and environment.  00 4000 2000 6000 Kilometers

 How Has Earth’s Environment Changed Over Time? 437
  HOW HAS EARTH’S ENVIRONMENT 
CHANGED   OVER   TIME?  
  Environmental variation, spatial as well as temporal, 
is one of Earth’s crucial characteristics. T emperatures rise 
and fall, precipitation waxes and wanes. Forests ﬂ  ourish 
and wither, deserts expand and contract. Humanity has evolved during a series of altern  a  tively warm and cold 
phases of an Ice Age that is still in progress. But today humanity itself is part of the process.  
  Modern   Homo sapiens   emerged less than 200,000 
years ago (and possibly not much more than 100,000 years 
ago). Humans altered their environment from the begin-ning by setting ﬁ  res to kill herds of reindeer and bison, or hunting entire species of large mammals to extinc-tion. The Maori, who arrived in New Zealand not much more than 1000 years ago, greatly altered native species of animals and plants long before the advent of modern technology. Elsewhere in the Paciﬁ  c realm, Pol  y  nesians 
reduced forest cover to brush and, with their penchant for wearing bird-feather robes, exterminated more than 80 percent of the regional bird species by the time the ﬁ  rst 
Europeans arrived. Europeans r  a  vaged species ranging 
from Galapagos turtles to Antarctic seals. European fash-ions had a disastrous impact on African species ranging from snakes to leopards. T raditional as well as modern societies have had devastating impacts on their ecosys-tems (ecological units consisting of self-regulating a  s  so-
ciations of living and nonliving natural elements) as well as on ecosystems into which they migrated.  
  Human alteration of environment continues in 
many forms today. For the ﬁ  rst time in history, how-
ever, the co  m  bined impact of humanity’s destructive and 
exploitative actions is capable of producing environmen-tal changes at the global scale. Consider for a moment the history of human life on Earth. Early human societies had relatively small popul  a  tions, and their impacts on the 
physical environment were limited in both duration and intensity. With the development of agrarian and   prein-
dustrial   societies, human alterations of the physical envi-
ronment increased, yet the effects of these early activities were still limited in scale.   Even the onset of urbaniza-
tion and the development of urban centers, which con-
ce  n  trated large numbers of people in particular places,   Key Questions     For   Chapter 13

had relatively limited effects on a global scale.   Over the 
last 500 years, however, both the rate and the scale at 
which humans modify Earth have i  n  creased dramatically. 
Particularly during the last half-century, every place on earth has been transformed, either directly or indirectly, by h  u  mans.  
  During our brief presence on this planet, humans 
have had a powerful impact on environments ranging 
from rainforests to   tundras  . Long before we became tech-
nologically proﬁ  cient we exterminated wildlife by the mil-
lions and burned grasslands and forests by the hundreds of thousands of square miles. The twentieth-century surge in the size of the human population, combined with a ra  p  id escalation in consumption, magniﬁ  es human-
ity’s impact on Earth in unprecedented ways. Although   Homo sapiens   have not domina  t  ed this world long, we have 
had enough of an impact that atmospheric chemist Paul 
  Crutzen   deﬁ  ned a new geologic epoch called the   anthr  o-
  pocene   to acknowledge the incredible role humans play 
in shaping Earth’s environment.  
  Tectonic Plates  
  How representative is the short-term present of the long-
term past? Over the past century, geographers and other scientists have been engaged in a joint mission to recon-struct our planet’s history on the basis of current evi-dence. One of them, the climatologist-geographer Alfred   Wegener  , used his spatial view of the world to make a key 
contribution. Viewing the i  n  creasingly accurate maps of 
the opposite coastlines of the North and South Atlantic 
oceans, he proposed a hypothesis that would a  c  count for 
the close “ﬁ  t” of the shapes of the facing continents, which, 
he argued, would be unlikely to be a matter of chance. His co  n  tinental drift hypothesis required the preexistence of a 
  supercontinent  , which he called   Pangaea  , that   broke apart 
into the fragments we now know as Africa, the Americas, 
Eurasia, and Australia (Fig. 13.3).   Wegener’s   hypothesis 
engendered the later theory of plate tectonics and   crustal   
spreading, and scientists now know that Pangaea and its 
fragmentation were only the latest episodes in a cycle of continental coalescence and spli  n  tering that spans billions 
of years. This latest   Pangaean   breakup, however, began 
only 180 million years ago and continues to this day.  c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 437  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 437  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

  At plate boundaries,   tectonic plates   either   diverge   
(spread apart),   converge   (come together) or   transform   
(slide past one another). In the Atlantic Ocean, the North 
American plate is diverging from the Eurasian plate. Along this plate boundary, new oceanic crust is constantly being created where the plates diverge. A chain of volca-noes called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have formed on the ocean ﬂ  oor.     Figure 13.3

 How Has Earth’s Environment Changed Over Time? 439
  Where the Indian plate meets the Eurasian plate, the 
two plates are converging. The Himalaya Mountains on 
this plate boundary were built through convergence. The Himalayas are still lifting, and earthquakes are relatively common in the region as a result. When an oceanic plate converges with a continental plate, it is called a   subduction   
zone. In a   subduction   zone, the denser oceanic plate   sub-
ducts   under the continental plate, creating a trench along 
the boundary as well as volcanoes and strong earthquakes. Most of the strongest earthquakes that occur, including Haiti, Chile, and Japan in 2010 and 2011, happen along   subduction   zones.  
  Where the North American plate meets the Paciﬁ  c 
plate, in and near California, the two tectonic plates are 
moving past each other, which   is   called a transform plate 
boundary. Earthquakes are also common in this region. However, vo  l  canoes are not. Compare Figure 13.2 with 
Figure 13.5, and look for the correlation between   subduc-
tion   zones and active volcanoes. Focus on the transform 
boundary in and near California. Earthquakes are com-mon but volcanoes are not. This is because unlike diver-gent boundaries where a magma source is creating new crust, often through volcanoes, or a   subduction   zone 
where one plate is being crushed to mo  l  ten rock under 
the heat and pressure of another plate, magma is not com-mon in transform boundaries. Rather, the plates move past each other, pressure builds up, and that pressure is released in earthquakes.  
  Ocean and Atmosphere  
  Earth is often called the Blue Planet because more than 
70 percent of its surface is covered by water and views from space are dominated by blue hues and swirls of white clouds. We do not know with any certainty how Earth acquired its watery cloak or exactly when. Some scientists hypothesize that the water was originally trapped inside Earth during its formation and rose to the surface during the time when heavier constituents sank to form the core. Others calc  u  late that most of the 
water that did reach the surface in this way would have 
been evaporated into space by the searing heat then prevailing, suggesting that another source must be iden-tiﬁ ed. This has led to the comet hypothesis, which pro-
poses that icy comets bombarded Earth for more than a billion years while its atmosphere was still thin, accu-mulating fresh water from space that ﬁ  lled the basins in the formative crust.  
  Neither do we know precisely how the atmosphere 
formed. Originally, the atmosphere was loaded with the 
gas carbon dioxide (CO  
2  ), and if you could have looked 
up at the sky it would have been bright red because CO  2   
scatters red light. Eventually, however, the primitive 
ocean, still heated from below, began to absorb CO  2   in huge quantities. A very long time passed before oxygen 
became a substantial gas in the atmosphere. Around 1500 million years ago, green algae started to spread across Earth’s ocean surfaces, and as their colonies grew, their   photosynthesis   (the conversion of carbon dioxide 
and water into carbohydrates and oxygen through the 
absorption of sunlight) raised the atmosphere’s oxygen co  n  tent. About 800 million years ago, the oxygen con-
tent in the atmosphere was about one-twentieth of its 
present strength, or just 1 percent of the total. But that was enough to support the emergence of the ﬁ  rst single-
celled animals, the prot  o  zoa.  
  Fire and Ice  
  T oday major volcanic eruptions happen infrequently 
enough that they make the news.   Krakatoa   (1883), 
Mount St. Helens (1980), Pinatubo (1991), and   Merapi   
(2010) took many lives, damaged property, and, in the case of Pinatubo, even changed global climate slightly. In 2010 a relatively mild eruption of the Icelandic volcano   Eyjafjallajökull   spewed enough ash in the air to disrupt 
air trafﬁ  c across the northern Atlantic for more than a 
week. Over the past three decades, ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea volcano have a  l  tered the coastline of the Big 
Island of   Hawai’i   (Fig. 13. 4).  
  Y et such events are relatively minor compared to 
one billion years ago, when Earth’s crust was still imma-
ture and subject to huge bursts of volcanic activity. Such episodes poured incalculable volumes of gases and ash into the atmosphere, causing   mass depletions   (loss 
of diversity through a failure to produce new species) 
and contributing to the three   mass extinctions   (mass 
destruction of most sp  e  cies) known to have occurred over 
the past 500 million years.  
  The Earth’s most recent experience with mass vol-
canism took place between 180 and 160 million years ago, 
when the   supercontinent   Pangaea began to fracture. Lava 
poured from ﬁ  ssures and vents as South America separated 
from Africa and India moved northeast. Skies were black-ened, the atmosphere choked with ash. Animals responded as they always have in time of crisis: by migra  t  ing, frag-
menting into smaller groups, and speeding up their adap-
tive, evolutionary response. Physical geographers hypoth-esize that the earliest phase of Pangaea’s fragmentation was also the most vi  o  lent, that the plate separations that started 
it all were driven by built-up, extreme heat below the   s  u  per-
continent  , but that the motion of the plates has since slowed 
down. The   Paciﬁ  c Ring of Fire  —an ocean-girdling zone 
of   crustal   instability, volcanism, and earthquakes—is but a 
trace of the paroxysm that marked the onset of Pangaea’s 
breakup (Fig. 13.5). Y et, as we saw with the tsunami in Japan in 2011, tectonic events have cost millions of humans their lives and altered the course of history.  c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 439  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 439  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
440 Chapter 13  The Humanized Environment
  When Pangaea still was a   supercontinent  , an Ice 
Age cooled the Earth and may have contributed to, if not 
caused, the greatest known extinction crisis in the history of life on Earth. Ice Ages are not uniform cooling events: surges of col  d  ness and advances of glaciers are interrupted 
by temporary warming spells long enough to reverse much of the glacial impact. By the time the   Pleistocene   
epoch opened, less than 2 million years ago, the planet 
was in a deep freeze.  
  The Pleistocene epoch was marked by long   glacia-
tions   and short, warm   interglacials  . When the Pleistocene 
glaciations were most severe, permanent ice advanced deep 
into the landmasses of the Northern Hemisphere. Plants, an  i  mals, and hominids saw their living space diminished, 
their refuges shrunk, their niches unusable. Such glacia-
tions could last as long as 100,000 years, but eventually a warming spell would arrive, the ice would recede, and space as well as opportun  i  ty expanded again. A warming 
phase of this kind occurred between about 120,000 and 
100,000 years ago.  
  After this warm-up came the most recent   glaciation   
of the Pleistocene, the   Wisconsinan      Glaciation  , which left its mark on much of the Northern Hemisphere 
(Fig. 13.6).   But resourceful humans managed to survive 
where their pred  e  cessors could not, and there is ample evi-
dence of human occupation in ice-covered Europe, rang-
ing from cave art to tool kits. Even during a glacial advance brief periods of milder climate emerge. Thus, Figure 13.6 represents a glacial extreme, not the whole picture. So human communities—ﬁ  shing, hunting and gathering, and 
using increasingly sophisticated tools (and probably means of verbal communication)—exploited the milder times to expand their frontiers, then hunkered down when it got cold again.  
  About 73,500 years ago, something happened that 
appears to have come close to exterminating human-
ity altoget  h  er. A volcano, Mount   T oba  , erupted on the 
Indonesian island of Sumatra. This was not just an erup-tion: the entire mountain exploded, sending millions of tons of debris into orbit, obscuring the sun, creating long-term darkness, and alte  r  ing global climate. Mount 
  T oba’s   detonation could hardly have come at a worse 
time. Earth’s habitable zone was a  l  ready constricted 
because of   glaciation  . Anthropologists refer to this event   Field Note  
  “Kilauea has been erupting almost cont  i  nu-ously since 1983, making it one of Earth’s most active volcanoes. After ﬂ  ying over 
the volcano in a helicopter and looking down at the molten lava, I asked the pilot to take us to the coast where the lava was spilling into the sea. What we saw provided a stirring r  e  minder that the environment is anything but static. Lava had poured across the road that ran along the coast, and the conﬁ  guration of the coast was being 
remade before our eyes.”

as humanity’s “evolutionary bottleneck,” suggesting that 
much genetic diversity was lost. T oday, the ﬁ  lled-in cal-
dera mar  k  ing   T oba’s   cataclysm is 90 kilometers (55 miles) 
long and 50 kilometers (30 miles) wide, silent witness to the greatest threat to our existence ever to come from any source (Fig. 13.7).  
  The   Wisconsinan     Glaciation   eventually gave way to 
a full-scale   interglacial  , the current warm interlude that 
has been given its own designation, the   Holocene  . Global 
warming began about 18,000 years ago, and for the next 
6000 years, temperatures rose rapidly. Although the ice sheets were thinning and giant, mud-laden ﬂ  oods sped 
down the Mississippi Valley, building the river’s enormous delta, ice continued to cover most of northern North America as recently as 13,000 years ago.  
  T o our human ancestors in the northern hemisphere, 
who inhabited much of western and eastern Eurasia and 
may just have been entering the Americas (some schol-ars argue that American Indians were here much earlier), this warming must have been a welcome exp  e  rience. 
Slight temperature increases happened earlier, during the   Wisconsinan     Glaciation  , but were quickly fo  l  lowed by 
colder times. So persistent was this most recent warming that people ventured farther and farther   poleward  .  
  The Little Ice Age in the Modern Era  
  T o the farmers, winegrowers, and seafarers of the four-
teenth century, increasing cold, decreasing rainfall, frigid winds, and shortened growing seasons made for dwin-dling harvests, failing farms, and seas too stormy for ﬁ  sh-
ing. By the turn of the fourteenth century, alpine glaciers began to advance. Greenland’s small settlement had long since disappeared, and Iceland was abandoned as well. Weather extremes abounded, not only in the form of record cold snaps but also as sea  r  ing summer heat and 
raging storms.  
  Famines struck all over Europe, just at a time when 
more people were clustered in towns than ever before. 
The climatic record, pieced together from farmers’ dia-ries (winegrowers’ diaries are especially useful), tree ring research (  dendochronology  ), ice cores, contem-
porary writings, illustrative paintings, and surviving 
sketches and drawings, justify the designation of the post–1300 period as a shift in the direction of   reglaci-
ation  . We now know that this return to colder times, 
marked by advancing mountain glaciers and thickening 
  Subarctic   ice, would end in the mid-nineteenth cen-
tury and that even the worst of it, starting in the late 
1600s, did not lead to full-scale Pleistocene   glaciation  . 
Whatever   was happening precipitated s  e  rious social 
disruptions   in Europe and in other parts of the world 
as well, but of course those who experienced it were 
unaware of the long-term implications. Only when new methods of analysis became avai  l  able did scien-
tists realize what had happened—and then they gave 
the episode an inappropriate name. This temporary cooling was no ice age: it was a minor   glaciation   and not

the ﬁ  rst over the past 6000 years. But the name   Little 
Ice Age   certainly was more dramatic than “Minor 
  Glaciation  ,” and it stuck.  
  In his book   The Little Ice Age   (2000), archaeolo-
gist Brian Fagan described how the Franz Josef Glacier 
on New Zealand’s South Island “thrust   downslope   into 
the valley below, smashing into the great rainforests . . . 
felling giant trees like matchsticks.” In North America, our growing understanding of the Little Ice Age helps explain why the Jamestown colony collapsed so fast, a failure attributed by historians to ineptitude and lack of preparation. The chief cause may well have been environmental. Geographer David   Stahle   (1998) and 
his team, studying tree ring records that go back eight 
centuries, found that the Jamestown area experienced a seven-year drought between 1606 (the year before the c  o  lony’s founding) through 1612, the worst in nearly 
eight centuries. European colonists and American 
Indians were in the same situation, and their relations worsened as they were forced to compete for dwindling food and falling water tables. The high rate of starva-tion was not unique to the colonists. They, and their American Indian neighbors, faced the rigors of the Little Ice Age as well.  
  As the Little Ice Age continued into the 1800s, a 
large-scale volcano had a major impact on human soci-
ety. On April 5, 1815, the   T ambora   Volcano on the island 
of Sumatra in what was then the Dutch East Indies, 
located not   far east   of Bali, rumbled to life. Less than 
a week later it was pulverized in a series of explosions 
that could be heard a thousand miles away, killing all but 26 of the island’s population of 12,000. When it was over, the top 4000 feet of the volcano were gone, and much of what is now Indonesia was covered by debris. Darkness enveloped most of the colony for weeks, and tens of thousands died of famine in the months that fol-lowed. Colonial reports describe ﬁ  elds covered by poi-
sonous ash and powder, waters clogged by trees and cinders, and air rendered   unbreathable   by a fog of acid 
chemicals.  
  Since the 1850s, when the Little Ice Age waned 
and a slow but nearly continuous warming phase 
began, climatologists and other scientists have sought answers to crucial questions relating to climate change: what causes alternating cycles of global warming and cooling? Given the enormous quantities of pollution poured into the planet’s atmosphere as the Industrial Revolution gathered momentum, how large is the human contribution to the associated   greenhouse 
effect   (that results when greenhouse gases trap heat 
and raise temperatures)? This worldwide, interna-
tional effort to answer such questions involves the use of sophisticated computers and complicated models, and as discussed below, it has achieved an alarming consensus.  
  Take time to search the Internet and read about what has happened to   Phuket  , Thailand, since the Indian Ocean tsu-nami hit in December 2004. Look for before and after images of   Phuket  —how did it look before the tsunami hit and after? Research how   Phuket   has been rebuilt and determine why   Phuket   has been rebuilt the way it has.  
  HOW   HAVE   HUMANS ALTERED 
EARTH’S ENVIRONMENT?  
  Biologists estimate that as many as 25 million types 
of organisms inhabit Earth, perhaps even more. Most 
have not yet been identiﬁ  ed, classiﬁ  ed, or studied. No spe-
cies, not even the powerful dinosaurs, ever affected their environment as strongly as humans do today. An impact by comets probably made the dinosaurs and many other species extinct. Some   bi  o  geographers   suggest that the 
next great extinction may be caused not by asteroids but by humans, whose numbers and demands are destroying mi  l  lions of species.  
  The natural environment is being modiﬁ  ed and 
stressed by human activity in many obvious and some less 
o  b  vious ways. Some   environmental stress   is more obvi-
ous because it takes place around human habitats, such 
as cutting forests and emitting pollutants into the atmo-sphere. Less obvious environmental stress takes place away from dense concentrations of humans, including mou  n  tain top mining, burying toxic wastes that contam-
inate groundwater supplies, and dumping vast amounts 
of garbage into the oceans. Humans have built seawalls, terraced   hillslopes  , dammed ri  v  ers, cut canals, and modi-
ﬁ ed the environment in many constructive as well as 
destructive ways. All of these activities have an i  m  pact 
on environment and have given rise to a number of key 
concerns. Among these are the future of water supplies, the state of the atmosphere, climate change, desertiﬁ  ca-
tion, deforestation, soil degradation, and the disposal of i  n  dustrial wastes.  
  Water  
  Resources that are replenished even as they are being 
used are   renewable resources  , and resources that are 
present in ﬁ  nite quantities are   nonrenewable resources  . 
Water, essential to life, is a renewable resource. But the 
available supply of fresh water is not distributed evenly across the globe. Figure 1.11 shows the world distribution c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 443  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 443  9/19/11  2:00 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

of precipitation, with the largest totals recorded in equa-
torial and tropical areas of Southeast Asia, South Asia, central and coastal West Africa, and Mi  d  dle and South 
America. The volume of precipitation in the world as 
a whole is enormous; spread out evenly, it would cover the land area of the planet with about 83 centimeters (33 inches) of water each year. Much of that water is lost through runoff and evaporation, but enough of it seeps downward into porous, water-holding rocks called   aqui-
fers   to provide mi  l  lions of wells with steady ﬂ  ows. In the 
United States alone, it is estimated that there is   50 times 
as much water   stored in aquifers as there is precipitation 
falling on the land surface every year.  
  Despite such favorable data, the supply of water is 
anything but plentiful (Fig. 13.8). Chronic water short-
ages afﬂ  ict tens of millions of farmers in Africa and hun-
dreds of thousands of city dwellers in Southern California; water rationing has been imposed in rainy South Florida and in Spain, which faces the Mediterranean Sea.  
   In many areas of the world, people have congre-
gated in places where water supplies are insufﬁ  cient, 
undependable, or both. In California, people are some-
times not allowed to wash their cars or reﬁ  ll their swim-
ming pools; these are minor inconveniences compared to the fate faced by millions of Sudanese trying to escape their country’s civil war by ﬂ  eeing to parched pans of the Sahara. In Florida, where the urban population depends on the Biscayne Aquifer for most of its water, the long-term prospect is troubled: whe  n  ever seasonal rainfalls do 
not reach their projected averages, Floridians overuse the Biscayne Aquifer, and saltwater enters the aquifer from the nearby Atlantic Ocean. The invasion of saltwater over time can permanently destroy a fresh water aquifer.    Hundreds of millions of people still cluster along 
several of Earth’s great rivers. Indeed, nearly three-
quarters of all the fresh water used annually is consumed in farming, not in cities. In California, where about 80 per-cent of available water is used for irrigation, this has led to an intense debate: should cities be provided with ample water at the expense of Central Valley farms, and should fruits and vegetables be bought from elsewhere, even overseas, rather than be grown locally?  
  Industries use another 20 percent of the world’s 
water supply, contributing heavily to pollution when the 
used water is returned to streams, lakes, and aquifers. When communist rule ended in   eastern   Europe, tests 
indicated that the region’s rivers and groundw  a  ter were 
among the most severely polluted in the world because industries there had not been ad  e  quately regulated.  
  As human populations have expanded, people have 
increasingly settled in arid regions. One of the great 
ecological disasters of the twentieth century occurred in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, whose common boundary runs through the Aral Sea. Streams that fed this large body of water were diverted to irrigate the surrounding desert, mainly for commercial cotton production. Heavy use of chemical pesticide ruined the groundwater below, caus-ing a health crisis that some o  b  servers describe as an “eco-
logical Chernobyl” (referring to the 1986 nuclear reactor meltdown in the Ukraine). In the meantime the Aral Sea began to dry up, and by the mid-1990s it had lost more than three-quarters of its total surface area (Fig. 13.9).  
  School children are not typically taught to think 
about the geography of water—how varying precipita-
tion and human uses of water affect its availability and quantity. T extbooks teach that water is a constant whose   Field Note

In the vast, arid landscape, this narrow rib-bon of water seems little more than an artiﬁ  cial brook—but

distribution is sustained through the   hydrologic cycle  , 
where water from oceans, lakes, soil, rivers, and veg-
etation evaporates, condenses, and then precipitates on landmasses. The precipitation inﬁ  ltrates and recharges 
groundwater or runs off into lakes, rivers, and oceans (Fig. 13.10). Physical geographer J  a  mie Linton questions 
the utility of any model of the water cycle that does not 
take into account the role of humans and culture, su  g-
  gesting that by “representing water as a constant, cycli-
cal ﬂ ow, the hydrologic cycle establishes a norm that is at 
odds with the hydr  o  logical reality of much of the world” 
(Linton 2008, 639).  
  Linton argues that the hydrologic cycle does not 
take into account the norms of water in arid regions of the 
world, and it also assumes water cycles in a predictable, lin-ear fashion. The amount of water cycling through is not a co  n  stant. For instance,   landcover   changes how much 
water is in the cycle. In the global south, Linton, contends, 
forests “can actually promote   evapotranspiration   at rates 
much higher than for short crops,” which has “the overall 
effect of   reducing   the quantity of water available for runoff 
or groundwater recharge” (Linton 2008, 643).  
  Instead of the hydrologic cycle, Linton advocates 
thinking of water as a system rather than a cycle (Fig. 13.11). 
He deﬁ  nes the water system as the “integration of physi-
cal, biological, biogeochemical, and human components” of the global water sy  s  tem.  
  Water Security  
  Throughout the world, people have come to depend on 
water sources whose future capacity is uncertain. Rocky Mountain and Sierra Nevada snows feed the Colorado River and the aquifers that irrigate the California Central Valley. Aqueducts snake their way across the desert to urban communities. None of this has slowed the popu-lation’s move to the Sun Belt (see Chapter 12), and the water situation there is becoming problematic. In coastal eastern Spain, low water pressure in city pipes sometimes deprive the upper ﬂ  oors of high-rise buildings of water. 
In Southwest Asia and the Arabian Peninsula, grow-ing populations strain ancient water supply systems and desalinization plants are a necessity. Water plays a role in regional conﬂ  icts in places including the Darfur region 
of Sudan  .  
  When relations between countries and peoples are 
problematic, disputes over water can make them even 
worse. As populations grow and as demand for water rises, fears of future shortages intensify.  
  Water and Politics in the Middle East  
  Water supply is a particularly difﬁ  cult problem affecting 
relations among Israel and its neighbors. With 7.7 mil-lion people, Israel annually consumes nearly three times as much water as Jordan, the West Bank Palestinian areas, and Gaza combined (total population: over 7 mi  l  lion).   As 
much as half of Israel’s water comes from sources outside the Israeli state.  
  The key sources of water for the entire area are 
the Jordan River and an aquifer beneath the West Bank. 
When Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria and the West Bank from Jordan during the 1967 war, it gained control over both of these sources, including the Jordan KAZAKHSTAN KAZAKHSTAN KAZAKHSTAN

River’s important tributary, the   Yarmuk   (Fig. 13.12). As 
the map shows, the Sea of Galilee forms a large fresh water 
reservoir in the Jordan River Valley. This is the source of most of Israel’s water (desalinization facilities do not yet contribute signiﬁ  can  t  ly).  
  The water supply complicates the relationships 
between Israel and its Palestinian neighbors in the West 
Bank and Gaza. The aquifer beneath the West Bank yields about 625 million cubic meters of water through hundreds of wells linked together by a system of pipelines. Of this, some 450 million cubic meters go directly to Israel; another 35 million are consumed by Israeli settlers on the West Bank, and only some 140 million are allotted to the West Bank’s nearly 2 million Arabs.  
  This is unfair, say the Palestinian Arabs: if the West 
Bank is to become an independent Palestinian territory, the 
water below the surface should belong to the Palestinians. But the Israeli cities of T el Aviv and Jerusalem depend heav-ily on water from the West Bank, and Israel cannot survive without this source.    The water issue will complicate any hoped-for 
settlement of territorial disputes among Israel and its 
neighbors. Israel might contemplate the return of most of the Golan Heights to Syria, but about 30 percent of all water reaching the Sea of Galilee comes from the Golan Heights. Israel might support the establishment of an independent state in the West Bank, but approximately 30 percent of Israel’s water supply comes from the West Bank aquifer. Any effort to negotiate a lasting peace in the region will have to take these geographical circumstances into account.

land, sustaining crops and forests and replenishing soils 
and wells.  
  In 1883 the Indonesian volcano   Krakatau   erupted 
catastrophically, throwing 10 cubic kilometers (2.5 cubic 
miles) of rock and ash into the atmosphere. T otal dark-ness prevailed in the area for nearly three days; dust from the explosion e  n  circled Earth and created vividly col-
ored sunsets for years afterward. However, eventually the atmosphere cleared, and all traces of the eruption dis-a  p  peared. In 1980 the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 
the northwestern United States caused a similar, though much smaller, globe-encircling cloud of volcanic dust in the upper atmosphere. Again, the a  t  mosphere cleared that 
volcanic dust.  
  Scientists are concerned that human pollution of 
the atmosphere will result in longer lasting, possibly 
permanent, damage. T rue, the air disperses even the densest smoke and most acrid chemical gases. However, anthropogenic sources of pollution from two centuries of industrial expansion are pouring into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate. While the United States remains the world’s largest per capita leader in terms of pollutants generated, China has overtaken the United States in total volume, India’s share is ri  s  ing rapidly, and 
other growing economies are compounding a problem 
that can only be solved by determined international action. Such coordinated action has different economic implications for different cou  n  tries, making it difﬁ  cult 
to achieve.  GAZA

448 Chapter 13  The Humanized Environment
  Climate Change  
  Growing populations and increased human activity, rang-
ing from the burning of tropical forests to pollution of the atmosphere by industry and automobiles, are having an unprecedented impact on the atmosphere. The amounts of key “greenhouse” gases, carbon dioxide (CO  
2  ), methane, 
and nitrous oxides in the atmosphere have been increas-
ing at a rate of about 2 percent per decade; automobiles, steel mills, reﬁ  neries, and chemical plants account for a 
large part of this increase. A simple experiment in a college chemistry lab shows that an increase in the level of CO  
2   in 
the atmosphere traps more heat. Hence, it is not surprising 
that an overwhelming majority of climate scientists have concluded that   tropospheric   pollution from anthropogenic 
(human) sources is causing the Earth to retain increasing 
amounts of heat, with effects that will increase during the course of the twenty-ﬁ  rst ce  n  tury and beyond.  
  While estimates of the degree of human-induced 
  climate change   differ, climate records from recent decades 
show that global temperatures are rising, which is why 
climate change is sometimes called global warming. Climate change is a more accurate term, however, because while the global te  m  perature is rising, the outcome will 
vary greatly across regions of the world.  
  Sea-level rise is only one aspect of climate change. 
While the rise in global temperatures will undoubtedly 
be i  n  terrupted by occasional spurts of cooling, computer 
models predict that warmer temperatures will melt polar and gl  a  cial ice and that sea levels will rise as much as 50 
centimeters or more over the next 90 years. Certain calcu-lations project an even greater sea-level rise. Alarmed gov-ernment leaders whose nations inhabit low-lying Paciﬁ  c 
and Indian Ocean islands talk of buying higher ground in other countries and of suing the governments of polluting states over lost real estate.  
  Changes in climate involve changes in the amount of 
water vapor in the atmosphere, which affects patterns of 
precipitation. Changes in precipitation affect where cer-tain types of vegetation can grow, altering everything from agricultural patterns to the location of animal hab  i  tats.  
  While there is no doubt that sustained global warm-
ing would cause such changes, predicting exactly where, 
and in what magnitude, these changes will occur is dif-ﬁ cult. What is clear is that those living on the margins of 
sustainability are facing even riskier f  u  tures.  
  Extreme Weather Events  
  In recent years, climatologists have begun to focus on 
abrupt weather events: a process that appears to be cou-pled with “swings” in climate such as the Little Ice Age and the current phase of climate change. Research has already shown that the onset of the global warming that led to the retreat of the   Wisconsinan   glaciers from north-
ern latitudes, gigantic storms swept across central North America, picked up millions of tons of pulverized rock and deposited it in thick layers in what is today the U.S. Midwest. Climatologists believe that the warming after the   Wisconsinan     Glaciation   included extraordinary tem-
perature swings and extreme weather events.  
  Extreme weather events have also accompanied 
periods of global cooling. When the Little Ice Age cooled 
Europe in the 1300s, some chroniclers described snow-fall increasing so rapidly that glaciers ﬂ  owing from their 
Alpine valleys “like white lava’ onto neighboring plains as rivers raged and crops withered.  
  Atmospheric scientists are investigating the relation-
ship between current changes in the climate and extreme 
weather events. If you follow the news, you have read headlines from around the world about cold snaps that are the worst in the century, ﬂ  oods the highest in memory, 
and droughts the longest on record. Many of the computer models used to simulate these events show a link between warming global temperatures and changing regional weather systems.  
  Acid Rain  
  A by-product of the enormous volume of pollutants 
spewed into the atmosphere is   acid rain  . Acid rain forms 
when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are released into 
the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas). These pollutants combine with water vapor in the air to form dilute solutions of sulfuric and nitric acids, which then are washed out of the atmosphere by rain or other types of precipitation, such as fog and snow.  
  Although acid rain usually consists of relatively mild 
acids, it is caustic enough to harm certain natural ecosys-
tems (the mutual interactions between groups of plant and animal organisms and their environment). Already we know that acid rain has acidiﬁ  ed lakes and streams (with 
resultant ﬁ  sh kills), stunted growth of forests, and dam-aged crops in affected areas. In cities, acid rain has acceler-ated corrosion of buildings and monuments.  
  The geography of acid rain is most closely associated 
with patterns of industrial concentration and middle- to 
long-distance wind ﬂ  ows. The highest densities of coal 
and oil burning are associated with large concentrations of heavy man  u  facturing, such as those in Europe, the 
United States, and China. As industrialization expanded in these places during the second half of the twentieth century, many countries (i  n  cluding the United States in 
1970) enacted legislation establishing minimal clean-air standards.  
  In the United States and western Europe, compli-
ance with legislated emission reductions is having posi-
tive results. In Canada as well as in Scandinavia, where acid rain from neighboring industrial regions damaged forests and acidiﬁ  ed lakes, recovery came faster than most scientists had predicted. This evidence is now c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 448  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 448  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

encouraging other countries to impose stricter controls 
over factory emissions.  
  The Land  
  Over the centuries, human population growth has put 
increasing pressure on land surfaces. More land is cleared and placed under cultivation, trees are cut down, and cities expand. The effects can be seen   almosteverywhere   and are 
so extensive that it is often difﬁ  cult even to reconstruct what 
an area might be like in the absence of humans. The human impact on Earth’s land surface has several key aspects, the most signiﬁ  cant of which are defor  e  station, soil erosion, 
waste disposal (discussed here) and biodiversity loss.    Field Note  
  “This was one of the most depressing days of this long South 
American ﬁ  eld trip. We had been briefed and had seen the 
satellite pictures of the destruction of the rainforest, with ugly gashes of bare ground pointing like rows of arrows into the woods. But walking to the temporary end points of some of these new roads made a lot more impact. From the remaining forest around came the calls of monkeys and other wildlife, their habitat retreating under the human onslaught. Next week this road would push ahead another mile, the logs carted away and burned, the ﬁ  rst steps in a process that would clear this land, ending billions of years of nature’s dominance.”

  Deforestation  
  Forests cover 31 percent of the total surface of the Earth 
from the tropical Amazon Basin to high-latitude North America and Eurasia. The world’s forests, especially those of lower and middle latitudes, play a critical role in what   biogeographers   call the   oxygen cycle  . Atmospheric oxy-
gen is consumed by natural processes as well as by human 
activities. Forests counteract this loss through photosyn-thesis and related processes, which release oxygen into the atmosphere. The d  e  struction of vast tracts of forest 
is called   deforestation  . Ecologists and others warn of 
unforeseeable and i  n  calculable effects not only for the 
affected areas but for the planet as a whole.  
  In the early 1980s, the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations undertook 
a study of the rate at which forests were being depleted. This analysis showed that 44 percent of the tropical rain-forest had already been affected by cutting and that more than 1 percent was being logged every year (Fig. 13.13).  
  In 2010, the FAO released a report on the world’s 
forests with good news: the rate of deforestation world-
wide d  e  clined in the last decade. According to the FAO, 
during the 1990s, humans deforested 16 million hectares a year, mostly by converting tropical rainforests to agri-culture land. Between 2000 and 2010, humans deforested 13 million hectares a year. Lower deforestation rates have been coupled with tree planting programs, especially in Brazil and Indonesia. As a result, the “net loss of forests was 5.2 million hectares per year between 2000 and 2010, down from 8.3 million hectares annually in the 1990s.”  
  Deforestation is not a singular process: it has been 
going on for centuries, and the motivations for deforesta-
tion vary vastly. Forests are cut and reforested for wood and paper products; forests are preserved for the main-tenance of biod  i  versity; and other forests are cleared for 
new agricultural production.  
  The reforestation (and harvesting) of deforested 
areas is not the whole answer to the problem, even if it 
could be done on a large scale. Forests in the United States, for example, consist mainly of second-growth trees, which replaced the original forest after it was logged. Ho  w  ever, 
the controlled second-growth forest does not (as the natu-ral forest did) have many trees dying of old age after their trunks and limbs become soft from rot. As a result, many animal species that depend on holes in trunks and hollows in tree limbs cannot ﬁ  nd places to nest (thus, the spotted 
owl dispute in the Paciﬁ  c Northwest of the United States). 
For them the forest has ceased to be a f  a  vorable habitat.  
  Soil Erosion  
  The loss of potentially productive soil to erosion has 
been described as a “quiet crisis” of global proportions. Ecologists Lester Brown and Edward Wolf point out that the increasing rate of this loss over the past generation c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 449  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 449  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

is not the result of a decline in the skills of farmers but 
rather of the pressures on farmers to produce more. In an integrated world food econ  o  my, the pressures on land 
resources are not conﬁ  ned to particular countries; they 
permeate the entire world.  
  Why has   soil erosion   increased so much? Part of 
the answer lies in population pressure: world population 
is over 7 billion. Associated with population growth is the cultivation of ever-steeper slopes, with hastily constructed te  r  races or without any terraces at all (Fig. 13.14). As the 
pressure on land increases, farmers are less able to leave part of their soil fallow (unused) to allow it to recover its nutrients. Shifting cultivators (see Chapter 11) must shorten their ﬁ  eld rotation cycle, and as a result their soil, too, is less able to recover. Altogether 99.7 percent of all human food is grown in soil (some is grown in water), and annual soil erosion shrinks the cropland available for agri-culture. A 2006 study reported that globally about 37,000 square miles (10 million hectares) of cropland are lost to soil erosion each year.  
  Soil erosion is caused by a variety of factors: live-
stock are allowed to graze in areas where they destroy 
the natural vegetation; lands too dry to sustain farming are plowed, and wind erosion follows. Soil is a renew-able resource because with proper care it can recover. However, it is being “mined” as if it were a nonrenewable resource. International cooperation in food distribution, education of farmers and governments, and worldwide dissemination of soil conservation methods are urgently needed to solve this “quiet crisis.”    Waste Disposal  
  If anything has grown faster than population itself, it is 
the waste generated by households, communities, and industries—much of it a matter of bulk, some of it a source of danger.  
  The United States, the world’s largest consumer 
of resources, is also the largest producer of   solid waste  , 
debris, and garbage discarded by those living in cities, 
industries, mines, and farms. According to current esti-mates, the United States produces about 2 kilograms (4.5 pounds) of solid waste per person per day, which adds 
up to more than 226 million m  e  tric tons (250 million tons) 
per year. But the United States is not alone. Other high-technology economies with a high ratio of disposable materials (containers, packaging) face the same problems.  
  Disposal of these wastes is a major worldwide prob-
lem. The growing volume of waste must be put some-
where, but space for it is no longer easy to ﬁ  nd. In poorer countries waste is often thrown onto open dumps where vermin multiply, decomposition sends methane gas into the air, rain and waste liquids carry contaminants into the groundwater below, and ﬁ  res pollute the surround-ing atmo  s  phere. In countries that can afford it, such open 
dumps have been replaced by   sanitary landﬁ  lls  . The 
waste is put in a hole that has been dug and prepared for 
the purpose, including a ﬂ  oor of materials to treat seeping liquids and soil to cover each load as it is co  m  pacted and 
deposited in the ﬁ  ll.  
  The number of suitable sites for sanitary landﬁ  lls 
is decreasing, however, and it is increasingly difﬁ  cult to    Figure 13.14

design new sites. In the United States landﬁ  ll capacity has 
been reached or will soon be reached in about a dozen 
States, most of them in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, and those States must now buy space from other States for this purpose. T rucking or sending garbage by rail to distant landﬁ  lls is very expensive, but there are few alternatives.  
  Similar problems arise on a global scale. The 
United States, the European Union, and Japan export 
solid (including hazardous) wastes to countries in Africa, Middle and South America, and East Asia. While these countries are paid for accepting the waste, they do not always have the capacity to treat it properly. So the waste often is dumped in open lan  d  ﬁ lls, where it creates the very 
hazards that the exporters want to avoid. In the late 1980s, the wealthier countries’ practice of “managing” waste by exporting it became a controversial issue, and in 1989 a treaty was drawn up to control it. The treaty did not (as many poorer countries wished) prohibit the exporting of hazardous waste, although it did place some restri  c  tions 
on trade in hazardous materials.  
  It is useful to differentiate between   toxic wastes  , in 
which the danger is caused by chemicals, infectious mate-
rials, and the like, and   radioactive wastes  , which are of 
two types: low-level radioactive wastes, which give off 
small amounts of radiation and are produced by industry, hospitals, research facilities, and nuclear power plants; and high-level radioactive wastes, which emit strong radi  a  tion and are produced by nuclear power plants and 
nuclear weapons factories. In the United States, low-level radioactive wastes have for many years been disposed of in steel drums placed in six special government-run landﬁ  lls, 
three of which are now closed.  
  High-level radioactive waste is extremely dangerous 
and difﬁ  cult to get rid of. Fuel rods from nuclear reactors 
will remain radioactive for thousands of years and must be stored in remote places where they will not contaminate water, air, or any other part of the environment. In fact, no satisfactory means or place for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste has been found. Among many suggested disposal sites are deep shafts in the bedrock, chambers dug in salt deposits (salt effectively blocks radiation), ice cham-bers in Antarctica, sediments beneath the ocean ﬂ  oor, and 
volcanically active   midocean   trenches. Meanwhile, spent 
fuel rods (which last only about three years in the reactor) are put in specially d  e  signed drums and stored in one of 
about 100 sites, all of them potentially dangerous.  
  There is a related problem: transportation of waste. 
Even if secure and safe storage can be found for high-level 
r  a  dioactive waste, the waste has to be transported from its 
source to the disposal site. Such transportation presents an a  d  ditional hazard; a truck or train accident could have 
disastrous consequences.  
  The dimensions of the waste-disposal problem are 
growing and globalizing. The threat to the planet’s envi-ronment is not just over the short term but can exist for 
centuries, indeed millennia.  
  Biodiversity  
  A signiﬁ  cant change that is related to all of the develop-
ments discussed so far is the accelerating loss of   biodiver-
sity  . An abbreviation of “biological diversity,” biodiver-
s  i  ty refers to the diversity of all aspects of life found on the 
Earth. Although the term is commonly used when refer-
ring to the diversity of species, it encompasses the entire range of biological divers  i  ty, from the genetic variability 
within individuals of a species to the diversity of ecosys-tems on the planet.  
  How many species are there? Estimates range from 
10 million to 100 million, and no one is quite sure how 
many. So far only some 1.75 million species have been identiﬁ  ed, and new species, particularly new species of 
insects, are being discovered regularly. Y et species are also becoming extinct at a rapid rate. It is difﬁ  cult to say 
exactly how quickly extin  c  tions are occurring, since we 
do not know how many species there are. What is clear, however, is that although extinction is a natural process, humans have dramatically increased rates of extinction, particularly over the last few hundred years. Estimates from the United Nations Environment Pr  o  gram’s Global 
Biodiversity Assessment indicate that 8 percent of plants, 5 percent of ﬁ  sh, 11 percent of birds, and 18 percent of the world’s mammal species are currently threatened.  
  Where is biodiversity most threatened? Whether a 
species is threatened with extinction depends on the range 
of the species, its scarcity, and its geographic concentra-tion. If a species with a small range, a high degree of scar-city, and a small geographic concentration has its habitat threatened, extinction can follow. Because most species have small ranges, change in a small area can affect a sp  e-
  cies. A 2005 report in   Scientiﬁ  c American   explained that 
“Clearing a forest, draining a wetland, damming a river 
or dynamiting a coral reef to kill its ﬁ  sh can more readily eliminate species with small ranges than more widespread species.”  
  Human impacts on biodiversity have increased over 
time. The domestication of animals, followed by the agri-
cultural domestication of plant life, caused signiﬁ  cant 
changes in our relationship with other species. Large ver-tebrates have a  l  ways been particularly hard hit by human 
activities. Many birds and mammals have been hunted not only for food but also for their skins, feathers, and so forth. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, beaver populations in North Amer  i  ca were drastically 
reduced as the beavers were trapped and skinned for their pelts. Many bird species were hunted for their feathers, which were sold to decorate fashionable hats. Worldwide, elephants and walruses continue to be hunted for their c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 451  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 451  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

ivory tusks. From historical records we know that over 
650 species of plants and over 480 animal species have become extinct in just the last 400 years. These represent only the documented extinctions. The actual number of extinctions that o  c  curred during this period is almost cer-
tainly much higher.  
  Humans have also indirectly contributed to extinc-
tions. Human travel, for instance, introduced new spe-
cies to areas around the globe—rats are among the more destructive of these; they have had devastating effects on oceanic islands. Introduced species may cause extinctions by preying upon native species or competing with them for resources. A fa  m  ous example is the dodo bird (  Raphus   
  cuculatus  ), which was hunted to extinction by humans, 
dogs, and rats on the island of Mauritius. Introduced spe-
cies may also carry new diseases, leading to the decimation and extinction of local populations. Species on islands are particularly susceptible to extinction because of the more insular ecosystems found on is  l  ands. An estimated 2000 
species of birds on tropical Paciﬁ  c Islands became extinct following human settlement.  
  Identifying the nature and extent of environmen-
tal changes is only a ﬁ  rst step toward understanding the 
extent of human alteration of the planet. A second, and 
more complicated step is to consider the forces driving these changes.  
  What is the greatest environmental concern facing the region where you live, and in what other regions of the world is that concern also present? How do differences between your region and the other regions sharing the concern inﬂ  u-
ence how it is understood and approached?  
  WHAT ARE THE MAJOR FACTORS 
CONTRIBUTING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE TODAY?  
  Environmental change occurs at all levels of scale, 
from local to global. For example, deforestation has local 
effects by reducing the diversity of species even in a small area. It has regional consequences by increasing sediment runoff into streams and rivers. And, globally, it results in the increased release of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which affects planetary climates.  
  Several interrelated factors inﬂ  uence the escalating 
impact of human activities on the natural environment. 
The past two centuries have witnessed dramatic growth in the human population, a fourfold increase (from about 1.5 billion to 6 billion) in the twentieth century alone. Per capita consumption of virtually everything, from water and farm products to metals and energy resources, has i  n  creased rapidly as well. Fast-developing technologies 
allow us to alter the natural environment ever more. Each of these factors can be studied at all scales from global to local.  
  Global environmental changes express themselves at 
all scales, from local to global. For example, deforestation 
can have a local effect by reducing the diversity of spe-cies in a particular area. It can have regional impacts by increasing s  e  diment runoff into rivers. Finally, at a global 
scale, deforestation is associated with the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and may affect global climate by altering processes that occur at the land surface. T o fully understand d  e  forestation, we must keep all of these 
scales in mind.  
  Several interrelated factors are responsible for the 
expanding impact of humans on the environment over 
the past two centuries. One of these factors is the dra-matic growth of the human population. Even consider-ing the minimal needs for human survival, there can be little doubt that the fourfold increase in the human popu-lation in the twentieth century had signiﬁ  cant environ-
mental impacts. Another factor is consumption, which has increased dramatically in the modern world. Y et another is technology, which has both expanded the human capac-ity to alter the environment and brought with it i  n  creas-
ing energy demands. Each of these interrelated factors that contribute to environmental change can be studied broadly, focusing on the general impacts of each factor on the global enviro  n  ment. Y et, when we shift scales to the 
local and regional, and we consider the context of human actions at these scales, we often ﬁ  nd that the causes of 
environme  n  tal change vary depending on the local and 
regional context.  
  Political Ecology  
  Leslie Gray and William Moseley describe the ﬁ  eld of 
political ecology, beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, as a 
way of cons  i  dering the roles of “political economy, power 
and history in shaping human-environmental interac-tions.” Political ecologists use scale to consider how attempts to affect environmental change, such as defores-tation, differ depending on the level of spatial detail used to examine the issue.  
  At the local scale, Moseley has studied the conserva-
tion behaviors of farmers in southern Mali (Fig 13.15). He 
found that one view that is widely held at the global scale—that poorer people degrade the land more than wealthier people—was not true at the local scale. Through exten-sive ﬁ  eldwork, interviews, and soil surveying, Moseley c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 452  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 452  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles
found that poorer farmers in southern Mali were more 
likely to use organic materials to preserve topsoil and that wealthier farmers were more likely to use inorganic fert  i  l-
izers and pesticides. Aside from being able to afford inor-ganic fertilizers, wealthier farmers did so in order to pro-duce cotton more easily. Policies and power relationships at the local, national, and global scales help explain why wealthier farmers in southern Mali produce cotton. For example, the government of Mali’s agricu  l  tural extension 
service singled out the wealthiest households for cotton farming, which “helped these households become even wealthier in the short term.”  
  Population  
  Because humans across the world do not consume or pol-
lute in exactly the same ways, we cannot make a simple chart showing that each additional human born on Earth results in a certain amount of consumption or  pollution. 
We can, howe  v  er, recognize that humans affect the envi-ronment and that a greater number of people on Earth 
translates into a greater capacity for environmental change.  
  Similarly, environmental change inﬂ  uences humans 
differently, depending in part on who they are and 
where they live. T o underscore the spatial differences in environmental impact on humans, we can consider two maps of natural disaster hot spots published by the Earth Institute at Columbia University and the World Bank in a 2005 report. The maps highlight the places in the world most susceptible to natural disasters, whether caused by drought, tectonic activity (earth-quakes and volcanoes), or hydrological h  a  zards (ﬂ  oods, 
cyclones, and landslides) (Fig. 13.16). Comparing the 
map of mortality risk with the map of total economic loss risk demonstrates that when a natural disaster hits a wealthier area, the place will more likely be hit ﬁ  nan-
cially, whereas, in a poorer area of the world, the place will likely be hit by both ﬁ  na  n  cial loss and the loss of 
lives. This relationship was certainly borne out when

  In this photo, a young man brings home the cotton harvest in the vil-
lage of Try in southern Mali. Prior to my graduate studies in geography, I spent a number of years as an international development worker con-cerned with tropical agriculture—both on the ground in Africa and as a policy wonk in Washington, D.C. I drew at least two important lessons from these experiences. First, well-intentioned work at the grassroots level would always be limited if it were not supported by broader scale policies and economics. Second, the people making the policies were often out of touch with the real i  m  pacts their decisions were having in the ﬁ  eld. As such, geography, and the subﬁ  eld of political ecology, were appealing to me because of its explicit attention to processes operat-ing at multiple scales, its tradition of ﬁ  eldwork, and its longstan  d  ing 
attention to human–environment interactions. I employed a political ecology approach during ﬁ  eldwork for my dissert  a  tion in 1999–2000. Here, I sought to test the notion that poor farmers are more likely to degrade soils than their wealthier counterparts (a concept widely pro-claimed in the development policy literature of the 1990s). Not only did I interview rich and poor farmers about their management prac-tices, but I tested their soils and questioned policymakers at the provin-cial, national, and international levels. My ﬁ  ndings (and those of others) have led to a questioning of the poverty–environmental degradation paradigm.

States in 2005. The coast endured the loss of XX lives 
and $XX in damages.   
  Patterns of Consumption  
  We humans rely on Earth’s resources for our very sur-
vival. At the most basic level, we consume water, oxygen, and o  r  ganic and mineral materials. Over time we have 
  developed increasingly complex ways of using resources 
in pursuit of agricultural intensiﬁ  cation and industrial 
production. Consequently, many societies now consume resources at a level and rate that far exceed basic subsi  s-
  tence needs. In a 1996 article on “Humanity’s Resources” 
in   The Companion Encyclopedia of Geography:     The 
Environment and Humankind  , I. G. Simmons notes that 
a hunter-gatherer could subsist on the resources found 
within an area of about 26 square kilometers, whereas today many people living in urban centers in the global economic core have access to r  e  sources from all over the 
planet.  
  Generally, the smaller numbers of people in the parts 
of the world belonging to the global economic core make 
far greater demands on Earth’s resources than do the much larger numbers in the poorer countries. It has been estimated that a baby born in the United States during the ﬁ rst decade of the twenty-ﬁ  rst century, at current rates, 
consumes about 250 times as much energy over a lifetime as a baby born in Bangladesh over the same lifetime. In terms of food, housing, and its comp  o  nents, metals, paper 
(and thus trees), and many other materials, the consump-tion of individuals in afﬂ  uent countries far exceeds that 
of people in poorer countries. Thus, rapid population growth in the periphery tends to have local or regional environmental impacts. Population growth in the core is also a ma  t  ter of concern, one whose impact is not just local 
or regional but global.  
  The foregoing discussion underscores the importance 
of thinking geographically about human impacts on the 
natural world. People living in the global economic periph-ery tend to affect their immediate environment, putting pressure on soil, natural vegetation, and water supplies, and polluting the local air with the smoke from their ﬁ  res. The 
reach of afﬂ  uent societies is much greater. The demand for low-cost meat for hamburgers in the United States has led to deforestation in Central and South America to make way for pastures and cattle herds. In the process, water demand has increased in such areas (T able 13.1). This example shows just one of the many ways in which the American (and European, Japanese, and Australian) consumer has an impact on distant env  i  ronments.  
  Globally, consumption is tied to technology, for (as 
we saw in Chapter 12) the industrialized core has access to 
a vast array of transportation and communication technol-ogies that allow advertisers to stimulate demand for par-ticular goods around the world and allow manufacturers to bring goods from distant places. The growth of wealth over the last ten years in the semi-periphery, including India and China, and their growing middle and upper classes, has i  n  creased the global consumption of con-
sumer goods. For example, in 2008 the Indian company   T ata   (which we talked about at the beginning of Chapter 
4) created the   Nano  , an automobile for the Indian market 
that is priced below $2500.   T ata   plans to produce 250,000 
  Nano   cars a year.  
  T echnological developments have expanded the pro-
duction of consumer goods. Those same developments have 
allowed humans to manipulate atmospheric, land, oceanic, and biological systems in profound ways. Understanding the complex ties between technology and environmental change requires consideration of several different facets of the tec  h  nology picture.  
  Industrial Technology  
  T echnological advances have increased rapidly since the 
Industrial Revolution and today affect all aspects of our lives. We are continually developing technologies that we hope will improve our standard of living, protect us against disease, and allow us to work more efﬁ  ciently. 
These technologies come with a cost. Resource extrac-tion practices such as mining and logging, which pr  o  vide 
the materials to produce technologies, have created severe environmental problems. T echnological innovations have produced hazardous and toxic by-products, creating pol-lution and health problems that we are only now begin-ning to recognize. Most signiﬁ  cant for our discussion of 
global environmental change, however, is the fact that tec  h  nology has enabled humans to alter large portions of 
the planet in a short period of time.  
  There are many dramatic examples of the role of 
industrial technology in environmental change. The 
impacts include degradation of the oceans (oil and gas exploitation and spills, pollution dumping, and massive   overﬁ  shing  ), land surfaces (open pit and mountain top   TABLE 13.1

mining, dams, and irrigation projects), the biosphere 
(deforestation, vegetation loss), and the atmosphere (air po  l  lution).  
  Transportation  
  Changing modes of transportation are a product of some 
of the most important technological advances in human history. Each innovation in transportation has required increased resource use, not only to make the vehicles that move people and goods, but also to build and maintain the related infrastructure—roads, railroad tracks, airports, parking structures, repair facilities, and the like. With each innovation the impacts seem to widen. As David   Headrick   points out in a study discussed in the   Companion 
Encyclopedia of Geography  , Chicago’s O’Hare Airport cov-
ers a larger area (approximately 28 square kilometers or 
17 square miles) than Chicago’s central business district (which covers approximately 8 square kilometers or 5 square miles). Moreover, transportation innovations offer access to remote areas of the planet. There are vehicles that allow people to travel through extreme climates, to the bottoms of the ocean, and across the polar ice caps. These places, in turn, have been altered by human activity.  
  T ransportation is also implicated in global environ-
mental change—albeit sometimes indirectly. Advances 
in transpo  r  tation have produced signiﬁ  cant pollution, as 
seen in the extent of oil spills along major shipping lanes (Fig. 13.17).    T ransportation facilitates the types of global net-
works necessary to sustain the patterns of consump-
tion outlined ea  r  lier. Many of the products available in 
stores—be they electronics or clothing or food—come from distant places. R  e  sources are required to produce 
and ship them, and except those that meet basic subsis-tence needs, they all contribute to the greater strains placed on the environment that come from those living in wealthier parts of the world. This realization has led some individuals to reduce their levels of consumption or to consume more environmentally friendly, locally produced products. These changes have had some effect, but so far their impact on the geography of global consumption has been marginal.

  Consumption of material goods is closely linked to con-
sumption of energy. It takes energy to produce mate-rial goods, energy to deliver them to markets, and, for many products (such as appliances and automobiles), energy to keep them running. The resulting d  e  mands 
for energy are a factor in environmental change. Much 
of our energy supply comes from nonrenewable fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Moreover, the evolution of tertiary, quaternary, and   quinary   economic 
activities has led to an increase in the consumption of 
nonrenewable resources. As populations grow, so does the d  e  mand for energy, and we can expect that over the ATLANTIC

 What Are the Major Factors Contributing to Environmental Change Today?  457
coming decades energy production will expand to meet 
the increased demand. In developing countries in par-ticular, demands for more energy are met by i  n  creasing 
the development of fossil fuel sources. This helps explain 
why, according to the United States Energy Information Administration, global oil produ  c  tion increased from 
45.89 million barrels per day in 1970 to 85.86 million 
barrels per day in 2010.  
  Oil is a ﬁ  nite resource. It is not a question of   if   the 
world’s oil supply will run out but   when  . Because discov-
eries of new reserves continue to be made, and because 
the extraction of fossil fuels is becoming ever more efﬁ  -
cient, it is difﬁ  cult to predict exactly how much longer oil will remain a viable energy source. Many suggest that the current level of oil co  n  sumption can be sustained for up 
to 100 years, although some argue for much shorter or much longer time frames. D  e  spite the range of opinion, 
the majority of scientists believe that by the middle of this century alternative sources will have to play a much more signiﬁ  cant role than they do now.  
  When one considers that oil could become an 
increasingly scarce commodity within the lifetimes of 
many college students today, the importance of develop-ing alternative energy sources becomes apparent. Adding further urgency to the quest are the pollution problems associated with burning fossil fuels and the geopolitical tensions that arise from global dependence on a resource co  n  centrated in select parts of the world. Moving away 
from a dependence on oil carries with it some clear posi-
tives, but it could lead to wrenching socioeconomic adjust-ments as well.  
  The effects of a shift away from oil will certainly 
be felt to some degree in the industrial and postin-
dustrial countries, where considerable retooling of the economic infrastructure will be necessary. It is the  oil-producing countries, however, that will face the 
grea  t  est adjustments. More than half of the world’s 
oil supply is found in the Middle Eastern countries of 
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Iran. In each of these countries, the extrac-tion and e  x  portation of oil account for at least 75 percent 
of total revenue and 90 percent of export-generated 
income. What will ha  p  pen to these countries when 
their oil reserves run dry?  
  Consider the case of Kuwait—a country in which the 
incomes of 80 percent of the wage earners are tied to oil. 
Kuwait’s citizens are currently guaranteed housing, educa-tion, and health care, and each adult couple receives a one-time stipend when a child is born. All of these programs are provided tax free, and when workers retire, their pensions are close to the salaries they earned as active members of the workforce.  
  Concerns over the long-term implications of a 
decline in oil revenue in Kuwait have led to efforts 
to ﬁ  nd an alternative source of wealth: potable water. In a part of the world that can go for months without rain, water is a most precious r  e  source. Some people in 
Kuwait joke that for each million dollars spent in the 
quest for sources of fresh water, all that is found is a bil-lion dollars worth of oil! But where fresh water cannot be found, it can potentially be made, and Kuwait has begun to position itself to become one of the world’s leaders in the ﬁ  eld of desalinization, the conversion of saltwater to fresh water. This is currently a very expensive pro-cess, but Kuwait is able to devote some of its oil reve-nues to research and development on the desalinization process. Absent a major technological breakthrough, in the short term income generated by desalinization will amount to only a tiny fraction of the income provided by oil production. The long term may be a different story, however. If not, Kuwait—and other countries in its position—will be facing a socioeconomic adjus  t  ment 
of enormous proportions.  
  Alternative Energy  
  T echnology has played a key role in amplifying human-
induced environmental change. At the same time, tech-nologies are being developed to identify and solve envi-ronmental problems. Some of these technologies offer alternative approaches to local energy production. In recent decades, a number of countries have established implementation programs that encourage both the devel-opment of “clean” renewable energy technol  o  gies and 
increased energy efﬁ  ciency in buildings, transportation, 
and manufacturing. Y et even alternative energy sources have environmental effects. At the core of the wind tur-bines that generate “clean” energy are rare earth miner-als, the extraction and processing of which have negative environmental consequences.  
  A single wind turbine (Fig. 13.18) that is made of 
ﬁ berglass, weighs hundreds of metric tons, and stands 90 
meters high “fundamentally relies on roughly 300 kilo-
grams of soft, silvery metal known as neodymium—a so called rare earth” (  Biello   2010, 16). Neodymium is used 
for the powerful magnets in a wind turbine that generate electricity. It is one of 17 elements on the perio  d  ic table 
that are considered rare earth elements.  
    Rare earth elements   are in demand because they 
are used not only in wind turbines but also in alterna-
tive energy cars, computers, screens, compact ﬂ  uo-
rescent light bulbs, cell phones, MRI machines, and advanced weapons systems (  Biello   2010). Rare earth 
elements are found in rock, and 97 percent of rare earth 
elements mined today come from China. The mining is only the ﬁ  rst step because making rare earth elements usable requires separating el  e  ments that are bound 
together in the rock. Hence, once the rocks are mined, 
Chinese companies intensively boil the elements in acid, repeating the process “thousands of times because the c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 457  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 457  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

the   nedymium   from other rare earth elements (  Bie  l  lo   
2010, 17).  
  The chemical processing of rare earth elements uses 
electricity and water and leaves behind chemicals and 
residuals, including thorium (a radioactive metal) and salt. The environmental consequences of rare earth element mining have historically been costly enough that produc-tion stopped at Mountain Pass Mine in California in 2002, in part because of the cost of complying with enviro  n  men-
tal laws in the United States.  
  A combination of looser environmental laws and 
labor costs led to increased production of rare earth ele-
ments in China during the last decade (Fig. 13.19). In Inner Mongolia, China, the extraction of rare earth ele-ments at the   Bayan  -Obo mine alone accounts for 40 per-
cent of the world’s supply. China closed off access to the mine to all outsiders, but the mine’s enormous pits and waste ponds can still be viewed from space and even seen using Google Earth (Fig. 13.20).  
  Because rare earth elements can be used in weap-
ons systems, the United States military blocked the 
sale of Mountain Pass Mine to a Chinese company as a matter of national security. Instead,   Molycorp   bought 
Mountain Pass Mine and has begun extracting rare 
earth elements again. Environmental regulations pre-vent some of the steps in the processing of rare earths from taking place in California. China will likely remain the leading producer of rare earth elements. However, recycling rare earth elements from discarded devices and new mining efforts in the United States, Australia, and Vietnam will likely improve the availability of rare earth elements from sources ou  t  side of China in years 
to come.

 What Policies Are Being Adopted in Response to Environmental Change? 459
  Go back to the last Thinking Geographically question—what 
is the greatest environmental concern facing the region where you live? Now, add to your answer by concentrating on how people in the community (leaders, students, locals, businesses) discuss this environmental concern. Read newspaper accounts of the debate over this environmental concern. Are the actors in this debate thinking and operating at different scales?  
  WHAT POLICIES ARE BEING ADOPTED 
IN   RESPONSE   TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE?  
  The extent and rapidity of recent environmental 
changes have led to the adoption of numerous policies 
aimed at protecting the environment or reversing the negative i  m  pacts of pollution. These policies range from 
local ordinances that restrict urban development in envi-ronmentally sensitive areas to global a  c  cords on topics 
such as biodiversity and climate change.  
  A major challenge in confronting environmental 
problems is that many of those problems do not lie within

political boundaries, and people sometimes move across 
those boundaries in response to environmental pressures. Designing policy responses is thus complicated by the fact that the political map does not reﬂ  ect the geogra-
phy of env  i  ronmental issues. The problem is particularly 
acute when environmental problems cross international boundaries, for there are few international policymak-ing bodies with signiﬁ  cant authority over multin  a  tional 
environmental spaces. Moreover, those that do exist—the European Union, for example—often have limited authority and must heed the concerns of member states. Those concerns, in turn, may not coincide with the inter-ests of the environment. Within democracies, politicians with an eye to the next election may h  e  sitate to tackle 
long-term problems that require short-term sacriﬁ  ces. 
Most authoritarian regimes have an even worse record, as can be seen in the policies of the Soviet-dominated gov-ernments of eastern Europe during the communist era. Moreover, governmental lea  d  ers in poorer countries ﬁ  nd 
it very difﬁ  cult to take action when, as is often the case, 
action requires reductions in already marginal standards of living and even greater difﬁ  culties in meeting the kinds of debt payments discussed in Chapter 10.  
  Despite these obstacles, the growing extent and 
urgency of global environmental changes have led to a 
number of international agreements to address some severe problems. Some of these have been spearheaded by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that operate outside of the formal political arena. They tend to focus on speciﬁ  c issues and problems, often in particular pla  c  es. 
With the 1972   United Nations Conference on the     Human 
Environment   in Stockholm, international governmental 
organizations began playing a major role in environmen-
tal policy.  
  The framework that currently guides international 
governmental activity in the environmental arena evolved 
from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. The del  e  gates to UNCED gave the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF)—a joint project of the United 
Nations and the World Bank—signiﬁ  cant authority over 
environmental action on a global scale. The GEF funds projects related to six issues: loss of biodiversity, climate change, protection of inte  r  national waters, depletion of 
the ozone layer, land degradation, and persistent organic 
pollutants. The delegates to UNCED believed that sig-niﬁ cant progress could be made through these funded 
projects, along with bilateral (that is, government-to-government) aid. They also made it easier for NGOs to participate in international environmental policymaking.  
  These actions hold the promise of a more coherent 
approach to environmental problem solving than is pos-
sible when decisions are made on a state-by-state basis. Y et individual states continue to inﬂ  uence decision making c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 459  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 459  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

in all sorts of ways. T ake the case of the GEF . Between 
1991 and 2010, the GEF provided $4.5 billion in grants, primarily to projects involving climate change or biodi-versity. Even though the GEF is charged with protecting key elements of the global environment, it still functions in a state-based world, as suggested by Fi  g  ure 13.21—a 
map from a 1994 World Bank technical report on the forest sector in   Subsaharan   Africa that divides the realm 
into “major regions” that follow state, rather than ecologi-
cal borders. Moreover, the GEF nonetheless serves the important role of providing ﬁ  nancial resources to four 
major international conventions on the environment: the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations Framework Convention on Cl  i  mate Change, the United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertiﬁ  cation, and the 
Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Poll  u  tants.  
  A few global environmental issues are so press-
ing that efforts are being made to draw up guidelines for 
action in the form of international conventions or treaties. The most prominent examples are in the areas of biologi-cal diversity, prote  c  tion of the ozone layer, and global 
climate change.    Biological Diversity  
  International concern over the loss of species led to calls 
for a global convention (agreement) as early as 1981. By the beginning of the 1990s, a group working under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Program reached agreement on the wording of the convention, and it was submitted to UNCED for approval. It went into effect in late 1993; as of 2011, 168 countries had signed it. The convention calls for establishing a system of pro-tected areas and a coordinated set of national and inter-national regulations on activities that can have signiﬁ  cant 
negative impacts on biodiversity. It also provides funding for developing countries that are trying to meet the terms of the convention.  
  The biodiversity convention is a step forward in 
that it both afﬁ  rms the vital signiﬁ  cance of preserving 
biological diversity and provides a framework for coop-eration toward that end. However, the agreement has proved difﬁ  cult to implement. In particular, there is an 
ongoing struggle to ﬁ  nd a balance between the need of poorer countries to promote local ec  o  nomic development    Figure 13.21

and the need to preserve biodiversity, which happens 
to be richest in parts of the global economic periph-ery. Also, there has been controversy over the sharing of costs for conservation programs, which has led to heated debates over ratiﬁ  cation of the convention in some countries. Nevertheless, this convention, along with a host of voluntary efforts, has helped to focus attention on the biodiversity issue and to promote the expansion of protected areas. Whether those areas will succeed in providing long-term species protection is an open question that will occupy geographers and biolo-gists for years to come.  
  Protection of the Ozone Layer  
  When found in the troposphere (0 to 16 kilometer or 
1.0 to 10 mile altitude), ozone (O  3  ) gas is a harmful 
pollutant closely associated with the creation of smog. 
However, a naturally occurring   ozone layer   exists in 
the stratosphere (between 30 and 45 kilometer altitude). 
The ozone layer is of vital importance because it pro-tects Earth’s surface from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays. In 1985, a group of British scientists working in Antarctica discovered that the thickness of the ozone layer above the South Pole was dramatically reduced, from 300 Dobson units (  DUs  ) in the 1960s to a  l  most 200 
  DUs   by 1985. Studies revealed that the main culprits in 
ozone depletion were a group of human-made gases col-
lectively known as CFCs (chloroﬂ  uorocarbons). These 
gases, used mainly as refrigerants in ﬁ  re extinguishers 
and in aerosol cans, had only been in use since the 1950s and were thought to be completely harmless to humans. The strength of the scie  n  tiﬁ c evidence pointing to a 
rapid reduction of the ozone layer led to an unusually 
rapid and united international response.  
  International cooperation began in 1985 with 
the negotiation of the   Vienna Convention for the 
Protection of the Ozone Layer  . Speciﬁ  c targets and 
timetables for the phase-out of production and con-
sumption of CFCs were deﬁ  ned and agreed upon as part of the international agreement known as the   Montreal 
Protocol  , which was signed in September 1987 by 105 
countries and the European Community. The original 
agreement called for a 50 percent reduction in the pro-duction and consumption of CFCs by 1999. At a meet-ing in London in 1990, scientiﬁ  c data showing that ozone depletion would continue for many years after a   phaseout   of CFCs led the   signators   of the Montreal 
Protocol to agree to halt CFC production entirely by 
the year 2000. Finally, at a meeting in Copenh  a  gen in 
1992, the timetable for CFC   phaseout   accelerated. Par-
ticipants agreed to eliminate CFC production by 1996 
and to accel  e  rate the   phaseout   of other ozone-depleting 
chemicals such as   halons  ,   hydrochloroﬂ  uorocarbons  , carbon tetrachloride, methyl chlor  o  form, and methyl 
bromide. This response is an encouraging example of 
international cooperation in the face of a signiﬁ  cant, 
albeit clearly d  e  ﬁ ned, problem.  
  Global Climate Change  
  Beginning in the late 1980s, growing concern about cli-
mate change led to a series of intergovernmental con-ferences on the nature and extent of human impacts on climate. In December 1990, the United Nations General Assembly approved the start of treaty negotiations. A draft convention called on developed countries to take measures aimed at r  e  ducing their emissions to 1990 levels 
by the year 2000 and to provide technical and ﬁ  nancial 
support for emission-reduction efforts in the developing countries. The European Comm  u  nity (precursor to the 
European Union) and 154 other states signed the con-vention, commonly called the Earth Summit, in Rio de J  a  neiro.  
  In 1997, the Kyoto Agreement set a target period of 
2008–2012 for the United States, the European Union, 
and Japan to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 7, 8, and 6 percent, respectively, below 1990 levels. The agree-ment reached in Kyoto did not obligate less developed countries to adhere to speciﬁ  c reduction goals; instead it 
called for voluntary emission reduction plans to be imple-mented individually by those countries with ﬁ  nancial 
assistance from industrialized countries.  
  Neither the United States nor China, the world’s 
two largest emitters of carbon dioxide, signed the 
Kyoto Protocol, which is slated to expire in 2012.   The 
United States continues to be the largest producer of 
carbon dioxide emissions, per person, in the world.   The 
United States emitted 19.4 tons of carbon dioxide per 
capita in 2007, and it was followed by the Eur  o  pean 
Union with 8.6 tons, China with 5.1 tons, and India 
with 1.8 tons (Fig. 13.22). However, in 2006, China took the lead as the world’s single largest total emit-ter of carbon dioxide, pushing the United States out of the top spot. The Beijing Olympics in 2008 opened the world’s eyes to the incredibly high emissions level in China (Fig. 13.23).  
  In 2009, the Copenhagen Agreement endorsed the 
continuation of the Kyoto Accord in the wake of a 2007 
report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded that “changes in the atmosphere, the ocean, and glaciers and ice caps now show unequivocally that the world is warming due to human activities.” A total of 141 countries have signed the nonbinding Copenhagen Accord, which states that the countries agre  e  ing to the accord will work to 
keep global temperature increases less than 2 degrees 
Celsius above   preindustrial   levels. With most countries c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 461  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501c13The HumanizedEnvironment.indd Page 461  9/19/11  2:01 PM user-f501 /204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles/204/MHBR250/mca25006_disk1of1/0073525006/mca25006_pagefiles

continuing to prioritize economic concerns over efforts 
to make serious inroads in the reduction of greenhouse gases, there is much doubt as to whether signiﬁ  cant 
progress will be made in confronting the human role in climate change. Hence, policy makers and scientists are  increasingly focusing their attention on adaptation strat  e  gies.

  Summary  
  What will the future be like? Many would agree with geographer Robert   Kates  , who 
foresees a “warmer, more crowded, more co  n  nected but more diverse world.” As we 
consider this prospect, we must acknowledge that global environmental changes illus-
trate the limits what we know about our planet. Global environmental change is not always anticipated and is often nonlinear. Some changes are “chaotic” in the sense that future conditions cannot be reliably predicted. Nonlinearity means that small actions in certain situations may result in large impacts and may be more important than larger actions in causing change. Thresholds also exist in many systems, which, once past, are irreversible. Irreversible changes occur, for e  x  ample, when the habitat for a species is 
diminished to the point where the species quickly dies off. Unfortunately, we may not be able to identify these thresholds until we pass them. This leaves open the possibility of “surprises”—unanticipated responses by physical sy  s  tems.  
  The complexity and urgency of environmental change will tax the energies of the 
scientiﬁ  c and policy communities for some time to come. Geography must be an essen-
tial part of any serious effort to grapple with these challenges. The major changes that 
are taking place have different origins and spatial expressions, and each results from a unique combination of physical and social processes. We cannot simply focus on sys-tem dynamics and generalized causal relationships. We must also consi  d  er emerging 
patterns of environmental change and the impacts of differences from place to place on the operation of general processes. Geography is not the backdrop to the changes tak-ing place; it is at the very heart of the changes themselves.

  Traveling through a rural village 
in Andhra Pradesh, India, we stopped to take in a weekend morning mar-ket. Women sold spices stored in heaps of col-ored ﬂ  akes; a man had a chair set up and was cutting a li  t  tle boy’s hair; a group of men sold rebar from shops behind vegeta-ble stands. I was used to see-ing the colorful   sarees   and    sa  l  war     kameez   worn by Indian women. Then, an older woman from one of India’s scheduled tribes caught my eye. I ﬁ  rst noticed her clothing. The colors were as bright as any   saree  , but the silver, mirrors, and beads adorning her dress stood out. I looked up at her, our eyes connected, and then she smiled (Fig. 14. 1). I asked if I could take her picture, and she 
nodded yes.  
  I think of her when I am teaching human 
geography. Often, students in their ﬁ  rst college-
level geogr  a  phy class are excited at the end of the semester to have learned so much about the world. Some have had their eyes opened to the world for the ﬁ  rst time as an adult. Others have ﬁ  nally under-
stood the roots of a conﬂ  ict they have only heard 
about on television. And many feel overwhelmed.   Too much information.     Too many people.   Too little they can do to help.

 Happiness is in the Eye of the Beholder  465
  Everyone feels this frustration to some degree, since no one can understand 
all of the complexities that govern life on Earth. But the ideas and perspectives set 
forth in this book give you insight into what it means to think geographically about the world. That type of thinking is critical if you are to raise the types of questions that go beyond the generalizations and stereotypes that can work against deeper understanding.  
  So many books try to simplify the world in an alarmist way. The world is ﬂ  at 
(Thomas Friedman)! There’s a population bomb (Paul Ehrlich)! We live in a post-American world (  Fareed     Zakaria  )! Such books o  f  ten start from an interesting observation, but then overlook how geography affects what is happening.  
  Each of us can attest that the world is anything but ﬂ  at. Millions of people in 
India may be co  m  peting on a more level playing ﬁ  eld with those in North America than was true in the past, but many other mi  l  lions live in a different world that we ignore at our peril. As geographer Yi Fu Tuan said, “People make places.” Each place is an imprint of culture, a reﬂ  ection of diffusion, and a dynamic entity. Each place 
has its own ide  n  tity, which makes it unique.  
  It is important not just to understand that the world is diverse, but to 
appreciate that the uniqu  e  ness of places cuts against the stereotypes that circu-late about them. Many in India do not live in a ﬂ  at world, but that does not mean they are unhappy or are unaffected by the wider world. The image of the tribal woman in India is the counterbalance to the images of the developing world I saw when I was growing up. I remember seeing pi  c  tures of women in remote parts of South America wearing exotic clothing. I also saw television coverage of children in   Subsaharan   Africa with distended stomachs and hunger in their faces. But in these images of the developing world that I saw as a child, no one was smiling.  
  The images I saw growing up formed the identities I had for the developing 
world and people in it. My experiences since then have changed the ways I see the world and my own place in it.  
  The king of Bhutan, a small country nestled in the foothills of the Himalaya 
Mountains, decided that st  a  tistics that calculate the wealth of a country, from gross national income (GNI) to Internet access, did not acc  u  rately measure the state of people’s lives. In the 1970s, the preceding king of Bhutan coined the term gross national happiness, stating that the government needed to focus on achieving happiness instead of focu  s  ing on gross domestic product (GDP). In 2008, the current leader of Bhutan, King   Wangchuck  , r  e  leased a new measure-ment, an index called gross national happiness (GNH) (Fig. 14. 2). King   Wangchuck   explained that measurements such as gross domestic product (GDP) or GNI emphasize production and consumption instead of conservation of resources and environment.  
  The Center for Bhutan Studies measures nine dimensions of happiness and 
calculates a single numerical index reported as GNH. The nine dimensions include measurements of psychological well-being, time use, community vitality, cul-ture, health, education, environmental diversity, living standard, and governance. R  e  gardless of the accuracy of the GNH index, we welcome a critical and reﬂ  ective 
look at how we measure our world.  
  Our hope is that this textbook has helped you think through the ways you 
make sense of the world. In this chapter, we consider how identities have changed in a globalizing world. In an effort to deepen our understanding of globalization, we also examine how ne  t  works operate in our world, in order to encourage you to consider the possibilities for tomorrow.  c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 465  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 465  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400 F-400F-400

  HOW   HAVE   IDENTITIES CHANGED 
IN A   GLOBALIZED   WORLD?  
  Gillian Rose deﬁ  nes identity as “how we make sense 
of ourselves.” She explains that we have identities at di  f-
  ferent scales: we have local, national, regional, and global identities. At each scale, place factors into our ident  i  ties. 
We infuse places with meaning and emotions based on 
our experiences in those places. Relatively few people liv-ing in today’s   globalized   world are world tra  v  elers. And

cities, living the lives of businesspeople (vi  s  iting air-
ports, ofﬁ  ce buildings, and hotels), or staying in luxuri-
ous resorts (separated from the “local”) as tou  r  ists. How, 
then, can a person have a global identity if he or she has 
not experienced the globe?  
  Globalization networks link us with other people and 
places, and the ﬂ  ow of information technology is a daily 
way in which we are interlinked with the globe. A person may be overwhelmed by the ﬂ  ow of information and choose to ignore it, but even such a person has a global identity. People identify themselves by identifying with or against others at local, regional, and global scales. As the ﬂ  ow of 
information continues, many people feel a need to make sense of the world by identifying with people and places. People personalize the ﬂ  ow of inform  a  tion, and in so doing 
they feel more connected to the globe and alter their local 
cultural landscapes to reﬂ  ect their feeling of co  n  nectedness.  
  In 1995,   National Geographic   discussed the future of 
the digital age and argued that as a result of technologi-
cal a  d  vances and the Internet, people were interacting in 
person less. However, the author also claimed that people would continue to have “a need for skin,” a desire to inter-act with other humans in person. As evidence, the a  u  thor 
cited how busy a mall is when the people in the mall could just as easily be ordering all of their purchases from home on the Internet.  Tropic of CancerArctic Circle

468 Chapter 14  Globalization and the Geography of Networks
  This discussion of a pull between a faceless Internet 
and the “need for skin” took place nine years before 
Mark   Zuckerberg   created   Facebook   in 2004. People with 
  Facebook   or T witter accounts (see chapter 4) can feel con-
nected without sharing skin by posting a quip or thought, which friends around the world can respond to imme-diately. Psychologists also recognize that the prolifera-tion of reality television shows is connected to d  e  clining 
human interaction through membership in service orga-niz  a  tions and clubs in the United States.  
  In the 1990s, at the launch of the digital revolution, 
psychologists predicted people would have poorer social 
skills because of the lack of personal or face to face inter-action in the digital age. We can certainly see evidence of this in our daily lives, from people answering a phone call or text message when they are in the middle of a conversa-tion with someone in person to   students     texting   or mul-
titasking on laptops during a geography lecture. T oday, 
psychologists recognize that the networks created among people through digital technology also enable greater per-sonal interaction and opportunities for empathy. Someone with medical problems can post a journal on   a cite   such as 
Caring Bridge and hundreds can follow the person’s recov-
ery and offer words of support. A young boy with a medical condition that makes it difﬁ  cult to leave home can post lip 
synched videos on Y ou T ube, develop followers around the world, and end up with recording artists stopping by to lip sync with him. Social networks can be used for good or for ill, but either way, they tend to be a major way by which individ  u  als, in a global, digital age can develop a sense of 
belonging and a personal connectedness to people who are 
separated by computer screens.  
  Personal Connectedness  
  Sixteen years before hundreds of millions around the world 
watched a live feed of the wedding of Price William and Catherine Middleton (chapter 4) on the Internet and on television, the news that Prince William’s mother, Princess Diana, had died traveled quickly from global television, radio, and print media sources among friends, family, and even strangers. Many felt the need to mourn for a prin-cess they had never met in a place they had never been. Some wanted to leave a token offering for the princess: a rose, a note, a candle, a photograph. I  m  promptu shrines 
to Princess Diana cropped up at the British embassy in 
Washington, D.C., and at British emba  s  sies and consulates 
around the world. People in Britain left countless ﬂ  owers at 
the royal palace in London, where Pri  n  cess Diana resided.  
  In an incredibly divided world, in which the rift 
between rich and poor is growing at the global scale, what 
made people feel connected to a woman who represented the royal family ruling over one modest-sized country, an elite group of people of wealth and privilege? What, sixteen years later, made people want to see how her son turned out and “get to know” who he was marrying by watching television programs and reading stories on line and in print about Catherine Middleton leading up to the wedding?
The idea that people around the world are linked and 
have shared experiences, such as death, tragedy, sorrow, and even joy, draws from Benedict Ande  r  son’s concept 
of the nation as an imagined community (see chapter 8). 
When massive tragedies such as 9/11, Hurricane K  a  trina, 
or the Japan tsunami occur, people often talk about some-
one they knew who was in the place (or had been at some point), someone who died (even those they did not know but heard about in the news), or an act of bravery or tri-umph that occurred in the midst of tragedy. The desire to   personalize  , to   localize,   a tragedy or even a joyous event 
feeds off of the imagined global community in which we 
live. In the process of personalizing and localizing, events can be   globalized   in an effort to appeal to the humanity of 
all people with the hope that all will feel or experience the 
loss or joy tange  n  tially.  
  In the case of a death or a tragedy, how do people 
choose a local space in which to express a personal and/
or global sorrow? In a world where some commentators argue that place and territory are unimportant because things like global superhighways of information transcend place, people continue to recognize territories and create places. In the case of Princess D  i  ana’s death, people created 
hundreds of spaces of sorrow to mourn the loss of a seem-
ingly magnanimous person whose life was cut short. In the case of September 11, people tran  s  formed homes, schools, 
public spaces, and houses of worship into spaces of reﬂ  ec-
tion by creating human chains, pa  r  ticipating in moments 
of silence, or holding prayer vigils for the victims.  
  In his book   Shadowed Ground: America’s Landscapes 
of Violence and Tragedy  , Kenneth Foote examines the 
“spontaneous shrines” created at a place of loss or at a 
place that represents loss and describes these spontane-ous shrines as a “ﬁ  rst stage in the commemoration of a disaster.” Foote draws from extensive ﬁ  eld research of lan  d  scapes of tragedy and violence in the United States 
to show how people mark or do not mark tragedy, both 
imm  e  diately with spontaneous shrines and in the longer 
term with permanent mem  o  rials (Fig. 14.3). He exam-
ines the struggles over whether and how to memorialize 
signiﬁ  cant people or experienced tragedy. His research 
focu  s  es on the United States, and after tracing and fol-
lowing the stories of hundreds of people and places, 
Foote concludes that “the debate over what, why, when, and where to build” a memorial for a person or event is “best considered a part of the grieving process.”  
  Foote realized that the ways sites are memorialized 
or not vary over time and across a multitude of circu  m-
  stances, depending on whether funding is available, what 
kind of structure is to be built, who is being reme  m  bered c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 468  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 468  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400 F-400F-400
(only those who died or also those injured?), whether the 
site represents a socially contested event (which often hap-pens when racism is involved), and whether people want to remember the site. In recent American hi  s  tory, major ter-
rorist attacks have been memorialized, often with the word 
“closure” evoked. Oklahoma City permanently memori-alized the site of a terrorist attack at the   Murrah   Federal 
Building on the ﬁ  ve-year annive  r  sary of the tragedy. Other 
tragedies, such as that experienced at the World T rade 
Center in New Y ork City on September 11, 2001, take longer to memorialize. Millions of people have a personal connection to the World T rade Center site, and so choos-ing a design and building a memorial took longer  .  
  The mass of information coming our way each day 
is often overwhelming. As people ﬁ  lter through or ignore 
the ﬂ  ow of information, they may personalize the infor-
mation and either make a connection or differentiate themselves from particular people or pla  c  es. In the end 
many people’s identities are shaped by developments unfolding at the global scale. Living in a world, at a scale we have not experienced previously, changes us and pro-foundly changes places. Globalization, for good or for ill, has modiﬁ  ed how we int  e  ract with one another and has 
shaped how we make  sense of ourselves in our world, our state, our region, and our locality.  
  Think of a national or global-scale tragedy, such as September 11 or World War II. In what ways do memor  i  als of that tragedy reﬂ  ected both globalization and localization at 
the same time?    Guest Field Note  
  Columbine, Colorado  
  I took this photo at the dedica-
tion ceremony for the memorial to the victims of the Columbine High School shooting of April 20, 1999. Columbine is located near Littleton, Colorado, in Denver’s southern suburbs. The memo-rial, dedicated on Se  p  tember 21,2007, provides a quiet place for meditation and reﬂ  ection 
in a public park adjacent to the school. Hundreds came to the ceremony to honor those killed and wounded in the attack, one of the deadliest school shoot-ings in U.S. history.  
  After tragedies like the 
Columbine shootings, creating a memorial often helps to rebuild a sense of community. Pu  b  lic ceremonies like this can set an example for survivors who may otherwise have difﬁ  culty facing 
their loss in private. A group memorial helps to acknowledge the magnitude of the community’s loss and, by so doing, helps assure families and survivors that the victims did not suffer alone—that their deaths and wounds are grieved by the entire community. Memorials are important too because they can serve as a focus for reme  m  brance and commemoration long into the future, even after all other evidence of a tragedy has disappeared.  
  In my research for   Shadowed Ground   I have visited hundreds of such places in the United States and Europe. I am still 
surprised by the power of such places and the fact that shrines and memorials resulting from similar tragedies are tended lovingly for decades, generations, and centuries. They produce strong emotions and som  e  times leave visitors—including me—in tears. But by allowing individuals to share loss, tragedy, and sorrow with others, they create a sense of common pu  r  pose.

470 Chapter 14  Globalization and the Geography of Networks
  WHAT IS GLOBALIZATION, AND 
WHAT ROLE   DO   NETWORKS PLAY IN GLOBALIZATION?  
  Whether you are in favor of or opposed to globaliza-
tion, we all must recognize that globalization is “ne  i  ther 
an inevitable nor an irreversible set of processes,” as John 
  O’Loughlin  , Lynn   Staeheli  , and Edward Greenberg put 
it. Andrew Kirby explains that globalization is “not pro-ceeding according to any particular playbook. It is not a smoothly evolving state of capitalist development.” Rather, it is fragmented, and its ﬂ  ows are “chaotic in terms of origins and destinations.”  
  Globalization   is a “chaotic” set of processes and 
outcomes created by people, be they corporate CEOs, 
unive  r  sity administrators, readers of   blogs  , electrical 
engineers, or protesters at a trade meeting. The processes of globalization and the connectedness created through globalization occur across scales and across networks, r  e  gardless of state borders.  
  The backbone of economic globalization is trade; as 
such, debates over globalization typically focus on trade. 
T o visualize how trade fosters globalization, examine a map of shipping routes (Fig. 14.4). The density of the net-works on the map tells us how extensively connected the world really is. But what are the consequences of those co  n  nections? The arguments in favor of globalization, as 
explained by economist Keith   Maskus  , are that “free trade 
raises the well-being of all countries by inducing them to specialize their resources in those goods they produce relatively most efﬁ  ciently” in order to lower production 
costs, and that “competition through trade raises a coun-try’s long-term growth rate by expanding access to global technologies and promo  t  ing innovation.”  
  This view of free trade underpins what is sometimes 
called the   Washington Consensus   because it is shared by 
the leaders of many international economic institutions 
with ofﬁ  ces in Washington, D.C., including   the World 
Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World 
T rade Organization. Y et not everyone accepts this “co  n-
  sensus.” Indeed, many have questioned its underlying 
assumptions in the wake of the global economic dow  n-
  turn that began in 2008. Opponents view the Washin  g  ton 
Consensus as part of a Western-dominated effort to get the 
rest of the world to privatize state-owned entities, to open ﬁ nancial markets, to liberalize trade by r  e  moving restric-

have signiﬁ  cant negative l  o  cal consequences. According 
to   Maskus  , the rules negotiated for the World T rade 
Organization “inevitably r  e  ﬂ ect the economic interest of 
powerful lobbyists” in places such as the United States 
and the European Union, and have heightened wealth dif-ferences between more and less prosperous regions, and strengthened an inhe  r  ently unequal global system.  
  However one views these arguments, the globalizing 
trends of the last few decades mean that we are, in many 
respects, living on an unprecedented scale. In Andrew Kirby’s words, we are living “not so much in a world without   boundaries, or in a world without geography—  but   more lit-
erally in a world  , as opposed to a neighbo  r  hood or a region” 
(emphasis added).   
  Networks  
  Manuel   Castells   deﬁ nes   networks   as “a set of intercon-
nected nodes” without a center. A nonhierarchical ne  t-
  work is horizontally structured, with power shared among 
all participants and ideas ﬂ  owing in all directions. The 
multitude of networks th  at exist in the world—ﬁ  nancial, 
transportation, communication, kinship, corporate, non-
governmental, trade, government, media, education, social and dozens of others—enable globalization to o  c  c  ur 
and create a higher degree of interaction and interde-pendence among people than ever before in human hi  s-
  tory. But there are deeply entrenched hierarchies in the networks that knit together the contemporary world, and 
these affect the character of different places and the inter-actions among them.  
  While networks have always existed,   Castells   says 
that they have fundamentally changed since 1995 as a 
result of the diffusion of information technology that links places in a global, yet uneven, way. Through infor-mation technology networks,   Ca  s  tells   argues that global-
ization has proceeded by “linking up all that, according to dominant interests, has value anywhere in the planet, and discarding anything (people, ﬁ  rms, territories, r  e  sources) 
which has no value or becomes devalued.” Information tec  h  nology networks link some places more than others, 
helping to create the spatial unevenness of globalization as well as the uneven outcomes of globa  l  ization.  
  Time–Space Compression  
  Access (or lack of access) to information technology net-
works creates time–space compression (chapters 1 and 4). Time–space compression means that certain places, such as global cities (especially in the core), are more i  n  tercon-
nected than ever through communic  a  tion and transpor-
tation networks, even as other places, such as those in the 
periphery, are farther removed than ever. According to   Castells  , the age of information technology ne  t  works has 
been more revolutionary than the advent of the printing 
press or the Industr  i  al Revolution. He claims that we are   Field Note  
  “ ‘You cannot come to southern Brazil without see-
ing our biggest city,’ said the vintner who was showing me around the   Cooperativa   Aurora, the huge winery in Bento   Gonçalves  , in the State of Rio Grande do   Sul  . ‘B  e  sides, it’s January, so they’ll be ha  v  ing the big marches, it’s almost like carnival time in Rio!’  
  So I headed for Porto   Alegre  , only to ﬁ  nd that a 
hotel room was not to be had. Tens of thousands of dem-onstr  a  tors had converged on the State’s capital, largest port, and leading industrial city—and what united them was opposition to globaliz  a  tion.  
  It was not quite a carnival, but the banners held 
aloft by the noisy, sometimes singing and dancing dem-onstr  a  tors left no doubt as to their common goals.  
  The World Social Forum has become an annual 
event held in cities around the world, with ever-larger marches and meetings to protest the actions of the world’s dominant states, especially the United States. The World S  o  cial F  o  rum is a network of   antiglobalizationists  —people 
who seek an alternative economic reality for the globe, one not centered on accumulation of capital. Socialist ec  o  nomic vie ws, 
leftist political leanings, and support for minority causes combine each year at the World Social Forum in a show of strength.”

just at the beginning of this age “as the Internet becomes 
a universal tool of interactive communic  a  tion, as we shift 
from computer-centered technologies to network-diffused 
technologies, (and) as we make pr  o  gress in nanotechnol  o  gy 
(and thus in the diffusion capacity of information devices).”  
  A major divide in access to information technology—
sometimes called the   Digital Divide  —is both a hall-
mark of the current world and an example of the 
uneven outcomes of globalization. The International T elecommun  i  cations Union reported the levels of digital 
access for developing and developed regions of the world. In 2010, the International T elecommunications Union reported that on a  v  erage developed (high income) states 
had 41.6 telephone connections, 114.2 cellular connec-tions, and 68.8 Internet users for every 100 people. On average, developing (low income) states had 11.9 tele-phone connections, 70.1 cellular connections, and 21.1 Internet u  s  ers for every 100 people.  
  The quickening pace of technological change is 
another hallmark of globalization and magniﬁ  es the 
global technological divide. We may be shocked to see 
how quickly technology has changed and diffused. In

1992, the highest income states had on average only 10 
cellular subscribers and 2.5 Internet users per 1000 people (co  n  trasted with 849 and 571, respectively, in 2005).  
  Global Cities  
  Time–space compression has helped to create and rein-
force a network of highly linked global cities. In Chapter 9, we discussed the growth of   global cities   in the core, semi-
periphery, and periphery of the globe and the growth in 
their connectedness. We considered research published by geographers in the Globalization and World Cities group based in the United Kingdom, who use network analyses to examine levels of connectivity among cities, based on such factors as air travel between cities, and the interpenetration of ﬁ  nancial and a  d  vertising networks.  
  The  se   researchers generated data for 315 global 
cities. They measured the information technology ﬂ  ows 
among the cities by tracking the ﬂ  ow of advanced ser-
vices among the cities, focusing on accounting, advertis-
ing, ban  k  ing/ﬁ  nance, insurance, law, and management 
consulting. Figure 14.6 shows the 30 cities they found to

be most connected to New Y ork City, as measured by the 
ﬂ ow of producer serv  ices. By tracking ﬂ  ows, the authors 
found that Miami, not Los Angeles, is the U.S. city most 
closely linked to Latin America and New Y ork is the sec-ond most   globally   linked city in the world (behind London 
and ahead of T okyo). Chicago is also a highly ranked 
member of the global city network, coming in seventh. The researchers found that New Y ork and Chicago stand apart from other world cities in that these American cit-ies have greater domestic linkages than global cities in the Paciﬁ  c Rim or the European Union.  
  The linkages among global cities provide insights into 
the spatial character of the networks that underlie   globa  l  ized   
processes. A multitude of   globalized   processes such as ﬁ  nan-
cial transactions and ﬂ  ows (represented here by banking/
ﬁ nance and accounting) occur across the network of global 
cities. Similarly, this network reﬂ  ects the ﬂ  ow of advertising and marketing consultation services, which in turn reﬂ  ects 
the ﬂ  ow of ideas through the media across the globe.  
  Castells   claims that the age of information technology is more revolutionary than either the advent of the printing press or the Industrial Revolution. Do you agree with him? Write an argument in support of your position, dra  w  ing on your unde  r  standing of the role of changing geographical cir-cumstances over the past several hundred years.  
  HOW DO NETWORKS OPERATE 
IN A GLOBALIZED WORLD?  
  The term   network   deﬁ  nes any number of   interlink-
ages   across the globe, whether transportation, educational, 
ﬁ      nancial, or social. In this section we examine three types 
of networks in the world today: those designed to promote 
a social end  ,   those concerned with the development and 
dissemination of information, and those that underlie eco-
nomic exchange. We consi  d  er both the global and local or 
regional scales of activity for each type of network. Within 
each type, nodes interact at a global scale, and ind  i  viduals 
have created their own local or regional networks, often in 
response to the network operating at the glo  b  al scale.  
  Networks with a Social Focus  
  In the spring awakening of 2011, Egyptians rose up to pro-
test government repression by President   Hosni     Mub  a  rak  , 
who had ruled the country for 29 years. Protests rose 
around North Africa and Southwest Asia, from T un  i  sia to Y emen to Iran to Syria and to Libya. Several factors 
prompted the revolutions in the region. In T unisia, a young man named Hamada Ben   Amor   took the stage name of El 
  Général   and posted videos on   Y ouT ube   and   Facebook   of 
rap songs he wrote in protest of his president and the cor-
ruption rampant in his government (see chapter 4). During protests in Egypt in spring 2011, El   Général’s   anthems 
caught hold and inspired Egyptians to pr  o  test, as well.  
  Social networks  , especially   Facebook   and T witter, 
were credited with making revolutions in T unisia and 
Egypt possible.   First, through protest rap music and sec-
ondly by constructing and carrying out plans for protest.   
In Egypt, a Google employee anonymously created a 
  Facebook   page titled “We are all   Khaled   Said” in honor of a 
young Egyptian businessman who was beaten and killed by 
two police ofﬁ  cers. The page garnered 473,000 supporters, and it “helped spread the word about the demonstrations in Egypt,   which   were ignited after a revolt in neighboring 
T unisia toppled the government there.”   (Preston 2011, 1).  
  Rap or hip hop music   were   powerful commonalities 
among protestors in large part because Islam, the pre-
dominant religion in the region, instructs followers to learn the Arabic language (chapters 6 and 7). El   Général’s   
raps, spoken in Arabic, were readily understood by Arabic 
speakers around the region. In Ar  a  bic, El   Général   rapped, 
“My president, your country is dead/ People eat garbage/
Look at what is happening/Misery everywhere/  Nowhere   
to sleep/I’m speaking for the people who suffer/Ground 
under feet.” Another reason El   Général’s   rap music dif-
fused quickly through North Africa and Southwest Asia 
was its simplicity and its ability to be ﬁ  lmed and posted 
with little production cost.  
  Participatory Development  
  Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are nonproﬁ  t 
institutions outside of formal governance structures that 
are established to promote particular social or humanitar-ian ends. Each NGO is a social network, where people with like interests communicate to achieve a goal. A sizeable community of NGOs is concerned with develo  p  ment, and 
in recent decades they have propagated a web of global net-
works in response to the top-down dec  i  sion making (e.g., 
structural adjustment loans) coming from global organi-
zations dom  i  nated by the major state-tied development 
institutions (e.g., the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund). As a result of their networks, NGOs have considerable inﬂ  uence on the deve  l  opment landscape.  
  NGO development networks serve as a counter-
balance to the power of the major decision makers in the 
world. The stated goal of many development-oriented NGOs is to include the voices of the poor and those directly a  f  fected by development, permitting them to 
express their opinions and lifestyles. Some NGOs have been crit  i  cized for falling far short of this goal, but devel-
opment networks now make it possible for NGOs in c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 474  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 474  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400 F-400F-400
 How Do Networks Operate in a Globalized World?  475
different parts of the world to work together to reach a 
consensus on how to achieve economic development and to r  e  spond to crises. The power of these networks was 
very much in evidence in the wake of the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, when NGOs from far-ﬂ  ung parts of 
the globe cooperated in an effort to respond to the cr  i  sis.  
  Despite the goal of sharing power across a network, 
most development networks (like other networks) have 
power differences within them. Indeed,   Leroi   Henry, 
Giles Mohan, and Helen   Yanacopulos   ﬁ nd that power 
r  e  lationships exist both within and between networks—
often privileging the views of NGOs in the core, as opposed to those in the periphery.  
  A growing number of development entities are pro-
moting local solutions to development.   Participatory 
deve  l  opment  —the idea that locals should be engaged in 
deciding what development means for them and how to 
achieve it—is another response to top-down decision mak-ing. Stuart   Corbridge   has studied how the global push for 
participatory development has encouraged the government 
of India to enact participatory development pr  o  grams. 
  Corbridge   and his colleague Sanjay Kumar describe the 
goal of participatory development as giving the people 
who are directly affected by policies and programs a voice in making the policies and programs—that is, to use local networks to shape development for local goals. Kumar and   Corbridge   found that “[t]here can be no doubting the sin-
ce  r  ity of” participatory development programs “to engage 
the rural poor” in India. However, they also found that 
local politics factor into the distribution of poverty allevia-tion schemes because richer farmers and elites in rural areas tend to be most involved with develo  p  ment program.  
  This situation is a failure not of development, they 
maintain, but rather of the deﬁ  nition of success. The goal 
of the program they studied in India was to get seeds to 
farmers and to create irrigation schemes. The pr  o  gram 
has succeeded in this respect for many farmers, though not for the poorest farmers. Their lack of pa  r  ticipation is 
not a reason to abandon the participatory program, how-ever. According to Kumar and   Corbridge  , the program 
(like other participatory development programs) has to “operate in an environment that is dom  i  nated by bet-
ter off farmers and particular community groups.” They argue that the deﬁ  nition of success must change because development organizations cannot expect the poorest to “participate in groups that have little meaning for them.”  
  The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, 
and even state governments are increasingly embrac-
ing the ideal of participatory development, loosening demands for trade liberalization in the periphery and semi-periphery. As Kumar and   Corbridge   explain, poli-
tics will enter participatory development, just as it enters the development networks and the global development organizations. The goal of participatory development is worthwhile, even if the short-term results do not mesh with Western concepts of success.    Networks and Information  
  The global diffusion of products and ideas associated 
with popular culture depends largely on   globalized   media 
and retail store networks, as well as the advertising prac-tices in which both engage. T oday’s media encompasses much more than print, radio, and telev  i  sion; also part 
of the picture are spaces of entertainment, such as the New Amsterdam Theater in Times Square in New Y ork (owned by Disney); songs produced under record labels like RCA, Jive, and BMG (all owned by Bertelsmann); games played on PlayStation (owned by Sony); movie i  n  formation disseminated through   MovieFone   and online 
directions to movie theaters that can be found through   MapQuest   (both owned by Time-Warner, as is the New 
Line Cin  e  ma movie you chose to see).  
  Through a series of mergers and consolidations 
occurring mostly in the post–Cold War era, global media 
are controlled largely by six globe-spanning corporations: Time-Warner, Disney, Bertelsmann, Viacom, News Co  r  poration, and   Vivendi   Universal. These six m  e  dia 
corporations (along with other media corporations) are masters of   vertical integration  . A vertically integrated 
corporation is one that has ownership in all or most of the 
points along the production and consumption of a com-modity chain.  
  In a 2003 report, Miguel Mendes Pereira noted 
that media companies compete for three things:   con-
tent, deli  v  ery  , and   co  n  sumers  . Through consolidation and 
mergers, vertically integrated global media companies 
such as the Walt Disney Corporation (Fig. 14.7) con-trol content (through ownership of production compa-nies, radio shows, television stations, ﬁ  lm pr  o  ducers, and 
publishers) and delivery (through ownership of radio, 
television stations, magazines, and movies). Delivery of content also refers to the infrastructure of technology—the pr  o  prietary technologies used for creating and shar-
ing digital media. Vertical integr  a  tion also helps media 
giants attract and maintain customers through   synergy  , 
or the cross promotion of vertically integrated goods. 
For e  x  ample, within the vertical integration of Disney, 
you can visit Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom to 
catch the Festival of the Lion King, based on the Disney Theatrical Production that was based on the Walt Disney Picture.  
  Vertical integration of media changes the geog-
raphy of the ﬂ  ow of ideas around the globe by limiting 
the ult  i  mate number of   gatekeepers  , that is, people or 
corporations with control over access to information. A 
gat  e  keeper can choose not to tell a story and the story will 
not be heard. Some are concerned, then, that the consol  i-
  dation of media is resulting in fewer ultimate gatekeepers. 
The big media conglomerates, in this view, have b  e  come 
the ult  i  mate gatekeepers. Or we can focus on the com-
petition for customers and the proliferation of sources of delivery for media (the vast number of cable television c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 475  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 475  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400 F-400F-400
476 Chapter 14  Globalization and the Geography of Networks
channels, radio stations, Internet sources, and magazines) 
and argue that there are more gatekeepers in the world today. The diversity of media outlets su  p  ports the latter 
proposition, with television channels geared to speciﬁ  c 
segments (or markets) of the population. For example, both the wide-reaching Al-  Jazeera   sate  l  lite television 
station and the new cable channels in the United States 
that are targeted toward Muslim Americans are geared 
to speciﬁ  c segments of the global or U.S. popul  a  tion.  
  Blogs  
  Historically, governments and journalists had the abil-
ity to be strong gatekeepers by choosing what stories to release or tell. T oday, with the extraordinary growth of   blogs   (“web logs”) on the Internet (upwards of 8 mi  l  lion 
in 2004 and over 133 million in 2010), tight   gatekeeping   
is much more difﬁ  cult. A   blog   allows individuals, without 
cost, to post thoughts, photographs, and exp  e  riences, and 
to create links to websites or other   blogs  .   Blogs are local, 
regional, national or global networks that respond to and 
stand separate from global media networks.     
  Anyone with access to the Internet can read a   blog-
ger’s   postings and comment on them.   Blogger  , the origi-
nal   blog   site created by the small company   Pyra   Labs in 
1999, was sold to Google. Media giants are ﬁ  nding their 
way into the   blogosphere   (as the   blog   space of the Internet 
is called) with sites such as MSN spaces and AOL journals. 
The   blog   site hosts your   blog   for free and provides a for-
mat for your   blog  , so that you need know next to nothing 
about website publishing.   Blogs   inﬂ  uence elections, and 
they help generate interest in particular st  o  ries and events.  
  Networks and Economic Exchange  
  Unlike major media corporations that are vertically 
integrated—with ownership of relevant suppliers and pr  o  ducers—major retail corporations are typically hori-
zontally integrated. A horizontally integrated corpora-
tion is one that acquires ownership of other corpor  a  tions 
engaged in similar activities. The retail industry may appear 
to be dominated by a large number of different companies; however, many retail companies bearing different names are in fact owned by the same horizontally integrated pa  r  ent corporation.  
  Horizontal integration   means that when you shop 
for similar products in different places or across a mall, 
your dollars often support the same parent corporation. If you go to the mall to buy a pair of jeans, your choice to shop at   Banana Republic  , the Gap, and Old Navy sends 
your dollars to the same parent company. And your choice 
to take a break at the food court to drink a Gatorade, eat a bag of Doritos, and buy a Quaker granola bar also sends your dollars to the same parent corporation (in this case, Peps  i  Co). Y ou might wonder when T aco Bell started selling DISNEY VERTICAL INTEGRATION

Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut pizza (all three

  Analyzing the global consolidation of media, the 
global networking of NGOs concerned with develop-
ment, and the global presence of retail corporations helps us see the diversity of global networks, with some i  n  creas-
ingly centralized and others increasingly disaggregated. Aside from the spatial characteristics of the network itself, what is interesting for geographers is the impact of these networks on local places, for   globa  l  ized   networks do not 
affect individual places in the same way. People interact with the global network, sha  p  ing it, resisting it, embracing 
it, and re  s  ponding to globalization in unique ways.  
  Community-Supported Agriculture  
  In the von   Thunen   model (Chapter 11), farms surrounded 
urban areas in a regular pattern and provided fresh food to the people in the cities by bringing their products to mar-
kets in the cities. With the industrialization of agriculture (chapter 11), the distance between farmers and co  n  sumers 
has increased, ﬁ  guratively and literally. Consumers often 
do not consider the source of their food, and some pro-
cessed foods look so little like natural foods that it is all too easy to forget farmers were involved in producing the food. Container ships and refrige  r  ated trucking and ship-

Census of Agriculture, it found the number of principal operators of farms in the United States had grown by 4 percent, to 2.2 mi  l  lion people. According to geographer 
Steven Schnell, one of the reasons the number of farm-ers in the United States has increased is the growth in the number of   community-supported agriculture   groups, 
known as   CSAs   (Fig. 14. 8). Schnell explains that   CSAs

began in Japan in the 1960s when a group of women “dis-
satisﬁ  ed with imported, processed, and pesticide-laden 
food, made arrang  e  ments directly with fa  r  mers to provide 
natural, organic, local food for their tables.”  
  From its hearth in Japan,   CSAs   diffused to Europe 
and then to the United States. The ﬁ  rst CSA in the United 
States was in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts. By 2011, the number of   CSAs   in the United States had 
risen to over 4000 according to Local Harvest, an orga-nization that maps   CSAs   to help consumers and farmers 
connect (Fig. 14.9).  
  Through a CSA, a farmer and consumers create a 
network whereby both assume risk. Consumers pay for a 
share of the farmer’s harvest, typically fruits and vegeta-bles, before the growing season begins. Farmers use the cash to purchase seed and plant and then deliver goods to consumers over a period of weeks during the growing season. Both Schnell and Local Harvest agree that CSA farmers typically use organic growing standards (cha  p  ter 
11) but do not take the time to certify their land and pro-
duce as organic.

  Summary  
  Globalization has been compared to a runaway train blowing through stations leaving 
much of the world to stare at its caboose. Y et this description is not entirely accurate. Globalization is a series of processes, not all of which are headed in the same direction. Even those processes headed down the globalization track are often stopped, sent back to the previous station, or derailed. The globalization track is not inevitable or irrevers-ible (in the words of   O’Loughlin  ,   Staeheli  , and Greenberg). Many of the most important 
global  i  zation processes take place within networks of global cities (see chapter 9), of 
places linked by popular culture (see chapter 4), of gover  n  ments (see chapter 8), of trade c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 478  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400c14GlobalizationandtheGeographyofNetworks.indd Page 478  10/4/11  11:26 AM user f-400 F-400F-400

MapsAAPPENDIX
The geographer’s greatest ally is the map. Maps can 
 present enormous amounts of information very effectively, 
and can be used to establish theories and solve problems. Furthermore, maps often are fascinating, revealing things no other medium can. It has been said that if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a map is worth a million.
Maps can be fascinating, but they often do not get the 
attention they deserve. Y ou may spend 20 minutes care-fully reading a page of text, but how often have you spent 20 minutes with a page-size map, studying what it reveals? It is difﬁ  cult to summarize every pattern a map shows in a 
caption or paragraph of text. Readers should actively read maps by looking for patterns and themes. For example, in chapter 2 on population we study several maps that depict the human condition by country, including birth and death rates, infant mortality, hunger index, and life expectancy. In the text, we can refer only to highlights (and low points) on those maps. But make a point of looking beyond the main issue to get a sense of the global distributions these maps represent. It is part of an intangible but important process: to enhance your mental map of the world.
While on the topic of maps, we should remind our-
selves that a map—any map—is an incomplete representa-tion of reality. In the ﬁ  rst place, a map is smaller than the real world it represents. Second, it must depict the curved surface of our world on a ﬂ  at plane, for example, a page of this book. And third, it contains symbols to convey the in-formation that must be transmitted to the reader. These are the three fundamental properties of all maps: scale, projec-tion, and symbols.
Understanding these basics helps us interpret maps 
while avoiding their pitfalls. Some maps look so convinc-ing that we may not question them as we would a para-graph of text. Y et maps, as representatives of the world all, to some extent, distort reality. Most of the time, such dis-tortion is necessary and does not invalidate the map’s mes-sage. But some maps are drawn deliberately to mislead. Propaganda maps, for example, may exaggerate or distort reality to promote  political aims. We should be alert to 
 cartographic mistakes when we read maps. The proper 
use of scale, projection, and symbolization ensures that a map is as  accurate as it can be made.
MAP SCALE
The scale of a map reveals how much the real world 
has been reduced to ﬁ  t on the page or screen on which it appears. It is the ratio between an actual distance on the ground and the length given to that distance on the map, using the same units of measurement. This ratio is often represented as a fraction (e.g., 1:10,000 or 1/10,000). This means that one unit on the map represents 10,000 such units in the real world. If the unit is 1 inch, then an inch on the map represents 10,000 inches on the ground, or slightly more than 833 feet. The metric system certainly makes things easier. One centimeter on the map would actually represent 10,000 cm or 100 meters. Such a scale would be useful when mapping a city’s downtown area, but it would be much too large for the map of an entire state. As the real-world area we want to map gets larger, we must make our map scale smaller. As small as the fraction 1/10,000 seems, it still is 10 times as large as 1/100,000, and 100 times as large as 1/1,000,000. If the world maps in this book had fractional scales, they would be even smaller. A large-scale map can contain much more detail and be far more representative of the real world than a small-scale map. Look at it this way: when we devote a half page of this book to a map of a major city (Fig. A.1), we are able to represent the layout of that city in considerable detail. But if the entire country in which that city is located must be represented on a single page, the city becomes just a large dot on that small-scale map, and the detail is lost in favor of larger-area coverage (Fig. A.2). So the selection of scale depends on the objective of the map.

A-2 Maps
But when you examine the maps in this book, you 
will note that most, if not all, of them have scales that are 
not given as ratios or fractions, but in graphic form. This method of representing map scale is convenient from sev-eral viewpoints. Using the edge of a piece of paper and marking the scale bar’s length, the map reader can quickly—without calculation—determine approximate distances. And if a map is enlarged or reduced in reproduction, the scale bar is enlarged or reduced with it and remains accu-rate. That, of course, is not true of a ratio or fractional scale. Graphic scales, therefore, are most common in this book.
MAP PROJECTIONS
For centuries cartographers have faced the challenge 
of creating map projections, ways representing the spheri-cal Earth, or part of it, on a ﬂ  at surface. T o get the job done, there had to be a frame of reference on the globe itself, a grid system that could be transferred to the ﬂ  at page. Any modern globe shows that system: a set of horizontal lines, usually at 10-degree intervals north and south from the equator, called parallels, and another set of vertical lines, converging on the poles, often shown at 15-degree inter-vals and called meridians (see box, “Numbering the Grid Lines”). On the spherical globe, parallels and meridians intersect at right angles (Fig. A.3).
Numbering the Grid Lines
When cartographers girdled the globe with their imagi-nary grid lines, they had to identify each line by number, that is, by degree. For the (horizontal) latitude lines, that was easy: the equator, which bisects the Earth midway between the poles, was designated as 0
/H11034 (zero degree) 
latitude, and all parallels north and south of the equator were designated by their angular position (Fig. A.3). The ⛪

parallel midway between the equator and the pole, thus, 
is 45/H11034 north latitude in the northern hemisphere and 45 /H11034 
south latitude in the southern hemisphere.
But the (vertical) longitude lines presented no such 
easy solution. Among the parallels, the equator is the only one to divide Earth into equal halves, but all meridians do this. During the second half of the nineteenth century, maps with conﬂ  icting numbers multiplied, and it was clear that a solution was needed. The most powerful country at the time was Britain, and in 1884, international agreement was reached whereby the meridian drawn through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, would be the prime meridian, 0
/H11034 (zero degree) longitude. All meridians east 
and west of the prime meridian could now be designated by number, from 0
/H11034 to 180 /H11034 east and west longitude.
But what happens when these lines of latitude (paral-
lels) and longitude (meridians) are drawn to intersect at right angles on a ﬂ  at piece of paper? At the equator, the 
representation of the real world is relatively accurate. But go toward the poles, and distortion grows with every de-gree until, in the northern and southern higher latitudes, the continents appear not only stretched out but also misshaped (Fig. A.4). Because the meridians cannot be made to converge in the polar areas, this projection makes Antarctica look like a giant, globe-girdling landmass.
Looking at this representation of the world, you might 
believe that it could serve no useful purpose. But in fact, the Mercator projection, invented in 1569 by Gerardus Mercator, a Flemish cartographer, had (and has) a very par-ticular function. Because parallels and meridians cross (as they do on the spherical globe’s grid) at right angles, direc-tion is true everywhere on this map. Thus the Mercator pro-jection enabled navigators to maintain an accurate course at sea simply by adhering to compass directions and plotting straight lines. It is used for that purpose to this day.
The spatial distortion of the Mercator projection 
serves to remind us that scale and projection are intercon-nected. What scale fraction or graphic scale bar could be used here? A scale that would be accurate at the equator on a Mercator map would be quite inaccurate at higher latitudes. So the distortion that is an inevitable byproduct of any map projection also affects map scales.
One might imagine that the spatial (areal) distor-
tion of the Mercator projection is so obvious that no one would use it to represent the world’s countries. But in fact, many popular atlas maps (Mercator also intro-duced the term atlas to describe a collection of maps) and wall maps still use a Mercator for such purposes. The National Geographic Society published its world maps on a Mercator projection until 1988, when it ﬁ  nally aban-
doned the practice in favor of a projection developed by the American cartographer Arthur Robinson (Fig. A.5). During the news conference at which the change was an-nounced, a questioner rose to pursue a point: Why had the Society waited so long to make this change? Was it because the distortion inherent in the Mercator projec-tion made American and European middle-latitude coun-tries large, compared to tropical countries in Africa and elsewhere? Although that was not the goal of the National Geographic Society, the questioner clearly understood the misleading subtleties inherent even in so apparently neutral a device as a map projection.
The Mercator projection is one of a group of pro-
jections called cylindrical projections. Imagine the globe’s lines of latitude and longitude represented by a wire grid, at the center of which we place a bright light. Wrap a piece of photographic paper around the wire grid, extending it well beyond the north and south poles, ﬂ  ash the bulb, and the photographic image will be that of a Mercator pro-jection (Fig. A.6). We could do the same after placing a cone-shaped of paper over each hemisphere, touching the grid, say, at the 40th parallel north and south; the result would be a conic projection (Fig. A.7). If we wanted a map of North America or Europe, a form of conic projection would be appropriate. Now the meridians do approach each other toward the poles (unlike the Mercator projec-tion), and there is much less shape and size distortion. And if we needed a map of Arctic and Antarctic regions, we would place the photographic paper as a ﬂ  at sheet against the North and South Poles. Now the photographic image would show a set of diverging lines, as the meridians do from each pole, and the parallels would appear as circles (Fig. A.8). Such a planar projection is a good choice for a map of the Arctic Ocean or the Antarctic continent.
Projections are chosen for various purposes. Just as the 
Mercator is appropriate for navigation because direction is true, other projections are designed to preserve areal size, keep distances real, or maintain the outlines (shapes) of land-masses and countries. Projections can be manipulated for many needs. In this book, we examine global distributions of

various phenomena. The world map that forms the base for 
these displays is one that is designed to give prominence to land areas at the expense of the oceans. This is achieved by “interrupting” the projection where loss of territory (in this case water area) is not problematic.
When a map is planned, therefore, the choice of 
projection is an important part of the process. An inap-propriate selection may weaken the effectiveness of a map and may lead to erroneous interpretations. Of course, the problem diminishes when the area to be mapped is smaller and the scale larger. We may consider various alternatives when it comes to a map of all of North America, but a map of a single State presents far fewer potential problems of distortion. And for a city map—even of a large city such as Chicago—the projection problem virtually disappears.
The old problem of how to represent the round Earth 
on a ﬂ  at surface has been attacked for centuries, and there is no single best solution. What has been learned in the pro-cess, however, will be useful in ﬁ  elds of endeavor other than Earthly geography. In the age of planetary exploration, space probes send back images of the surfaces of the Moon, Mars, Jupiter, and other components of our solar system, and we will have to agree once again on grids, equators, and prime meridians to map these bodies. What has been learned in our efforts to map and represent the Earth will be useful in depicting the universe beyond. Figure A.4
Mercator’s Projection greatly exaggerates the size and shape of higher-latitude landmasses, 
but direction is true everywhere on this map. In this Mercator map of the world, Africa and Greenland look to be about the same size, but in reality, Africa is 14 times larger than Greenland.160°E 0° 20°W 40°W 60°W 80°W 100°W 120°W 140°W 160°W 140°E 120°E 100°E 80°E 60°E 40°E 20°E

SYMBOLS ON MAPS
The third fundamental property of a map is its sym-
bolization. Maps represent the real world, and this can be 
done only through the use of symbols. Anyone who has used an atlas map is familiar with some of these symbols: prominent dots (perhaps black or red) for cities; a large dot with a circle around it, or a star, for capitals; red lines for roads, double lines for four-lane highways, black lines for railroads; and patterns or colors for areas of water, forest, or farmland. Notice that these symbols respectively represent points, lines, and areas on the ground. For our purposes, we need not go further into map symbolization, which can become a very complex topic when it comes to highly

 specialized cartography in such ﬁ  elds as geology and me-
teorology. Nevertheless, it is useful to know why symbols such as those used on the maps in this book were chosen.
Point symbols, as we noted, are used to show individ-
ual features or places. On a large-scale map of a city, dots can represent individual houses or locations of businesses. A dot map shows a spatial distribution, such as the distribution of Starbucks coffee shops in Washington, D.C. (Fig. A.9).

A July 2005 story in the Washington Post reported a corre-
lation between income and Starbucks locations in the city. Starbucks are clustered around federal and corporate build-ings downtown and in northwest neighborhoods, where  incomes are higher (see Fig. 1.17). Lower income neighbor-
hoods in southeast D.C. have few Starbucks retail outlets. 
Line symbols include not only roads and railroads, 
but also political and administrative boundaries, rivers, and other linear features. Again scale plays a crucial role: on a large-scale map, it is possible to represent the fenced boundaries of a single farm, but on a small-scale map, such detail cannot be shown.
Some lines on maps do not actually exist on the 
ground. When physical geographers do their ﬁ  eld work 
they use contour maps, lines that represent a certain con-sistent height above mean sea level (Fig. A.10). All points  Figure A.9

tions of Starbucks stores in the Washington, D.C. area. Data from: Map Muse, Inc, 2011.

on such a contour line thus are at the same elevation. The 
spacing between contour lines immediately reveals the nature of the local topography (the natural land surface). When the contour lines at a given interval (e.g., 100 feet) are spaced closely together, the slope of the ground is steep. When they are widely separated, the land surface slopes gently. Of course contour lines cannot be found in the real world, and neither can the lines drawn on the weather maps in our daily newspaper. These lines connect points of equal pressure (isobars) and temperature (iso-therms) and show the development of weather systems. Note that the letters iso (meaning “the same”) appear in these terms. Invisible lines of this kind are collectively known as isolines, lines of equal or constant value. These are abstract constructions, but they can be of great value in geographic research and representation.
Area symbols take many forms, and we will see some 
of them on the maps in this book. Area symbols are used in various ways to represent distributions and magni-tudes. Maps showing distributions (of such phenomena as regionally dominant languages or religions in human geography, and climates or soils in physical geography) show the world, or parts of it, divided into areas shaded or colored in contrasting hues. But be careful: those sharp dividing lines are likely to be transition zones in the real world, and a dominant language or religion does not imply the exclusion of all others. So distribution maps, and there are many in this book, tend to be small-scale generalizations of much more complex patterns than they can reveal. Maps showing magnitudes also must be read with care. Here the objective is to reveal how much of a phenomenon prevails in one unit (e.g., country) on the map, compared to others. The maps on population in chapter 2 are examples of such maps. The important cartographic decision has to do with color. Darker should mean more, and lighter implies less. That is relatively easily done when the dominant color is the same. But on a multicolored map, the use of reds, greens, and yellows can be confusing, and ﬁ  rst impressions may have to be 
revised upon examination of the key.
Some students who are ﬁ  rst drawn to the discipline 
of geography go on to become professional cartographers, and their work is seen in atlases, newspapers, magazines, books, websites, and many other venues.  Figure A.10

A-17the GNI, that is, the Gross National Income per person 
and what this would buy in each country. In the language 
of economic geographers, this is called the GNI-PPP , the per-capita Gross National Income in terms of its Purchasing Power Parity.
Indexes that may not be immediately obvious to you 
include Arithmetic Population Density, the number of 
people per square kilometer in each country; Physiologic 
Population Density, the number of people per square kilometer of agriculturally productive land; Birth and Death Rates per thousand in the population, resulting in the national population’s rate of Natural Increase; a pop-ulation’s Infant Mortality, the number of deaths per 
thousand in the ﬁ  rst year of life, thus largely reﬂ  ecting the 
number of deaths at birth; Child Mortality, the deaths per thousand of children in their ﬁ  rst ﬁ ve years; the Cor-
ruption Index, based on T ransparency International data in which 10.0 is perfect and 0.1 is the worst; the Big Mac 
Price index, which tells you why Argentina in 2011 was the best place to buy a hamburger in U.S. dollars; and the Per Capita GNI ($U.S.), the GNI-PPP index referred 
to above, which tells you how spendable income varies around the globe. For additional details on sources and 
data, please consult the Data Sources section of the Preface.This Data T able is a valuable resource, and should be consulted throughout your reading. Like all else in this book, this table is subject to continuous revision and modiﬁ  cation. Compared to previous editions, we have 
deleted some indices, elaborated others, and introduced new ones. For example, in a world with ever-slower pop-ulation growth, the so-called Doubling Time index—the number of years it will take for a population to double in size based on its current rate of natural increase—has lost most of its utility. On the other hand, when it comes to Life Expectancy  and Literacy , general averages con-
ceal signiﬁ  cant differences between male and female 
rates, which in turn reﬂ  ect conditions in individual coun-tries, so we report these by gender. Also in this edition, we continue to use the Corruption Index , not available 
for all countries but an important reﬂ  ection of a global 
problem. The Big Mac Price index, a measure intro-duced by the journal The Economist, tells you much more than what a hamburger with all the trimmings would cost in real dollars in various countries of the world—it also reﬂ  ects whether those countries’ curren-cies are overvalued or undervalued. And the ﬁ  nal col-
umn, in which we formerly used to reported the per-capita GNP (Gross National Product), now reveals BMappB.indd Page A-17  9/30/11  1:41 PM user f-400BMappB.indd Page A-17  9/30/11  1:41 PM user f-400 F-400F-400
A-18  Ability     In the context of political power, the capacity of a state to   inﬂ u-
ence other states or achieve its goals through diplomatic, economic, and 
militaristic means.  
  Absolute location     The position or place of a certain item on the 
  surface of the Earth as expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds of 
  latitude  , 0° to 90° north or south of the equator, and   longitude  , 0° to 
180° east or west of the   Prime Meridian   passing through Greenwich, 
England (a suburb of London).  
  Accessibility     The degree of ease with which it is possible to reach a 
certain location from other locations. A  c  cessibility varies from place to 
place and can be measured.  
  Acid rain     A growing environmental peril whereby acidiﬁ  ed rainwater 
severely damages plant and animal life; caused by the oxides of sulfur and 
nitrogen that are released into the atmosphere when coal, oil, and natu-ral gas are burned, especially in major manufacturing zones.  
  Acropolis     Literally “high point of the city.” The upper fortiﬁ  ed part of 
an ancient Greek city, usually devoted to religious purposes.  
  Activity (action) space     The space within which daily activity occurs.  
  Agglomeration     A process involving the clustering or concentrating of 
people or activities. The term often refers to manufacturing plants and 
businesses that beneﬁ  t from close proximity because they share skilled-labor pools and technological and ﬁ  nancial amenities.  
  Aging index   the number of people aged 65 years and older per 100 
children aged zero to 14 years in a given population.  
  Agora     In ancient Greece, public spaces where citizens debated, lectured,

array of goods and services that support the agriculture industry.  
  Agricultural surplus     One of two components, together with   social 
stratiﬁ  cation  , that enable the formation of   cities  ; agricultural produc-
tion in excess of that which the producer needs for his or her own   suste-
nance and that of his or her family and which is then sold for consumption 
by others.  
  Agricultural village     A relatively small, egalitarian village, where most 
of the population was involved in a  g  riculture. Starting over 10,000 years 
ago, people began to cluster in agricultural villages as they stayed in one 
place to tend their crops.  
  Agriculture     The purposeful tending of crops and livestock in order to 
produce food and ﬁ  ber.  
  AIDS (Acquired Immune Deﬁ  ciency Syndrome)     Immune system 
disease caused by the Human Immun  o  deﬁ ciency Virus (HIV) which 
over a period of years weakens the capacity of the immune system to ﬁ ght off infection so that weight loss and weakness set in and other   af-
ﬂ ictions such as cancer or pneumonia may ha  s  ten an infected person’s 
demise.  
  Animal domestication     Genetic modiﬁ  cation of an animal such that it 
is rendered more amenable to human control.

method or another.  
  Area     A term that refers to a part of the Earth’s surface with less speci-
ﬁ city than   region  . For example, “u  r  ban area” alludes very generally to a 
place where urban development has taken place, whereas “urban region” 
requires certain speciﬁ  c criteria on which a delimitation is based (e.g., the spatial extent of commuting or the built townscape).  
  Arithmetic population density     The population of a country or   re-
gion expressed as an average per unit area. The ﬁ  gure is derived by divid-
ing the population of the areal unit by the number of square   kilometers 
or miles that make up the unit.  
  Assimilation     The process through which people lose originally dif-
ferentiating traits, such as dress, speech particularities or mannerisms, 
when they come into contact with another society or culture. Often used to d  e  scribe immigrant adaptation to new places of residence.  
  Asylum     Shelter and protection in one state for refugees from another 
state.  
  Atmosphere     Blanket of gases surrounding the Earth and located 
some 350 miles above the Earth’s surface.  
  Authenticity     In the context of local cultures or customs, the accuracy 
with which a single stereotypical or typecast image or experience con-
veys an otherwise dynamic and complex local culture or its customs.

 Glossary  A-19
  Blockbusting     Rapid change in the racial composition of residential 
blocks in American cities that occurs when real estate agents and others 
stir up fears of neighborhood decline after encouraging people of color to move to previously white neighborhoods. In the resulting   outmigra-

  Boundary     Vertical plane between states that cuts through the rocks 
below, and the airspace above the surface.  
  Break-of-bulk point     A   location   along a transport route where goods

  Buddhism     Religion   founded in the sixth century BCE and charac-
terized by the belief that enlightenment would come through knowl-
edge, especially self-knowledge; elimination of greed, craving, and desire; complete honesty; and never hurting another person or animal. Buddhism splintered from   Hinduism   as a reaction to the strict social 
hierarchy maintained by Hinduism.  
  Cadastral map     A large-scale map, usually created at the scale of 1:2500,

  Chloroﬂ  uorocarbons (CFCs)     Synthetic organic compounds ﬁ  rst 
created in the 1950s and used primarily as refrigerants and as propel-
lants. The role of CFCs in the destruction of the ozone layer led to the signing of an international agreement (the   Montreal Protocol  ).  
  Christianity     Religion   based on the teachings of Jesus. According to 
Christian teaching, Jesus is the son of God, placed on Earth to teach 
people how to live according to God’s plan.    Chronic (or degenerative) diseases     Generally long-lasting afﬂ  ic-
tions now more common because of higher life expectancies.  
  City     Conglomeration of people and buildings clustered together to 
serve as a center of politics, culture, and economics.  
  Climatic regions     Areas of the world with similar climatic   characteristics.  
  Colonialism     Rule by an autonomous power over a subordinate and 
alien people and place. Although often established and maintained 
through political structures, colonialism also creates unequal cultural and economic relations. Because of the magnitude and impact of the European colonial project of the last few centuries, the term is generally understood to refer to that particular colonial endeavor.

  Commodity chain     Series of links connecting the many places of pro-
duction and distribution and resulting in a commodity that is then ex-
changed on the world market.  
  Complementarity     A condition that exists when two regions, through 
an exchange of raw materials and/or ﬁ  nished products, can speciﬁ  cally 
satisfy each other’s demands.  
  Community supported agriculture (CSA)   network between agri-
cultural producers and consumers whereby consumers pledge support 
to a farming operation in order to receive a share of the output from the farming o  p  eration.  
  Concentric zone model     A structural model of the American   central 
city   that suggests the existence of ﬁ  ve concentric land-use rings arranged

  Confucianism     A philosophy of ethics, education, and public service 
based on the writings of Confucius and traditionally thought of as one of 
the core elements of Chinese culture.  
  Connectivity     The degree of direct linkage between one particular lo-
cation and other locations in a transport network.  
  Conquest theory     One major theory of how   Proto-Indo-European   
diffused into Europe which holds that the early speakers of Proto-Indo-
European spread westward on horseback, overpowering earlier inhabit-ants and b  e  ginning the   diffusion   and differentiation of Indo-European 
tongues.  
  Contagious diffusion     The distance-controlled spreading of an idea, 
innovation, or some other item through a local population by contact 
from person to person—analogous to the communication of a conta-gious illness.

combination of what is happening at a variety of   scales   concurrently.  
  Core     Processes that incorporate higher levels of education, higher 
salaries, and more technology; generate more wealth than   periphery   
processes in the world-economy.  
  Core area     In geography, a term with several connotations. Core refers

  Roman Catholic Church     One of three major branches of 
  Christianity  , the Roman Catholic Church, together with the   Eastern 
Orthodox Church  , a second of the three major branches of Christianity, 
arose out of the div  i  sion of the Roman Empire by Emperor Diocletian
