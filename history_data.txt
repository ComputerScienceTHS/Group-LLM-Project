xlii WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONThe Agricultural Revolution
Around 10,000 years ago, or about 8000 B.C.E., the climate was warming 
from an Ice Age. As it did, humans began to plant crops and raise animals for 
food. This change, called the Agricultural Revolution , began in the Middle 
East. Because of this development, people began to produce a surplus of food. 
For the first time in human history, one part of the population produced enough 
food to feed everyone. This allowed part of the population to specialize in non-
food producing activities. This specialization change transformed every aspect 
of human life, causing innovations and trends that have existed ever since:
• The population grew. People lived in larger settlements that eventually 
developed into cities.
• People became highly skilled at one job. Artisans made tools and 
weapons. Merchants engaged in trade. Priests conducted rituals. 
• People developed new technology. They learned how to improve 
irrigation systems, make use of the wheel in transportation, and replace 
stone with metals such as bronze and iron for making tools and art.
• People created more extensive governments and taxation. The desire to 
keep records about trade and taxes led to the invention of writing.
• Competition for resources and the accumulation of wealth increased 
group conflicts. However, the development of government provided a 
more peaceful way to settle conflicts between individuals.
• People became more sharply divided into social classes by wealth and 
occupation. In general, the status of women declined. 
The First Civilizations
Trends that began to emerge after the Agricultural Revolution led to the first 
civilizations, large societies with cities and a powerful state. Most were in 
river valleys, places with fresh water and fertile land. 
Mesopotamia  The world’s first civilization was in Mesopotamia, a 
region around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is today Iraq. Several 
cultures emerged in this region, many based on city-states. A city-state  is an 
independent state made up of a city and its surrounding territory. All city-
states were highly patriarchal, built monumental architecture such as religious 
temples called ziggurats, and engaged in long-distance trade. The people were 
polytheistic, believing in many gods.
Sumer was a city-state along the southernmost region of ancient 
Mesopotamia. As taxes and trade became more complex, the Sumerians 
invented cuneiform, the first written language in history. They used cuneiform 
to record the first written laws.
Egypt  In the Nile River valley, Egypt prospered. Though it shared many 
traits with Mesopotamia, Egypt was highly centralized under one ruler, called 
a  pharaoh. The Egyptians developed their own writing system (hieroglyphics) 
xliii PROLOGUEand a complex system of mathematics. They built monumental architecture 
(pyramids) that demonstrated the pharaoh’s power. Egyptian women were 
allowed to own property, and they were recognized as legally equal to men in 
court. These rights gave women a higher social standing than their counterparts 
in other patriarchal civilizations.
Indus  Archaeological remains show the sophistication of ancient 
civilizations along the Indus River in South Asia. Cities such as Harappa and 
Mohenjo-Daro engaged in long-distance trade with Mesopotamia, practiced 
polytheism, developed technology such as indoor plumbing, and planned the 
layout of urban areas. However, no one has deciphered their language, so less 
is known about them than about other early civilizations. 
China  Along the Huang He River in northern China, a highly patriarchal 
and centralized system developed. One of its distinctive features was the 
special honor that its people gave to their ancestors. 
Non-River Valley Civilizations  Two early civilizations in the Americas 
did not develop in river valleys. The Olmec in Mesoamerica and the Chavin in 
the Andes were complex societies that participated in extensive trade.

reflected the power of early governments to organize workers to build large structures.

xliv WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONHinduism and Judaism 
At the same time that cities were growing, people began developing new ideas 
about religion. In animism, most deities were identified with specific places. 
Over time, people developed more abstract beliefs in which deities were not 
fixed in location. As people moved, they could take their deities with them. In 
some places, belief in many gods (polytheism) was replaced with a belief in 
just one supreme deity, monotheism.
Hinduism  The belief now called Hinduism  is sometimes categorized 
as polytheistic and sometimes as monotheistic. The origins of Hinduism go 
back at least 3,500 years. People called Aryans from north of the Himalaya 
Mountains migrated south to what is now Pakistan and India. They spoke an 
Indo-European language, and they brought with them scriptures called the 
Vedas and a belief that many deities existed. However, over time, people came 
to regard all deities as the expression of one supreme deity. 
The Vedas taught that the soul of a person is reborn, or reincarnated, 
many times. Eventually, a soul would spiritually advance enough to become 
liberated from this cycle of death and rebirth. The Vedas taught that people 
should organize society into sharply defined classes, called castes. The 
caste system prohibited social mobility. While the caste system kept society 
stratified, society was also unified. 
Zoroastrianism  A clear example of an early form of monotheism is 
Zoroastrianism. This belief system developed in Persia. Followers of this faith 
focus on human free will and the eternal battle between the forces of good and 
evil.
Judaism  The most influential example of monotheism is Judaism . Its 
earliest adherents were known as Hebrews or Israelites, but they have long 
been called Jews. Judaism developed in and around what is now the state of 
Israel. The Jewish people trace their history to the teachings of Abraham, who 
lived about 4,000 years ago. 
Jews believe that they have entered into a covenant, or mutual promise, 
with their God, whom they call Yahweh. In return for their devotion, Yahweh 
would consider them his chosen people. Judaism was further developed with 
the codification of Hebrew Scriptures, sometimes called the Old Testament. 
Like Judaism, two other faiths—Christianity and Islam—are also 
monotheistic religions that looked back to Abraham as an important figure. 
Christianity and Islam will be discussed later in this Prologue. 
xlv PROLOGUEPart 2:  The Classical Era, c. 600 B.C.E.  
to c. 600 C.E. 
Several great empires that arose between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E. became the 
core foundations of later civilizations in their region: 
• western Eurasia: the Persian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine empires
• southern Asia: the Mauryan and Gupta empires 
• eastern Asia: the Qin and Han dynasties
• Mesoamerica: the Mayan Empire
These empires provided political and economic security for their people. 
Goods and ideas flowed along land routes such as the ones in Eurasia known 
as the Silk Roads and maritime routes in the Mediterranean Sea and Indian 
Ocean. These trade routes fostered the development of such great cities as 
Rome (Italy), Constantinople (Turkey), Damascus (Syria), Pataliputra (India), 
and Chang’an (China).

Buddhism and Developments in South Asia
While intense spirituality and distinct social organization have provided 
continuity in South Asian history, strong political centralization has not. The 
region was unified under a single government only twice during the Classical 
Period. The most influential development in South Asia was the development 
of the religion of Buddhism.
xlvi WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONBeginning of Buddhism  The founder of Buddhism  was Siddhartha 
Gautama. Born into a wealthy Hindu family around 530 B.C.E., he became 
sharply aware of all the suffering people endured. To understand why people 
suffered, he left his wealthy family and pursued a life of poverty and meditation. 
According to Buddhist traditions, Siddhartha had been meditating for several 
days underneath a bodhi tree when he finally understood the cause of suffering 
and how to end it. He called himself the Buddha or “enlightened one,” and 
sought to teach others what he had come to understand. 
Buddhist doctrines became summarized in the Four Noble Truths, which 
sought to eliminate desire and suffering by following the Eightfold Path. This 
path requires an individual to meditate, reflect, and refrain from excessive 
earthly pleasures. The goal is, over time, to achieve enlightenment and the 
peaceful bliss known as nirvana, which would end the cycle of reincarnation. 
The Spread of Buddhism  Buddhism provided an alternative to the Vedic 
beliefs that were the foundation of Hinduism. Because Buddhism rejected 
the caste system, it became popular with members of the lower caste. It 
spread quickly throughout India and across Asia. Those spreading it included 
missionaries and merchants along the Silk Roads and around the Indian Ocean. 
Unlike Hinduism and Judaism, which remained the faiths of particular 
groups of people in particular places, Buddhism was a universalizing religion, 
one that actively sought converts among all people. Buddhism is also a 
monastic faith, one that develops monastery communities for men and women.
The Mauryan Empire  The first period of unity in South Asia was under 
the Mauryan Empire  (322 B.C.E.–187 B.C.E.) It reached its high point 
during the rule of Ashoka. He promoted prosperity by creating an efficient 
tax system and by building roads that connected commercial centers. Ashoka 
spread knowledge of the law by inscribing his edicts on pillars throughout the 
empire. 
Ashoka is one of the few powerful rulers in history who converted from 
one faith—Hinduism—to another. He became a Buddhist. His conversion 
helped spread the faith throughout India. After Ashoka, the Mauryan Empire 
soon declined in power, resulting in political decentralization.
The Gupta Empire  The second period of unity in South Asia was under  
the Gupta Empire . It ruled from c. 320 C.E. to c. 550 C.E. (C.E. stands 
for Common Era, sometimes called A.D.; c. stands for circa  and means 
approximately). This period is referred to as the Golden Age of India. Under 
a centralized government based in Pataliputra, a city in northwestern India, 
intellectual and cultural life flourished. In public hospitals, physicians 
made advances in medicine, such as using inoculations to prevent disease. 
Mathematicians developed a numbering system that combined a small number 
of symbols, 0 through 9, and the idea of place value. The system was so 
efficient that it is used throughout most of the world today. 
The social structure in the Gupta era was patriarchal. Men held most 
positions of power in public life. To unify people, the Gupta strongly supported 
Hinduism. Hinduism is the most common religion in India today.
xlvii PROLOGUEConfucianism and Developments in East Asia
Central China was united under the Zhou Dynasty (1076 B.C.E.–256 B.C.E.). 
However, as the dynasty weakened, China suffered a time of instability and 
decentralization referred to as the Warring States period.
Mandate of Heaven  One legacy of the Zhou Dynasty in China was in 
how people thought about government. This was the concept of a Mandate 
of Heaven,  the idea that “heaven,” or some universal force, provided the 
justification for an emperor and his family to rule China. If the ruler was corrupt 
or ineffective, “heaven” would show its displeasure in the form of natural 
disasters. These disasters, such as drought or famine, were a sign to the Chinese 
people that the ruler had lost the Mandate of Heaven. Several major peasant 
uprisings in China were a direct result in this belief.
Confucianism  During the Warring States period, around 551 B.C.E., the 
philosopher K’ung Fu-tzu, whose westernized name is Confucius , was born. He 
lived around the same time as the Buddha in India. The teachings of Confucius, 
written down by his followers in the Analects , describe how people should 
behave in everyday life. Unlike the teachings of Hinduism and Judaism, the 
Analects  do not focus on any deity. Rather, Confucius focused on education, 
benevolence, virtue, respect for those with authority (especially the emperor), 
and a patriarchal social structure. He emphasized filial piety, the duty of people 
to honor their ancestors. The teachings of Confucius affected Chinese beliefs 
and values more than any other philosophy. 
Daoism  A second response to the chaos of the Warring States period was 
Daoism. While Confucianism focused on how people could live in harmony 
with one another, Daoism  focused on how people could live in harmony with 
nature. The practices of Daoism emphasized internal reflection more than 
external behavior. Daoism would be influential throughout Chinese history.
The Qin and Han Dynasties  China regained stability when the Qin  
Dynasty  (221 B.C.E.–207 B.C.E.) and Han Dynasty  (206 B.C.E.–220 C.E.) 
established centralized control. The Qin standardized Chinese script, established 
a uniform system of weights and measures, and built canals and roads. Together, 
these changes provided the foundation for increased trade and prosperity.
Building on the accomplishments of the Qin, the Han Dynasty became a 
Golden Age of Chinese history. Under the Han, China was more peaceful and 
its population grew. Chinese science and technology prospered, producing such 
developments as the magnetic compass, paper, and the sternpost rudder. Under 
Han regulation, trade extended from Chang’an, the capital of the empire, west 
to the Mediterranean Sea. Most of the trade was in luxury items such as spices, 
gems, precious metals, tea, and, most famously, silk.
The Han transformed China’s government by creating a civil service exam . 
It required students to analyze Confucian teachings. Those who scored well 
received prestigious jobs in the government bureaucracy. This system produced 
a government of well-educated individuals and allowed for some social mobility. 
xlviii WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONCivilizations of Western Eurasia and Christianity
In western Eurasia between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E., strong civilizations 
developed in Persia, Greece, and Rome. Trade, war, and the flow of ideas 
connected these civilizations to one another. Each civilization prospered 
through a combination of trade and military strength.
Persia  Around 559 B.C.E., a large empire developed in Persia (modern-
day Iran) under the leadership of Cyrus the Great. The Persian Empire  
included most of the lands from the Aegean Sea in the west to the border of 
India in the east. The empire also became known as the Achaemenid Empire. 
With a strong centralized government, efficient bureaucracy, and network 
of roads, the Persian empire promoted trade, prosperity, and stability. The 
vast empire was ethnically and religiously diverse, which the government 
recognized by practicing religious toleration. 
Greece  While Persia was a vast but united empire, Greece was divided 
into approximately 1,000 city-states. The numerous islands and mountainous 
terrain made unifying the Grecian region under one leader very difficult. 
One cultural trait shared by Greeks was religion. Unlike the monotheistic 
Hebrews who worshipped a single all-powerful God, the Greeks believed in 
many deities and each possessed human frailties. These frailties help explain 
why Greeks developed a feeling that they controlled their own destiny.
Two of the largest city-states, Athens and Sparta, reflected the great variety 
among Greece’s many city-states. 
• Spartans organized their society around a powerful military. Women, 
the elderly, and enslaved people all filled roles that allowed free men to 
train as soldiers and fight when needed. 
• Athenians made impressive advances in architecture, literature, theater, 
and philosophy. Many of these came during its Golden Age in the 
late 400s B.C.E. Athens also developed the concept of democracy , a 
system of government in which a large part of the population runs the 
government. Athens allowed free adult males the ability to participate 
directly in making political decisions. 
In the 300s B.C.E., the army of Alexander the Great spread Greek culture 
into Egypt, across Persia, and east to India. This region became known as the 
Hellenistic world. 
Rome  According to legend, Rome was founded in 753 B.C.E. Roman 
culture borrowed heavily from the Greeks. The Romans incorporated the 
Greek gods into their pantheon of deities, relied on slavery, and made advances 
in government that continue to have lasting influence on governments today. 
Romans developed the practice of a representative government and of the 
judicial concept “innocent until proven guilty.” To protect individual rights, 
the Romans publicly displayed written laws known as the Twelve Tables. 
Spreading awareness of laws provided a check on abuses of government 
power, a concept that would be built into numerous constitutions in the future.
xlix PROLOGUELike Greece, Rome had a patriarchal society. However, compared to 
Greek women, Roman women gained more rights, including the right to own 
and inherit property and the right to initiate divorce proceedings. 
While the Greek city-states remained small, Rome expanded outward 
in all directions, turning the Mediterranean Sea into “a Roman lake.” At the 
peak of its power, the Roman Empire ruled territory from Scotland to northern 
Africa to the Middle East. In the large size of its territory, Rome was more like 
Persia. Both Rome and Persia were land-based empires under a strong central 
government. Both fostered trade and prosperity with well-maintained roads 
and strong militaries to protect travelers. Rome was also famous for other 
publicly funded projects, such as aqueducts, which were systems to transport 
water to cities, and large stadiums for public entertainment. 
Despite Rome’s wealth and power, it faced many challenges. Roman 
leaders over-extended the Roman military, were often corrupt, and failed to 
deal with devastating epidemics caused by smallpox and the bubonic plague. 
Gradually, trade and urban populations declined. As a result, Roman lands 
suffered economically. Rome’s decline was made worse by invasions from 
groups such as the Huns, Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and Vandals. By 476 C.E., the 
empire was so weak that a non-Roman became emperor for the first time in 
more than a thousand years.   
The Development of Christianity  Rome’s most enduring legacy was 
not in its military or its engineering achievements. It was in religion. Rome 
generally tolerated all faiths as long as subjects agreed to accept the divine 
nature of the emperor. People with polytheistic beliefs could do this easily.

l WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONHowever, monotheists could not. In particular, Jews living the Middle East 
refused to recognize any deity but their own. Roman persecution of Jews 
living in the Middle East contributed to the diaspora,  or spreading, of Jews 
to lands throughout northern Africa and Europe as they looked for places to 
worship freely.
One leader who emerged from the Jewish community was Jesus. For 
his teachings, he was executed by the Romans. Since the followers of his 
teachings considered him the Christ, or savior of humanity sent by God, they 
became known as Christians. Despite persecution by the Romans, Jesus’s 
disciples continued to spread his teachings. By the end of the 1st century C.E., 
Christians were practicing their faith throughout the empire. 
This new faith was particularly attractive to the poor because it taught that 
people could have a better life after death if they believed in Jesus. Despite 
continued persecution, Christianity  grew stronger. In the 4th century, under 
the emperor Constantine, Christianity became legal and was accepted as the 
official religion of the empire. 
Constantine’s endorsement of Christianity accelerated its growth. Like 
Buddhism, Christianity was a universalizing religion, meaning it actively 
sought converts and it was easily adaptable to areas outside its place of origin. 
It also offered monastic lifestyles for men (monks) and women (nuns) to 
devote their lives to practicing the faith. This new monotheistic faith would 
have far-reaching impact on future civilizations. 
Byzantine  By the middle of the 4th century, the eastern half of the Roman 
Empire had become wealthier and politically more powerful than the western 
half. For this reason, in 330, Emperor Constantine moved the capital of the 
empire eastward to Byzantium and renamed the city Constantinople (Istanbul 
today). In 395, the Roman Empire  was divided into two distinct entities. 
Rome became the capital in the west, and Constantinople became the capital 
in the east. 
Constantinople quickly became a political and economic hub. Geography 
aided its rise to prominence as rivers from the north flowed into the nearby 
Mediterranean and Black seas. As an entrep ôt, or coastal trading center , 
Constantinople prospered  as raw goods arrived from northern Europe, cereals 
came from Egypt, and precious spices and finished products came from the 
east. 
At its height, the Byzantine Empire  extended throughout the eastern 
half of the Mediterranean world. The reign of Justinian the Great (527–565) 
included great accomplishments. One was the construction of a magnificent 
church called Hagia Sophia (537). Another was the creation of the Justinian 
Code. This consolidation of Roman law would serve as the foundation of legal 
knowledge in Europe into the 19th century. Though constantly threatened by 
foreign incursion, the Byzantine Empire would survive for another 900 years.

Early American Civilizations
Afro-Eurasian civilizations developed in isolation from American civilizations 
during the classical era. Two of the most important were in Mesoamerica, the 
region that is now Mexico and Central America.
Teotihuacan  One of the most important civilizations in the Americas was 
based in the city of Teotihuacan , located near modern-day Mexico City. It 
was a multicultural urban area that prospered through regional trade. By the 
6th century C.E., its population of 125,000 made it one of the largest cities 
in the world. Teotihuacan featured streets laid out on a grid and monumental 
religious temples dedicated to the gods of the sun and moon. The city was 
abandoned by 650, but the “city of the gods” as it was called, would later 
influence other powerful civilization such as the Aztecs. 
The Mayans  South of Teotihuacan lived the Mayans . They were the most 
influential classical civilization in the Americas. The Mayans can be traced as 
far back as 1500 B.C.E. They reached their height of population and wealth 
between 250 C.E. and 900 C.E. The Mayans developed the most complex 
written language in the Americas before contact with people from Europe. 
Mayan priests created a very accurate calendar, a sign that they studied and 
understood the movement of Earth through space. Mayans understood the 
importance of the concept of zero, something people in the Mediterranean 
world had not grasped in this period. 
lii WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONComparisons in the Classical Age
The  empires that emerged between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E. shared several 
traits in economics and politics. In general, increased trade, technological 
innovation, and centralized government worked together to make the lives of 
people longer, safer, and more comfortable. In general, the empires also shared 
similar reasons for their decline. 
Early Trade Networks  As technological developments made trade easier, 
strong and stable governments provided the wealth and security to foster and 
sponsor trade. The Eurasian exchange networks utilized the strength of the 
Roman and Han innovations, such as stirrups that made riding horses easier 
and networks of places to rest and eat that made long journey travel more 
dependable.  
Other key technologies included the improvements in sail design and ship 
hulls that enabled ships to maneuver in less than favorable wind conditions. 
The knowledge of monsoon winds facilitated trade along the entrepôts in the 
Indian Ocean. The improvements to the camel saddle made caravan trade 
profitable and possible across the Sahara. 
The Mediterranean Sea lanes continued to facilitate cultural exchange and 
goods between the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, and people of North Africa. 
Long-distance trade was only beginning to hit its stride. These developments 
ushered in the first Golden Age of the Silk Roads.
Decline of Classical Empires  By 600 C.E., many of the great classical 
empires were losing or had lost their unity and political power. As a result, 
people faced growing problems that they could not agree on how to address. 
Each unsolved problem then made peace and prosperity more precarious:
• challenges collecting taxes weakened government
• declines in trade decreased access to foreign goods and markets
• spread of disease reduced urban populations
• increases in the gap between the rich and poor created social conflict
• lack of broad support for leadership made solving problems harder
• attacks by outside groups led to a need for more spending on defense
In some areas, the spread of a common religion helped keep society unified 
even as a government failed. In later centuries, this unity would help new 
empires arise. For example, in Europe, the Roman Empire broke apart in the 
5th century, but Christianity held society together. Confucianism filled a similar 
role in China, while Hinduism and Buddhism did the same in South Asia.

c. 600–c. 1200
In many parts of the world, the decline of classical civilizations was marked 
by a century or more of declines in trade, intellectual innovation, and social 
stability. However, new centralized states that promoted peace and prosperity 
emerged to replace them. Throughout Afro-Eurasia, trade intensified after 
600 as networks of exchange widened and became more profitable. The Silk 
Roads, the Indian Ocean trade networks , and the trans-Saharan trade 
routes were brimming with items such as porcelain, ivory, teakwood, spices, 
and silk. These networks of exchange also provided ways for technology and 
ideas to move from one culture to another. More and more regions became 
familiar with the compass, the astrolabe, new forms of credit, paper money, 
and new religious beliefs. 
However, all of this exchange came with a high price. Deadly diseases 
also spread along these same pathways. 
Afro-Eurasia and the Americas remained separate, but people in 
Mesoamerica and the Andes Mountains experienced similar developments. 
The growth of more centralized states in each region also promoted trade and 
the spread of ideas.

At the beginning of the 7th century, the people of the Middle East were a 
mixture of animists, Zoroastrians, Jews, Christians, and others. A merchant 
named Muhammad living on the Arabian Peninsula believed that he had 
received revelations from God. These revelations were later recorded in the 
Quran, the sacred scriptures of the religion of Islam . Those who followed 
the teachings in the Quran became known as Muslims. They believed that 
Muhammad was last in a line of great prophets that included Abraham, Moses, 
and Jesus.  
The Teachings of Islam  The core principles of the Quran became known 
as the Five Pillars of Islam: a belief in one god called Allah, ritual prayer, 
almsgiving, fasting, and making a pilgrimage to Mecca. They evolved a law 
code based on the Quran, called sharia , to regulate Muslim religious and civic 
behavior. Unlike the laws of the Romans, sharia made no distinction between 
religious and civil law. 
Sunnis and Shi’as  Through Muhammad’s leadership, Islam quickly 
unified and brought peace to the warring tribes of the Arabian Peninsula. 
However, Islam experienced a crisis upon the death of Muhammad in 632. 
He had made no provision for a successor. People fell into two warring camps  
over who should become the political leader, called the caliph, of the Islamic 
community. This rift, which continues today, created a divide between the 
two major branches of Islam: Sunni and Shi’a. Sunni Muslims felt that the 
caliph could be selected from among all leaders in the Islamic community. 
lv PROLOGUEShi’a Muslims felt that the caliph should be a blood relative of Muhammad. 
Today, Sunnis form the majority of Muslims in the world. Shi’a Muslims are 
strongest in Iran and Iraq. 
Expansion of Islam  Despite this early division among Muslims, Islam 
spread rapidly. In less than a century, Islam had united southern Spain, North 
Africa, the Middle East, and parts of India. This area became known as the 
House of Islam, or Dar al-Islam . 
The Abbasids  The most influential rulers in Dar al-Islam were those of 
the Abbasid Caliphate  (750–1258). Under them, Islamic culture experienced  
a golden age. A stable government allowed trade to once again prosper. The 
Abbasids helped China, then under the Tang Dynasty, reestablish a booming 
trade along the Silk Roads. They also facilitated the growth of trans-Saharan 
trade to West Africa and were major participants in the diffusion of ideas and 
goods throughout the Indian Ocean. 
Islamic society, particularly in the capital in Baghdad, thrived under the 
Abbasids. The empire became a center of learning where people made advances 
in medicine, built astronomical observatories, developed algebra, improved the 
astrolabe, and preserved Greek and Roman texts. The government practiced a 
degree of religious toleration. Non-Muslims could keep their faith by paying 
an additional tax called the jizya . 
The Abbasids ended female infanticide and strengthened the marriage and 
property rights of women. The Abbasids continued to support the veiling of 
women and the right of a man to take up to four wives.

lvi WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONChina 
After the Han Dynasty declined in the 3rd century, China suffered three 
centuries of turmoil and disunity. However, after that, China experienced 
several centuries of growth.
Sui Dynasty  China’s period of troubles was ended by the short-lived 
Sui Dynasty  (581–618). By reconstituting a centralized government, the 
Sui provided the foundation on which China again became prosperous. The 
dynasty’s most dramatic accomplishment was the construction of the Grand 
Canal. Stretching over 1,000 miles, it connected the agricultural south to the 
population centers in the north. Besides fostering economic growth, the Grand 
Canal helped unify the varied ethnic and cultural groups of China.
Tang Dynasty  Building on the accomplishments of the Sui, the Tang 
Dynasty  (618–907) extended China’s boundaries north into Mongolia, 
west into Central Asia, and south into Vietnam. China’s population grew 
significantly under the Tang. Learning to grow a fast-ripening variety of rice 
allowed peasants to produce more calories per acre, so the land could support 
more people. 
The Tang expanded the civil service exam and the empire’s bureaucracy, 
which developed into an ongoing feature of the Chinese government. Under 
the Tang, the Chinese invented gunpowder and developed paper money,  
which facilitated trade. Political stability and steady demand for China’s silk, 
porcelain, and other goods ushered in a second golden age of the Silk Roads.

lvii PROLOGUEThe Chinese had long viewed their country as the “Middle Kingdom,” 
possibly because they believed they were at the center of cultural advances 
in the world.  Based on this viewpoint, they developed the tributary system, 
the idea that surrounding kingdoms should make payment, or tribute, to the 
Chinese and officially submit to their rule in exchange for trading privileges.
The strength of the Tang eventually declined. A combination of internal 
peasant uprisings and invasions from the west and north led to the downfall 
of the dynasty.
Song Dynasty  After the Tang collapsed, a new dynasty, the Song Dynasty 
(960 –1279), was able to restore order. Under the Song, China continued its 
golden age. Chinese meritocracy allowed for more upward mobility than any 
other hiring system of its time. China became the leading manufacturer in the 
world, producing iron, steel, silk, and porcelain, and it had the largest cities in 
the world. Neo-Confucianism, a melding of Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist 
philosophies that had begun under the Tang, became popular. It was during 
this time that paper money and the magnetic compass was exported from East 
Asia to other parts of the world. 
Japan
Between about 800 and 1200, Japan had its own golden age of achievements 
in painting and literature. Though influenced by China, Japan always had a 
separate and distinctive culture. However, by the end of this period, powerful 
clans of land-owning nobles were eroding the emperor’s power. As government 
became more decentralized, warfare between these clans increased. A strong 
political and social hierarchy developed over the control of land and included 
hierarchical obligations. At the top was the shogun , a military general, 
followed by powerful landlords called daimyos . Each daimyo had a force of 
warriors called samurais who pledged loyalty to serve him. Below the samurai 
were the peasants, followed by merchants. 
Culturally, Japan’s official religion was Shinto , a set of beliefs centered 
on the veneration of ancestors and nature spirits. However, missionaries from 
China and Korea brought Buddhism to the country, and it became popular at 
this time. Many Japanese adopted Buddhism yet keep their Shinto beliefs. 
Africa 
In most of sub-Saharan Africa between 600 and 1200, people often lived in 
small self-governing chiefdoms in which many people were related. These kin-
based communities often cooperated with one another and sometimes formed 
larger political units. While cultures were as diverse as the geography of the 
continent, similarities existed. Some similarities resulted from the migrations 
of Bantu-speaking people out of a region in west central Africa between  
c. 1000 B.C.E. and c. 1500 C.E. These migrating people spread a language, 
farming techniques, and knowledge of how to work with iron. 
lviii WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONBy 1000 C.E., complex agricultural practices such as irrigation and 
the allocation of land for people to cultivate demanded the development of 
more complex forms of government. With a stronger government came more 
control over production and distribution of surplus products. This government 
regulation, combined with the introduction of the camel and use of the camel 
saddle, led to long-distance trade across the Sahara. Muslim merchants greatly 
increased trade, which benefited the kingdom of Ghana  (c. 700–c. 1240). The 
trans-Saharan trade route allowed Ghana to become very wealthy. The rulers of 
Ghana protected these trade routes and taxed the gold and salt that continually 
entered or exited their trading centers. 
The development of trade also affected the religion of the people of West 
Africa. As Muslim merchants from North Africa traded in the region, they 
spread Islam. The region became part of Dar al-Islam. The legacy of this 
period can be seen today in the large number of Muslims in some countries. In 
Nigeria, about 50 percent of the population identifies as Muslim. In Mali, over 
90 percent do. 
On the east coast of Africa, merchants linked into the Indian Ocean trading 
network. Through it, Africans and people from the Middle East, South Asia, 
and Southeast Asia were all connected. African merchants exported gold, ivory, 
and enslaved people. They imported porcelain, silk, and spices. 
While governments were generally small and local in most of Africa, 
outside of West Africa, one large kingdom arose in the southeast part of the 
continent, Great Zimbabwe . It dominated the region between the 12th and 
15th centuries. The reasons Great Zimbabwe declined are not clear, though one 
reason was probably the reduced output of gold mines in the region.
South Asia and Southeast Asia
After the fall of the Gupta empire in 550, South Asia was riddled by disunity 
and fighting. Despite this decentralization, Hinduism and the caste system kept 
southern India unified and relatively stable. Northern India, however, suffered 
a series of invasions and weak confederations. One of those invasions brought 
Islam to the region in 711. 
Despite a period of divisions and conflict, South Asian trade flourished. As 
people better understood the pattern of the monsoon winds , India’s location 
made it the hub of Indian Ocean trade. Silks and porcelain from East Asia, 
spices from southeast Asia, horses from the Middle East, and enslaved people 
and ivory from Africa were all traded in India.
Religion and trade dominated South Asia’s influence on Southeast Asia. 
Buddhists and Hindus used trade networks to spread their religions’ teachings. 
Islam also significantly influenced Southeast Asia at this time. Muslim 
merchants, though often not consciously missionaries, spread their faith by 
settling in new regions with their families. Islam soon became the dominant 
religion in the Spice Islands and the Malay peninsula.

Europe
The Postclassical period saw a dramatic shift in Europe. The Eastern Roman 
Empire, based in Constantinople, flourished. In contrast, the decline of the 
Western Roman Empire left a power vacuum in the rest of the continent. 
Invasions of people from Northern Europe, known as the Vikings, brought 
another group of people into the cultural exchanges. Central and western 
Europe devolved into thousands of duchies and fiefdoms. As a result of the 
lack of strong central governments, Europe could not provide the protection 
and stability merchants desired. It did not benefit from long distance Afro-
Eurasian trade as much as other regions did. 
Just as Hinduism provided cultural unity to a politically divided South 
Asia, Christianity became the one unifying force in central and western Europe. 
In 800, the pope demonstrated his power and authority by bestowing on the 
French king, Charlemagne, the title of “Emperor of the Romans.” However, 
European Christian unity would not endure. In 1054, it split into two branches, 
the Roman Catholic Church in the west and the Orthodox Church  in the 
east.  
In 1095, the Roman Catholic pope called for a Holy Crusade to free 
Jerusalem and the lands around it from Islamic control. The early crusaders 
had some limited success. But after two centuries of trying, the crusades failed 
to seize power. However, they had a large impact culturally. The Crusades 
made Europeans more aware of the achievements of the Middle East and the 
rest of Asia. This awareness was one factor in stimulating Europe to become 
more interested in intellectual and technological advances. 
lx WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITION WORLD HISTORY MODERN: AP® EDITIONThe Americas
By the year 900, the Mayan golden age in Mesoamerica was ending. A 
combination of environmental degradation, drought, and warfare caused 
Mayans to abandon many of their cities. However, some Mayan cities, such as 
Chichen Itza, continued to be inhabited. 
Two other large civilizations developed in the Western Hemisphere during 
this time. One was the Mississippian  civilization, near present-day St. Louis. 
It flourished between the 8th century and the 16th century. Its city of Cahokia 
was a major trade hub with a population larger than that of London. 
The other was the Toltecs  civilization, which emerged in the 10th century 
in Mesoamerica. The Toltecs adopted many Mayan practices, including a 
religion that was both polytheistic and animistic. The Toltecs had a major 
influence on a later empire in the region, the Aztecs.

lxi PROLOGUEThe World in 1200
By 1200, much of the world had recovered from the decline of the classical 
civilizations. In many regions, new states were emerging that were promoting 
trade and the transfer of ideas among regions:
• Africa, Europe, and Asia were connected through Indian Ocean trade, 
the Silk Roads, and trans-Saharan trade routes.
• The Byzantine Empire and various Islamic empires provided some 
stability in the region from Eastern Europe through the Middle East to 
South Asia.
• China and Dar al-Islam continued to be leading centers of learning and 
innovation.
• Western Europe and Japan had decentralized systems of government 
that featured powerful land-owning nobles. 
• Africa largely remained stateless, except for some regions in West 
Africa and East Africa that were part of Dar al-Islam.
• Afro-Eurasia, America, and Oceania were developing in isolation from 
each other.
In 1200, people in Africa and Eurasia might have predicted that in the next 
three centuries, the regions of the world would remain on their paths. China 
would grow wealthier, Islamic states would become stronger, and Europe 
would continue to learn from other regions. However, few could have guessed 
that in the 13th century a little-known group of nomads from Central Asia 
would upend life in Eurasia. Then, in 1492, a voyage by a European would 
reshape the lives of people around the world.

Understand the Context
Between 1200 and 1450, several large empires emerged around the world. Some 
were modified revivals of earlier empires in their region. Others represented 
new developments. All were shaped by the context of regional trade, which had 
been increasing since around 600. 
The Revival of Large Empires  Between 1200 and 1450, the wealthiest 
and most innovative empire in the world was the Song Dynasty in China. It 
was the latest in a series of states that had ruled a unified and prosperous China. 
Similarly, in Mesoamerica, the rise of the Aztec was influenced by an earlier 
empire under the Mayans. Two other centers of great intellectual achievement, 
Baghdad and Spain, reflected the emphasis on learning in the Islamic world. 
However, in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, the growth of regional 
trade produced larger and more complex states than had previously existed in 
those regions. Trade across the Sahara resulted in the West African empires of 
Ghana and Mali. Trade in the Indian Ocean provided the context for large states 
in =imbabwe in East Africa and various states in India and Southeast Asia.
Unity in Central Eurasia  Shaping the context for events throughout 
Eurasia between 1200 and 150 was the remarkable emergence of the 
Mongols. A group of nomads from Central Asia, the Mongols conquered lands 
from central Europe to the Pacific Ocean, creating the largest land empire in 
human history. The conquest came with great devastation. However, the unity 
of so much territory under the rule of one group allowed trade to flourish once 
again across Eurasia, with new ideas and technology spreading easily. These 
developments set the stage for the intensifying  global interactions that helped 
define the period after 150.

DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIA 3
1.1
Developments in East Asia
From now on, our ordinances will be properly enforced  
and the morality of our people will be restored. 
—Ming Dynasty “Prohibition Ordinance” (1368–1644)
Essential Question:   How did developments in China and the rest of East 
Asia between c. 1200 and c. 1450 reflect continuity, 
innovation, and diversity? 
The Song Dynasty in China 60±12 was the leading example of diversity 
and innovation in Afro-Eurasia and the Americas during the 1th century. 
China enjoyed great wealth, political stability, and fine artistic and intellectual 
achievements. Neo-Confucian teachings, illustrated in the above quotation, 
supported the government and shaped social classes and the family system. 
In addition, China developed the greatest manufacturing capability in the 
world. However, the spread of Confucianism and Buddhism might be the most 
enduring testimony to Chinese influence. 
Government Developments in the Song Dynasty
The Song Dynasty  replaced the Tang in 60 and ruled for more than three 
centuries. They lost control of northern lands to invading pastoralists from 
Manchuria who set up the Jin Empire. Although the Song ruled a smaller region 
than the Tang, their reign was prosperous and under them the arts flourished.
Bureaucracy  China’s strength was partially the result of its imperial 
bureaucracy , a vast organization in which appointed officials carried 
out the empire’s policies. The bureaucracy had been a feature of Chinese  
government since the Qin dynasty (221 B.C.E.–207 B.C.E.). It represented a 
continuity across centuries and dynasties. Under the Song, China’s bureaucracy 
expanded. Early in the dynasty, this strengthened the dynasty.
Meritocracy and the Civil Service Exam  One of Emperor Song Taizu’s 
great achievements was that he expanded the educational opportunities to 
young men of the lower economic classes so they could score well on the civil 
service exams. By scoring well, a young man could obtain a highly desired job 
in the bureaucracy. These exams were based on knowledge of Confucian texts. 
Because officials obtained their positions by demonstrating their merit on these 
exams, China’s bureaucratic system was known as a meritocracy . Though 
4 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONthe poor were vastly underrepresented in the bureaucracy, the Chinese system 
allowed for more upward mobility than any other hiring system of its time. 
However, by the end of the Song, the bureaucracy had grown so large that it 
contributed to the empire’s weakness. By creating so many jobs and by paying 
these officials so handsomely, the Song increased the costs of government to 
the point that they began drying up China’s surplus wealth. 
Economic Developments in Postclassical China
The flourishing Tang Dynasty had successfully promoted agricultural 
development, improved roads and canals, encouraged foreign trade, and spread 
technology. These accomplishments led to rapid prosperity and population 
growth during the Song Dynasty. The Grand Canal  was an inexpensive and 
efficient internal waterway transportation system that extended over 0,000 
miles. Expanding the canal enabled China, under the Song Dynasty, to become 
the most populous trading area in the world. 
Gunpowder  Although gunpowder had been invented in China in previous 
dynasties, innovators in the Song Dynasty made the first guns. Over centuries, 
the technology of making gunpowder and guns spread from China to all parts 
of Eurasia via traders on the Silk Roads.

5 DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIA 5.ingdom in present-day 9ietnam, greatly expanded agricultural production in 
China. This rice and other strains developed through experimentation allowed 
farming to spread to lands where once rice could not grow, such as lowlands, 
riverbanks, and hills. In some areas, it also allowed farmers to grow two crops 
of rice per year, a summer crop and a winter crop. 
Innovative methods of production contributed to agricultural success. For 
example, Chinese farmers put manure both human and animal on the fields 
to enrich the soil. They built elaborate irrigation systems using ditches, water 
wheels, pumps, and terraces to increase productivity. New heavy plows pulled 
by water buffalo or oxen allowed previously unusable land to be cultivated.
The combination of these changes in agriculture produced an abundance 
of food. As a result, China’s population grew quickly. In the three centuries of 
Song Dynasty rule, China’s population increased from around 25 percent of 
the total world population to nearly 40 percent.
Manufacturing and Trade  Industrial production soared, as did China’s 
population. China’s discovery of “black earth”²coal²in the th century 
B.C.E. enabled it to produce greater amounts of cast iron goods. Though 
massive use of coal to power machines wouldn’t happened until the 18th 
century, China did have the greatest manufacturing capability in the world. 
The Chinese later learned how to take the carbon out of cast iron and began 
to manufacture steel. They used steel to make or reinforce bridges, gates, and 
ship anchors. They also used steel to make religious items, such as pagodas 
and Buddhist figurines. Steel also strengthened the agricultural equipment, 
contributing to the abundance of food production as well. 
Under the Song²and earlier than in Western Europe²China experienced 
proto-industrialization , a set of economic changes in which people in rural 
areas made more goods than they could sell. Unlike later industrialization, 
which featured large-scale production in factories using complex machinery, 
proto-industrialization relied more on home-based or community-based 
production using simple equipment. For example, artisans , or skilled 
craftworkers, produced steel and other products in widely dispersed smelting 
facilities under the supervision of the imperial government. Artisans also 
manufactured porcelain and silk that reached consumers through expanding 
trade networks, especially by sea. Porcelain was highly desired because it 
was light-weight yet strong. Further, it was light-colored, so it could be easily 
painted with elaborate designs.
The Chinese used the compass in maritime navigation, and they redesigned 
their ships to carry more cargo. China’s ability to print paper navigation 
charts made seafaring possible in open waters, out of sight of land, and sailors 
became less reliant on the sky for direction. 
China became the world’s most commercialized society. Its economy 
changed from local consumption to market production, with porcelains, 
textiles, and tea the chief exports. The Grand Canal supported a vibrant internal 
trade while advances in naval technology allowed China to control trade in 
the South China Sea. The military power of the Tang and Song enabled them 
to protect traders from bandits. 
6 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONTaxes  The Song also promoted the growth of a commercial economy by 
changing how they built public projects, such as roads and irrigation canals. 
Instead of requiring that people labor on these projects, the government paid 
people to work on them. This change increased the amount of money in 
circulation, promoting economic growth.
Tributes  Another source of income for the government came from the 
tributary system, an arrangement in which other states had to pay money or 
provide goods to honor the Chinese emperor. This system cemented China’s 
economic and political power over several foreign countries, but it also created 
stability and stimulated trade for all parties involved. The origins of the system 
existed in the Han Dynasty. By the time of the Song Dynasty, Japan, .orea, 
and kingdoms throughout southeast Asia were tributary states. The emperor 
expected representatives from tributary states to demonstrate their respect by 
performing a  kowtow,  a ritual in which anyone greeting the Chinese emperor 
must bow his or her head until it reached the floor. The Chinese sent out 
tremendous fleets led by =heng He to demonstrate the power of the emperor 
and to receive tribute. (Zheng He’s voyages are described in more detail in 
Topic 2..
Social Structures in China
Through most of Chinese history, the majority of people lived in rural areas. 
However, urban areas grew in prominence in this productive period. At the 
height of the Song Dynasty, China was the most urbanized land in the world, 
boasting several cities containing more than 100,000 people. The largest cities, 
Chang’an an ancient capital, Hangzhou at the southern end of the Grand 
Canal, and the port city of Guangzhou were cosmopolitan metropolises²
active centers of commerce with many entertainment options to of fer. 
China’s Class Structure  Though urbanization represented a significant 
development in China, life in rural areas grew more complex as well. The 
bureaucratic expansion created an entirely new social class, the scholar gentry . 
They soon outnumbered the aristocracy, which was comprised of landowners 
who inherited their wealth. The scholar gentry were educated in Confucian 
philosophy and became the most influential social class in China. 
Three other classes ranked below the scholar gentry: farmers, artisans, 
and merchants. The low status of merchants reflected Confucian respect for 
hard work and creating value. The tasks of merchants did not require physical 
strength or endurance, and they simply exchanged goods without growing or 
making anything new.
Lower rungs of Chinese society included peasants who worked for wealthy 
landowners, often to pay off debts, and the urban poor. The Song government 
provided aid to the poor and established public hospitals where people could 
receive free care.
Role of Women  Confucian traditions included both respect for women 
and the expectation that they would defer to men. This patriarchal pattern 
7 DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIAstrengthened during the Tang and Song dynasties. One distinctive constraint on 
women’s activities in China was the practice of foot binding , which became 
common among aristocratic families during the Song Dynasty. From a very 
young age, girls had their feet wrapped so tightly that the bones did not grow 
naturally. A bound foot signified social status, something suitors particularly 
desired. It also restricted women’s ability to move and hence to participate in 
the public sphere. Foot binding was finally banned in 112.
Intellectual and Cultural Developments
During the Tang and Song eras, China enjoyed affluence, a well-educated 
populace, and extensive contact with foreign nations. As a result, intellectual 
pursuits (technology, literature, and visual arts) thrived.
Paper and Printing  The Chinese had invented paper as early as the 2nd 
century C.E., and they developed a system of printing in the th century. They 
were the first culture to use woodblock printing . A Buddhist scripture produced 
in the th century is thought to be the world’s first woodblock printed work. 
For information on the Gutenberg press, a related technology, see Topic 1.6. 
In the Song era, printed booklets on how to farm efficiently were distributed 
throughout rice-growing regions.

With the development of woodblock printing in China, people could make multiple copies of art 
or written texts without laboriously copying each by hand.
8 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONReading and Poetry  The development of paper and printing expanded the 
availability of books. Though most peasants were illiterate, China’s privileged 
classes had increased access to literature. Confucian scholars not only 
consumed literature at a tremendous rate, they were also the major producers 
of literature throughout the era. The Tang and Song dynasties’ emphasis on 
schooling created generations of well-rounded scholar-bureaucrats. Later, 
Europeans with such diverse skills would be called “Renaissance men.”
Religious Diversity in China
Buddhism  had come to China from its birthplace in India via the Silk Roads. 
Its presence is evident during the anarchic period between the later Han and 
the Sui dynasties. However, its popularity became widespread during the Tang 
Dynasty. The th century Buddhist monk ;uanzang helped build Buddhism’s 
popularity in China. 
Buddhism and Daoism  Three forms of Buddhism from India came to 
shape Asia, each developing a different emphasis: 
• Theravada Buddhism  focused on personal spiritual growth through 
silent meditation and self-discipline. It became strongest in Southeast 
Asia.
• Mahayana Buddhism  focused on spiritual growth for all beings and 
on service. It became strongest in China and Korea.
• Tibetan Buddhism  focused on chanting. It became strongest in Tibet.
All three include a belief in the Four Noble Truths, which stress the idea 
that personal suffering can be alleviated by eliminating cravings or desires and 
by following Buddhist precepts. All three also embrace the Eight-Fold Path, 
the precepts including right speech, right livelihood, right effort, and right 
mindfulness that can lead to enlightenment or nirvana. 
Monks introduced Buddhism to the Chinese by relating its beliefs to Daoist 
principles. For example, Buddhism’s idea of dharma became translated as dao 
“the way”. Eventually, Buddhist doctrines combined with elements of Daoist 
traditions to create the syncretic , or fused, faith Chan Buddhism , also known 
as Zen Buddhism . Like Daoism, =en Buddhism emphasized direct experience 
and meditation as opposed to formal learning based on studying scripture. 
Because of its fusion with Chinese beliefs, Buddhism became very popular 
in China. Monasteries²buildings where monks lived together²appeared in 
most major cities. 
The presence of these monasteries became a problem for the Tang 
bureaucracy. Many leaders of the Tang Dynasty, which considered itself the 
“Middle .ingdom,” had trouble accepting that a foreign religion would have 
such prominence in society. Buddhism’s popularity, which drew individuals 
away from China’s native religions, made Daoists and Confucians jealous. 
Despite monasteries’ closures and land seizures, however, Chan Buddhism 
remained popular among ordinary Chinese citizens.
9 DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIABuddhism and Neo-Confucianism  The Song Dynasty was somewhat 
more friendly towards Buddhism, but it did not go out of its way to promote 
the religion. It preferred to emphasize China’s native traditions, such 
as Confucianism. However, Buddhism had a strong presence and many 
Confucians began to adopt its ideals into their daily lives. The development 
of printing had made Buddhist scriptures widely available to the Confucian 
scholar gentry. The Song Dynasty benefited from the Confucian idea of filial 
piety , the duty of family members to subordinate their desires to those of the 
male head of the family and to the ruler. The emphasis on respect for one’s 
elders helped the Song maintain their rule in China.  
Neo-Confucianism  evolved in China between 0 and 80. It was a 
syncretic system, combining rational thought with the more abstract ideas of 
Daoism and Buddhism. This new incarnation of Confucianism emphasized 
ethics rather than the mysteries of God and nature. It became immensely 
popular in the countries in China’s orbit, including Japan, .orea, and 9ietnam.
Comparing Japan, Korea, and Vietnam
An important dynamic in the histories of Japan, .orea, and 9ietnam was 
each country’s relationship with China. When China was unified, its political 
strength, economic wealth, religious traditions, intellectual advances, and 
technological innovations made the world’s most powerful realm. Its smaller 
neighbors benefited from being so close to China but faced a challenge of 
maintaining their own distinctive cultures. Each had to confront the issue of 
sinification, or the assimilation of Chinese traditions and practices.
Japan
Since Japan was separated from China by a sea rather than land, it had more 
ability to control its interactions with China than .orea or 9ietnam could. The 
impact of Chinese culture appeared in many aspects of life:
• Japan’s Prince Shotoku Taishi 5±622 promoted Buddhism and 
Confucianism along with Japan’s traditional Shinto religion. During 
this era, Japan learned how to do woodblock printing from China. 
• During the Heian period  ±1185 Japan emulated Chinese 
traditions in politics, art, and literature. 
• However, Japanese writers also moved in new directions. For example, 
in the 11th century, a Japanese writer composed the world’s first novel, 
The Tale of Genji.  It is the story of a Japanese prince and his life at 
court, particularly his many romances. 
Feudalism For hundreds of years, Japan had been a feudal society without 
a centralized government. Landowning aristocrats, the daimyo , battled for 
control of land, while the majority of people worked as rice fa rmers. 
10 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONJapanese feudalism was similar to European feudalism, which is described 
in Topic 1.6. Both featured very little social mobility, and both systems were 
built upon hereditary hierarchies. In Japan, peasants, known as serfs, were born 
into lives of economic dependency, while samurai were born into their roles as 
protectors and daimyo were born into lives of privilege. In Europe, the three 
groups were serfs, knights, and nobles.
What distinguishes Japanese feudalism from that of Europe was that the 
daimyo enjoyed much more power than the nobility in Europe did. The daimyo 
ruled over vast stretches of land and, in reality, were more powerful than 
either the emperor or the shogun. By contrast, Europe’s hierarchy placed the 
monarch above the nobility. Though there were periods when authority of the 
monarch waned and power was distributed among nobility, the main centralized 
power structure of European feudalism would not change until the Modern  
Industrial Era. 
In Europe, the ideal knight held to the code of chivalry, with duty to 
countrymen, duty to God, and duty to women, the last expressed through 
courtly love and the virtues of gentleness and graciousness. In Japan, the code 
was known as bushido  and stressed frugality, loyalty, the martial arts, and 
honor unto death.
Japan also differed from China in how it was governed. China was ruled by 
an emperor who oversaw a large civilian bureaucracy. For much of its history, 
China had a central government strong enough to promote trade and peace. In 
contrast, when the Heian court declined, a powerful land-owning family, the 
Minamoto clan, took charge. In 1192, the Minamoto installed a shogun, or 
military ruler, to reign. Though Japan still had an emperor, he had little power. 
For the following four centuries, Japan suffered from regional rivalries among 
aristocrats. Not until the 17th century would shoguns create a strong central 
government that could unify the country. (Connect: In a paragraph, explain 
how Buddhism and Confucianism influenced the development of Chinese 
governments in the period from 1200 to 150. See Prologue.
Korea
Korea’s location gave it a very direct relationship with China. The countries 
shared a land boundary, and China extended both the north and south of .orea.
Similarity to China  Through its tributary relationship, Korea and China 
were in close contact. Thus, .orea emulated many aspects of China’s politics 
and culture. It centralized its government in the style of the Chinese. Culturally, 
.oreans adopted both Confucian and Buddhist beliefs. The educated elite 
studied Confucian classics, while Buddhist doctrine attracted the peasant 
masses. Koreans adopted the Chinese writing system, which proved to be 
very awkward. The Chinese and Korean languages remained structurally very 
different. In the 15th century, .orea developed its own writing system. 
Powerful Aristocracy  One important difference between .orea and 
China was that the landed aristocracy were more powerful in .orea than in 
11 DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST ASIAChina. As a result, the .orean elite were able to prevent certain Chinese reforms 
from ever being implemented. For example, though there was a .orean civil 
service examination, it was not open to peasants. Thus, there was no truly 
merit-based system for entering the bureaucracy.
Vietnam
Like Japan and .orea, 9ietnam traded with and learned from China. For 
example, 9ietnam adapted the Chinese writing system and architectural styles. 
However, 9ietnam had a more adversarial relationship with China. At times, 
the 9ietnamese launched violent rebellions against Chinese influence.
Gender and Social Structure  9ietnamese culture differed from Chinese 
culture in several ways, which explains the strong resistance to Chinese power. 
For example, 9ietnamese women enjoyed greater independence in their married 
lives than did Chinese women in the Confucian tradition. While the Chinese 
lived in extended families, the 9ietnamese preferred nuclear families  (just a 
wife, husband, and their children. 9ietnamese villages operated independently 
of a national government political centralization was nonexistent.
Although 9ietnam adopted a merit-based bureaucracy of educated men, 
the 9ietnamese system did not function like the Chinese scholar-bureaucracy. 
Instead of loyalty to the emperor, scholar-officials in 9ietnam owed more 
allegiance to the village peasants. In fact, 9ietnamese scholar-officials often led 
revolts against the government if they deemed it too oppressive. 9ietnamese 
women resented their inferior status under the Chinese. In particularly, they 
rejected the customs of foot binding and polygyny , the practice of having more 
than one wife at the same time. In spite of 9ietnamese efforts to maintain the 
purity of their own culture, sinification did occur.
Military Conflict with China  As the Tang Dynasty began to crumble in 
the 8th century, 9ietnamese rebels pushed out China’s occupying army. In their 
battles against the Chinese, they showed a strong capacity for guerilla warfare, 
perhaps due to their deep knowledge of their own land.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“The Moral Nature
Being upright and modest, reserved and quiet, correct and dignified, sincere 
and honest: these constitute the moral nature of a woman. Being filial and 
respectful, humane and perspicacious >shrewd, wise@, loving and warm, meek

Cultivation of the Self
. . . Now if the self is not cultivated, then virtue will not be established. If 
one’s virtue is not established, rarely can one be an influence for good in 
the family±how much less in the wider world. Therefore, the wife is one 
who follows her husband. The way of husband and wife is the principle of 
the strong and the weak. In the past, the reason why enlightened monarchs 
were careful about establishing marriage was that they valued the way of 
procreation and perpetuation. >The rise and fall of the state is intimately 
linked to the prosperity or decline of the family.@”

14 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   C O N T E XTUALIZE HISTORICAL  
DEVELOPMENTS
To contextualize is to look at an event, development, or process in 
history within the situation, or context, in which it occurs. After you 
place events in context, you begin to see themes and patterns emerge 
in history. Historians use these themes and patterns to understand the 
interactions of laws, institutions, culture, events, and people. 
For example, one way to understand the Song Dynasty’s success from 
960 to 1279 is to place its political, social, and economic development 
in the context of what came before and after it. In the context of what 
came before, the imperial bureaucracy represents a political continuity, 
since the bureaucratic system had been in place in earlier dynasties as 
well. However, its modification under the Song to allow more upward 
mobility represents a change. Similarly, considering the Song imperial 
bureaucracy in the economic context of what came after, you might gain 
insights into causation. That is, the cost of supporting the bureaucracy 
drained China of its wealth, which in turn helped create problems that 
led to the decline of the Song Dynasty. Contextualizing also promotes 
understanding of comparisons among different cultures and time 
periods. 
Explain how the passage below provides context for the spread of 
Buddhism in China in light of other developments of the time. 
In 62, a Chinese Buddhist monk named ;uanzang left China to go 
on a pilgrimage to India, the birthplace of Buddhism. He traveled west 
on the Silk Roads to Central Asia, then south and east to India, which 
he reached in 60. Along the way and in India he met many Buddhist 
monks and visited Buddhist shrines. In order to gain more insight into 
Buddhism, he studied for years in Buddhist monasteries and at Nalanda 
University in Bilar, India²a famous center of Buddhist knowledge. 
After 1 years away, ;uanzang finally returned to China, where people 
greeted him as a celebrity. He brought back many Buddhist texts, which 
he spent the rest of his life translating into Chinese. These writings were 
highly instrumental in the growth of Buddhist scholarship in China.

DEVELOPMENTS IN DAR AL-ISLAM 15
1.2
Developments in Dar al-Islam
Allah will admit those who embrace the true faith and do good works  
to gardens watered by running streams.
—The Quran, Chapter 47
Essential Question:   In the period from c. 1200 to c. 1450, how did Islamic 
states arise, and how did major religious systems 
shape society?
After the death of Muhammad  in 62, Islam spread rapidly outward 
from Arabia. Through military actions and the activities of merchants and 
missionaries, Islam’s reach extended from India to Spain. As the quotation 
suggests, many Islamic leaders showed tolerance to Christians, Jews, and 
others who believed in a single god and did good works. Under the Abbasid 
Empire, scholars traveled from far away to Baghdad to study at a renowned 
center of learning known as the House of Wisdom . The Islamic community 
helped transfer knowledge throughout Afro-Eurasia. When the Abbasids 
declined, they were replaced by other Islamic states. 
Invasions and Shifts in Trade Routes
In the 1100s and 1200s, the  Abbasid Empire confronted many challenges. Like 
the Chinese, they had conflicts with nomadic groups in Central Asia. Unlike 
the Chinese, they also confronted European invaders. 
Egyptian Mamluks  Arabs often purchased enslaved people, or Mamluks , 
who were frequently ethnic Turks from Central Asia, to serve as soldiers and 
later as bureaucrats. Because of their roles, Mamluks had more opportunities 
for advancement than did most enslaved people. In Egypt, Mamluks seized 
control of the government, establishing the Mamluk Sultanate (1250–1517). 
They prospered by facilitating trade in cotton and sugar between the Islamic 
world and Europe. However, when the Portuguese and other Europeans 
developed new sea routes for trade, the Mamluks declined in power . 
Seljuk Turks  Another challenge to the Abbasids came from the Central 
Asian Seljuk Turks , who were also Muslims. Starting in the 11th century, they 
began conquering parts of the Middle East, eventually extending their power 
almost as far east as Western China. The Seljuk leader called himself sultan , 
thereby reducing the role of the highest-ranking Abbasid from caliph to chief 
Sunni religious authority.
16 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONCrusaders  The Abbasids allowed Christians to travel easily to and 
from their holy sites in and around Jerusalem. However, the Seljuk Turks 
limited this travel. European Christians organized groups of soldiers, called 
Crusaders , to reopen access. (See Topic 1.6.) 
Mongols  The fourth group to attack the Abbasid Empire were among the 
most famous conquerors in history: the Mongols . (See Topic 2.2.) Like many 
Mamluks and the Seljuk Turks, they came from Central Asia. The Mongols 
conquered the remaining Abbasid Empire in 1258 and ended the Seljuk rule. 
They continued to push westward but were stopped in Egypt by the Mamluks.
Economic Competition  Since the 8th century, the Abbasids had been an 
important link connecting Asia, Europe, and North Africa. Goods and ideas 
flowed from one region to another on trade routes controlled by the Abbasids. 
Many went through Baghdad . However, trade patterns slowly shifted to 
routes farther north. As Baghdad lost its traditional place at the center of trade, 
it lost wealth and population. It could not afford to keep its canals repaired. 
Farmers could not provide enough food for the urban population. Slowly, the 
infrastructure that had made Baghdad a great city fell into decay .
Cultural and Social Life
Over time, the Islamic world fragmented politically. Many of these new states 
adopted Abbasid practices, but they were distinct ethnically. The Abbasid 
Caliphate  was led by Arabs and Persians, but the later Islamic states were 
shaped by Turkic peoples who descended from people in Central Asia. For 
example, the Mamluks in North Africa, the Seljuks in the Middle East, and 
the Delhi Sultanate in South Asia were all at least partially Turkic. By the 
16th century, three large Islamic states had their roots in Turkic cultures: the 
Ottoman Empire in Turkey, the Safavid Empire in Persia, and the Mughal 
Empire in India. See Topic .1. 
However, these Islamic states continued to form a cultural region. Trade 
spread new goods and fresh ideas. The common use of shariah created similar 
legal systems. Great universities in Baghdad, Iraq Cyrdoba, Spain Cairo, 
Egypt and Bukhara in Central Asia created centers for sharing intellectual 
innovations.
Cultural Continuities  Islamic scholars followed the advice of the 
prophet Muhammad: “Go in quest of knowledge even unto China.” By 
learning from many cultures, they carried on the work of earlier thinkers:
• They translated Greek literary classics into Arabic, saving the works 
of Aristotle and other Greek thinkers from oblivion. 
• They studied mathematics texts from India and transferred the 
knowledge to Europeans.
• They adopted techniques for paper-making from China. Through 
them, Europeans learned to make paper. 
17 DEVELOPMENTS IN DAR AL-ISLAM 17Cultural Innovations  In addition to building on the intellectual 
achievements of other cultures, scholars during the “golden age” in Baghdad 
made their own achievements. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi  (1201–1274) was one 
of the most celebrated Islamic scholars. He contributed to astronomy, law, 
logic, ethics, mathematics, philosophy, and medicine. An observatory built 
under his direction was the most advanced in the world and produced the most 
accurate astronomical charts. He studied the relationship between the lengths 
of the sides of a triangle and the angles. This laid the groundwork for making 
trigonometry a separate subject. Medical advances and hospital care improved 
in cities such as Cairo, while doctors and pharmacists studied for examinations 
for licenses that would allow them to practice.
Ibn .haldun 12±106 was well known for his historical accounts and 
is widely acknowledged as a founder of the fields of historiography the study 
of the methods of historians and sociology. 
Sufi poet and mystic ‘A’ishah al-Ba’uniyyah  (1460–1507) may be the 
most prolific female Muslim writer before the 20th century. Her best-known 
work, a long poem honoring Muhammad called “Clear Inspiration, on Praise of 
the Trusted One,” refers to many previous poets, reflecting her broad learning. 
Many of her works describe her journey toward mystical illumination. 
µA’ishah’s poetry reflects a contrast between most Muslims and Sufis. 
Unlike Muslims who focused on intellectual pursuits, such as the study of the 
Quran, Sufis emphasized introspection to grasp truths that they believed could 
not be understood through learning. Sufism may have begun as a mystical 
response to the perceived love of luxury by the early Umayyad Caliphate.
Sufi missionaries played an important role in the spread of Islam. They 
tended to adapt to local cultures and traditions, sometimes interweaving local 
religious elements into Islam, and in this way they won many converts.  
Commerce, Class, and Diversity  Helping to power the golden age of 
natural and moral philosophy and the arts was commerce. Islamic society 
viewed merchants as more prestigious than did other societies in Europe and 
Asia at the time. Muhammad himself had been a merchant, as had his first 
wife. With the revival of trade on Silk Roads, merchants could grow rich from 
their dealings across the Indian Ocean and Central Asia. They were esteemed 
as long as they maintained fair dealings and gave to charity in accord with the 
pillars of the Islamic faith. Some merchants were even sent out as missionaries.  
In the non-Arab areas of Islamic expansion, control by Islamic caliphs led 
to discrimination against non-Arabs, though rarely to open persecution. This 
discrimination gradually faded in the th century. The caliph’s soldiers were 
forbidden to own territory they had conquered. The presence of a permanent 
military force that kept order but did not own property allowed life for most 
of the inhabitants of the countryside to remain virtually unchanged. However, 
people paid tribute to Islamic caliphs rather than to Byzantine rulers.
Slavery  Islam prohibited Muslims from enslaving other Muslims or 
monotheists such as Jews, Christians, and =oroastrians. See Prologue. 
However, it permitted enslaving others. Muslims often imported enslaved 
18 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONpeople from Africa, .ievan Rus present-day Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, 
and Central Asia, but the institution of hereditary slavery had not developed. 
Many enslaved people converted to Islam, after which their owners freed them. 
Enslaved women might find themselves serving as concubines to Islamic 
men who already had wed their allotment of four wives. They were allowed 
more independence²for example, to go to markets and to run errands²than 
the legal wives. Only enslaved women were permitted to dance or perform 
musically before unrelated men. This opportunity to earn money sometimes 
enabled females in slavery to accumulate enough to buy their freedom. 
Free Women in Islam
Some practices now associated with Islam were common cultural customs in 
Central Asia and the Byzantine Empire before the time of Muhammad. For 
example, women often covered their heads and faces. This practice solidified 
under Islam, with most women observing  hijab,  a term that can refer either to 
the practice of dressing modestly or to a specific type of covering. Men often 
wore head coverings, from turbans to skull caps. While women could study 
and read, they were not to do so in the company of men not related to them.
Muhammad’s Policies  Muhammad raised the status of women in several 
ways. He treated his wives with love and devotion. He insisted that dowries, 
the payments prospective husbands made to secure brides, be paid to the 
future wife rather than to her father. He forbade female infanticide, the killing 
of newborn girls. Muhammad’s first wife was educated and owned her own 
business, which set a pattern for the recognition of women’s abilities. 
The Status of Women  Overall, Islamic women enjoyed a higher status 
than Christian or Jewish women. Islamic women were allowed to inherit 
property and retain ownership after marriage. They could remarry if widowed, 
and they could receive a cash settlement if divorced. Under some conditions, 
a wife could initiate divorce. Moreover, women could practice birth control. 
Islamic women who testified in a court under shariah see Topic . were to 
be protected from retaliation, but their testimony was worth only half that of 
a man. One gap in the historical record is written evidence of how women 
viewed their position in society: most of the records created before 150 were 
written by men.
The rise of towns and cities in Islamic-ruled areas resulted in new 
limitations on women’s rights, just as it did in other cultures. The new status 
of women might best be symbolized by the veil and the harem, a  dwelling set 
aside for wives, concubines, and the children of these women.
Islamic Rule in Spain
While the Umayyads ruled only briefly in the Middle East, they kept power 
longer in Spain. In 11, after Muslim forces had defeated Byzantine armies 
across North Africa, they successfully invaded Spain from the south. They 
designated Cyrdoba as their capital for Spain. 
19 DEVELOPMENTS IN DAR AL-ISLAMBattle of Tours  The Islamic military was turned back in 2 when it lost 
the Battle of Tours against Frankish forces. This defeat, rare for Islamic armies 
during the 00s, marked the limit of rapid Islamic expansion into Western 
Europe. Most of the continent remained Christian, but Muslims ruled Spain 
for the next seven centuries. (Connect:  In a paragraph, compare the status of 
women in Chinese society to the status of women in Islamic society in the 
period c. 1200 to c. 1450.)
Prosperity Under Islam  Like the Abbasids in Baghdad, the Umayyad 
rulers in Cyrdoba created a climate of toleration, with Muslims, Christians, 
and Jews coexisting peacefully. They also promoted trade, allowing Chinese 
and Southeast Asian products to enter into Spain and thus into the rest of 
Europe. Many of the goods in this trade traveled aboard ships called dhows. 
These ships, first developed in India or China, had long, thin hulls that made 
them excellent for carrying goods, though less useful for conducting warfare. 
Cultural and Scholarly Transfers  The Islamic state in Spain, known 
as al-Andalus, became a center of learning. Cyrdoba had the largest library in 
the world at the time. Among the famous scholars from Spain was Ibn Rushd , 
known in Europe as Averroes 12th century. He wrote influential works on 
law, secular philosophy, and the natural sciences. 
The Muslims, Christians, and Jews living in al-Andalus²all “people of 
the book” as Muslims regarded them²not only tolerated one another but also 
influenced one another. For example, Ibn Rushd’s commentaries on Aristotle 
influenced the Jewish philosopher Maimonides c. 115±c. 120. Maimonides 
developed a synthesis of Aristotle’s reasoning and biblical interpretation. He, 
in turn, influenced Christian philosophers, including St. Thomas Aquinas 
1225±12. Islamic scholarship and scientific innovations, along with the 
knowledge transferred from India and China, laid the groundwork for the 
Renaissance and Scientific Revolution in Europe. For example, making paper, 
a technology developed in China and taught to Europeans by Muslims, was 
vital to spreading ideas in Europe.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“I paid a visit to the tomb of John the son of =echariah >a figure in the Christian 
Bible@²God’s blessing on both of them²in the village of Sebastea in the 
province of Nablus >a region in the Middle East near the Jordan River@. After 
saying my prayers, I came out into the square that was bounded on one side 
by the Holy Precinct >a place of worship@. I found a half-closed gate, opened it 
and entered a church. Inside were about ten old men, their bare heads as white 
as combed cotton. They were facing east, and wore on their chests >wooden 
sticks@ ending in crossbars turned up like the rear of a saddle. They took their 
oath on this sign and gave hospitality to those who needed it. The sight of 
their piety touched my heart, but at the same time it displeased and saddened 
me, for I had never seen such zeal and devotion among the Muslims. 
For some time I brooded on this experience, until one day, as Mu’in ad-Din 
and I were passing . . . he said to me: ‘I want to dismount here and visit the 
Old Men >people who practice severe self-discipline@.’
‘Certainly,’ I replied, and we dismounted and went into a long building set at 
an angle to the road. For the moment I thought there was no one there. Then 
I saw about a hundred prayer mats, and on each a sufi, his face expressing 
peaceful serenity, and his body humble devotion. This was a reassuring sight, 
and I gave thanks to Almighty God that there were among the Muslims men 
of even more zealous devotion than those Christian priests. Before this I had 
never seen sufis in their monastery, and was ignorant of the way they lived.”

Unit 1 is called “The Global Tapestry” to suggest that world history 
is a complex interweaving of different threads from different parts of 
the world at different times. However, to fully appreciate the whole, 
historians try to unravel the tapestry thread by thread to see just how each 
fits in. As they do, they use such historical concepts  as change, continuity, 
perspective, cause and effect, significance, and empathy. Applying 
these concepts, they come to understand historical developments ²
patterns of changes or growth over time. To see these patterns, they look 
at subjects in historical context²how did they start out, and what did 
they become over time" Historians also try to understand the historical 
processes  that made certain developments possible, such as migration, 
industrialization, conquest, and state building.

Developments in South and 
Southeast Asia
What the books taught me, I’ve practised.  
What they didn’t teach me, I’ve taught myself.  
I’ve gone into the forest and wrestled with the lion.  
I didn’t get this far by teaching one thing and doing another.
—Lal Ded (1320–1392)
Essential Question:   How did various beliefs and practices in South and 
Southeast Asia affect society and the development  
of states?
The poetry of Lal Ded, known as Mother Lalla, illustrates a major cross-
interaction between religious traditions that shaped the history of South and 
Southern Asia. She was born in .ashmir, a region of northern India. While a 
Hindu, her emphasis on experience appealed to many Muslims, particularly 
Sufis. The interaction of Hindus and Muslims, though sometimes violent,  
created dynamic developments in religious thought, politics, economics, art, 
and architecture. Despite the strong Islamic presence in the region, local Hindu 
kingdoms continued to play a major role in India’s decentralized political 
landscape. A third religion, Buddhism, also had a strong presence in the area, 
particularly in the Sinhala dynasties in present-day Sri Lanka and the great 
kingdoms of Southeast Asia. 
Political Structures in South Asia
South Asia was only occasionally united as a single state in its history. After 
the Gupta Dynasty that had dominated South Asia collapsed in 550, ending 
the so-called Golden Age or Classical Era of Indian history, disunity returned 
to the region for most of the next 1,000 years. Northern and southern India 
developed separate political structures. However, Hinduism provided some 
cultural unity throughout the region. Many people combined their own local 
faith tradition with adherence to the same scriptures and core beliefs respected 
throughout the region. 
Political Structures in Southern India  Southern India was more stable 
than northern India. The first kingdom, the Chola Dynasty, reigned over 
southern India for more than 00 years 850±126. During the 11th century, 
24 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONthe dynasty extended its rule to Ceylon, the large island just south of India. 
(Today it is known as Sri Lanka.) 
The second kingdom, the Vijayanagara Empire 16 –1646)  took its 
name from the word for “the victorious city.” It began with the arrival of two 
brothers, Harihara and Bukka, from the Delhi Sultanate in north-central India. 
They were sent to the area because the Delhi Sultanate wished to extend its 
rule to southern India. These brothers had been born as Hindus and converted 
to Islam for the sake of upward mobility. When they left the region controlled 
by the Delhi Sultanate, they once again embraced the religion of their birth 
and established their own Hindu kingdom. The 9ijayanagar Empire existed 
from the mid-100s until the mid-1500s, when a group of Muslim kingdoms 
overthrew it.
Political Structures in Northern India  Northern India experienced a 
great deal more upheaval than did southern India. After the fall of the Gupta 
Empire (see Prologue ), the Rajput kingdoms gradually formed in northern 
India and present-day Pakistan. These were Hindu kingdoms led by leaders 
of numerous clans who were often at war with one another. Because of the 
competition among clans, no centralized government arose, once again 
demonstrating the diversity and the regionalism of South Asia. The lack of a 
centralized power left the kingdoms vulnerable to Muslim attacks.
While the Himalayas protected India from invasions from the north and 
east, mountain passes in the northwest allowed invasions by Muslim armies. 
Each attack disrupted a region that had been mostly Hindu and Buddhist. Over 
time, the Islamic presence in the region grew:
• In the 8th century, Islamic armies invaded what is today Pakistan. 
However, they brought little change to everyday life. Located on the 
eastern fringes of the Dar al-Islam, the region was isolated from the 
center of the culture. In addition, the Rajput princes skillfully wielded 
their power to limit the Muslim conquerors’ influence.
• In the 11th century, Islamic forces plundered northern India’s Hindu 
temples and Buddhist shrines for their riches. In addition, they erected 
mosques on Hindu and Buddhist holy sites²much to the anger of 
followers of those faiths. 
In the early 1th century, Islamic forces managed to conquer the city of 
Delhi and much of the northern portion of South Asia. Bringing Islam into 
India, the Delhi Sultanate  reigned for 00 years, from the 1th through the 16th 
centuries. The interaction of Islam and Hinduism in northern India dominated 
the political history of the era. While some Hindus converted to Islam, others 
resented  Muslims and considered them foreigners. One factor contributing to 
this resentment was that the Delhi Sultanate imposed a tax, called the jizya, on 
all non-Muslim subjects of the empire. 
Throughout its reign, the Delhi Sultanate never organized an efficient 
bureaucracy in the style of the Chinese. For this reason, sultans had difficulty 
imposing their policies in a land as vast and diverse as India. Despite the strong 
25 DEVELOPMENTS IN SO UTH AN D SOUTHEAST ASIA 25Islamic presence in the region, local kingdoms continued to play a major role 
in India’s decentralized political landscape.
The sultans wanted to extend their rule southward. Before they succeeded, 
though, they became focused on defending themselves from an onslaught 
by the Mongol army from the northwest. The Delhi Sultanate prevented the 
Mongols themselves from conquering South Asia. However, in 1526, the 
sultans lost power to a new empire, the Mughals, whose leaders did trace their 
ancestry to the Mongols. 
Religion in South Asia
Religion always held a dominant place in South Asian history. Before the 
arrival of Islam, most South Asians practiced Hinduism, while a smaller 
number identified themselves as Buddhists. South Asians encountered a 
starkly different religion when Islam arrived. 
• Hindus pray to many gods, while Islam is strictly monotheistic. 
• Hindu temples and artwork are replete with pictures of deities, while 
Muslims disapprove of any visual representation of Allah. 
• Hinduism was associated with a hierarchical caste system, while Islam 
has always called for the equality of all believers. 
• Hindus recognize several sacred texts, while Muslims look to only the 
Quran for spiritual guidance.
The Arrival of Islam  The relationship between Hindus and Muslims 
shaped the history of South Asia beginning in the th century, and it continues 
to shape regional culture and politics today. Islam initially entered India 
forcefully yet eventually took on a more peaceful approach. But while Islam 
was a universalizing religion, one that wanted to proselytize , or actively seek 
converts, Muslim rulers found early in their reign that forcing their Hindu and 
Buddhist subjects to convert was not successful. Thus, most converts came to 
Islam voluntarily. Many Muslim merchants in the Indian Ocean trade moved 
to Indian port cities and married. Their wives often ended up converting to 
their husband’s religion. 
With its emphasis on the equality of all believers, Islam also attracted 
low-caste Hindus who hoped that conversion would improve their social 
status. In this sense, Islam in India was like Christianity in the Roman Empire. 
Both appealed to the people who suffered the most under the existing social 
structure. 
The largest numbers of converts to Islam, however, were Buddhists. 
Corruption among the monks and raids on monasteries by early Muslim 
conquerors left the Buddhist religion disorganized. The spread of Islam helped 
make Buddhism a minority religion in its place of birth. (Connect: Make an 
outline comparing the spread of Islam in South Asia to the spread of Buddhism 
in China. See Topic 1.1.)
26 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONSocial Structures in South Asia
The arrival of Islam did little to alter the basic structure of society in South 
Asia. India’s caste system is its strongest historical continuity. While obviously 
inequitable, it lent stability to a politically decentralized land. The caste system 
was flexible and able to accommodate newcomers. Muslim merchants and 
migrants, even though they were not Hindu, found a place for themselves 
within the caste hierarchy based on their occupation. These subcastes based 
on occupation operated like workers’ guilds, soon becoming absorbed into the 
social fabric of Indian society. Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the caste 
system in South Asia to the social structures in China in the period from 1200 
to 1450. See Topic 1.1.)
At the same time, most of those who tried to escape the grip of the caste 
system failed. The low-caste Hindus who converted to Islam as a way to improve 
their social status usually did not achieve that goal. Individuals required more 
education and opportunities for better jobs, not just a new religion, to help 
them escape their low status in life. 
As Islam spread, Muslims varied how they applied its core teachings, 
depending on their culture before converting. For example, Islam did not alter 
gender relations greatly. In South Asia, women in the Hindu tradition were 
confined to a separate social sphere, and Islamic women received similar 
treatment. In Southeast Asia, women enjoyed more independence before the 
arrival of Islam. This pattern continued as people became Muslims. Thus, 
converts in South and Southeast Asia found ways to accommodate a new faith, 
but most people did not reject their traditions in the process.
Cultural Interactions in South Asia
People in South Asia and the Middle East shared their intellectual and 
cultural achievements with each other. For example, Arab astronomers 
and mathematicians added to the body of knowledge begun by their Indian 
counterparts. Indian developments in algebra and geometry were translated 
into Arabic, and spread throughout Dar al-Islam. One result of this movement 
of ideas was that the numeral system referred to in the West as “Arabic 
numerals,” actually originated in India.
In India itself, sultans erected buildings melding the intricate artistic details 
of Hindu art with the geometric patterns preferred by Islamic architecture. The 
city of Delhi is filled with examples of Islamic architecture built during the Delhi 
Sultanate. One famous example, the Qutub Minar , stands in the southern part 
of the city. Rulers from the Delhi Sultanate built an elaborate mosque on top 
of a Hindu temple and used materials for the mosque from nearby Hindu and 
other religious shrines. Towering over the mosque is the Qutub Minar itself, a 
gigantic leaning tower, the tallest structure in India today. Historians debate the 
reason for its construction one obvious function is its presence as a symbol of 
Islamic influence and, at one time, dominance of northern India. 
27 DEVELOPMENTS IN SO UTH AN D SOUTHEAST ASIAAn entirely new language developed among Muslims of South Asia: 
Urdu . Urdu melded the grammatical pattern of Hindi the language of 
Northern Indians, and with the vocabulary of Arabic and some elements 
of Farsi the language of Persians. Today, Urdu is the official language of 
Pakistan. 
The Bhakti Movement  Beginning in the 12th century, some Hindus 
began to draw upon traditional teachings about the importance of emotion in 
their spiritual life. Rather than emphasize studying texts or performing rituals, 
they focused on developing a strong attachment to a particular deity. This 
development, known as the Bhakti Movement , started in southern India. It  
was especially appealing to many believers because it did not discriminate 
against women or people of low social status. For example, one of the most 
famous figures of the Bhakti Movement would be a female, the poet  Mira Bai, 
who lived in the 16th century.
Though the bhaktis were Hindus, they were similar in some ways to 
Sufi Muslims. Both groups were mystical movements, ones that emphasized 
inner reflection in order to achieve a direct personal relationship with a deity. 
Because they placed less emphasis on strict adherence to traditional rituals 
and beliefs, bhaktis and Sufis each appealed to people outside their traditions. 
Just as the Sufis helped spread Islam, the Bhaktis helped spread Hinduism.

28 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONSoutheast Asia
Like China, South Asia strongly influenced its neighbors, particularly the 
lands of Southeast Asia²today’s Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, 
Laos, and 9ietnam. Indian merchants had contact with these Southeast Asian 
lands as early as 500 B.C.E. The merchants sold gold, silver, metal goods, 
and textiles in the region and brought back its fine spices. Trade voyages 
introduced the Indian religions of Hinduism and Buddhism to Southeast Asia.  
Much of the region became and remains today mostly Buddhist. The region, 
like Southwest Asia, was strategically significant. Whoever controlled this 
region could influence the valuable trade between South Asia and East Asia. 
Sea-Based Kingdoms  Because Southeast Asia was so important, several 
kingdoms emerged there. Two were particularly long-lasting:  
• The Srivijaya Empire  (670–1025) was a Hindu kingdom based on 
Sumatra. It built up its navy and prospered by charging fees for ships 
traveling between India and China. 
• The Majapahit Kingdom  12±1520 based on Java had 8 
tributaries at its height. Like Srivijaya, Majapahit sustained its power 
by controlling sea routes. Unlike Srivijaya, Majapahit was Buddhist. 
Land-Based Kingdoms  Other kingdoms in Southeast Asia drew power 
from their control over land. The Sinhala dynasties in Sri Lanka had their 
roots in the arrival of early immigrants, most likely merchants, from north 
India. Buddhists arrived in the rd century B.C.E. and the island became a 
center of Buddhist study. Monasteries and nunneries flourished. Both men and 
women found a life of contemplation and simple living attractive. 
Buddhism was so deeply embedded that Buddhist priests often served as 
advisors to the monarchs. The government of one of the kingdoms oversaw 
the construction of a network of reservoirs and canals to create an excellent 
irrigation system, which contributed to economic growth. However, attacks 
by invaders from India and conflicts between the monarchy and the priests 
ultimately weakened the kingdoms.
The Khmer Empire , also known as the Angkor .ingdom 802±11, was 
situated near the Mekong River and also did not depend on maritime prowess 
for its power. The kingdom’s complex irrigation and drainage systems led 
to economic prosperity, making it one of the most prosperous kingdoms in 
Southeast Asia. Irrigation allowed farmers to harvest rice crops several times 
a year, and drainage systems reduced the impact of the heavy monsoon rains. 
The Khmer capital was at Angkor Thom. The temples there showed the 
variety of Indian cultural influences on Southeast Asia. Hindu artwork and 
sculptures of deities abounded. But at some point the .hmer rulers became 
Buddhist. Starting in the 12th and 1th centuries, they added Buddhist 
sculptures and artwork to the temples without destroying any of the Hindu 
artwork. 
29 DEVELOPMENTS IN SO UTH AN D SOUTHEAST ASIADuring the same period and only one-half mile from Angkor Thom, rulers 
constructed the ornate and majestic Buddhist temple complex of Angkor Wat. 
In 11, the Thais of the Sukhothai Kingdom  invaded the area, forcing the 
.hmers out. Nevertheless, ruins of the magnificent structures in Angkor Thom 
and Angkor Wat still stand, testifying not only to the sophistication of Southeast 
Asian culture but also to the powerful influence of Indian culture on the region.  
Islam  Islam’s movement into the Indian Ocean region paralleled its 
expansion elsewhere. The first Southeast Asian Muslims were local merchants, 
who converted in the 700s, hoping to have better trading relations with the 
Islamic merchants who arrived on their shores. Islam was most popular in 
urban areas at the time. Islam spread to Sumatra, Java, and the Malay Peninsula. 
Today, Indonesia includes more Muslims than any other country. 
Sufis Sufis  also did missionary work in Southeast Asia. (See Topic 1.2.) 
Because of their tolerance for local faiths, people felt comfortable converting 
to Islam. They could be Muslims and still honor local deities.

Instead, in modern scholarship, a claim expresses a viewpoint with 
which thoughtful people can reasonably disagree. It forms the basis of 
an argument ²reasoning backed up with evidence. 
A claim is often a somewhat general statement that reflects a 
judgment shaped by the point of view of the writer. In some historical 
texts with a clear bias, the claim may simply be the author’s main 
idea, and it may be based more on opinion or overgeneralization than 
rigorous reasoning. In modern scholarship, however, claims should be 
grounded in facts and informed opinions. While claims are general, the 
evidence used to support them should be specific.

Developments in the Americas 
I love the song of the mockingbird,  
Bird of four hundred voices,  
I love the color of jade  
And the intoxicating scent of flowers,  
But more than all I love my brother, man!
—Nezahualcoyotl (1402–1472), Aztec poet 
Essential Question:   What states developed in the Americas, and how did 
they change over time?
Following the decline of the Olmecs in Mesoamerica and the Chavin in the 
Andes,  new civilizations, such as the Mayans, the Aztecs, and the Incas rose in 
the same regions. In addition, the first large-scale civilization in North America 
developed. As in Afro-Eurasia, several of these civilizations developed strong 
states, large urban centers, and complex belief systems. Current knowledge 
about these civilizations combines archaeological evidence, oral traditions, 
and writings by Europeans who came to the Americas after 12. One poem 
recorded by the Spanish was the one above from an Aztec writer. 
The Mississippian Culture
The first large-scale civilization in North America emerged in the 00s or 800s 
in what is now the eastern United States. Since it started in the Mississippi 
River 9alley, it is known as the Mississippian culture. While other cultures 
built monumental buildings, Mississippians built enormous earthen mounds, 
some of which were as tall as 100 feet and covered an area the size of 12 
football fields. The largest of these mounds is Cahokia , located in southern 
Illinois.
Government and Society  The Mississippian society had a rigid class 
structure. A chief called the Great Sun ruled each large town. Below the Great 
Sun was an upper class of priests and nobles and a lower class of farmers, 
hunters, merchants, and artisans. At the bottom were enslaved people, who 
usually were prisoners of war. In general, women farmed and men hunted. The 
Mississippians had a matrilineal society , which means that social standing 
was determined by the woman’s side of the family. For example, when the 
Great Sun died, the title passed not to his own son, but to a sister’s son.
34 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe Decline of Mississippian Civilization  People abandoned Cahokia 
around 1450, and other large Mississippian cities by 1600. Historians disagree 
on why the Mississippian people moved. One theory posits that flooding or 
other weather extremes caused crop failures and the collapse of the agricultural 
economy needed to sustain the populations of the large cities. Another theory 
suggests that diseases introduced by the Europeans decimated the population.
Chaco and Mesa Verde
Soon after the rise of the Mississippian Civilization, various cultures emerged 
in what is now the southwestern United States. Living in a dry region, people  
developed ways to collect, transport, and store water efficiently. In addition, 
because of the climate, trees were small and scarce, so people had little wood 
to use to build homes. Two cultures became well-known for their innovations:
• The Chaco built large housing structures using stones and clay, some of 
which included hundreds of rooms.
• The people of Mesa 9erde built multi-story homes into the sides of 
cliffs using bricks made of sandstone. 
Both groups declined in the late 1th century as the climate became drier .
The Maya City-States
Mayan civilization reached its height between 250 and 00 C.E. Mayans 
stretched over the southern part of Mexico and much of what is now Belize, 
Honduras, and Guatemala. Most lived in or near one of the approximately 0 
cities that ranged in size from 5,000 to 50,000 people. At its peak, as many as 
2 million Mayans populated the region.  
Mayan Government  The main form of Mayan government was the 
city-state , each ruled by a king and consisting of a city and its surrounding 
territory. Most rulers were men. However, when no male heir was available 
or old enough to govern, Mayan women ruled. Wars between city-states were 
common. At times, city-states were overthrown. However, Mayans rarely 
fought to control territory. More often they fought to gain tribute²payments 
from the conquered to the conqueror²and captives to be used as human 
sacrifices  during religious ceremonies. 
Each Mayan king claimed to be descended from a god. The Mayans 
believed that when the king died, he would become one with his ancestor-
god. The king directed the activities of the elite scribes and priests who 
administered the affairs of the state. Royal rule usually passed from father to 
son, but kings who lost the support of the people were sometimes overthrown. 
The common people were required to pay taxes, usually in the form of crops, 
and to provide labor to the government. City-states had no standing armies, so 
when war erupted, governments required citizens to provide military service. 
No central government ruled all Mayan lands, although often one city-state 
was the strongest in a region and would dominate its neighbors.
35 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS 35Mayan Religion, Science, and Technology  The Mayans were innovative 
thinkers and inventors. For example, they incorporated the concept of zero into 
their number system, developed a complex writing system, and learned to make 
rubber out of liquid collected from rubber plants. 
Mayan science and religion were linked through astronomy. Based on the 
calendar, priests decided when to celebrate religious ceremonies and whether 
to go to war. As a result, keeping an accurate calendar was very important. 
Although the Mayans had no telescopes, they made very precise observatories 
atop pyramids such as the one at Chichen Itza. Their observations enabled 
priests to design a calendar more accurate than any used in Europe at the time.
One task of priests, who could be either male or female, was to conduct 
ceremonies honoring many deities. Among the most important deities were 
those of the sun, rain, and corn. Mayans made offerings to the gods so prayers 
might be answered. War captives were sometimes killed as offerings. (Connect:

South Asia. See Topic 1..

Mayan pyramids, with steps going up the side, were similar to Mesopotamian ziggurats. Similarly 
shaped architecture can be found from Spain and Algeria to China and Indonesia.  
The Aztecs
The Aztecs, also known as the Mexicas , were originally hunter-gatherers who 
migrated to central Mexico from the north in the 1200s. In 125, they founded 
their capital Tenochtitlin on the site of what is now Mexico City. Over the next 
100 years, they conquered the surrounding peoples and created an empire that 
stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. 
Capital City  The Aztecs located Tenochtitlin on an island in the middle of 
a swampy lake in order to protect it from attacks. Tenochtitlin grew to almost 
200,000 people, making it one of the largest cities in the world. To provide 
water for the city, they built a network of aqueducts. At the center of the city, 
the Aztecs built a pyramid that rose 150 feet into the air. This Great Pyramid and 
other pyramids, temples, and palaces were made of stone. On Lake Texcoco, the 
Aztecs built floating gardens called chinampas  to increase the amount of space 
for food production. The Aztecs dug ditches to use lake water to irrigate their 
fields and to drain parts of the lake for more land.  
36 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONGovernment, Economy, and Society  As the Aztecs conquered much of 
Mesoamerica, they developed a tribute system that insured their dominance. 
Conquered people were forced to pay tribute, surrender lands, and perform 
military service. Tribute included practical goods such as food, cloth, and 
firewood, as well as luxury items such as feathers, beads, and jewelry. The 
Aztecs allowed local rulers to stay in their positions to serve as tribute collectors. 
This allowed Aztec political dominance without direct administrative control. 
In exchange, the conquered people were extended Aztec protection. 
To administer the empire, the Aztecs grouped city-states into provinces. 
They moved warriors and their families to each province’s capital to make 
sure the province remained under Aztec control. In addition, an Aztec official 
was stationed in each capital to collect tribute from local officials. 
Aztec government was a theocracy , which is rule by religious leaders. At 
the top was the emperor, known as the Great Speaker, who was the political 
ruler as well as a divine representative of the gods. Next in the social hierarchy 
were land-owning nobles, who also formed the majority of Aztec military 
leadership. Next in rank were scribes and healers, followed by craftspeople 
and traders. A special merchant class called pochteca traded in luxury goods. 
Below the traders were the peasants and soldiers. Aztec people could be 
enslaved as well, usually because they did not pay their debts or were being 
punished for crimes. Besides being used for labor, enslaved people were also 
offered up as sacrifices in religious ceremonies. 
Religion  The intricate and complex religion of the Aztecs was central 
to their society. They worshipped an ever-evolving pantheon of hundreds of 
deities, many of whom were considered to have both male and female aspects. Source:  DEQG DAGLIORTI Granger, NYC 
The construction of chinampas in Mesoamerica was one way people expanded the land on which 
to grow crops.

37 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS Worship among the Aztecs involved a great many rituals and feast days as 
well as human sacrifices. The Aztecs believed that the gods had sacrificed 
themselves in order to create the world²thus human sacrifice and blood-
letting was a sort of repayment and atonement for human sin. Human sacrifice 
probably had a political component, in the sense that it demonstrated the 
great might of the Aztec Empire in dramatic fashion. The number of human 
sacrifices may never be known. Much of the information about Aztec society 
comes from Spanish invaders, who may have exaggerated the extent of human 
sacrifice in order to make the Aztecs seem more deserving of conquest. 
Role of Women  Women played an important role in the Aztec tribute 
system since they wove the valuable cloth that local rulers demanded as part 
of the regular tribute. As the demand for cloth tribute increased, an Aztec 
husband might obtain more than one wife in order to be able to pay the tribute. 
While most Aztec women worked in their homes, some became priestesses, 
midwives, healers, or merchants. A few noblewomen worked as scribes to 
female members of royal families. Therefore, at least these few women knew 
how to read and write.
The Decline of the Aztecs  By the late 15th century, the Aztec Empire 
was in decline. The Aztecs’ comparatively low level of technology²such as 
the lack of wheeled vehicles and pack animals²meant that agriculture was 
arduous and inefficient. The Aztecs’ commitment to military victory and the 
constant desire for more human sacrifices induced the leadership to expand the 
empire beyond what it could reasonably govern. Finally, the extraction from 
conquered people of tribute and sacrifice victims inspired more resentment 
than loyalty. Because of this resentment, many tribes ruled by the Aztecs 
were ready to rebel if they thought they had an opportunity to succeed. This 
opportunity would come later, when Spaniards arrived in 1519.
The Inca
In 18, a tribal leader who called himself Pachacuti , which means 
“transformer” or “shaker” of the earth, began conquering the tribes living 
near what is now Cuzco, Peru. His military victories, followed by those of 
his son, combined the small tribes into a full-fledged state, the Incan Empire . 
It extended from present-day Ecuador in the north to Chile in the south. By 
1, Pachacuti’s grandson, Huayna Capac, ruled the empire. He  focused on 
consolidating and managing the many lands conquered by his predecessors. 
Government, Economy, and Society  In order to rule the extensive 
territory efficiently, the Incan Empire was split into four provinces, each with 
its own governor and bureaucracy. Conquered leaders who demonstrated 
loyalty to the empire were rewarded. In contrast to the people living under the 
Aztecs, conquered people under the Inca did not have to pay tribute. Rather, 
they were subject to the mit’a system , mandatory public service. Men between 
the ages of 15 and 50 provided agricultural and other forms of labor, including 
the construction of roads. 
38 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONReligion  The name Inca means “people of the sun,” and Inti, the sun 
god, was the most important of the Incan gods. Inca rulers were considered 
to be Inti’s representative on the earth. As the center of two critical elements 
in Incan religion²honoring of the sun and royal ancestor veneration²the 
Temple of the Sun  in Cuzco formed the core of Incan religion. 
Royal ancestor veneration was a practice intended to extend the rule of 
a leader. Dead rulers were mummified and continued to “rule” as they had 
in life and were thought to retain ownership of their servants, possessions, 
and property. Thus, Incan rulers could not expect to inherit land or property 
upon assuming power. This practice was a partial motivator for the constant 
expansion of the empire. 
Priests were consulted before important actions. To the Inca, the gods 
controlled all things, and priests could determine the gods’ will by studying the 
arrangement of coca leaves in a dish or by watching the movement of a spider. 
Priests diagnosed illnesses, predicted the outcome of battles, solved crimes, 
and determined what sacrifices should be made to which god. Serious events 
such as famines, plagues, and defeat in war called for human sacrifices²
although scholars do not believe that human sacrifice was practiced with the 
same frequency as it probably was with the Aztecs. 
Inca religion included some animism ²the belief that elements of the 
physical world could have supernatural powers. Called huaca, they could be 
large geographical features such as a river or a mountain peak. Or, they could 
be very small objects such as a stone, a plant, or a built object , such as a bridge. 
Achievements  In mathematics, the Inca developed the quipu,  a system of 
knotted strings used to record numerical information for trade and engineering 
and for recording messages to be carried throughout the empire. In agriculture, 
the Inca developed sophisticated terrace systems for the cultivation of crops 
such as potatoes and maize. The terraces utilized a technique called waru 
waru , raised beds with channels that captured and redirected rain to avoid 
erosion during floods and that stored water to be used during dry periods. 
The Inca were especially good builders of bridges and roads. Using captive 
labor, they constructed a massive roadway system called the Carpa Nan , with 
some 25,000 miles of roads used mainly by the government and military. In a 
mountainous region, bridges were particularly important.
Decline  Upon the arrival of Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro in 
152, the Incan Empire was in the midst of a civil war of succession after 
the death of emperor Huayna Capac. Some scholars believe that the civil war 
weakened the Incan army, making it easier for Pizarro’s forces to prevail. 
Others believe that other factors such as diseases introduced by the Europeans 
led to the decline. In 15, the Spanish conquered the core of the empire, 
although outposts held out until 152. Today, the Inca ruins at Machu Picchu 
are one of the most-visited sites in the world. 
39 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS Continuities and Diversity
Historians have debated how closely Mesoamerican cultures are related to 
one another. Many argue that most are based on the Olmec civilization, since 
many later cultures adopted some of its features. For example, the Olmecs’ 
feathered snake-god became fundamental in both the Mayan and Aztec 
religion. The subjects depicted on Olmec pottery have been found in pottery 
in other civilizations. The Olmecs’ ritual sacrifices, pyramids, and ball courts 
were also continued in other cultures. Other historians argue that different 
cultures developed complex civilizations more or less independently .

41 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AMERICAS SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“Unluckily, the accounts of Spanish authors concerning Maya mythology do 
not agree with the representations of the gods delineated >described precisely@ 
in the codices. That the three codices have a mythology in common is certain. 
Again, great difficulty is found in comparing the deities of the codices with 
those represented by the carved and stucco bas-reliefs of the Maya region. 
It will thus be seen that very considerable difficulties beset the student in 
this mythological sphere. So few data have yet been collected regarding 
the Maya mythology that to dogmatize >represent as absolute truth@ upon 
any subject connected with it would indeed be rash >impulsive@. But much 
has been accomplished in the past few decades, and evidence is slowly but 
surely accumulating from which sound conclusions can be drawn.”

Developments In Africa
After that the chief of the poets mounts the steps of the pempi [a raised 
platform on which the ruler sits] and lays his head on the sultan’s lap, then 
climbs to the top of the pempi and lays his head first on the sultan’ s right 
shoulder and then on his left, speaking all the while in their tongue, and finally 
he comes down again. I was told that this practice is a very old custom 
amongst them, prior to the introduction of Islam, and that they have kept it up.
—Ibn Battuta, c. 1352
Essential Question:   How and why did states develop in Africa and  
change over time? 
Ibn Battuta’s commentary on Mali society sheds light on the cultural forces at 
work in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1th century. A scholar from Morocco 
on the northwest coast of Africa, he was well versed in Islamic law, also known 
as shariah. Islamic governments in Mogadishu east Africa and Delhi India 
sought his advice and welcomed him to their lands. Ibn Battuta’s travelogue 
demonstrated how Islam’s phenomenal growth increased connections among 
cultures of Asia, Africa, and southern Europe. As Ibn Battuta’s account makes 
clear, African societies that had adopted Islam kept many of their traditions. 
Some parts of Africa resisted Islam. To better defend themselves against 
attacks by Islamic forces, they built churches with labyrinths, reservoirs, and 
tunnels. Other parts of the continent, especially in the south, had little contact 
with Islam until later in history.
Political Structures in Inland Africa
The development of Sub-Saharan Africa was heavily shaped by the migrations 
of Bantu-speaking people outward from west-central Africa. By the year 
1000, most of the region had adopted agriculture. With the sedentary nature 
of agriculture, people needed more complex political relationships to govern 
themselves. In contrast to most Asian or European societies, those in Sub-
Saharan Africa did not centralize power under one leader or central government. 
Instead, communities formed kin-based networks , where families governed 
themselves. A male head of the network, a chief , mediated conflicts and dealt 
with neighboring groups. Groups of villages became districts, and a group of 
chiefs decided among themselves how to solve the district’s problems.
44 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONAs populations grew, kin-based networks became more difficult to govern. 
Competition among neighbors increased, which in turn increased fighting 
among villages and districts. Survival for small kin-based communities 
became more challenging. Though many such communities continued to 
exist in Sub-Saharan Africa until the 1th century, larger kingdoms grew in 
prominence, particularly after 1000. 
The Hausa Kingdoms  Sometime before 1000, in what is now Nigeria, 
people of the Hausa ethnic group formed seven states, the Hausa Kingdoms . 
The states were loosely connected through kinship ties, though they too had 
no central authority. People established prospering city-states, each with a 
speciality. For example, several were situated in plains where cotton grew 
well. 
Though the region lacked access to the sea, contact with people from 
outside the region was important. Many Hausa benefited from the thriving 
trans-Saharan  trade , a network of trading routes across the great desert. 
A state on the western edge of the region specialized in military matters 
and defended the states against attack. Because the states lacked a central 
authority, however, they were frequently subject to domination from outside. 
In the 14th century, missionaries introduced Islam to the region. (Connect:

Political Structures of West and East Africa
.ingdoms on both the western and eastern sides of Africa benefited from 
increased trade. The exchange of goods brought them wealth, political power, 
and cultural diversity. The spread of Islam added to the religious diversity of 
the continent, where animism and Christianity were already practiced. Four of 
these kingdoms were Ghana, Mali, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia.
Ghana  Nestled between the Sahara and the tropical rain forests of the 
West African coast, the kingdom of Ghana  was not in the same location as 
the modern nation of Ghana. Historians believe that the kingdom had been 
founded during the 5th century, at least two centuries before the time of 
Muhammad, but Ghana reached its peak of influence from the 8th to the 11th 
centuries. Ghana’s rulers sold gold and ivory to Muslim traders in exchange 
for salt, copper, cloth, and tools. From Ghana’s capital city, .oumbi Saleh, the 
king ruled a centralized government aided by nobles and an army equipped 
with iron weapons.

most powerful of which was Mali . You will read more about Mali in Topic 2.. 
Most scholars believe that Mali’s founding ruler, Sundiata, was a Muslim and 
used his connections with others of his faith to establish trade relationships with 
North African and Arab merchants. Sundiata cultivated a thriving gold trade 
in Mali. Under his steady leadership, Mali’s wealth grew tremendously. His 
nephew, Mansa Musa, made a pilgrimage to Mecca where his lavish displays of 
gold left a lasting impression. See Topic 2. for the later developments in West 
Africa, such as the growth of the city of Timbuktu and the Songhai Empire.
Zimbabwe  In East Africa, the architecture demonstrated the growing 
wealth of one kingdom. Though most houses had traditionally been constructed 
from wood, by the th century chiefs had begun to construct their “zimbabwes,” 
the Bantu word for “dwellings,” with stone. This word became the name of 
one of the most powerful of all the East African kingdoms between the 12th 
and 15th centuries² Zimbabwe . It was situated between the =ambezi and 
Limpopo rivers in modern-day =imbabwe and Mozambique. 
=imbabwe built its prosperity on a mixture of agriculture, grazing, trade, 
and, above all, gold. Like Ghana and Mali on the other side of the continent, 
=imbabwe had rich gold fields, and taxes on the transport of gold made the 
kingdom wealthy. While Ghana and Mali relied on land-based trade across the 
Sahara, =imbabwe traded with the coastal city-states such as Mombasa, .ilwa, 
and Mogadishu. Through these ports, Zimbabwe was tied into the Indian 
Ocean trade , which connected East Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and 
East Asia. In East Africa, traders blended Bantu and Arabic to develop a new 
language, Swahili . Today, Swahili is spoken by various groups in the African 
Great Lakes region as well as other parts of Southeast Africa. 
The rise and decline of =imbabwe was reflected in the defensive walls 
used to protect cities. By the end of the 1th century, a massive wall of stone, 
0 feet tall by 15 feet thick, surrounded the capital city, which became known 
as the Great Zimbabwe . The stone wall was the first large one on the continent 
that people built without mortar. Inside the wall, most of the royal city’s 
buildings were made of stone. In the late 15th century, nearly 20,000 people 
resided within the Great =imbabwe. However, overgrazing so damaged the 
surrounding environment that residents of the bustling capital city abandoned 
it by the end of the 100s. The wall still stands in the modern country of 
Zimbabwe.
Ethiopia  Christianity had spread from its origins along the east coast of 
the Mediterranean Sea south into Egypt and beyond. In what is today Ethiopia , 
the kingdom of Axum developed. It prospered by trading goods obtained from 
India, Arabia, the Roman Empire, and the interior of Africa. Beginning in the 
th century, the spread of Islam made the region more diverse religiously. 
In the 12th century, a new Christian-led kingdom in Ethiopia emerged. Its 
rulers, like those of other countries, expressed their power through architecture. 
They ordered the creation of 11 massive churches made entirely of rock. 
47 DEVELOPMENTS IN AFRICACarved rock structures had been a feature of Ethiopian religious architecture 
since the 2nd millennium B.C.E.
From the 12th through the 16th centuries, Ethiopia was an island of 
Christianity on the continent of Africa. Separated from both the Roman 
Catholic Church of western Europe and the Orthodox Church of eastern 
Europe, Ethiopian Christianity developed independently. People combined 
their traditional faith traditions, such as ancestor veneration and beliefs in 
spirits, with Christianity to create a distinct form of faith. 
Social Structures of Sub-Saharan Africa
In Sub-Saharan Africa, strong central governments ruling over large territories  
were uncommon. Instead, Sub-Saharan Africa’s small communities were 
organized around several structures: kinship, age, and gender. .inship 
connections allowed people to identify first as members of a clan or family. 
Age was another significant social marker. An 18-year-old could do more hard 
labor than a 60-year-old, but younger people often relied on the advice of their 
elders. Thus, communities divided work according to age, creating age grades 
or age sets. Finally, gender had an influential role in social organization. 
• Men dominated most activities that required a specialized skill. For 
example, leather tanners and blacksmiths were typically men.

48 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITION• Women generally engaged in agriculture and food gathering. They also 
took the primary responsibilities for carrying out domestic chores and 
raising their family’s children.
Slavery in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southwest Asia  Slavery had a long 
history in Africa. Prisoners of war, debtors, and criminals were often enslaved. 
Most men and some women did agricultural work. Most women and some 
men served in households. In many kin-based societies, people could not own 
land privately, but they could own other people. Owning a large number of 
enslaved people increased one’s social status. Slavery existed in many forms.

A strong demand in the Middle East for enslaved workers resulted in an 
Indian Ocean slave trade  between East Africa and the Middle East. This 
trade started several centuries before the Atlantic Ocean slave trade between 
West Africa and the Americas. In some places, it lasted into the 20th century. 
The enslaved East Africans, known in Arabic as zanj,  provided valuable 
labor on sugar plantations in Mesopotamia. However, between 86 and 88, 
they and many Arab workers mounted a series of revolts known as the Zanj 
Rebellion . About 15,000 enslaved people successfully captured the city of 
Basra and held it for ten years before being defeated. The large size and long 
length of time before it was defeated make the =anj Rebellion one of the most 
successful slave revolts in history. 
49 DEVELOPMENTS IN AFRICACultural Life in Sub-Saharan Africa
Playing music, creating visual arts, and telling stories were and continue to be 
important aspects of cultures everywhere because they provided enjoyment 
and mark rituals such as weddings and funerals. In Africa, these activities 
carried additional significance. Because traditional African religions included 
ancestor veneration, song lyrics provided a means of communicating with the 
spirit world. African music usually had a distinctive rhythmic pattern, and 
vocals were interspersed with percussive elements such as handclaps, bells, 
pots, or gourds.
9isual arts also commonly served a religious purpose. For example, 
metalworkers created busts of past rulers so that ruling royalty could look to 
them for guidance. Artists in Benin, West Africa, were famous for their intricate 
sculptures in iron and bronze. In the late 1th century, the sophistication of 
these pieces of art would cause some Europeans to increase their respect for  
West African cultures.
Griots and Griottes  Literature, as it existed in Sub-Saharan Africa, was 
oral. Griots, or storytellers,  were the conduits of history for a community. 
Griots possessed encyclopedic knowledge of family lineages and the lives and 
deeds of great leaders. In general, griots were also adept at music, singing their 
stories and accompanying themselves on instruments, such as the drums and a 
12-string harp called the kora. 
The griots were both venerated and feared as they held both the power of 
language and of story. People said that a griot could sing your success or sing 
your downfall. By telling and retelling their stories and histories, the griots 
preserved a people’s history and passed that history on from generation to 
generation. .ings often sought their counsel regarding political matters. When 
a griot died, it was as though a library had burned. 
Just as men served as griots, women served as griottes. They would sing 
at special occasions, such as before a wedding. For example, the griotte would 
counsel the bride to not talk back if her mother-in-law abused her or reassure 
the bride that if things got too bad, she could return home. Griottes provided 
women with a sense of empowerment in a patriarchal society.

Developments in Europe 
I should not wish to be Aristotle if this were to separate me from Christ.
—Peter Abelard, Letter 17 to Heloise (1141)
Essential Question   How did the beliefs and practices of the predominant 
religions, agricultural practices, and political 
decentralization affect European society from  
c. 1200 to c. 1450?
As the Roman Empire declined in power in the 5th and 6th centuries, 
Western Europe entered the Middle Ages, sometimes called the medieval 
period. Throughout Europe, trade declined, intellectual life receded, and the 
united Roman state was replaced by smaller kingdoms that frequently fought 
one another for control of territory. In response, European kings, lords, and 
peasants worked out agreements to provide for common defense. Only the 
Roman Catholic Church remained powerful in most of Europe from Roman 
times to the 16th century.
However, between 1000 to 1450, learning and trade began to revive in 
Europe. This era is called the High Middle Ages. Like many scholars of this 
period, Peter Abelard studied classical thinkers such as Aristotle and sometimes 
criticized the Church, but he remained a faithful throughout his life. 
Feudalism: Political and Social Systems
European civilization in the Middle Ages was characterized by a decentralized 
political organization based on a system of exchanges of land for loyalty 
known as feudalism . Lacking a strong government, people needed some 
protection from bandits, rival lords, and invaders such as the 9ikings from 
northern Europe. The core of feudalism was a system of mutual obligations:
• A monarch, usually a king, granted tracts of land, called fiefs, to lords. 
In return, a lord became a king’s vassal , a person who owed service to 
another person of higher status. 
• Lords then provided land to knights. In return, knights became vassals 
of the lord, and pledged to fight for the lord or king.
• Lords also provided land and protection to peasants. In return, peasants 
were obligated to farm the lord’s land and provide the lord with crops 
and livestock, and to obey the lord’s orders. 
54 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONFeudalism provided some security for peasants, equipment for warriors, 
and land to those who served a lord. Since the entire system was based on 
agriculture, wealth was measured in land rather than in cash.
The feudal system incorporated a code of chivalry ²an unwritten set 
of rules for conduct focusing on honor, courtesy, and bravery²as a way to 
resolve disputes. Since women were to be protected, the code put them on a 
pedestal while not investing them with any significant additional importance. 
In practice, women did not have many rights. (Connect: Compare European 
feudalism and Japanese feudalism. See Topic 1.1.
Manorial System  Large fiefs or estates were also referred to as 
manors . The manorial system  provided economic self-sufficiency and 
defense. The manor produced everything that people living on it required, 
limiting the need for trade or contact with outsiders. Many serfs spent their 
entire lives on a single manor, little aware of events in the rest of Europe.
Manor grounds were small villages that often included a church, a 
blacksmith shop, a mill, and wine presses. They included the homes of 
peasants known as serfs . Serfs, while not enslaved, were tied to the land. 
This meant they could not travel without permission from their lords. Nor 
could they marry without their lord’s approval. In exchange for protection 
provided by the lord of the manor, they paid tribute in the form of crops, 
labor, or, in rare cases, coins. Children born to serfs also became serfs.
As both climate and technology slowly improved, the amount of arable 
or farmable land gradually increased. Agriculture became more efficient 
near the end of the Middle Ages. The three-field system , in which crops 
were rotated through three fields, came into use. 
• One field was planted with wheat or rye, crops that provided food.
• A second field was planted with legumes such as peas, lentils, or 
beans. These made the soil more fertile by adding nitrogen to it.
• A third field was allowed to remain fallow, or unused, each year. 
Technological developments included windmills and new types of plows. 
Heavier plows with wheels worked well in the dense soil north of the Alps, 
while lighter plows worked better in southern Europe. These changes 
promoted population growth.
Political Trends in the Later Middle Ages
In the later Middle Ages, monarchies grew more powerful at the expense 
of feudal lords by employing their own bureaucracy and a military. These 
employees worked directly for the king or queen. In contrast, in modern  
countries such as the United States, bureaucrats and soldiers work for the 
country, not the chief executive. The lands these monarchs collected under 
their control, particularly in England and France, were beginning to look 
like the modern countries of Europe.

bureaucracy. Yet it was not until Philip I9 ruled 1285±11 that the first 
Estates-General   met. The Estates-General was a body to advise the king 
that included representatives from each of the three legal classes, or estates , 
in France: the clergy, nobility, and commoners. Although the French kings 
consulted this Estates-General when necessary, they did not exact regular taxes 
from the upper two estates, the clergy and nobility. Consequently, the Estates-
General had little power. The clergy and nobility felt little responsibility 
to protect a government that they were not financing, a problem that only 
continued to increase in France up to the eve of the French Revolution of 18.
Holy Roman Empire  The German king Otto I  was crowned Holy  Roman 
Emperor in 962, hearkening back to Charlemagne’s designation as Emperor 
of the Romans. Otto’s successors survived the power struggle with the papacy 
over the lay investiture controversy  of the 11th and 12th centuries. This 
dispute was over whether a secular non-religious leader, rather than the 
pope, could invest bishops with the symbols of office. It was finally resolved 
in the Concordat of Worms of 1122, when the Church achieved autonomy 
from secular authorities. The Holy Roman Empire remained vibrant until it 
was virtually destroyed during the Thirty Years’ War 1618±168. It lingered 
on, but with little power. The Empire came to a formal end when the French 
leader Napoleon Bonaparte invaded central Europe in 1806.
56 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONNorman England  The Normans  were descendents of 9ikings who settled 
in northwestern France, a region known as Normandy. In 1066, a Norman 
king, William the Conqueror, successfully invaded England. This gave him 
kingdoms on both sides of the English Channel. He presided over a tightly 
organized feudal system, using royal sheriffs as his administrative officials. 
The fusion of Normans and Anglo-Saxons created the modern English people.
Many English nobles objected to the power of William and the succeeding 
Norman monarchs. These nobles forced limits on that power. In 1215, they 
forced .ing John to sign the Magna Carta , which required the king to respect 
certain rights, such as the right to a jury trial before a noble could be sentenced 
to prison. They also won the right to be consulted on the issue of scutage a tax 
paid on a knight who wanted to pay money instead of provide military service. 
Finally, the first English Parliament  was formed in 1265. These developments 
increased the rights of the English nobility, but not of the general population.
In the first full parliamentary meeting in 1265, the House of Lords 
represented the nobles and Church hierarchy, while the House of Commons 
was made up of elected representatives of wealthy townspeople. Eventually, 
the power of these two legislative bodies in England became stronger than that 
of similar bodies on the European continent. 
The Hundred Years’ War  Between 1 and 15, the rival monarchies 
of England and France fought a series of battles known as the Hundred Years’ 
War. English archers armed with longbows about six feet long helped win 
several early victories. However, by the end of the conflict, the English retained 
only the port of Calais in France. Two other important results of the war were 
on how people saw themselves and how they fought. 
• On each side, serving under a monarch fostered a sense of unity 
among soldiers who often spoke distinct languages or dialects. The 
war marked another step towards people identifying themselves as 
“English” or “French” rather than from a particular region. 
• The war also demonstrated the spreading use of gunpowder weapons. 
Gunpowder had been invented by the Chinese and spread west by 
Mongols. 
Christians versus Muslims  In addition to conquering England, the 
Normans also conquered Sicily, taking control of that Mediterranean island 
from Muslims. Muslims had conquered Spain in the 8th century. From that 
time, Christians had wanted to reconquer it. This effort, called the reconquista , 
occurred over many centuries. It was finally completed in 12.
Roman Catholic Church during the Middle Ages 
In 1054, the Christian Church in Europe divided into two branches, a split 
called the Great Schism . The Roman Catholic Church continued to dominate 
most of Europe for another five centuries, while the Orthodox Church was 
powerful farther east, from Greece to Russia. 
57 DEVELOPMENTS IN E UROPE The Roman Catholic Church was the most powerful institution in a Europe 
divided into hundreds of small political states. Often Church staff were the 
only people in a community who knew how to read and write. If common 
people needed something written or read, they asked a Church official to do 
it. Most manors had a small church and a priest on the grounds. Christianity 
provided people a shared identity even as vernacular languages, ones spoken 
by the people in a region, emerged to replace Latin.
Education and Art  The Church established the first universities in 
Europe. Because the Church led in the area of education, most philosophers, 
writers, and other thinkers of the Middle Ages were religious leaders. All 
artists worked for the Church. Most artwork focused on religious themes, 
which provided images to help illiterate serfs understand the Bible.
Church and State  The Church held great power in the feudal system. 
If a lord displeased the Church, it could pressure the lord in various ways. 
For example, a local bishop might cancel religious services for his serfs. This 
angered the serfs, who would demand that the lord give in to the bishop.
Like the Roman Empire, the Roman Catholic Church had an extensive 
hierarchy of regional leaders. The regional religious leaders, called bishops, 
owed allegiance to the pope, the supreme bishop in Rome. The bishops also 
selected and supervised local priests. 
Monasticism  Although some Christian clergy withdrew to monasteries 
to meditate and pray, they remained part of the economies of Western 
Europe. The monasteries had the same economic functions of agriculture 
and protection as other manors. Women were permitted to become nuns and 
exerted their influence in the monasteries of the Catholic Church. 
Reform  Although clergy took vows of poverty and supported charities 
in their communities, the clergy also wielded considerable political influence, 
and some monasteries became quite wealthy. Wealth and political power led 
to corruption during the 1th and 1th centuries. Eventually, corruption, as 
well as theological disagreements, drove reformers such as Martin Luther to 
take stands that would shatter the unity of the Roman Catholic Church in the 
16th century.
Christian Crusades 
Just as Europeans fought to drive Muslims out of Sicily and Spain, they also 
sought to reclaim control of the Holy Land, the region of Palestine in the 
Middle East that contains sites of spiritual significance to Jews, Christians, 
and Muslims. European Christians had enjoyed access to these lands for 
centuries, even after they came under the control of Muslims. 
Social and economic trends of the 11th century added to the pressure 
among Europeans to invade the Middle East. Rules of primogeniture , under 
which the eldest son in a family inherited the entire estate, left a generation 
of younger sons with little access to wealth and land. The landed nobles saw 
58 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONa military campaign as a way to divert the ambitions of these restless nobles 
as well as unemployed peasants, who often pillaged the lands of neighboring 
lords. Furthermore, merchants desired unfettered access to trade routes through 
the Middle East. The combination of these religious, social, and economic 
pressures resulted in the Crusades— a series of European military campaigns 
in the Middle East between 1095 and the 1200s.
Politics shaped the conduct of Crusades. Tensions between popes and 
kings strengthened the intention of the Roman Catholic Church to take control. 
The Church also used its spiritual authority to recruit believers. It granted 
relief from required acts of atonement and penance and even promised people 
they would reach heaven sooner if they joined a Crusade. Support came for the 
Orthodox branch of Christianity as well. Alarmed by news of the persecution of 
Christian pilgrims by Seljuk Turks, the Orthodox patriarch at Constantinople 
appealed to Pope Urban II to help retake the Holy Land from Islamic control. 
The First Crusade  Of the four major Crusades, only the first was a clear 
victory for Christendom. The European army conquered Jerusalem in July 
10. However, Muslim forces under Saladin regained control of Jerusalem 
in 118. The Crusades did promote cultural exchange between Europe and the 
Middle East. The Middle East had a higher standard of living, and European 
Crusaders increased the demand for Middle Eastern goods.  (Connect: Create 
a timeline tracing the spread of Islam up through the Crusades. See Topic 1.2.
The Fourth Crusade  During the fourth and last major Crusade 1202±
120, 9enice, a wealthy city-state in northern Italy, had a contract to transport 
Crusaders to the Middle East, an area known as the Levant. However, 9enice 
was not paid all of what was due, so the 9enetians persuaded the Crusader 
debtors first to sack =ara, an Italian city, and then Constantinople, a major 
trade competitor of 9enice. The Fourth Crusade never made it to the Holy 
Land. Eventually, Islamic forces prevailed in the Levant. 
Economic and Social Change
The Crusades were just part of the changes occurring in Europe in the late 
Middle Ages. Local economic self-sufficiency in Europe gradually gave way 
to an interest in goods from other European areas and from far-flung ports. 
Marco Polo  In the late 1th century Marco Polo , an Italian native 
from 9enice, visited the court of .ublai .han in Dadu, modern-day Beijing. 
Polo’s captivating descriptions of the customs of the people he met intrigued 
Europeans. For example, he described how Mongols had multiple marriages, 
drank mare’s milk, burned black stones (coal) to heat their homes, and bathed 
frequently  ²often three times per week. Curiosity about Asia skyrocketed, 
stimulating interest in cartography, or mapmaking.
Social Change  Growth in long-distance commerce changed the social 
pyramid of Western Europe. Economic success started to rival religious 
vocation or military service in winning status. This middle class, between the 
59 DEVELOPMENTS IN E UROPE elite nobles and clergy and the mass of peasants, began to grow. .nown as the 
bourgeoisie , or burghers , it included shopkeepers, merchants, craftspeople, 
and small landholders. 
Urban Growth  With renewed commerce came larger cities. The change 
to the three-field system and other advances in agriculture led to population 
growth in the late Middle Ages. This agricultural surplus encouraged the 
growth of towns and of markets that could operate more frequently than 
just on holidays. As the demand for more labor on the manors increased, the 
supply decreased. A series of severe plagues swept through Eurasia in the 1th 
century. In Europe, an outbreak of bubonic plague known as the Black Death 
killed as many as one-third of the population. The growing demand for labor 
and the deaths of so many people gave serfs more bargaining power with lords. 
Urban growth was hampered after about 100 by a five-century cooling 
of the climate known as the Little Ice Age . Lower temperatures reduced 
agricultural productivity, so people had less to trade and cities grew more 
slowly. The Little Ice Age led to an increase in disease and an increase in 
unemployment. These, in turn, created social unrest. The crime rate increased, 
and Jews, and other groups that already faced discrimination, were the victims 
of scapegoating²being blamed for something over which they had no control.
Jews  During the Middle Ages, the small Jewish population in Christian 
Europe began to grow. Many Jews lived in Muslim areas in the Iberian 
Peninsula present-day Spain and Portugal and around the Mediterranean 
Sea when these areas were overtaken by European Christians. In time, Jews 
who could afford to moved northward in Europe. Some political leaders, 
particularly in Amsterdam and other commercial cities, welcomed them, since 
they brought valuable experience in business and trade.
The Roman Catholic Church also had a policy that Christians could not 
charge interest on loans to other Christians. However, Jews were not bound 
by this restriction. With few other economic opportunities, many northern 
European Jews became moneylenders. The resulting increase in the flow of 
money contributed to the economic growth of Europe. 
However, anti-Jewish sentiment, or antisemitism , was widespread among 
Christians. They thought of Jews as outsiders and untrustworthy. Jews were 
expelled from England in 120, France in 1, Spain in 12, and Portugal in 
1, as well as from various independent kingdoms and cities in northern and 
central Europe. Jews expelled from western and central Europe often moved to 
eastern Europe. While Jews had lived in this region since the 1st century, their 
numbers increased greatly because of the expulsions.
Muslims  Like Jews, Muslims faced discrimination in Europe. In 12, 
the Spanish king expelled the remaining Muslims in the kingdom who would 
not convert to Christianity. Many Muslims moved to southeastern Europe. In 
the 1th century, the Muslim Ottoman Empire expanded its reach from Turkey 
into the Balkan countries of present-day Albania, .osovo, and Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. These countries developed large Muslim populations. 
60 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONWhile Europe was predominantly Christian, and despite their persecution, 
both Jews and Muslims helped shape society. Unlike most people in Europe in 
the Middle Ages, Jews lived in urban areas, and they served as a bridge between 
Christians and the Muslims whose goods they desired in trade. Contacts with 
traders in Muslim caliphates opened up a world of trade and a world of ideas 
for Europeans who had long been self-sufficient and isolated under feudalism.
Gender Roles  Women found their rights eroding as a wave of patriarchal 
thinking and writing accompanied the movement from an agricultural society 
to a more urban one. Even fewer women than men received an education, 
although women often managed manor accounts. One place where women had 
greater opportunities to display their skills in administration and leadership was 
in religious orders. Some women became artisans and members of guilds²
associations of craftspeople and merchants²although not all had property 
rights. Women in Islamic societies tended to enjoy higher levels of equality, 
particularly in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. 
Renaissance
The expansion of trade, the growth of an agricultural surplus, and the rise of 
a middle class able to patronize artists sparked great creativity in Europe. The 
Renaissance  was a period characterized by a revival of interest in classical 
Greek and Roman literature, art, culture, and civic virtue. Scholars recovered 
and studied decaying manuscripts that had been written many centuries earlier. 
Developed in 1, Johannes Gutenberg’s movable-type printing press initiated 
a revolution in print technology. The printing press allowed manuscripts to be 
mass-produced at relatively affordable costs. It fostered a growth in literacy 
and the rapid spread of ideas.
One characteristic of the Renaissance was the interest in humanism , the 
focus on individuals rather than God. Humanists sought education and reform. 
They began to write secular literature. Cultural changes in the Renaissance, 
such as the increased use of the vernacular language, propelled the rise of 
powerful monarchies, the centralization of governments, and the birth of 
nationalism. Connect: List three elements of classical Greece and Rome 
revived by the Renaissance. See Prologue. 
Southern Renaissance  In the regions of Italy and Spain, church patronage 
supported the Renaissance. For example, the writer Dante Alighieri 1265±
121 used a religious framework for The Divine Comedy, which features hell, 
purgatory, and heaven. Nevertheless, his fearlessness in criticizing corrupt 
religious officials and his willingness to use Italian vernacular instead of 
Latin reflected his independence from the Roman Catholic Church. Wealthy 
families, such as the Medicis of Florence, used their money to support painters, 
sculptors, and architects. 
Northern Renaissance  By 100, the Renaissance spirit spread to northern 
Europe. While many Renaissance artists emphasized piety in their work, others 
61 DEVELOPMENTS IN E UROPE emphasized human concerns. Geoffrey Chaucer, writing in The Canterbury 
Tales in the late 100s, portrayed a microcosm of middle-class occupations in 
England, including several Church positions. His satirical writings portrayed 
monks who loved hunting and overly sentimental nuns. Like Dante a century 
earlier, Chaucer chose a vernacular, Middle English, for this work, although 
many of his other writings were in Latin.

The Origins of Russia 
During the late Middle Ages in Eastern Europe, extensive trade in furs, fish, 
and grain connected people from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean to Central 
Asia. The city-state at the center of this trade was .ievan Rus, based in 
what is today .iev, Ukraine. Because it adopted the Orthodox Christianity, 
it maintained closer cultural relationships with Byzantium than with Roman 
Catholic Europe. In the 1th century, the Mongols overtook this region, so it 
developed even more separately from of the rest of Europe. See Topic 2.2.
The Mongols required local nobles to collect taxes for them. As these 
nobles grew wealthy in their role, they began to resist Mongol rule. In the late 
15th century, under the leadership of a Moscow-based ruler known as Ivan 
the Great, the region became independent of the Mongols. This marked the 
beginning of the modern state of Russia.

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:  IDENTIFY  HISTORICAL  DEVELOPMENTS
Europe in c. 1200 was an area of decentralized feudal kingdoms with 
little contact with the world beyond the manor. Europe in c. 1450, in 
contrast, was a region of agricultural abundance, growing towns and 
cities, increasing trade with other parts of the world, growing commerce, 
and centralizing states. 
For each of the following aspects of life in Europe, write a sentence 
identifying a development—an event or series of events that fit into 
a broader pattern—that contributed to the changes between c. 1200 
and c. 1450. Review the chapter as needed.

Essential Question:   In what ways was the process of state-building  
in various parts of the world between c. 1200  
and c. 1450 similar and different? 
Between c. 1200 and c. 150, states in core areas of civilization grew larger 
while smaller states declined. In this way, much of the world followed the 
same trend of building more centralized, more powerful states. However, the 
process varied from place to place. In most of Asia, the military strength of 
the Mongols created the largest land-based empire in world history. In West 
Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, the religion of Islam was a key part 
of state-building. In Europe, trade, both internal and with the more advanced 
civilizations of the Middle East, had greater impact. 
State-Building and New Empires
As stronger, more centralized states rose, the influence of nomadic societies 
began to wane by the 15th century. During this period, new empires emerged 
and states around the world expanded. 
• The Song Dynasty in China continued a long period of technological 
and cultural progress.
• The Abbasid Caliphate in the Middle East was fragmented by invaders 
and shifts in trade. Following it, new Muslim states arose in Africa, the 
Middle East, and Spain.
• In South and Southeast Asia, the Chola .ingdom and 9ijayanagar 
Empire used trade to build strong states, while the Delhi Sultanate in 
northern India was more land-based.
• In Africa, the rulers of Mali created an empire that was bigger and 
more centrally administered than the Empire of Ghana that preceded it.
66 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITION• In the Americas, the Aztecs formed a tributary empire in Mesoamerica 
that relied on a strong military. The Inca Empire in the Andean region 
used the elaborate mit’a system as a way to support state-building. In 
contrast, most of the Americas lacked centralized states.
• In Europe, feudal ties declined in importance as centralized states 
developed. This development was clearer in the Western European 
kingdoms of England and France than in Eastern Europe. 
• Japan, unlike most states, became more decentralized and feudal.
The Role of Religion in State-Building
One similarity in much of the world was that religion was a vital part of state-
building. To help unite a diverse population, empires and states often turned 
to religion to strengthen political control over their territory. One excellent 
example of how religion worked with state-building was in the Islamic world. 
Through the unifying power of shared beliefs and a use of the common 
language of Arabic, Islam provided the basis for the legitimacy of rulers from 
West Africa to Southeast Asia.
China and East Asia  Other states also were strengthened by religion. In 
China, the Confucian belief system was closely tied to civil service. The Song 
Dynasty relied on Confucian scholars to run a powerful, enduring bureaucracy. 
No other state had such a well-established and extensive system for conducting 
government affairs across such a large territory. The ability to implement laws 
and carry out imperial edicts was a key part of state-building in China.
Neo-Confucianism see Topic 1.1 spread to .orea and Japan, allowing 
rulers in these East Asian regions to justify and consolidate their political power 
as well. Similarly, rulers in South and Southeast Asia relied on Hinduism and 
Buddhism to aid them in strengthening their states.
Europe  In Europe, the relationship between Roman Catholic Church and 
state-building was somewhat different than in most of Eurasia. At times, the 
Church was part of the state-building process. However, because European 
states were so weak for most of the Middle Ages, the Church had provided 
an alternative structure for organizing society. Then, between 1200 and 150, 
as more powerful states emerged in France and the Holy Roman Empire, the 
Church sometimes became a rival power. 
Diffusion of Religion  The spread of major religions during this time 
period resulted in the influence of religion over wide areas. Islam, Buddhism, 
and Christianity all encouraged their followers to convert non-believers. 
Therefore, missionary activity was an important factor in the decline in the 
practice of local religions in places such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast 
Asia, and East Asia. In South Asia, converts to Islam increased partly as a 
result of military invasions by Islamic armies from Central Asia. However, 
Hinduism remained the predominant religion in South Asia, setting the stage 
for intermittent periods of conflict and tolerance between followers of Islam 
67 COMPARISON IN THE PERIO D FROM C. 1200 TO C. 1450 COMPARISON IN THE PERIO D FROM C. 1200 TO C. 1450 67and Hinduism on the sub-continent. Trade networks in the Indian Ocean, 
South China Sea, East and Central Asia, and across the Sahara Desert helped 
to spread religions as commercial activity increased. 
State-Building Through Trade
Fueled by increased trade, cross-cultural exchanges of technology and 
innovation increased. Innovations in crop production, such as Champa rice 
that spread from 9ietnam to China, helped the Song Dynasty feed and sustain 
a growing population. The resulting effect, a larger and more urban citizenry, 
supported the development of China’s manufacturing capability²the largest 
in the world at the time. Porcelain, silk, steel, and iron production all increased 
during this time. Together, these changes built the Song into the strongest state 
in China since the time of the Han a millennium earlier.
Paper manufacturing, invented in China in the 2nd century B.C.E., made 
its way across Eurasia, reaching Europe around the 1th century. The resulting 
printed material led to increased literacy rates across Europe, the Middle East, 
and North Africa. The focus on intellectual thought and learning led to advances 
in mathematics and medicine, especially in Islamic centers of learning such as 
the House of Wisdom in Bagdad. 
Europe benefited from exchanges with the Middle East, and through it 
with the rest of Asia. Not all contact between Europe and Asia was peaceful. 
Muslims had conquered Spain by force in the 8th century and Christian 
crusaders attempted to seize lands they considered holy in the Middle East 
beginning around 1100. The Mongols fostered the transfer of knowledge, but 
only after they carried out brutal conquests. All of these contacts with Asia 
contributed to state-building in Europe. Between 1200 and 150, the process 
was small and slow, held back by the manorial system and serfdom, but it was 
noticeable. After 150, state-building would increase in speed and significance 
in Europe.
The Impact of Nomadic Peoples
Nomadic peoples played a key role in the process of state building between 
1200 and 150. The Mongols, a pastoral people from the steppes of Central 
Asia, ruled over significant areas of Asia and Eastern Europe during the 1th 
century. (For more on the Mongols, see Topic 2.2.) The political stability 
resulting from Mongol dominance allowed trade across Eurasia to greatly 
expand. Cross-cultural interactions and transfers intensified and some of 
the first direct contacts between Europe and China since the classical period 
occurred, also facilitated by Mongol rule.  
Similar to the Mongols, Turkish peoples, also from the Central Asian 
steppes, increased their dominance over large land-based empires in the eastern 
Mediterranean, Persia, and South Asia that lasted well past 150. However, 
unlike the Mongols, who built their empire initially as a coordinated campaign 
by unified Mongol clans, different Turkish groups built separate empires. 
68 WORLD HISTORY  MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe Seljuk and Ottoman Turks became dominant forces in the Mediterranean 
region while another Turkish group established an empire located in Persia and 
the surrounding territories. 
The creation of these empires would be among the last major impacts of 
the interaction between settled and nomadic peoples. The role of nomads in 
commerce and cross-cultural exchange diminished as they were replaced by 
organized groups of merchants and trading companies.
Patriarchy and Religion
Social organization in most cultures remained patriarchal. However, cultures 
varied. While religion often reinforced the power of men, its record was mixed.  
For example, convent life for Christians in Europe and in Jainist and Buddhist 
religious communities in South Asia provided women with opportunities for 
learning and leadership. In contrast, in China, women lost some independence 
as the custom of foot binding became more common.

UNIT 1 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   WHO DEVELOPE D GUNS?
The development of gunpowder and its use in guns revolutionized 
world history. However, historians presented various arguments to 
explain who was responsible for starting this revolution.
Chinese Claims and European Doubts  While the Chinese 
long took credit for developing both gunpowder and guns, European 
historians were traditionally skeptical because they doubted the 
Chinese had the technological ability to make such advances. For 
example, Henry Hime, a British military officer, argued in his 10 
book, Gunpowder and Ammunition: Their Origin and Progress,  
that the Chinese “possessed little genius for mechanical or chemical 
inventions” so they had probably “obtained their first gunpowder and 
firearms from the West.” 
Fireworks  European scholars gradually recognized Chinese 
contributions to the technologies that led to the development of guns. 
They first recognized that the Chinese had invented gunpowder and 
that knowledge of the explosive substance had been carried by traders 
and the Mongols to Europe in the 1th century. However, European 
historians continued to argue that the Chinese had used gunpowder only 
for fireworks, not for weaponry. Historian Jack .elly, in a recent book 
about the history of gunpowder, noted that historians had not moved 
much beyond Hime’s argument in their views of Chinese abilities. “The 
notion of China’s benign relationship with gunpowder sprang in part 
from Western prejudices about the Chinese character. Some viewed the 
Chinese as amateurs who stumbled onto the secret of gunpowder but 
couldn’t see its potential. Others saw them as pacifist sages who wisely 
turned away from its destructive possibilities.” 
Agreement  The next step was for Europeans to acknowledge that 
the Chinese historians were correct, and that the Chinese had begun 
using gunpowder to make early forms of guns since the 10th century. 
British scholar Joseph Needham revolutionized Western attitudes 
toward China with his multivolume work Science and Civilization in 
China . Begun in 15, it continued after Needham’s death under other 
scholars and now includes more than 25 volumes. Needham called 
the development of gunpowder “no doubt the greatest of all Chinese 
military inventions.” And he concluded that the Chinese had developed 
the first gun “before other peoples knew of the invention at all.” 
Develop an Argument:  Evaluate the extent to which historical 
evidence supports one of the perspectives on the historical development 
and use of gunpowder. Review outside sources as necessary.

Understand the Context
Between 1200 and 1450, economic activity along existing trade routes 
increased in volume and scope. Technological and commercial innovations, 
imperial expansion, and demand for luxury goods were key factors in the 
ongoing expansion of trade. Growing trade networks accelerated cultural, 
biological, and technological diffusion across Afro-Eurasia. 
Factors that Expanded Trade  Between 1200 and 1450, the rise of 
powerful states and empires played a critical role in increasing the volume and 
geographical reach of existing trade networks. The Mongol Empire promoted 
trade along the Silk Roads, creating a vast commercial network across Eurasia. 
Trade routes across the Sahara and in the Indian Ocean added both West 
Africa and East Africa to this network. Improvements to previously existing 
commercial practices, including forms of credit, facilitated larger networks 
of exchange. Driving this growth in trade was a growing demand for luxury 
goods, such as silk and porcelain from China and gold from Africa. 
Consequences of Trade  In the context of this growing trade, powerful 
new trading cities emerged scattered across Africa and Eurasia. Trade provided 
the setting for significant cross-cultural exchanges. As merchants and other 
travelers moved from place to place, they introduced religious beliefs such as 
Islam and developments in technology such as paper making and gunpowder 
to new communities. Against the backdrop of this transfer of ideas and things, 
came also the rapid spread of deadly diseases, most notably the bubonic plague.

The Silk Roads
And don’t forget that if you treat the customhouse oѝcers with respect,

—Italian merchant Francesco Balducci Peglotti (1471)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the growth  
of networRs  of e_change  after 1200?
More than 1,00 years after the first accounts of travel on the Silk Roads, 
these fabled routes that had fallen into disuse had revived by the 8th and 9th 
centuries. As described by merchant Peglotti, the land route of the Silk Roads 
was vibrant and essential to interregional trade in the 14th and 15th centuries. 
Demand for luxury goods increased in Europe and Africa. Chinese, Persian, 
and Indian artisans and merchants expanded their production of textiles and 
porcelains for export. Caravans made travel safer and more practical, and the 
Chinese developed a system using paper money to manage increasing trade. 
Interregional trade on the Silk Roads flourished.
Causes of the Growth of Exchange Networks
The Crusades helped pave the way to expanding networks of exchange, as 
lords and their armies of knights brought back fabrics and spices from the 
East. Despite the inroads on the Byzantine Empire by the Ottoman Turks, the 
Silk Roads trade routes remained in operation, as did sea routes across the 
Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. China was still eager for Europe’s 
gold and silver, and Europe was growing more eager than ever for silk, tea, 
and rhubarb. Global trade increased. Although Europeans had not yet found 
a route around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, they had 
been making overland trips across Europe for many centuries. 
Rise of New Empires  After the collapse of classical civilizations such 
as the Roman and Han empires, the first golden age of the Silk Roads came 
to an end, and activity declined dramatically. However, by the 8th and 9th 
centuries, Arab merchants from the Abbasid Empire revived the land route 
of the Silk Roads as well as sea routes in the Indian Ocean. Tang China had 
much to offer the newly revived global trade network, including the compass, 
78 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONpaper, and gunpowder. China exported porcelain, tea, and silk. From other 
parts of Asia, China imported cotton, precious stones, pomegranates, dates, 
horses, and grapes. These luxury goods appealed to the upper class of Chinese 
society, whose members reveled in their country’s newfound affluence. This 
period marked the second golden age of the Silk Roads.
No other cause, however, had as significant an impact on the expansion of 
trade as did the rise of the Mongol Empire . Mongols conquered the Abbasid 
Caliphate in 1258, and in the 14th century China came under their control as 
well. Parts of the Silk Roads that were under the authority of different rulers 
were, for the first time, unified in a system under the control of an authority 
that respected merchants and enforced laws. The Mongols improved roads 
and punished bandits, both of which increased the safety of travel on the Silk 
Roads. New trade channels were also established between Asia, the Middle 
East, Africa, and Europe. Those who survived the conquests by the Mongols 
and their descendants benefited from the reinvigoration of trade routes that had 
not been heavily used since the days of the Roman and Han Empires. (You will 
read more about the Mongols in Topic 2.2.)
Improvements in Transportation Technologies  Another cause for the 
expansion of exchange networks was the improvement of transportation. 
Travelers on the overland Silk Roads learned that traveling with others in 
caravans was safer than traveling alone. They also learned how to design 
saddles for camels that greatly increased the weight of the load the animals 
could carry. 
Centuries earlier, China had made advances in naval technology that 
allowed it to control sea-based trade routes in the South China Sea. During 
the Han Dynasty, Chinese scientists developed the magnetic compass  and 
improved the rudder , both of which helped aid navigation and ship control 
along the seas. The Chinese junk , also developed in the Han Dynasty, was 
a boat similar to the Southwest Asian dhow. It had multiple sails and was 
as long as 400 feet—at least triple the size of the typical Western European 
ship of its time. The hull of a junk was divided into compartments. The walls 
making these divisions strengthened the ship for rough voyages at sea and 
made sinking less likely.

Two significant effects of the expansion and stability of the Silk Roads were 
the series of oases that developed along the routes, including thriving cities, 
and commercial innovations that greatly helped to manage the increasing 
trade. 
Cities and Oases  Long stretches of the overland Silk Roads passed 
through inhospitable terrain—hot arid lands where water was scarce. Cities 
along the routes that were watered by rivers became thriving centers of trade. 
For example, the city of Kashgar  is located at the western edge of China where 
northern and southern routes of the Silk Roads crossed, leading to destinations 
79 THE SI LK ROA DS79in Central Asia, India, Pakistan, and Persia. It sits where the Taklamakan Desert 
meets the Tian Shan Mountains and is watered by the Kashgar River, which 
has made the lands along it fertile for crops such as wheat, rice, fruits, and 
cotton. Travelers on the Silk Roads depended on Kashgar for its abundance 
of water and food. Artisans in Kashgar produced textiles, rugs, leather goods, 
and pottery. Its food and handicrafts were sold in a bustling market. At the 
crossroads of both ideas and goods, the once primarily Buddhist city also 
became a center of Islamic scholarship. 
Similarly, Samarkand,  in present-day Uzbekistan in the Zeravshan River 
valley, was a stopping point on the Silk Roads between China and the 
Mediterranean. Samarkand was a center of cultural exchange as much as it was 
a center for trading goods. Archaeological remains show the presence of 
diverse religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and 
Islam. Like Kashgar, Samarkand was known for its artisans as well as its 
centers of Islamic learning and magnificently decorated mosques.

Caravanserai  Large flourishing trading cities such as .ashgar and 
Samarkand, however, were not the only oases along the arid Silk Roads. Once 
the routes of the Silk Roads became stabilized, inns known as caravanserai 
sprang up, often about 100 miles apart. That distance is how far camels could 
travel before they needed water. At the caravanserai, travelers could rest both 
themselves and their animals and sometimes trade their animals for fresh ones. 
The word caravanserai  derives from the Persian words for caravan and palace.
Commercial Innovations   To manage the increasing trade, China 
developed new financial systems. China had long been a money economy—
using money rather than bartering with such commodities as cowrie shells or 
80 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONsalt. However, the  copper coins they used became too unwieldy to transport 
for everyday transactions, so the government developed a system of credit 
known as flyinJ cash . This allowed a merchant to deposit paper money  under 
his name in one location and withdraw the same amount at another location. 
Locations for exchanging flying cash became the model for the banks of the 
modern era, including the banking houses  established in European cities in 
the 1300s. At a banking house, a person could present a bill of exchange— a 
document stating the holder was legally promised payment of a set amount 
on a set date—and receive that amount of money in exchange. Each of these 
innovations encouraged and supported trade by providing convenience and the 
stability of institutions.
The Crusades awakened Europeans’ interest in luxury goods from Asia. 
To acquire them, they organized the trade of European resources. In the 13th 
century, cities in northern Germany and Scandinavia formed a commercial 
alliance called the Hanseatic League . Controlling trade in the North Sea and 
the Baltic Sea, member cities of the league, such as Lubeck, Hamburg, and Riga, 
were able to drive out pirates and monopolize trade in goods such as timber, 
grain, leather, and salted fish. League ships would leave the Baltic and North 
Seas. They would round the Atlantic Coast of Western Europe, proceeding to 
the ports of the Mediterranean. There, they might pick up valuable goods from 
Arab caravans. The league lasted until the mid-17th century, when national 
governments became strong enough to protect their merchants.( Connect:

Increase in Demand  The growing demand for luxury goods from 
Afro-Eurasia, China, Persia, and India led to a corresponding increase 
in the supply of those goods through expanded production. Craftworkers 
expanded their production of such goods as silk and other textiles and 
porcelains for export. Increased demand also led to the expansion of iron 
and steel manufactured in China, motivating its proto-industrialization.

When you contextualize a historical development or process, you place it 
within a larger historical perspective—a “bigger picture.” Sometimes to 
get this perspective you look at the causes of a development or process. 
For example, the historical development of intercultural connections 
was possible in the Classical Era because of the interregional trade along 
the Silk Roads. In the “bigger picture,” these intercultural connections 
bridged the East and the West and began the foundations of a global 
community. 
Identify and describe a context, or “bigger picture,” by looking 
for a cause of each of the following developments during the Song

1. China developed new financial systems in response to increasing 
trade with Arab merchants from the Abbasid Empire.
2. Russia was able to exchange goods and services with other 
cultures farther west.

Essential Question:   How did Eurasian empires grow over time, and how did 
their e_pansion  influence  trade and communication?
The Mongols of Central Asia marched across much of Eurasia throughout the 
13th century, leaving destruction and chaos in their wake. The reputation of the 
Mongols for slaughter spread even farther than their actual conquest. Matthew 
Paris had no firsthand knowledge of the Mongols as he wrote from the safe 
vantage point of a Benedictine abbey in England. Like Paris, most writers of 
the time focused on Mongol atrocities. However, in their quest for blood and 
treasure, the Mongols also sparked a period of interregional connection and 
exchange at a level that the world had not experienced in a thousand years. 
The Mongols and Their Surroundings
In the 12th century, the Mongols were multiple clans of pastoral nomads who 
herded goats and sheep and who were also hunter-foragers, north of the Gobi 
Desert  in East Asia. Life on the arid Asian steppes was harsh, and it shaped 
the Mongol culture. 
The Mongols expected everyone, male and female, to become skilled 
horse riders, and they highly valued courage in hunting and warfare. They 
were surrounded by other tribes—the Tatars, the Naimans, the Merkits, and the 
powerful Jurchen in northern China. The Mongols coveted the relative wealth 
of tribes and kingdoms that were located closer to the Silk Roads and had 
easier access to luxury goods such as silk clothing and gold jewelry. 
86 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONGenghis Khan 
The Mongol leader Temujin, 
born in 1162, spent the early 
decades of his life creating a 
series of tribal alliances and 
defeating neighboring groups 
one by one. He formed key 
friendships and married his 
oldest son to the daughter of 
a neighboring khan , or king. 
Temujin was intensely focused 
on building power. With this 
focus, he sometimes appointed 
talented nonfamily members to 
positions over family members. 
He was often also ruthless. 
For example, he killed his own 
stepbrother. He considered 
personal loyalty the best way 
to run his growing kingdom. In 
1206, Temujin gathered the Mongol chieftains at a meeting called a kuriltai  
where he was  elected khan of the Mongolian Kingdom. He took the name 
Genghis Khan , or “ruler of all.”
The Beginning of Conquest  In 1210, Genghis Khan and his troops 
headed east and attacked the powerful Jin Empire, which had been established 
by the Jurchens a century earlier and now ruled Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, 
and northern China. Its capital was the city of Zhongdu, present-day 
Beijing. Genghis Khan earned his reputation as a terrifying warrior during 
this campaign; anyone who resisted him was brutally killed in retribution. 
Sometimes the Mongols wiped out the civilian populations of entire towns 
after defeating their armies. Stories of Khan’s brutality spread in advance of 
his new westward campaigns, inducing some leaders to surrender before an 
attack. In 1219, Khan conquered both the Central Asian Kara Khitai Empire  
and the Islamic Khwarazm Empire  farther west. By 1227, Genghis Khan’s 
khanate , or kingdom, reached from the North China Sea to eastern Persia. 
(Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the reign of Genghis Khan to the reign 
of Sundiata. See Topic 1.5.)
Genghis Khan at War  Khan’s empire would not have been possible 
without the skilled and fearsome soldiers under his command. Mongolian 
soldiers were strong riders and proficient with the short bow. They were also 
highly disciplined, and .han developed an efficient command structure. To 
help with communication between units, a messenger force was created whose 
members rode for days without stopping, even sleeping on their horses while 
continuing to ride. With the help of Genghis Khan, the Mongolian armies

87 THE MONGO L EMPIRE AN D THE MO DERN WOR LD 87developed special units that mapped the terrain so that they were prepared 
against attacks and knew which way to go to attack their enemies. Their military 
strategies extended to surprise and craft. For instance, Mongol forces frequently 
deployed a band of warriors smaller than that of their enemy, retreating in 
feigned defeat; usually, enemy forces pursued the retreating Mongols, who then 
amassed larger forces to confuse and outflank the enemy.
When coming upon an enemy settlement, Genghis Khan sent a small group 
ahead to ask for surrender. If the enemy refused, he killed all the aristocrats. 
Craftworkers, miners, and others with skills, such as the ability to read and 
write, were recruited for the Mongol Empire. Others were used as laborers for 
tasks such as carrying looted goods back to the Mongol capital or as fodder in 
the front lines of battles.
Mongols quickly incorporated into their military the weapons and 
technology of the peoples they conquered. For example, when they conquered 
parts of China and Persia, they exploited the expertise of captured engineers 
who knew how to produce improved siege weapons , such as portable towers 
used to attack walled fortifications and catapults that hurled stones or other 
objects. To keep contact with the far reaches of the empire, Genghis Khan 
created a type of pony express, except instead of carrying written letters riders 
carried oral messages.
Genghis Khan at Peace  Those who expected Genghis Khan to govern 
the way he made war were surprised. The period of Eurasian history between 
the 13th and 14th centuries is often called the Pax Mongolica , or Mongolian 
peace. Genghis Khan established the capital of his empire at Karakorum, near 
the center of what is now the modern country of Mongolia. In constructing the 
city and establishing his government, he consulted with scholars and engineers 
of Chinese and Islamic traditions. Genghis Khan may have been responsible for 
more new bridges than any other ruler in history. The social policies of Genghis 
Khan were liberal for the day. For example, he instituted a policy of religious 
tolerance throughout the empire, which was unusual in the 13th century. Freed 
from years of warfare, Genghis Khan’s soldiers took charge of protecting the 
Silk Roads, making them safe for trade and ushering in the third golden age 
of the Silk Roads. New trade channels were also established between Asia, 
the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. Those who survived the conquests by 
the Mongols and their descendants benefited from the reinvigoration of trade 
routes that had not been heavily used since the days of the Roman and Han 
Empires. (Connect: List the similarities and differences in religious policies 
between the Pax Mongolica and the Romans. See Prologue.)
Genghis Khan’s effort to unify his empire included directing a scribe 
captured in 1204 to adapt the Uyghur alphabet  to represent Mongol. Although 
the effort to establish one system throughout the empire failed, the alphabet is 
still used in Mongolia today.
88 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMongolian Empire Expands
Three of Genghis Khan’s grandsons set up their own khanates, further expanding 
the empire into Asia and Europe. With each conquest, the empire expanded, 
with new people absorbed into its economy and networks of exchange. 
Batu and the Golden Horde  In 1236, Batu , the son of Khan’s oldest son, 
led a Mongolian army of 100,000 soldiers into Russia, which at the time was a 
loose network of city-states and principalities. Batu’s army, which came to be 
known as the Golden Horde , marched westward, conquering the small Russian 
kingdoms and forcing them to pay tributes. In 1240, the capital city of Kiev 
was looted and destroyed. 
The Golden Horde continued pushing westward. An initial period of sympathy 
for the Mongols, based on religious toleration and promotion of trade, evaporated 
when Western Europe saw the Golden Horde conquer a Christian region, Russia. 
In 1241, Batu led the Golden Horde into a successful military encounter with 
Polish, German, and French knights under the leadership of King Henry of Silesia. 
Soon afterward, Batu defeated a force of Hungarian knights. He next set his sights 
on Italy and Austria, but fate intervened. Back in Karakorum, Ogodei Khan, the 
Great Khan’s successor, had died. Batu called off the attacks and returned home to 
attend the funeral and to see to issues of succession. By the time Batu returned to 
Europe, he had apparently lost interest in conquering Western Europe. 
The Mongols ruled northern Russia by working through existing Russian rulers, 
who sent regular tributes. The Mongols chose this form of indirect rule because they East

began to decline.  By the mid-16th century, Russia had defeated all of the descendant 
khans of the Mongols except the Crimean Tatars, who were not defeated until the 
late 18th century. Connect: Create a five-event timeline tracing the history of  Russia 
from the Mongols to the development of the modern state. See Topics 1.6 and 2.1.)
The Mongols had long-lasting impact on Russia. As elsewhere, Russia 
suffered widespread devastation and death from the Mongol attacks. But once 
the destruction by the Golden Horde was over, Russia began to recover. The 
invasions prompted Russian princes to improve their military organization and 
to accept the value of more centralized leadership of the region. In addition, three 
centuries of Mongol rule severed Russia’s ties with much of Western Europe. As a 
result, Russia developed a more distinctly Russian culture than it had before, and 
resistance to the Mongols created the foundation for the modern Russian state.
Hulegu and the Islamic Heartlands  While Batu led the western armies, 
Hulegu , another grandson of Genghis Khan, took charge of the southwest 
region. In 1258, Hulegu led the Mongols into the Abbasid territories, where 
they destroyed the city of Baghdad and killed the caliph, along with perhaps 
200,000 residents of the city. Hulegu’s Mongolian armies continued to push 
west, threatening more of the Middle East. In 1260, however, they were 
defeated as a result of a temporary alliance between the Muslim Mamluks, 
under their military leader Baibars, and Christian Crusaders in Palestine. Both 
religious groups viewed the Mongols as a serious threat.
At the time of this defeat, Hulegu’s kingdom, called the Il-khanate , in 
Central Asia stretched from Byzantium to the Oxus River, which is now called 
the Amu Darya. Mongols ruled this kingdom, but Persians served as ministers 
and provincial and local officials. The Mongols found that this arrangement 
resulted in maximum tax collection.
Eventually, Hulegu and most of the other Mongols living in the Il-khanate 
converted to Islam. Before this conversion, the Mongols had tolerated all 
religions in Persia. After the conversion, however, Mongols supported 
massacres of Jews and Christians.
Kublai Khan and the Yuan Dynasty  Meanwhile, in the eastern part of 
the Mongolian Empire, a grandson of Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan , set his 
sights on China, which was then ruled by the Song Dynasty. China was a more 
formidable opponent than those faced by the other khans, and Kublai’s armies 
spent the years from 1235 to 1271 attempting to conquer China. In 1260, 
.ublai assumed the title of Great .han, and eleven years later finally defeated 
the Chinese. Adhering closer to Chinese tradition, rather than enforcing 
Mongolian practices of leadership and control, Kublai Khan established the 
Yuan Dynasty . He rebuilt the capital at Zhongdu, which had been destroyed 
by the Mongols in 1215, calling it Dadu. Kublai Khan proved to be skilled at 
90 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONgoverning a large, diverse territory. Like his grandfather, he instituted a policy 
of religious tolerance, which inspired loyalty in formerly oppressed groups 
such as Buddhists and Daoists, who were out of favor in China at the time. 
His policies were also tolerant toward Muslims, Jews, and Christians. With 
these and other reforms and the protection of the Mongolian armies, most 
Chinese initially enjoyed the rule of the Great Khan; he brought prosperity to 
China because of cultural exchanges and improved trade with other countries, 
including European ones. 
Mongol women led more independent lives than women in other societies 
of the time. In their nomadic culture, women tended flocks of sheep and goats 
in addition to raising children and providing meals for the family. Since they 
rode horses as Mongol men did, the women wore the same kind of leather 
trousers. Mongol women could remarry after being widowed and could initiate 
divorces.
Mongols Lose Power  Despite Kublai Khan’s adoption of many Chinese 
customs, Mongolian leaders eventually alienated many Chinese. They hired 
foreigners for the government rather than native-born Chinese. By promoting 
Buddhists and Daoists and dismantling the civil service exam system, 
the Mongols distressed the Chinese scholar-gentry class who were often 
Confucians. Although the official policy was one of tolerance, the Mongolians 
tended to remain separate from the Chinese and prohibited non-Mongols from 
speaking Mongolian.
Just as Batu had reached the limit of Mongol expansion to the west, the 
Mongolian rulers of China failed to expand beyond China. Starting in 1274, 
the Yuan Dynasty tried and failed to conquer Japan, Indochina, Burma, and the 
island of Java. These defeats suggested to the already disenchanted Chinese 
population that the Mongols were not as fearsome as they once had been. In 
the 1350s, the secret White Lotus Society  began quietly organizing to put an 
end to the Yuan Dynasty. In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang , a Buddhist monk from a 
poor peasant family, led a revolt that overthrew the Yuan Dynasty and founded 
the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). 
The Mongols’ defeat in China paralleled a general decline in their power 
elsewhere, and the empire began to shrink. The Golden Horde had lost its 
territory by about 1369, while Central Asian territories were conquered by 
Tamerlane, also known as Timur the Lame, at around the same time. 
(Connect: Describe what the Mongols desired in each of their conquests. See 
Topic 2.1.)
The Long-Term Impact of the Mongolian Invasions
The Mongolian invasions played a key role in history in many ways, positive 
and negative. 
• Mongols conquered a larger area than the Romans, and their bloody 
reputation was usually well-earned.Their empire was the largest 
continuous land empire in history.
91 THE MONGO L EMPIRE AN D THE MO DERN WOR LD • During the period known as the Pax Mongolica (c. 1250–c. 1350), 
Mongols revitalized interregional trade between Asia, the Middle East, 
Africa, and Europe. The Mongols built a system of roads and continued 
to maintain and guard the trade routes. 
• Interregional cultural exchange occurred as well. Islamic scientific 
knowledge made its way to China, and paper from China made 
possible the revolution in communication powered by the Gutenberg 
printing press (see Topic 1.6). The Mongols transferred Greco-Islamic 
medical knowledge and the Arabic numbering system to Western 
Europe.
• The Mongol conquests helped to transmit the fleas that carried the 
bubonic plague , termed the Black Death, from southern China to 
Central Asia, and from there to Southeast Asia and Europe. It followed 
familiar paths of trade and military conquest.
• The Mongols ruled successfully due to their understanding of 
centralized power, a capacity that would transfer in many cases to 
the occupied civilizations. The Mongols devised and used a single 
international law for all their conquered territories. Thus, after the 
Mongols declined in power, the kingdoms and states of Europe, Asia, 
and Southeast Asia continued or copied the process of centralizing 
power.
• Mongol fighting techniques led to the end of Western Europe’s use of 
knights in armor. The heavily clad knights could not react in time to the 
Mongols’ use of speed and surprise.
• The era of the walled city in Europe also came to an end, as walls 
proved useless against the Mongols’ siege technology. Some consider 
the cannon  a Mongol invention, cobbled together using Chinese 
gunpowder, Muslim flamethrowers, and European bell-casting 
techniques.

tale.
‘Lord King!’ he began, ‘these Mongols don’t carry on warfare in an 
honorable, chivalrous way. They fight only to destroy, they are bloodthirsty, 
merciless; their only object is to plunder, slay, murder, and burn, not even to 
make any use of what lands they conquer. They are like a swarm of locusts. 
They stay till everything is eaten up, till all are plundered, and what they 
can’t carry off, that they kill, or reduce to ashes. They are utterly faithless; 
their words and promises are not in the least to be trusted, and those who do 
make friends with them are the first upon whom they wreak their vengeance if

“And the Monarch of the World, the Hatim of the Age, [Mengü] Qa’an [Khan]

against the Qifchaq, and therefore in accordance with precedent the dispatch 
of orders and the assembling of the people took place at the door of the . . . 
palace of his wife, Möge Khatun. . . . But since Törengene Khatun was the 
mother of his eldest sons and was moreover shrewder and more sagacious 
than Möge Khatun, she [Törengene Khatun] sent messages to the princes, 
i.e. the brothers and nephews of the Qa’an . . . and said that until a Khan was

that the business of the state might not be neglected nor the affairs of the 
commonwealth thrown into confusion; in order, too, that the army and the

. . . therefore, until a quriltai [an assembly of Mongol nobles] was held, it was

Making connections helps historians see developments not as isolated 
happenings but rather as pieces of a larger pattern. For example, examining 
the exchange of goods between c. 1200 and c. 1450 takes on much more 
meaning when it is connected with the exchange of ideas, knowledge, 
technology, and religion. The impact of trade on states that participated 
in the Silk Roads exchanges from c. 1200 to c. 1450 went far beyond just 
the goods that changed hands.

EXCHANGE IN THE IN DIAN OCEAN 95
2.3
Exchange in the Indian Ocean
:eek ye knowledge, e]en to *hina 
—Hadith (9th century)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the growth 
of networRs  of e_change  after 1200, and how did 
environmental  Rnowledge  support that e_pansion?
The saying from the Hadith, traditionally attributed to the prophet 
Muhammad, provides guidance to Muslims, encouraging them to travel and 
learn. Following this advice, it is understandable that Dar al–Islam—literally 
the House of Islam, or Muslim world²might be called the world’s first global 
empire. It connected societies from North Africa to South Asia. 
Even before missionaries and imperial armies spread Islam around the 
world, Muslim merchants traveling to non-Muslim lands in search of trading 
partners were paving the way. In fact, Arab merchants had been traveling to 
South Asia for centuries before Islam began expanding. Muslim merchants’ 
connections to Dar al-Islam interacted with developments in sailing technology 
and environmental knowledge to transform the Indian Ocean into an economic 
hot spot during the Postclassical Era .
Causes of Expanded Exchange in the Indian Ocean 
South Asia, with its location in the center of the Indian Ocean, benefited 
enormously from the trade in the Indian Ocean Basin . (Connect: Write a 
paragraph comparing the Islamic global empire with the Mongolian Empire. 
See Topic 2.2.)  Although some of the causes of expanded trade in the Indian 
Ocean Basin were the same as those of expanded overland routes, some related 
specifically to ocean travel and knowledge.
Spread of Islam  Although the Indian Ocean trade had existed as early 
as 200 B.C.E., the expansion of Islam connected more cities than ever before. 
Trading partners existed in East Africa, East and Southeast Asia, and South Asia. 
Muslim Persians and Arabs were the dominant seafarers and were instrumental 
in transporting goods to port cities across the Indian Ocean. Cities on the west 
coast of India, such as Calicut  and Cambay, became thriving centers of trade 
due to interactions with merchants from East Africa and Southwest Asia. 
Calicut, especially, became a bustling port city for merchants in search 
of spices from southern India. Foreign merchants from Arabia and China met 
96 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONin Calicut to exchange goods from the West and the East, respectively. Local 
rulers welcomed the presence of Muslim and Chinese merchants, as it brought 
the city wealth and prominence in the Indian Ocean Basin. 
Increased Demand for Specialized Products  As the Indian Ocean trade 
grew, so did the demand for specialized products. Every region involved in 
trade had something special to offer its trading partners.
• India became known for the high quality of its fabrics, particularly 
cotton. In addition, merchants traveled to India in search of 
meticulously woven carpets as well as high-carbon steel (used for 
knives and swords), tanned leather, and artisan-crafted stonework. 
Merchants also sought pepper from India’s southern coastal cities. 
• Modern-day Malaysia and Indonesia became known as the Spice 
Islands  because of the fragrant nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and 
cardamom they exported. 
• Enslaved people, ivory, and gold came from the Swahili coastal cities 
of Mombasa, Mogadishu, and Sofala. 
• China exported silks, and Chinese porcelain became coveted 
worldwide, which is why people in the West still refer to their fancier 
dishes as “fine china.”
• From Southwest Asia came horses, figs, and dates.
Trade in enslaved people also played a role in exchanges in the Indian 
Ocean. While most Africans who were enslaved and transported to the 
Americas after 1500 came from west and central Africa, there had been a long-
running slave trade in the eastern part of the continent. By routes over land or 
in the Indian Ocean, enslaved people from eastern Africa were sold to buyers 
in northern Africa, the Middle East, and India. Many were transported to the 
islands off the southeast coast of Africa, such as Madagascar. The trade reached 
its peak in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Enslaved people taken in the Indian Ocean trade suffered fates different 
from those who were taken across the Atlantic. Those in the Indian Ocean trade 
were more likely to provide forced labor in seaports in the shipping industry 
and as household servants. Some worked as sailors or even soldiers. Living 
in towns or cities, they had more opportunity to develop communities and to 
work alongside free laborers than did enslaved people taken to the Americas. 
Enslaved people who ended up in Islamic communities had certain rights, such 
as the right to marry. As a result of the Indian Ocean slave trade , African 
words, musical styles, and customs can be found in Oman, India, and elsewhere.
Environmental Knowledge  Knowledge of monsoon winds  was essential 
for trading in the Indian Ocean. In the winter months, winds originated from 
the northeast, while in the spring and summer, they blew from the southwest. 
Thus, merchants had to time their voyages carefully, often remaining in port 
cities for months at a time, depending on when favorable winds would come 
their way. 
97 EXCHANGE IN THE IN DIAN OCEAN 97Advances in Maritime Technology  Travelers needed ships capable of 
navigating the Indian Ocean’s winds. Arab sailors used sailing technology to 
aid their travel. It is debatable whether Arab sailors invented the triangular 
lateen sails  that they used, but the sails were popular because sailors found 
that the triangular shape could easily catch winds coming from many different 
directions. Chinese sailors during the classical period had invented the 
stern rudder , which gave their ships more stability and made them easier 
to maneuver. The small wooden dhows used by Arab and Indian sailors 
dominated the seas during the Postclassical Era. Trade facilitated the rapid 
spread of sailing technology across the many lands bordering the Indian Ocean 
in this period. (See Topic 4.1 for later Chinese maritime technology, such 
as the magnetic compass and improved rudder.) The astrolabe , improved by 
Muslim navigators in the 12th century, allowed sailors to determine how far 
north or south they were from the equator.
Growth of States The trading networks in the Indian Ocean fostered the 
growth of states to help institutionalize the revenue from trade. One Muslim 
city-state, Malacca , also spelled Melaka , became wealthy by building a navy 
and by imposing fees on ships that passed through the Strait of Malacca, a 
narrow inlet that many ship captains used to travel between ports in India and 
ports in China. The Sultan of Malacca became so powerful in the 1400s that 
he expanded the state into Sumatra and the southern Malay Peninsula. As in 
city-states in East Africa, Italy, and the Americas, Malacca’s prosperity was 
based on trade rather than agriculture or mining or manufacturing. 
The sultanate ended when the Portuguese invaded the city in 1511. The 
Portuguese hoped that by conquering the key city on the Strait of Malacca, 
they could control the trade that flowed through it between Europe, India, and 
China. They were successful enough to generate great wealth for their empire. 
However, they were less successful than they had hoped. Their conquest 
touched off conflicts among the other states in the region and caused traders to 
diversify their routes and the ports they used. 
(σecWsRf([SDnGeG([cKDnJeinWKe,nGiDn2ceDn
Some of the very factors that caused expansion of exchange networks in the 
Indian Ocean also, in time, became effects. 
Diasporic Communities  Without the arrival of merchants in distant lands, 
trade could not have expanded. As a natural result of waiting for favorable 
winds for travel, these merchants interacted with the surrounding cultures 
and peoples of the region. In fact, many Arab and East African merchants 
stayed in western Indian port cities permanently because they married women 
they met there. Arab and Persian merchants settled in East Africa. Thus, these 
merchants from Dar al-Islam were the first to bring Islam to southern Asia, 
not through missionary work or conquest, but through intermarriage. Their 
children would generally be raised within Muslim traditions. 
98 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONSettlements of people away from their homeland are known as a diaspora . 
In these communities, settlers introduced their own cultural traditions into 
the indigenous cultures. Those cultures, in turn, influenced the culture of the 
merchants. Diasporas arose through trade in many parts of the world.

Response to Increased Demand  In a similar way, increased demand 
for products caused trade to expand. At the same time, however, it resulted in 
several effects with long-lasting impact. For example, to meet rising demand, 
producers needed to find ways to become more efficient²to grow more crops, 
to make more textiles, to manufacture more iron. In some places, the role of 
the state increased even more to oversee these efforts at efficiency and to raise 
money through customs—taxes on imported goods—and fees for the use of 
seaports. The western Indian Rajput kingdom of Gujarat,  for example, became 
the go-between for trade between the East and West. The revenue from customs 
in Gujarat was many times more than the entire worth of some European states.
Swahili City-States The Indian Ocean trade also created thriving city-states 
along the east coast of Africa, sometimes known as the Swahili city-states . 
“Swahili,” which literally means “coasters,” referred to the inhabitants of 
bustling commercial centers, such as Kilwa, Mombasa (in modern Kenya), and 
Zanzibar (in modern Tanzania). The traders of the Zanj Coast, as it was known 
in Arabic, sold ivory, gold, and enslaved people to their Arab trading partners, 
as well as more exotic goods such as tortoise shells, peacock feathers, and 
rhinoceros horns. In exchange, the “Zanj” cities acquired Chinese porcelain, 
Indian cotton, and manufactured ironwork. Trade was so vigorous with East 
Asia that Chinese porcelain remains a common find among the ruins of Swahili 
cities.
Trade brought considerable wealth to the cities on the East African coast. 
Architectural ruins in Kilwa suggest the wealth and grandeur that once existed 
there. For example, most buildings had traditionally been constructed of mud 
and clay. However, at the Indian Ocean trade’s height, many mosques and 
wealthy merchants’ homes were made of stone or coral.
99 EXCHANGE IN THE IN DIAN OCEANSiJnificant Cultural 7ransIers  The transfer of knowledge, culture, 
technology, commerce, and religion intensified as a result of thriving trade in 
the Indian Ocean Basin. The voyages of the Muslim admiral Zheng He  (1371–
1 reflect this transfer, as well as the conflicts it sometimes generated.  In 
105, the Ming emperor Yongle sent =heng He on the first of seven great 
voyages. Zheng traveled to Indonesia, Ceylon, and other coastal areas on the 
Indian Ocean, to Arabia, and to the east coast of Africa as well as to the Cape 
of Good Hope. The main purposes of the voyages were to display the might of 
the Ming Dynasty to the rest of the world and to receive tribute from the people 
he encountered. =heng’s fleet was impressive: At its height, his fleet included 
more than 300 ships that carried 28,000 people. 
The expeditions won prestige for the Chinese government and opened up 
new markets for Chinese goods. Zheng He and his crew returned to China with 
exotic treasures, such as the first giraffe the Chinese had ever seen. They also 
brought back a new understanding of the world beyond China’s borders. The 
voyages inspired some to immigrate to ports in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.
Zheng He’s voyages stirred controversy, though. Confucianism promoted 
a stable, agrarian lifestyle, and scholars worried that greater interaction and 
trade with foreign cultures threatened China’s social order. Some critics simply 
looked down upon other cultures, deeming them barbaric and vastly inferior to 
Chinese culture. Some thought the voyages were too expensive.
Emperor Yongle’s successor, his son Zhu Gaozhi, ended Zheng He’s 
travels, and he also discouraged all Chinese from sailing away from China. 
To emphasize his point, he made building a ship with more than two masts a 
punishable offense. Zheng’s voyages did have one positive short-term result: Arabian

topic, idea, or event? How is one topic, idea, or event like and/or 
unlike another? Possible answer and connection:  The expansion 
of sea routes for trade is like the expansion of the land-based Silk 
Roads for trade. They are alike in that they both extended global 
interconnections and depended on new technologies.
• Causation: What caused something to happen? Possible answer 
and connection:  China’s withdrawal from sailing to distant lands 
caused a return of piracy in the China Sea.
• Continuity and change: In what ways is something a continuation 
of what came before it? In what ways did something differ from 
what preceded it? Possible answer and connection:  Trade in the 
Indian Ocean had periods in which it flourished before the spread 
of Islam, and flourishing trade continued after the spread of Islam. 
Some changes after the spread of Islam were the high regard 
afforded Muslim merchants and the expansion of trade routes.

Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of Trans-Saharan  
trade, and how did the growth of empires influence  
trade and communication?
While the East African Coast had been fairly well populated for many 
centuries before the arrival of Islam, few societies had inhabited the Sahara 
Desert  because its arid climate made it nearly impossible to farm. Though 
nomadic communities did conduct some trade across the Sahara, the volume 
of trade increased with the arrival of Muslim merchants in the 7th and 8th 
centuries. When empires such as Mali took over the area in the early 1200s, 
commerce expanded dramatically. As illustrated in the commentaries of Ibn 
Battuta, a Muslim scholar and explorer of the 14th century, merchants and 
traders used caravans to facilitate commerce. Africans traded gold, ivory, 
hides, and enslaved people for Arab and Berber salt, cloth, paper, and horses.
Trans-Saharan Trade
The Sahara Desert is immense, occupying 3.6 million square miles—about 
the same size as China. Of that vast expanse of sand and rock, only about 800 
square miles are oases —places where human settlement is possible because 
water from deep underground is brought to the surface, making land fertile. In 
some oases, the water comes from underground naturally. In others, humans 
have dug wells to access the water. 
Camels, Saddles, and Trade  Muslim merchants from Southwest Asia 
traveled across the Sahara on camels. Native to the Islamic heartland (Arabia), 
camels began to appear in North Africa in the 3rd century B.C.E. Accustomed 
to the harsh, dry climate of the Arabian Desert , camels adapted well to living 
104 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONin the Sahara. Compared to horses, camels can consume a large quantity of 
water at one time (over 50 gallons in three minutes) and not need more water 
for a long time. They began to replace horses and donkeys after 300 C.E.
As use of the camel spread, people developed as many as 15 types of 
camel saddles for different purposes. South Arabians developed a saddle in 
which the rider sits in back of the hump, which makes riding easier because 
the rider can hold onto the hair of the hump. Northern Arabians developed a 
saddle for sitting on top of the hump, putting them high in the air, which gave 
them greater visibility in battles. Being near the head gave the rider the best 
possible control over the camel.
However, the saddle that had the greatest impact on trade was one the 
Somalis in Eastern Africa developed. They were semi-nomadic and needed to 
carry their possessions with them, so they designed a saddle for carrying loads 
up to 600 pounds. Without the development of this type of saddle, camels 
could not have been used to carry heavy loads of goods in trade.

105 TRANS-SAHARAN TRA DE RO UTES 105The caravans that crossed the Sahara often had thousands of camels laden 
not only with goods to trade but also with enough provisions, including fresh 
water, to last until the travelers could reach the next oasis. The people leading 
the caravans generally walked the entire way. The map on page 44 shows some 
of the main trade routes across the Sahara. There were seven north-south trade 
routes and two east-west routes. These put the people in Sub-Saharan Africa in 
touch with an expanding number of cultures and trading partners.
By the end of the 8th century C.E., the trans-Saharan trade  had become 
famous throughout Europe and Asia. Gold was the most precious commodity 
traded. West African merchants acquired the metal from the waters of the 
Senegal River, near modern-day Senegal and Mauritania. Foreign traders 
came to West Africa seeking not only gold but also ivory and enslaved people. 
In exchange, they brought salt, textiles, and horses. For more than 700 years, 
trans-Saharan trade brought considerable wealth to the societies of West Africa, 
particularly the kingdoms of Ghana and Mali. They also brought Islam, which 
spread into Sub-Saharan Africa as a result. ( Connect: Compare the impact of 
trade across the Sahara and throughout the Andes. See Topic 1.4. )

West African Empire Expansion
By the 12th century, wars with neighboring societies had permanently 
weakened the Ghanaian state. (See Topic 1.5.) In its place arose several new 
trading societies, the most powerful of which was Mali . North African traders 
had introduced Islam to Mali in the 9th century.
Mali’s Riches  The government of Mali profited from the gold trade, 
but it also taxed nearly all other trade entering West Africa. In that way, it 
became even more prosperous than Ghana had been. Most of Mali’s residents 
were farmers who cultivated sorghum and rice. However, the great cities of 
Timbuktu and Gao accumulated the most wealth and developed into centers 
of Muslim life in the region. Timbuktu in particular became a world-renowned 
center of Islamic learning. By the 1500s, books created and sold in Timbuktu 
brought prices higher than most other goods.
106 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONExpanding Role of States  The growth in trade and wealth gave rise to 
the need to administer and maintain it. For example, rulers needed to establish 
a currency whose value was widely understood. In Mali, the currency was 
cowrie shells, cotton cloth, gold, glass beads, and salt. Rulers also needed 
to protect both the trade routes and the areas where their currencies were 
made or harvested or their other trade resources were produced. Sometimes 
empires expanded their reach to take over resource-rich areas. They did so 
with military forces well provisioned with horses and iron weapons bought 
with the tax revenue. With each expansion, more people were drawn into the 
empire’s economy and trade networks, bringing more people in touch with 
distant cultures.
Mali’s founding ruler, Sundiata , became the subject of legend. His father 
had ruled over a small society in West Africa in what today is Guinea. When 
his father died, rival groups invaded, killing most of the royal family and 
capturing the throne. They did not bother to kill Sundiata because the young 
prince was crippled and was not considered a threat. In spite of his injury, he 
learned to fight and became so feared as a warrior that his enemies forced him 
into exile. His time in exile only strengthened him and his allies. In 1235, 
Sundiata, “the Lion Prince,” returned to the kingdom of his birth, defeated his 
enemies, and reclaimed the throne for himself.
Sundiata’s story made him beloved within his kingdom, but he was also an 
astute and capable ruler. Most scholars believe he was a Muslim and used his 
connections with others of his faith to establish trade relationships with North 
African and Arab merchants. Sundiata cultivated a thriving gold trade in Mali. 
Under his steady leadership, Mali’s wealth grew tremendously.
Mansa Musa  In the 14th century, Sundiata’s grand-nephew, Mansa 
Musa , brought more fame to the region. However, Mansa Musa was better 
known for his religious leadership than for his political or economic acumen. 
A devout Muslim, Mansa Musa began a pilgrimage in 1324 to Mecca , Islam’s 
holiest city. His journey, however, was unlike that of any ordinary pilgrim. 
Mali’s prosperity allowed him to take an extraordinarily extravagant caravan 
to Arabia, consisting of 100 camels, thousands of enslaved people and soldiers, 
and gold to distribute to all of the people who hosted him along his journey. His 
pilgrimage displayed Mali’s wealth to the outside world.
Mansa Musa’s visit to Mecca deepened his devotion to Islam. Upon his 
return, he established religious schools in Timbuktu, built mosques in Muslim 
trading cities, and sponsored those who wanted to continue their religious 
studies elsewhere. Though most West Africans continued to hold onto their 
traditional beliefs, Mansa Musa’s reign deepened the support for Islam in Mali.
However, in fewer than 100 years after Mansa Musa’s death, the Mali 
kingdom was declining. By the late 1400s, the Songhai Kingdom  had taken 
its place as the powerhouse in West Africa. Following processes like those 
Mali had gone through, Songhai became larger and richer than Mali. In 
spite of Mali’s fall, Mansa Musa’s efforts to strengthen Islam in West Africa 
succeeded: The religion has a prominent place in the region today.

the trade networRs  from c. 1200 to c. 1450?
whether by caravan through the Sahara or Gobi deserts or by junk 
or dhow on the China Sea or Indian Ocean, goods, people, and ideas 
traveled with relative freedom through the networks of exchange in Afro-
Eurasia in the years between c. 1200 and c. 1450. One reason for this 
free exchange was the stability of the Mongol Empire and the protection 
it offered merchants and travelers. The empire reached well past former 
boundaries, incorporating new people, goods, and ideas within its 
authority. Technological developments, such as gunpowder and paper 
from China, were diffused by trade. Literary and artistic interactions and 
cultural exchanges were documented by travelers such as Marco Polo 
and Ibn Battuta, who told of the wonders they saw and the extraordinary 
people they met. The known world became a larger place.
Religious, Cultural, and Technological  
(σecWsRf,nWeUDcWiRn
The diffusion of different religions between c. 1200 and c. 1450 had 
varying effects. In some cases, the arrival of a new religion served to 
unify people and provide justification for a kingdom’s leadership. It often 
also influenced the literary and artistic culture of areas to which it spread, 
where themes, subjects, and styles were inspired by the spreading religion. 
In other places, it either fused or coexisted with the native religions. 
The interactions resulting from increased trade also led to technological 
innovations that helped shape the era.
112 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITION,nfluence oI %uGGhisP on (ast $sian Culture  Buddhism came to China 
from its birthplace in India via the Silk Roads, and the 7th-century Buddhist 
monk Xuanzang helped make it popular. Monks related Buddhism to familiar 
Daoist principles, and in time Buddhist doctrines fused with elements of 
Daoist traditions to create the syncretic faith Chan Buddhism, also known as 
Zen Buddhism. Although some leaders in China did not want China’s native 
religions diminished as a result of the spread of Buddhism, Chan Buddhism 
remained popular among ordinary Chinese citizens. Under the Song Dynasty 
(960–1279), many Confucians among the scholar gentry began to adopt its 
ideals into their daily lives. The development of printing had made Buddhist 
scriptures widely available to the Confucian scholar gentry. Buddhist writers 
also influenced Chinese literature by writing in the vernacular rather than the 
formal language of Confucian scholars, a practice that became widespread. 
Japan and Korea, countries in China’s orbit, also adopted Buddhism, 
along with Confucianism. In Korea, the educated elite studied Confucian 
classics, while Buddhist doctrine attracted the peasants. Neo-Confucianism 
was another syncretic faith that originated in China, first appearing in the 
Tang Dynasty but developing further in the Song Dynasty. Neo-Confucianism 
fused rational thought with the abstract ideas of Daoism and Buddhism and 
became widespread in Japan and 9ietnam. It also became .orea’s official state 
ideology.

113 CULTURAL CONSEQ UENCES OF CONNECTI VITY 113Spread of Hinduism and Buddhism  Through trade, the Indian religions 
of Hinduism and Buddhism made their way to Southeast Asia as well. The 
sea-based Srivijaya Empire on Sumatra was a Hindu kingdom, while the 
later Majapahit Kingdom on Java was Buddhist. The South Asian land-based 
Sinhala dynasties in Sri Lanka became centers of Buddhist study with many 
monasteries. Buddhism’s influence was so strong under the Sinhala dynasties 
that Buddhist priests often advised monarchs on matters of government. (See 
Topic 1.3.) 
The Khmer Empire in present-day Cambodia, also known as the Angkor 
Kingdom, was the most successful kingdom in Southeast Asia. The royal 
monuments at Angkor Thom are evidence of both Hindu and Buddhist cultural 
influences on Southeast Asia. Hindu artwork and sculptures of Hindu gods 
adorned the city. Later, when Khmer rulers had become Buddhist, they added 
Buddhist sculptures and artwork onto buildings while keeping the Hindu 
artwork. 
Spread of Islam  Through merchants, missionaries, and conquests, Islam 
spread over a wide swath of Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The chart 
below summarizes some of the cultural influences of that expansion.
Cultural Inﬂuences of Islam in Afro-Eurasia
Region 0nÅ\enJeZ
Africa • Swahili  language is a blend of Bantu and Arabic and is still 
widely spoken today.
• Timbuktu became a center of Islamic learning.
• Leaders of African states deepened Islamic ties through 
pilgrimages to Mecca.
South Asia • Before Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism were popular.
• After Islam arrived, Buddhists converted more readily than 
Hindus because they were disillusioned by the corruption 
among Buddhist priests.
• With its emphasis on equality, Islam also attracted lower-caste 
Hindus.
• Architecture blended Hindu designs with Islamic patterns.
• Urdu language had influences from Sanskrit-based Hindi, as 
well as from Arabic and Farsi, a Persian language.
• Bhakti poets and missionaries sought links between Hinduism 
and Islam. 
Southeast Asia • Muslim rulers on Java combined Mughal Indian features, local 
traditions, and Chinese-Buddhist and Confucian traits.
• Traditional Javanese stories, puppetry, and poetry absorbed 
Muslim characters and techniques.
Scientific anG 7echnoloJical ,nnoYations  Along with religion, science 
and technology traveled the trade routes. Islamic scholars translated Greek 
literary classics into Arabic, saving the works of Aristotle and other Greek 
thinkers from oblivion. Scholars also brought back mathematics texts from 
114 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIndia and techniques for papermaking from China. They studied medicine 
from ancient Greeks, Mesopotamians, and Egyptians, making advances in 
hospital care, including surgery. (See Topic 1.2.)
Improvements in agricultural efficiency, such as the use of Champa 
rice, spread from India to Vietnam and China. With a reliable food supply, 
the population grew, as did cities and industries, such as the production of 
porcelain, silk, steel, and iron. Papermaking reached Europe from China in 
the 13th century and along with printing technology helped lead to a rise in 
literacy.
Seafaring technology improved with lateen sails , the stern rudder , the 
astrolabe , and the magnetic compass  as Chinese, Indian, and Southwest 
Asians expanded their knowledge of astronomy and other aspects of the natural 
world. Production of gunpowder  and guns spread from China and influenced 
warfare as well.
Thanks, in part, to the writing of Marco Polo, historians have a good picture 
of the city of Hangzhou  in China. It shows how trade supported urbanization. 
Hangzhou was large—it was home to about one million people—but other 
Chinese cities were larger. Chang’an had about two million people. However, 
Hangzhou was the center of culture in southern China, the home of poets such 
as Lu Yu and Xin Qiji, and other writers and artists. Located at the southern 
end of the Grand Canal, it was also a center of trade. Like other important 
cities of the era, such as Novgorod in Russia, Timbuktu in Africa, and Calicut 
in India, the city grew and prospered as its merchants exchanged goods. This 
trade brought diversity to Hangzhou, including a thriving community of Arabs.
Other cities on the trade routes that grew and thrived included Samarkand  
and Kashgar.  (See Topic 2.1.) They were both known as centers of Islamic 
scholarship, bustling markets, and sources for fresh water and plentiful food 
for merchants traveling the Silk Roads. 
Factors Contributing to Growth of Cities
• Political stability and decline of invasions
• Safe and reliable transportation
• Rise of commerce
• Plentiful labor supply
• Increased agricultural output
Declining Cities  Kashgar, however, declined after a series of conquests 
by nomadic invaders and in 1389–90 was ravaged by Tamerlane. (See Topic 
2.2.) Another once-thriving city, the heavily walled Constantinople  in present-
day Turkey, also suffered a series of traumatic setbacks. Mutinous Crusader 
armies weakened Constantinople after an attack in the Fourth Crusade in 1204 
(see Topic 1.6), and in 1346 and 1349, the bubonic plague killed about half of 
the people in Constantinople. After a 5-day seige, the city finally fell to the 
Ottomans in 1453, an event some historians believe marks the end of the High 
Middle Ages. (Connect: Describe the relationship between urban growth in

115 CULTURAL CONSEQ UENCES OF CONNECTI VITY Factors Contributing to Decline of Cities
• Political instability and invasions
• Disease
• Decline of agricultural productivity
Effects of the Crusades  Knowledge of the world beyond Western Europe 
increased as Crusaders encountered both the Byzantine and Islamic cultures. The 
encounters also increased demand in Europe for newfound wares from the East. In 
opening up to global trade, however, Western Europeans also opened themselves 
to disease. The plague, referred to as the Black Death , was introduced to Europe 
by way of trading routes. A major epidemic broke out between 1347 and 1351. 
Additional outbreaks occurred over the succeeding decades. As many as 25 
million people in Europe may have died from the plague. With drastically reduced 
populations, economic activity declined in Europe. In particular, a shortage of 
people to work on the land had lasting effects on the feudal system. Also, exposure 
to new ideas from Byzantium and the Muslim world would contribute to the 
Renaissance and the subsequent rise of secularism.
Travelers’ Tales
As exchange networks intensified and literacy spread as a result of paper and 
printing technology, an increasing number of travelers within Afro-Eurasia 
wrote about their journeys for eager readers.

116 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMarco Polo  In the late 13th century, Marco Polo , an Italian native from 
Venice, visited the court of Kublai Khan. (See Topic 2.2.) Chinese cities 
impressed Polo. After Polo returned to Italy in 1295, he wrote a book about 
his travels. However, many Europeans refused to believe his descriptions 
of China’s size, wealth, and wonders. Only when other Europeans followed 
Polo’s route to China did people widely accept that China was prosperous 
and innovative. Polo’s captivating descriptions of the customs of the people 
he met intrigued Europeans. Polo wrote extensively about the high levels of 
urbanization he saw in the 13th century. Polo’s point of view as a merchant 
kept him focused on trade-related matters.
They use paper money as currency. The men as well as the women are fair-
skinned and handsome. Most of them always dress themselves in silk, as a 
result of the vast quantities of that material produced in Hangzhou, exclusive 
of what the merchants import from other provinces.
Ibn Battuta  He was just 21 years old, Ibn Battuta  (1304–1353), a 
Muslim scholar from Morocco, set out to see the world he read about. 
I set out alone, having neither fellow-traveller in whose companionship I 
might find cheer, nor caravan whose part I might join, but swayed by an 
overmastering impulse within me and a desire long-cherished in my bosom 
to visit these illustrious sanctuaries.
Over 30 years, Ibn Battuta traveled through Central Asia, Southeast Asia, 
South Asia, China, Spain, North Africa, and Mali, mainly to Muslim lands. 
After telling his tales to the Sultan of Morocco, Battuta was told to “dictate 
an account of the cities which he had seen in his travel, and of the interesting 
events which had clung to his memory, and that he should speak of those 
whom he had met of the rulers of countries, of their distinguished men of 
learning, and of their pious saints.” His book A Gift to Those Who Contemplate 
the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Traveling  provides a wealth of detail 
about the places he visited and their cultures. Unlike Polo, Battuta had the 
point of view of a Muslim devoted to his faith. His journey was in large part 
to learn as much as he could about Islam and its people and accomplishments.

Rome, Germany, and Spain. She does relate details of her travel experiences, 
such as being so overcome by the sight of Jerusalem as she approached it that 
she nearly fell off her donkey. However, her book is also significant because it 
is a firsthand account of a middle-class medieval woman’s life. .empe conveys 
both the intense spiritual visions and feelings of her mystical experiences and 
the trials of everyday life for a woman with 14 children.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“Ibn Battuta traveled primarily in Muslim-ruled lands, the Dar al-Islam [House 
or Abode of Islam], while the Christian Polo, son of a European merchant, 
lived and worked in countries whose cultures and religions were foreign to 
him. This difference makes a comparison of their works most interesting. 
Marco Polo’s knowledge of four Asian languages as well as Italian allowed 
him to communicate with foreigners and even work as an administrator for the 
Chinese emperor. Yet, in all his travels, he remained culturally an “outsider” 
to the peoples he met, and this fact enhanced his power of observation and 
stimulated his natural curiosity. By contrast, Ibn Battuta usually traveled as an 
“insider” and his hosts accepted him as a respected Muslim jurist [qadi] and 
student of Islamic mysticism >Sufism@. Traveling to more than sixty Muslim 
courts, where he met rulers and their officials, Ibn Battuta was able to judge 
the behavior of his hosts in light of the Muslim scripture, the Koran, and the 
precepts of Islamic law. For him, the difference between their native cultures 
and his own North Arabic culture was a secondary importance.”

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“The borrowing and lending necessary for most of the crusaders stimulated 
credit formation and the development of credit institutions and instruments. 
Indeed, the money economy as a whole must have been stimulated by these 
great enterprises which took so much money. The transformation of gold and 
silver altar ornaments into coin for crusaders may have helped to heighten 
the inflation that occurred during the Crusades, especially in the later 12th 
century. The sale of land to finance most assuredly helped to make the market 
in real estate which was bringing about a new social order in the age of the 
Crusades. The principal beneficiaries of all these financial transactions were 
the bourgeoisie, who loaned the money, bought the land, sold the provisions, 
furnished the transportation, and generally benefited from the financial 
activity of the crusaders.”

Historical evidence comes from many sources, including such primary 
sources as ruins and eyewitness accounts in diaries and letters as 
well as secondary sources created later based on information from 
primary sources and other secondary sources. While they all might be 
“truthful,” each has a perspective, or point of view, that might color 
the interpretation of events and experiences. To evaluate historical 
evidence, identify a source’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, 
and/or audience. Ask the following questions:
• Who created this evidence? 
• What might be unique about his or her point of view? 
• For what purpose was the source created?
• For whom and in what situation was it created? 
• How did people use it at the time? 
The answers to these questions will help you determine what strengths

Essential Question:   What were some of the environmental  effects of  
trade in Afro-Eurasia  from c. 1200 to c. 1450?
Although trade networks enabled the spread of novel agricultural products, 
such as the introduction of certain citrus fruits to the Mediterranean basin, the 
most dramatic environmental consequence of increased commerce was not 
food, but rather disease. Bubonic plague or “Black Death” swept from Central 
Asia; struck in China, India, Persia, and Egypt; and arrived in Europe in 1347. 
The epidemic is estimated to have killed from 75 to 200 million people in 
Eurasia and peaked in Europe from 1347 to 1351. Boccaccio, whose famous 
work The Decameron  was inspired by living through the plague, described the 
horrors he saw.

Along with luxury goods, spices, textiles, and religions, merchants in some 
places introduced crops where they had not grown before. The new crops often 
had an impact on land use and population growth and distribution. In some 
areas, people found ways to sustain abundant production; in others, overuse of 
the land led to environmental degradation.
Migration of Crops  Few crops had as significant an impact as the quick-
ripening Champa rice , which was introduced to the Champa states by Vietnam, 
a Hindu state, and then offered to the Chinese as tribute. Because of the Hindu 
influence on Champa in present-day central 9ietnam, some scholars believe 
Champa rice may have originated in India. It was drought-resistant, flood-
resistant, and capable of yielding two crops a year. It was widely distributed in 
China to meet the needs of the growing population and in turn contributed to 
the population growth.
It also had an impact on land use. Through terraced farming in the uplands 
and paddies in the lowlands, Champa rice was grown in many parts of China 
where once land was thought unusable for growing rice. Nonetheless, as the 
122 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONpopulation of China grew, people tended to migrate southward to the original 
rice growing region, contributing to the growth of cities.
Indonesian seafarers traveling across the Indian Ocean had introduced 
bananas  to Sub-Saharan Africa. The nutrition-rich food led to a spike in 
population. Many Indonesians settled on the island of Madagascar. Bananas 
allowed the Bantu-speaking peoples (see Prologue) with their metallurgy 
skills and farming techniques to migrate to places where yams—a traditional 
food source—did not easily grow. To grow bananas, farmers increased land for 
cultivation, which enriched diets and led to population growth.
As caliphs conquered lands beyond the Arabian Peninsula, they spread 
Islam, the Arabic language, and the cultivation of cotton, sugar , and citrus 
crops . New foods were also available at the markets along the trade routes. 
The markets of Samarkand, for example, introduced new fruits and vegetables, 
as well as rice and citrus products from Southwest Asia, to Europe. Europeans’ 
demand for sugar would become so high that it became a key factor in the 
massive use of enslaved people in the Americas in the 1500s and after. ( Connect:

This photo was taken in 1911 of a vendor in the central Asian city of Samarkand. In 
the valleys in this region, people have long grown melons, grapes, apples, citrus fruits, 
pomegranates, apricots, peaches, and other fruits. These products were then widely 
distributed by merchants who traveled on the Silk Roads.
123 ENVIRONMENTA L CONSEQ UENCES OF CONNECTI VITY 123Environmental Degradation  Increases in population put pressure on 
resources. For example, overgrazing  outside of Great Zimbabwe was so 
severe that people had to abandon the city in the late 1400s. (See Topic 1.5.) 
In feudal Europe, overuse of farm land and deforestation  led to soil erosion , 
reducing agricultural production. The Little Ice Age (c. 1300–c. 1800) also 
contributed to a decrease in agricultural products. Environmental degradation 
was a factor in the decline of the Mayans in the Americas as well.
Spread of Epidemics through Exchange Networks
While scholars in Dar al-Islam and India were developing advances in medical 
understanding and treatment, no knowledge at the time could have prevented 
the spread of deadly infectious diseases that accompanied trade. The Mongol 
conquests helped to transmit the fleas that carried the bubonic plague , termed 
the Black Death, from southern China to Central Asia, and from there to 
Southeast Asia and Europe. Some historians believe the caravanserai that 
housed people and animals together may have contributed to the spread of the 
disease, since the animals likely carried infected fleas. 
The Black Death had a tremendous impact on Europe, killing one-third 
of the population there in a few years. With fewer workers, agricultural 
production continued its decline. However, the reduced number of workers 
led to a new relationship between workers and those they worked for: each 
person’s labor became more valuable, so workers could demand higher wages. 
This shift helped lay the groundwork for the economic changes that developed 
as feudalism declined.
The Black Death led to similar loss of life in other areas, including North 
Africa, China, and Central Asia. About 25 million Chinese and other Asians 
died between 1332 and 1347. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa were spared 
because there were few trading ports in those regions.

• Moroccan historian Ibn Khaldun wrote about the black plague outbreak 
this way:  “Civilization both in the East and the West was visited by a 
destructive plague which devastated nations and caused populations to 
vanish. It swallowed up many of the good things of civilization and wiped 
them out. . . . Civilization decreased with the decrease of mankind. Cities 
and buildings were laid waste, roads and way signs were obliterated, 
settlements and mansions became empty, dynasties and tribes grew weak. 
The entire inhabited world changed.”
• In The Travels of Ibn Battuta , the great traveler noted that as of 1345, “the 
number that died daily in Damascus [Syria] had been two thousand,” but the 
people were able to defeat the plague through prayer.
• An Italian lawyer, Gabriele de Mussis, recorded: “The whole army was 
affected by a disease which overran the Tartars [Mongols] and killed 
thousands upon thousands every day.” He [charges] that the Mongol 
leader “ordered corpses to be placed in catapults and lobbed into the city 
in hopes that the intolerable stench would kill everyone inside.”
• A French churchman, Gilles li Muisis, notes that a “calamitous disease befell 
the Tartar army, and the mortality was so great and widespread that scarcely 
one in twenty of them remained alive.” However, he depicts the Mongol 
survivors as surprised when the Christians in Kaffa also came down with the 
disease.

126 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   M A K I N G  CONNECTIONS  BY ANALYZING 
CAUSATION
One way to make connections across cultures and eras is to analyze cycles 
of cause and effect. For example, improved agricultural production 
often leads to increased population. Increased population, in turn, 
requires even more agricultural production. Efforts to fulfill agricultural 
and other needs associated with increased population, in turn, may 
lead to pressure on resources, including environmental degradation, 
and the population may decline as a result or be vulnerable to disease 
or conquest. However, with the next improvement in agriculture or 
another economic advancement, the population may grow again, and 
so the cycle continues. Recognizing this somewhat predictable cycle of 
cause and effect can help you make connections by seeing it in action in 
different geographic areas at different times in history.
Describe a similar cycle of cause and effect related to increased 
demand for goods rather than for food. Then, analyze cause-
and-effect connections between cultures that were involved in 
transregional exchange networks from c. 1200 to c. 1450.

Essential Question:   What were the similarities  and differences  among the 
various networRs  of e_change  in the period from c. 
1200 to c. 1450?
Calicut was known as the “City of Spices,” a market city where merchants 
traded their goods for pepper and cinnamon from India and a variety of goods 
from other areas as well. In some ways, such as its ability to provide security 
and the diversity of people who patronized the markets, Calicut was like other 
big trading cities along the well-traveled trade routes. In other ways, such as 
the type of currency it used and how the polity, or governmental unit,  made 
money on trade, it differed from trading cities elsewhere. The similarities 
and differences among trading cities were also reflected in the larger trading 
networks. 
Similarities Among Networks of Exchange
Several major trading networks connected people in Africa, Europe, and Asia 
in the years between c. 1200 and c. 1450:
• the Silk Roads through the Gobi Desert and mountain passes in China 
and Central Asia to Southwest Asia and Europe, on which merchants 
tended to specialize in luxury goods 
• the monsoon-dependent trade routes in the Indian Ocean linking East 
Asia with Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Southwest Asia, on which 
merchants exchanged goods too heavy to transport by land
• the trans-Saharan trade routes from North Africa and the Mediterranean 
Basin across the desert to West and East Africa, on which merchants 
traded salt from North Africa with gold from the kingdoms south of  
the desert 
128 WOR LD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONWhile each exchange network had its unique characteristics, all were similar 
in their origins, purpose, and effects. 
Origins   Interregional trade began well before the common era as agrarian 
cultures consolidated into stable settlements. The trade that flourished between 
c. 1200 and c. 1450 built on the routes these early traders—and conquerors—
first traced. As kingdoms and empires expanded, so did the trade routes they 
controlled and traveled. 
The Postclassical trading networks also needed the stability of established 
states to grow and expand. Stable kingdoms, caliphates, city-states, or empires 
assured merchants that the routes and the merchants themselves would 
be protected—which is why the wealthy merchants in Calicut could walk 
away from their cargoes knowing they would not be stolen. Stable polities 
also supported the technological upgrades that made trade more profitable²
nautical equipment such as the magnetic compass and lateen sail, high-yielding 
strains of crops, and saddles to allow for the carriage of heavy loads of goods. 
Purpose  The trading networks shared an overall economic purpose: to 
exchange what people were able to grow or produce for what they wanted, 
needed, or could use to trade for other items. In other words, their purpose 
was primarily economic. However, as you have read, people exchanged 
much more than just products. Diplomats and missionaries also traveled the 
trade routes, negotiating alliances and proselytizing for converts. Together, 
merchants, diplomats, and missionaries exchanged ways of life as well as 
economic goods. 
Effects   All the exchange networks also experienced similar effects. 
Because of the very nature of a network—which can be described as a fabric 
of cords crossing at regular distances, knotted for strength at the crossings—
the trade routes all gave rise to trading cities, the “knots” that held the network 
together.

129 COMPARISON OF ECONOMIC EXCHANGE 129The growth of trading cities gave rise to another effect of the trade 
networks: centralization. Malacca, for example, grew wealthy from the fees 
levied on ships and cargoes passing through the Strait of Malacca. To prevent 
piracy, Malacca used its wealth in part to develop a strong navy—an endeavor 
that required centralized planning. Trading cities along each of the trade routes 
underwent similar developments, using their wealth to keep the routes and the 
cities safe.  
Another aspect of trade in the cities that encouraged centralization was 
the desire for a standardized currency. Widely accepted currencies sped up 
transactions and enabled merchants to measure the value of products.

131 COMPARISON OF ECONOMIC EXCHANGE The trading networks also had unique currencies and commercial practices. 
For example, at one time silk was not only a commodity but also a currency. 
In places in Southeast Asia, tin ingots were used as a currency standard. West 
African states used cowrie shells as currency. 
In time, however, states shifted to a money economy based on gold and 
other metal coins. To make commerce less bulky, the Chinese invented “flying 
cash” (see Topic 2.1) and established the precursors of banks, including the 
practice of extending credit.
Social Implications of Networks of Exchange
The rising demand for luxury goods spurred efforts to make production more 
efficient than it had been. China went through a period of proto-industrialization 
as it sought to meet the demand for iron, steel, and porcelain. (See Topic 1.1.)  
New business practices, such as partnerships for sharing the risk of investment, 
began to emerge. 
The production of goods such as textiles and porcelain in China and 
spices in South and Southeast Asia increased to meet demands. As the amount 
of goods increased, the volume of trade on maritime trade routes began to 
supersede that of the overland trade routes. Larger ships were needed as well 
as improved navigational knowledge and technology.
Labor  The demand for labor rose along with the growing demand for 
products. The forms of labor from earlier periods continued—free peasant 
farmers, craft workers or artisans in cottage industries, people forced to work 
to pay off debts, and people forced into labor through enslavement. Trade 
in enslaved people was common along the Indian Ocean and trans-Saharan 
routes.
Large-scale projects—irrigation canals, military defenses, great 
buildings—called for the work of thousands of organized laborers. Kinship 
ties often played a role in coordinating these large-scale projects. An observer 
in the Vijayanagara Empire in South India in the 1300s describes the work of 
completing a giant reservoir:

amongst his captains, each of whom had the duty of seeing that the people 
placed under him did their work, and that the tank was finished and brought 
to completion.” 
Narrative of Domingo Paes (1520–22)
Social and Gender Structures The typical social structures during the 
period between 1200 and 150 were still defined by class or caste, and societies, 
with rare exceptions, remained patriarchies. There were, however, areas where 
women exercised more power and influence. For example, even though the 
vast Mongol Empire was a patriarchy, Mongol women had somewhat more 
freedom than women in most other parts of Afro-Eurasia. Mongol women 
moved about freely and refused the burka from the West and foot binding from 
the East. Women were also often top advisors to the great khan. 
In Europe, women worked as farmers and artisans, and they had their 
own guilds. In Southeast Asia, women were skilled in the practices of the 
marketplace, operating and controlling marketplaces as representatives of 
powerful families. Outside of these limited areas, however, women within 
other major regions still experienced far fewer opportunities and freedoms 
than men in virtually all aspects of life. 
Environmental Processes  The interconnections that spurred so much 
vibrant economic and cultural exchange also led to a steep population decline 
as merchants, diplomats, and missionaries transferred the bubonic plague and 
other infectious diseases along the trade routes. The plague, named the Black 
Death, contributed to the decline of once-great cities, such as Constantinople. 
Most believe that at least a third of Europe’s population died during this 
period. China experienced outbreaks in the 1330s and 1350s, causing tens of 
millions of deaths. 
Changes in trade networks led to cultural diffusion and the development  
of educational centers in cities such as Canton, Samarkand, Timbuktu, 
Cairo, and Venice. Political instability and increased agriculture strained the 
environment. For example, soil erosion from deforestation, or overgrazing, 
forced growing populations to migrate to other areas.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  H O W  BRUTAL WAS  GENGHIS  KHAN ?
Was Genghis Khan a brutal destroyer who murdered millions, or was he a 
great unifier who promoted prosperity by unifying most of Eurasi a" 
The Destroyer  Many historians emphasize that Khan was a 
bloodthirsty tyrant. Military historian Steven R. Ward writes that 
“Overall, the Mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-
fourths of the population of the Iranian Plateau.” Total deaths attributed 
to the Mongols during his rule and the rule of his descendants are in 
the tens of millions. Stories of his massacres of innocent people and of 
using unarmed civilians to protect his own soldiers show him to have 
had little regard for human life. 
The Empire Builder  Other historians focus on Khan’s role as a 
great leader. Mongolian scholars, proud of their countryman, argue that 
charges of brutality have been exaggerated. As historians from Europe 
and the United States focused more on trade and toleration, they saw 
benefits of the Mongol rule, often referring to Pax Mongolica . Genghis 
Khan forged a united China and established a system of Eurasian trade 
that renewed the links between China and Europe that had lapsed. Further, 
the Mongols were open to ideas and tolerant of different religions. Khan 
believed in a meritocracy, and he established one writing system across 
his empire. His rule opened the way for new systems of laws, for trade, 
and for cultural expansion.

UNIT 3: LAND-BASED EMPIRES 141
UNIT 3:   Land-Based Empires 
Understand the Context
Great land-based empires existed before 1450 and after 1750. However, 
between these years, several of history’s greatest land-based empires reached 
their peak of wealth and influence. Among these were the Songhai in West 
Africa the Safavids based in Persia the Mughals in northern India the 
Ottomans in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Northern Africa and the 
Manchus in eastern Asia. They were multiethnic states that had direct political 
control over large regions and overland trade routes.
Expansion  Since these empires measured their power in land, they 
frequently warred against neighbors over territory. The Manchus, who 
established the Qing Dynasty in China in 16, were very successful in this. 
By 111, they had tripled the amount of land they controlled. 
Centralization  Land-based empires in this period prospered by 
consolidating their power in a central government. They employed bureaucratic 
elites to enforce laws and military professionals to provide defense. To pay 
for the bureaucrats and soldiers, they collected tributes from weaker states 
and taxes from their citizens. To demonstrate their wealth and power, they 
constructed great palaces, religious buildings, and shrines. 
Belief Systems  Land-based empires were often closely tied with particular 
religious faiths. As a result, political and religious conflicts were intertwined. 
In Europe, Roman Catholics and Protestants fought wars in which millions of 
people died. In Asia, the Safavids, who were Shi’a Muslims, and the Mughals, 
who were Sunni Muslims, were often at war.  
After 1750  Many land-based empires began declining in power in the 18th 
century. The increasing importance of ethnic identities for individuals, ocean 
routes for trade, and economic relationships among businesses undermined 
the unity and influence that land-based empires initially developed.14501550 1650 1750

3.1
European, East Asian, and 
Gunpowder Empires Expand
What men call sovereignty is a worldly strife and constant war;  
Worship of God is the highest throne, the happiest of all estates.
—Suleiman the 4agniÄcent (1494–15)
Essential Question:   How did certain land-based empires develop and 
e_pand in the period from 1450–1750?
From its origins in China, gunpowder spread via the trade routes and became 
a powerful source of change between 150 and 150. The term Gunpowder 
Empires  refers to large, m ultiethnic  states in Southwest, Central, and South 
Asia that relied on firearms to conquer and control territories. In addition to 
Russia, the Gunpowder Empires included three in which Islam was strong: the 
Ottoman, the Safavid, and the Mughal Empires. Suleiman the Magnificent,  
quoted above, ruled the Ottoman Empire at its height. Although he declared 
religious worship the happiest of all practices, he also personally led Ottoman 
armies in conquering Christian strongholds in Belgrade, Rhodes, and 
Hungary in Southeastern Europe. The Gunpowder Empire societies tended 
to be militaristic, yet all three left splendid artistic and architectural legacies, 
created in part to reflect the legitimacy of their rulers.
The Qing Empire of China also expanded, and although it experienced 
several invasions, it also prospered during long periods of stability. Europe’s 
expansion involved an even wider exchange network than that which spread 
gunpowder: transoceanic connections with the Americas. You will read more 
about this path to empire expansion in Unit .
Armed trade was common in expanding empires during this period. The 
different empires traded with one another. However, they kept troops and 
armaments at the ready in case another empire questioned their right to trade. 
This type of exchange differed from the free markets of later eras.
Europe
The year 150 has traditionally signified the ending of the medieval period 
and the beginning of the early modern period. The mid-100s saw the end 
of a wave of plagues, the conclusion of the Hundred Years’ War between 
144 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONFrance and England see Topic 1.6, and the invention of the Gutenberg 
printing press  followed by an increase in literacy. After the slow political 
and economic development of the Middle Ages, several countries in Europe 
were becoming powerful, wealthy nations. New monarchies began to launch 
overseas explorations and establish colonies around the world. 
The nature of the new monarchies in Europe in the 1500s was the result 
of the desire of certain leaders to centralize power by controlling taxes, the 
army, and many aspects of religion. These new monarchs included the Tudors 
in England, the 9alois in France, and Queen Isabella and .ing Ferdinand 
in Spain. In each area, bureaucracies increased and the power of the middle 
class grew at the expense of lords and the churches. For example, the new 
monarchies moved to curb the private armies of the nobility.
Russia 
Western Europeans were long unsure what to think of Russia: Was Russia 
more European in its outlook and character, or was it more Asian" Russia was 
in a pivotal position for trade. It was able to exchange goods and services with 
other cultures farther east and west. However, Russia remained tightly linked 
to Europe. Its capital²whether .iev, St. Petersburg, or Moscow²was located 
in Europe. Although a product of Mongol influence from Central Asia to the 
east, Russia was also a product of Europe as a result of 9iking invasions and 
trading.
When Ivan IV  ruled 15±158, called Ivan the Terrible, was crowned 
tsar in 15, he immediately set about to expand the Russian border eastward, 
first by taking control of the khanates of .azan, Astrakhan, and Siberia held 
by the descendants of the Golden Horde, the Mongolian conquerors. This 
expansion came to rely more and more upon the use of gunpowder. 
Control of the Volga  Wanting to expand east to control the fur trade, Ivan 
I9 allowed the Stroganovs, major Russian landowners, to hire bands of fierce 
peasant warriors known as Cossacks to fight the local tribes and the Siberian 
khan. The Stroganovs’ forces were successful, gaining control of the 9 olga

7o the 3acific   Russia continued moving east into Siberia after the reign 
of Ivan I9 . Fur traders and militias defeated one indigenous tribe after another. 
Missionaries followed, converting many to the Eastern Orthodox faith, although 
the local shamans, or religious leaders, continued to have influence. By 16, 
the Russians had advanced east as far as the Pacific Ocean. Explorations and 
fur trading expeditions continued across the Pacific to Alaska 11 and down 
the coast of North America to California 181. 
East Asia 
China’s Yuan Dynasty, founded by Mongol invader .ublai .han in 121, was 
overthrown by the  Ming Dynasty  in 168 after less than a century in power. 
Ming rulers managed to stabilize the East Asian region for nearly 00 years. 
During the Ming era, the Portuguese and other Europeans arrived, aiming to 
encroach on the Asian trade network. Then, in 16, the powerful Manchu  
from neighboring Manchuria seized power and established the Qing Dynasty , 
which ruled until 111. During both of these dynasties, Japan and .orea 
experienced parallel developments but with unique aspects.
The Ming Dynasty also expanded the size of China, conquering lands in 
Mongolia and Central Asia. It did not hold them for long, however. In the 
10s, Mongol armies defeated Ming forces and even took the Ming emperor 
prisoner. In reaction to renewed Mongol power, China’s leaders looked to the 
Great Wall of China for protection. The Wall had not been maintained under 
Mongol rule, but under the Ming Dynasty it was restored and expanded to 
help keep out invaders from the north. Connect: Create a chart comparing the 
Ming and Yuan Dynasties. See Topic 2.2.
Emperor Kangxi  One of  China’s longest-reigning emperors, Kangxi 
ruled 1661±122 presided over a period of stability and expansion during 
the Qing Dynasty in China. .angxi sent forces into Taiwan, Mongolia, and 
Central Asia, incorporating those areas into the empire. China also imposed a 
protectorate over Tibet, the mountainous land north of India, a policy reflected 
in China’s control of the region today.
Emperor Qianlong  Another important Qing ruler was Emperor 
Qianlong ruled 16±16, a poet, who was also  knowledgeable in art and 
calligraphy. At the beginning of his reign, the country was well administered 
and government tax collections were at an all-time high. Qianlong initiated 
military campaigns in lands west of China, which led to the annexation of 
;injiang accompanied by the mass killings of the local population. Even 
today, parts of ;injiang remain troubled. The local Muslim population, called 
Uighurs, has never fully become incorporated into the rest of Chinese culture. 
146 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONQianlong also sent armies into Tibet to install the Dalai Lama on the throne 
there. A campaign against the Nepalese was successful, forcing them to submit 
to Chinese rule. However, campaigns against Burma and 9ietnam were 
unsuccessful and costly, resulting in the emptying of the empire’s treasury.
Conflicts with the :est  Needing funds, the Qing Dynasty sold limited 
trading privileges to the European powers but confined them to Guangzhou 
also known as Canton. The British were not satisfied with these limited 
privileges, so they asked for more trading rights in 1. Emperor Qianlong 
responded with a letter to .ing George III stating that the Chinese had no need 
for British manufactured goods. During the later part of Qianlong’s reign, 
the traditionally efficient Chinese bureaucracy became corrupt, levying high 
taxes on the people. In response to these high taxes and a desire to restore 
the Ming Dynasty, a group of peasants organized the White Lotus Rebellion 
16±180. The Qing government suppressed the uprising brutally, killing 
around 100,000 peasants.
Rise of the Islamic Gunpowder Empires
The warrior leaders of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal Empires shared 
many traits besides being Muslims: 
• They descended from Turkic nomads who once lived in Central Asia.
• They spoke a Turkic language.
• They took advantage of power vacuums left by the breakup of Mongol 
khanates.
• They relied on gunpowder weapons, such as artillery and cannons. 
The initial success of the Gunpowder Empires was a result of their own 
military might along with the weakness and corruption of the regimes that 
they replaced. As European nations fought among themselves rather than 
uniting to topple the new powers growing in the east, the Gunpowder Empires 
further expanded. 
The Rule of Tamerlane  The invasion of Central Asia and the Middle 
East by Tamerlane  Timur the Lame, a Mongol-Turkic ruler of the late 1th 
century set the stage for the rise of the Turkic empires. Leading an army partly 
composed of nomadic invaders from the broad steppes of Eurasia, Tamerlane 
moved out from the trading city of Samarkand in modern-day Uzbekistan to 
make ruthless conquests in Persia modern-day Iran and India. The Eurasian 
steppes were also the birthplace of the ghazi ideal ²a model for warrior life 
that blended the cooperative values of nomadic culture with the willingness to 
serve as a holy fighter for Islam. According to some historians, the ghazi ideal 
served as the model for warriors who participated in the rise of the Gunpowder 
Empires, and it was a model that fit Tamerlane well.
Some historians believe that Tamerlane’s violent takeover of areas of 
Central Asia included the massacre of some 100,000 Hindus before the gates 
147 EUROPEAN, EAST ASIAN, AND G UNPOWDER EMPIRES EXPANDof Delhi in India. The pattern of conquest was marked by violence that resulted 
in new dynasties: the Ottomans, the Safavids, and the Mughals. Nonetheless, 
Tamerlane’s rule in Samarkand encouraged learning and the arts²a trend also 
typical of these later empires. For example, Tamerlane championed literature, 
and he himself corresponded with European rulers and wrote his own memoirs. 
Buildings still standing in the city of Samarkand are lasting reminders of his 
interest in architecture and decorative arts. 
While the empire he created largely fell apart except for the area that 
his descendant Babur would take over to create India’s Mughal Dynasty, 
Tamerlane’s invasions were a testament to the significance of gunpowder. 
He used it to build a government dependent upon his military and the use 
of heavy artillery. He also used it to protect land routes on the Silk Roads. 
However, he failed to leave an effective political structure in many of the 
areas he conquered. Without effective government, the expenses of the wars 
eventually ravaged the empire’s economy. 
Tamerlane’s rule casts light on two major forces that had battled each 
other continually from the late 10th century to the 1th century²Mongols 
from the northeast versus Islamic forces from Arabia and the areas around the 
Mediterranean Sea. These forces would clash continuously with the rise and 
fall of the three Asian Gunpowder Empires that are the focus of the rest of this 
chapter.  
The Ottoman Empire
By the 15th century, the Ottoman Empire was already becoming a major 
power. Extending into modern-day Turkey as well as to the Balkan areas of 
Europe and parts of North Africa and Southeast Asia, the Ottoman Empire  was 
the largest and most enduring of the great Islamic empires of this period. Founded 
by the Osman Dynasty in the 100s, the empire lasted until its defeat in 118 by 
the Allies in World War I. Thus a single dynasty controlled the empire for more 
than 600 years.
Mehmed II  Called the Conqueror, Mehmed II ruled 151±181 firmly 
established the empire’s capital after his forces besieged Constantinople once 
the center of the Byzantine Empire in 15. Despite its triple fortifications, 
the city fell as its walls crumbled under the bombardment of Ottoman cannons. 
The Ottomans used a 26-foot bronze cannon and several other cannons from 
15 to 22 feet in length.  Under Mehmed II’s rule, the city²its name changed 
to Istanbul²prospered because of its location. A nexus for trade, the city 
controlled the Bosporus Strait, the only waterway linking the Aegean Sea with 
the Black Sea.
The armies of Mehmed II next seized lands around the western edge of 
the Black Sea. Then they moved into the Balkans in Southeast Europe. To 
counter the power of 9enice, an expanding state on the Adriatic Sea with a 
robust maritime trade, Mehmed strengthened the Ottoman navy and attacked 
various areas of Italy. Although he did not conquer 9enice, he forced the city 
148 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONto pay him a yearly tax. In the early 16th century, the Ottomans added to 
their empire lands in present-day Syria, Israel, Egypt, and Algeria. When the 
Mamluk Dynasty’s power declined, Istanbul became a center of Islam. For 
more on the Mamluk Empire, see Topic 1.2.
Suleiman I  The Ottoman Empire reached its peak under Suleiman I  
ruled 1520±1566. His armies overran Hungary in 1526 and, by 152, were 
hammering at the gates of 9ienna, the main city in Austria. Their attempt to 
take 9ienna failed twice, but the ability of the Ottomans to send troops so far 
into Christian Europe caused great fear there.
In 1522, Suleiman’s navy captured the island of Rhodes now part of 
Greece in the eastern Mediterranean, which had long been a stronghold of 
Christian knights. In the 1550s, the Ottoman navy took control of Tripoli in 
North Africa. The Ottoman Empire would experience a transformation as the 
state adapted to new internal and external pressures. A period of reform would 
follow by the 18th century. Challenges in defending Ottoman territory against 
foreign invasion and occupation led to the Ottoman defeat and dissolution by 
122.
The Safavids
The Safavid dynasty had its origin in the Safavid order of Sufism, established 
in the northern Azerbaijan region Iran. An early Safavid military hero named 
Ismail  conquered most of Persia and pushed into Iraq. Although only 1 or 15 
years old, he soon conquered all of Iran and was proclaimed shah  equivalent 
to king or emperor in 1501.  
The Safavid Empire  had two problems. First, despite being on the Arabian 
Sea part of the Indian Ocean, the empire did not have a real navy. Second, 
the Safavids lacked natural defenses. Nevertheless, the Safavids rose to power 
in the 1500s due to their land-based military might and strong leadership.
Called Abbas the Great, Shah Abbas I ruled 1588±162 presided over 
the Safavid Empire at its height. His troops included soldiers²often Christian 
boys pressed into service²from as far northwest as Georgia in Russia.  Abbas 
imported weaponry from Europe and also relied on Europeans to advise his 
troops about this newly acquired military technology. Slowly, the shahs came to 
control religion as well as politics. Using Shi’a Islam as a unifying force, Shah 
Ismail built a power base that supported his rule and denied legitimacy to any 
Sunni. This strict adherence to Shi’a Islam caused frequent hostilities with the 
Ottoman Empire, a stronghold of Sunni Islam. In 151, Safavid forces were 
stopped by the Ottomans at Tabriz, a city in Persia that became part of the border 
between Sunni and Shi’a societies. The hostility between the two groups lives 
on in present-day Iraq and Iran.
Conflicts between Ottomans and Safavids were not entirely religious, 
however. Another conflict arose over control of overland trade routes. The 
Ottomans used trade embargoes, official bans on trade, consistently against 
the Safavid silk traders as a way to assert dominance over their eastern rival.

Safavid histories however, Safavid women were permitted to participate in 
their societies. While Safavid women were still veiled and restricted in their 
movements, as was traditional in the region, they had access to rights provided 
by Islamic law for inheritance and, in extreme cases, divorce. 
Mughal India
In the 1520s, Babur, a descendant of Tamerlane see Topic 2.2, founded a  
00-year dynasty during a time when India was in disarray. He completed 
conquests in northern India and, under the new Mughal name, formed a 
central government similar to that of Suleiman in Turkey. Akbar , Babur’s 
grandson, achieved grand religious and political goals. 
The Mughal Empire  under Akbar was one of the richest and best-
governed states in the world. Overseas trade flourished during the relatively 
peaceful period Arab traders conducted most of the commerce. Traded goods 
included textiles, tropical foods, spices, and precious stones, all of which 
were often exchanged for gold and silver. Trade within the borders of the 
empire was carried on by merchant castes. Members of the merchant castes 
were allowed to participate in banking and the production of handicrafts. 
Castes, or jatis, are strict social groupings designated at birth. The caste 
system divides Hindu people into four categories: Brahmins, .shatriyas, 
9aishyas, and the Shudras. Outside of the system are the achhoots, or the 
Dalits, the untouchables. The Indian caste system is the basis of educational 
and vocational opportunities for Indian society. 
Mughal India flourished from Babur’s time through the early 18th century. 
Magnificent architectural accomplishments are remaining testaments to the 
wealth and sophistication of the Mughal empire.
Decline of the Gunpowder Empires
The Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal Empires declined as Western Europe grew 
in strength economically and militarily²particularly in terms of sea power. 
Unlike these three Islamic empires, Russia modernized and reorganized its 
army, modeling it after the armies of England, France, and the Netherlands. 
The Islamic empires did not modernize and, as a result, Russia remained 
powerful enough to survive as an independent nation-state, while the other 
Gunpowder Empires fell. 
Decline of the Ottoman Empire  In 151, after Suleiman’s death, a 
European force made up mostly of Spaniards and 9enetians defeated the 
Ottomans in a great naval conflict known as the Battle of Lepanto. After 
the reign of Suleiman, the Ottomans fell victim to weak sultans and strong 
European neighbors. In time, the empire became known as the Sick Man of 
Europe. Successors to Suleiman were often held hostage to “harem politics,” 
the efforts of wives and concubines of the sultan to promote their own children 
150 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONas likely heirs to the throne. In this way, some women became powerful 
behind the scenes. The failed Siege of 9ienna in 168 marked a turning point 
in Ottoman domination in Eastern Europe. British and French involvement 
in the Ottoman territories, Greece’s independence in 1821, and the Russian 
expansion in the 1th century further weakened the Ottoman Empire.
Safavid Decline  The ineffectual leaders who followed Shah Abbas 
combined lavish lifestyles and military spending with falling revenues, resulting 
in a weakened economy. In 122, Safavid forces were not able to quell a 
rebellion by the heavily oppressed Sunni Pashtuns in present-day Afghanistan. 
The Afghan forces went on to sack Isfahan, and their leader, Mahmud, declared 
himself Shah of Persia. While the Safavid Dynasty remained nominally 
in control, the resulting chaos was an impediment to centralization and tax 
collection. Taking advantage of the weakened Safavids, the Ottomans and the 
Russians were able to seize territories. The Safavid Dynasty declined rapidly 
until it was replaced by the =and Dynasty in 160.
Mughal Decline  Shah Jahan’s son and successor, Aurangzeb ruled 1658±
10, inherited an empire weakened by corruption and the failure to keep up 
with the military innovations of external enemies. Nevertheless, Aurangzeb 
hoped to increase the size of the empire and bring all of India under Muslim rule. 
Additionally, he wanted to rid the empire of its Hindu influences.  Nile R.Euphrates R.  Tigris R.   Indus R.

to frequent conflicts and rebellions. 
There were revolts as well among the Hindu and Islamic princes. The empire 
grew increasingly unstable after his death, which allowed the British and French 
to gain more and more economic power in India. The British would take political 
power away from the Mughals in the 1th century.

154 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   E X P L A I N  THE HISTORICAL CONCEPT  
OF EMPIRE
In this topic, you read about the expansion of empires between 150 
and 150, especially in Russia, China, and Southwest, Central, and 
South Asia. Although it may seem obvious what an empire is, historians 
have thought carefully about the concept  of an empire. A concept is a 
general, abstract idea often formed from specific instances.
For example, Paul James and Tom Nairn, editors of Globalization and 
Violence , conceptualize “empire” this way:
“As a general phenomenon, empires extend relations of power 
across territorial spaces over which they have no prior or given legal 
sovereignty, and where, in one or more of the domains of economics, 
politics, and culture, they gain some measure of extensive hegemony 
over those spaces for the purpose of extracting or accruing value.” 
Steven Howe, in his book Empire , argues that an empire typically also 
has diverse ethnic, national, cultural, and religious elements under its 
power. 
If you combine these conceptualizations and then break them down into 
their component parts, you would likely come up with these features of 
empires: 
• extension of power over spaces in which they have no previous or 
legal control
• exertion of major control of economic, political, or cultural a spects 
of subjects
• extraction or accumulation of value as a result of domination
• control of diverse ethnic, national, cultural, and religious elements

Empires: Administrations
The state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth:  
for kings are not  only God’s lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon  
 God’s throne, but even by God himself they are called gods.
—2ing 1ames I (15–125)
Essential Question:   How did rulers in land-based empires legitimize and 
consolidate their power from 1450 to 1750?
By the end of the 16th century, centralization of power by controlling taxes, 
the army, and some aspects of religion coalesced into a system of government 
that led to a powerful monarch in England and absolute monarchy in France. 
In other states, different methods were used to solidify authority: building 
temples, as with the Inca paying the military elite a salary, as with the samurai 
in Japan and forcibly establishing a captive governmental bureaucracy, as 
with the Ottoman devshirme system.
Rulers of empires in the years 150 to 150 developed methods for 
assuring they maintained control of all the regions of their empires. Some of 
the successful methods included using bureaucratic elites to oversee sections 
of the empire and developing a professional military.
Centralizing Control in Europe
England’s .ing James I believed in the divine right of kings , a common claim 
from the Middle Ages that the right to rule was given to a king by God. Under 
this belief, a king was a political and religious authority. As seen in the quote 
above, James believed himself outside of the law and any earthly authority and 
saw any challenge toward him as a challenge to God. 
(nJlanG¶s *entry 2Ificials   In England, the Tudors ruled 185±160 
relied on justices of the peace,  officials selected by the landed gentry to 
“swear that as Justices of the Peace . . . in all articles in the .ing’s Commission 
to you directed, ye shall do equal right to the poor and to the rich after your 
cunning wit, and power, and after the laws and customs of the realm and 
statutes thereof made,” according to their oath of office. In other words, their 
job was to maintain peace in the counties of England, even settling some legal 
matters, and to carry out the monarch’s laws. The number and responsibilities 
156 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONof the justices of the peace increased through the years of Tudor rule, and 
they became among the most important and powerful groups in the kingdom. 
Under Tudor rule, the power of feudal lords weakened. Many seats in the 
House of Commons in Parliament were occupied by justices of the peace. The 
justices of the peace as well as the Parliament, which had been established in 
1265, gave legitimacy to the monarch’s claim to authority. 
Parliament also checked the monarch’s powers. In 168, England’s rulers 
William and Mary signed the English Bill of Rights , which assured individual 
civil liberties. For example, legal process was required before someone could 
be arrested and detained. The Bill of Rights also guaranteed protection against 
tyranny of the monarchy by requiring the agreement of Parliament on matters 
of taxation and raising an army.
Absolutism in France  In contrast to developments in England, the 
French government became more absolute— directed by one source of power, 
the king, with complete authority²in the 1th and 18th centuries. Henry I9 
ruled 158±1610 of the House of 9alois listened to his advisor Jean Bodin, 
who advocated the divine right of the monarchy. Building on these ideas, 
Louis ;III ruled 1610±16 and his minister Cardinal Richelieu  moved to 
even greater centralization of the government and development of the system 
of intendants. These intendants  were royal officials  ²bureaucratic elites²
sent out to the provinces to execute the orders of the central government. 
The intendants themselves were sometimes called tax farmers  because they 
oversaw the collection of various taxes in support of the royal governments. 
The Sun .ing, Louis XIV  ruled 16±115, espoused a theory of 
divine right and was a virtual dictator. His aims were twofold, just as those 
of Richelieu had been: He wanted to hold absolute power and expand French 
borders. Louis declared that he was the state: “L’etat, c’est moi.” He combined 
the lawmaking and the justice system in his own person²he was absolute. 
He kept nobles close to him in his palace at Versailles , making it difficult 
for them to act independently or plot against him. Louis and his successors’ 
refusal to share power eventually weakened the French government.

157 EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATI ONSReigning in Control of the Russian Empire
Social hierarchy in Moscow was almost static²much as it had been in .ievan 
Russia earlier. The noble landowning class, the boyars , stood at the top of 
the social pyramid. Below them were the merchants. Last and most numerous 
were the peasants, who would gradually sink more and more deeply into debt 
and, as a result, into serfdom . Serfs were peasants who received a plot of 
land and protection from a noble. In return, the serfs were bound to that land 
and had little personal freedom. Transfers of land ownership to another noble 
included control over the serfs on that land.
The Efforts of Ivan IV  The boyar class experienced tensions with the 
rulers similar to the tensions between nobles and rulers in Western Europe. 
Boyars of Novgorod had opposed the expansionist policies of Ivan IV , so 
Ivan punished them after his forces defeated Novgorod. Ivan I9 confiscated 
the lands of his boyar opponents and forced them and their families to move to 
Moscow. Like Louis ;I9 , he wanted to keep an eye on the nobility. 
To further control the boyars, Ivan established a paramilitary force loyal 
to him called the oprichnina . Dressed in black and traveling quickly on 
horseback, the members showed fierce loyalty to Ivan. They were drawn from 
lower-level bureaucrats and merchants to assure their loyalty to Ivan rather 
than to the boyars. The oprichnina’s methods would be reflected later in the 
development of the Russian secret police. Connect: Create a table comparing

158 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONPeter the Great  The Romanov Dynasty  took control of Russia in 161 
after a period of turmoil following Ivan’s death in 158. Under the autocratic 
control of the Romanovs, three main groups in Russia had conflicting desires 
and agendas: the Church, bent on conserving traditional values and beliefs 
the boyars, desiring to gain and hold power and members of the tsar’s royal 
family. The rise to power of Peter I , also known as Peter the Great ruled 
1682±125, illustrates these conflicting ambitions. First, to gain full control 
of the throne, Peter had to defeat his half-sister Sophia and her supporters, a 
boyar-led elite military corps called the Streltsy. He consolidated power by 
forcing Sophia into a convent. Later, the Streltsy rebelled against Peter’s reign, 
so he temporarily disbanded them and then integrated them into Russia’s 
regular army.
Peter the Great was known as the Defender of Orthodoxy, participating 
closely in ecclesiastical >church@ affairs. However, Peter would eventually lose 
the support of the Russian clergy over his reforms. Later in his reign, Peter 
reorganized the Russian government by creating provinces first 8 and later 
50 administrative divisions. Provincial officials received a salary, replacing 
the old system of local officials “feeding off the land” getting money through 
bribes, fees, and taxes. Another government reform was the creation of a 
senate, a council to advise government officials when Peter was away . 
Centralizing Control in the Ottoman Empire
To ensure their control over large areas, the Ottoman sultans used a selection 
system called devshirme to staff their military and their government. This 
system began in the late 1th century and expanded in the 15th and 16th 
centuries. Through this system, Christian boys who were subjects of the empire 
were recruited by force to serve in the Ottoman government. Boys ages 8 to 20 
were taken each year from conquered Christian lands in Europe.
The system of devshirme developed from an earlier system of slavery 
in the Ottoman Empire. In both systems, enslaved people were considered 
tribute owed to the empire after conquest, which was typically one-fifth of the 
conquered land’s wealth. Since Islamic law prohibited enslavement of “people 
of the book”²Muslims and Jews²Christian boys were forcibly removed 
from their families, especially from Balkan territories. 
The Christian boys were taught various skills in politics, the arts, and the 
military and received a very high level of education. The most famous group, 
called Janissaries , formed elite forces in the Ottoman army. Other boys were 
groomed to become administrators of the newly conquered territories some 
were scribes, tax collectors, and even diplomats. They were indoctrinated to 
be fiercely loyal to the sultan  ²some served as bodyguards. In some ways, 
becoming a Janissary provided a path of upward mobility in the Ottoman 
Empire, even though the Janissaries continued to be called “slaves of the 
state.” Some parents even wanted their sons to be recruited into the service. 
159 EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATI ONSCentralizing Control in East and South Asia
Following the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty, the Ming ruled in 
China from 168±16. The Ming Dynasty in China wanted to erase the 
influence of Mongol rulers of the Yuan Dynasty. To help accomplish this goal, 
the Ming brought back the traditional civil service exam, improved education 
by establishing a national school system, and reestablished the bureaucracy, 
which had fallen into disuse under the Mongols. See Topic 2.2. During the 
Qing Dynasty, in the later part of Qianlong’s reign, the traditionally efficient 
Chinese bureaucracy became corrupt, levying high taxes on the people. The 
Qing government used harsh military control to put down a rebellion against 
these developments and maintain its authority. 
Consolidating Power in Japan  Military leaders called shoguns ruled 
Japan in the emperor’s name from the 12th to the 15th centuries. Yet conflict 
between landholding aristocrats called daimyo  left Japan in disarray. Each 
daimyo had an army of warriors known as samurai ambition to conquer 
more territory and power to rule his fiefdoms as he saw fit. The samurai 
were salaried, paid first in rice and later in gold, which gave them significant 
economic power. Finally, just as gunpowder weapons enabled the rise of new 
empires in Turkey, Persia, and India, gunpowder weapons helped a series of 
three powerful daimyo to gradually unify Japan. Connect : Write a paragraph 
connecting shogun rule with the rule of the daimyo. See Topic 1.1.
The first of these powerful daimyo was Oda Nobunaga. Armed with 
muskets purchased from Portuguese traders, Nobunaga and his samurai took 
over .yoto in 1568. He then began to extend his power, forcing daimyo in the 
lands around .yoto to submit. Nobunaga had unified about one-third of what 
is today Japan when he was assassinated in 1582. 
Nobunaga’s successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, continued expanding the 
territory until most of what we now know as Japan was under his control. 
After his death in 158, the center of power shifted to the city of Edo Tokyo, 
controlled by the daimyo Tokugawa Ieyasu  ruled 1600±1616, who was 
declared shogun in 160. His successors would continue to rule Japan into the 
mid-1th century, in an era known as the Period of Great Peace.
The Tokugawa shogunate  set about reorganizing the governance of Japan 
in order to centralize  control over what was essentially a feudal system. Japan 
was divided into 250 hans, or territories, each of which was controlled by 
a daimyo who had his own army and was fairly independent. However, the 
Tokugawa government required that daimyo maintain residences both in their 
home territory and also in the capital if the daimyo himself was visiting his 
home territory, his family had to stay in Tokyo, essentially as hostages. This 
kept the daimyo under the control of the shogunate, reducing them to landlords 
who managed the hans, rather than independent leaders.
Consolidating Mughal Power in South Asia   Ruling from 1556 to 
1605, Akbar  proved to be the most capable of the Mughal rulers. For the 
first 0 years of his rule, he defeated Hindu armies and extended his empire 
160 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONsouthward and westward. From his capital in Delhi , Akbar established an 
efficient government and a system of fairly administered laws. For example, 
all his people had the right to appeal to him for final judgment in any lawsuit. 
As Akbar’s fame spread, capable men from many parts of Central Asia came 
to serve him. They helped Akbar create a strong, centralized government and 
an effective civil service. Paid government officials called zamindars  were in 
charge of specific duties, such as taxation, construction, and the water supply.
Later, they were given grants of land rather than salaries but were permitted 
to keep a portion of the taxes paid by local peasants, who contributed one-
third of their produce to the government. The system worked well under 
Akbar. Under the rulers who came after him, though, the zamindars began 
to keep more of the taxes that they collected. With this money, they built 
personal armies of soldiers and civilians loyal to them.
Legitimizing Power through Religion and Art
European governments sought to legitimize the authority of the monarch 
through the idea of the divine right of monarchy. For more information 
about the divine right of monarchy, see Topic .. They also built impressive 
structures, such as the Palace of 9ersailles in France, to demonstrate their 
power and glory. Governments in other parts of the world followed similar 
patterns to consolidate and legitimize their authority. See Topic 1. for links 
among religion, grand temples and pyramids, human sacrifice, and political 
power in the Mexica and Incan cultures.
Peter and St. Petersburg  When Peter the Great seized lands on the 
Baltic Sea from Sweden, the conquest gave Russia its own warm-water port 
on the Baltic²St. Petersburg. Peter moved the Russian capital from Moscow 
to St. Petersburg so he could keep watch on the boyars there, who were doing 
their required state service by working in his government. 
The new city became a testament to Peter’s determination to have his own 
capital. Architects laid out streets in a rectangular grid, unlike the irregular 
pattern of Moscow and other cities. Peasants and Swedish prisoners of war 
were forced to work, draining marshes and building streets and government 
structures. In the mid-18th century, workers built the famous Winter Palace. 
It was designed in a European rather than a Byzantine style to show Peter’s 
admiration of Europe and its rulers.
Askia the Great of Songhai  Askia Mohammad I, or Askia the Great , 
came to power in 1. He claimed his predecessor, Sunni Ali, was not a 
faithful Muslim. Like Mansa Musa of Mali, Askia the Great promoted Islam 
throughout his kingdom and made an elaborate pilgrimage to Mecca. Under 
his leadership, Songhai became the largest kingdom in its day in West Africa. 
Askia made Islam Songhai’s official religion in an attempt to unite his empire. 
In addition to legitimizing his rule through promoting Islam, he also supported 
an efficient bureaucracy to bring the empire together.
161 EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATI ONSShah Jahan  Mughal India produced a number of magnificent architectural 
accomplishments, including the Taj Mahal , built by Shah Jahan  ruled 1628±
1658 as a tomb for his wife. Mughal rulers also beautified Delhi and had 
forts built. The craftspeople and builders of Mughal India combined the arts of 
Islam calligraphy, illumination of manuscripts, and ceramics with local arts 
to create magnificent, airy structures with decorative geometric designs. All 
these accomplishments showed the power of the rulers.
Ottoman Architectural and Artistic Achievements  Tremendous 
changes in government and religion took place in Ottoman territory. However, 
the arts, the culture, and the economy showed continuities, though they now 
legitimized the rule of the Ottomans. Constantinople, renamed Istanbul, 
remained the western end of the overland Silk Roads, and the Grand Bazaar 
there continued to be full of foreign imports. Coffeehouses, although banned 
by Islamic law, continued to do a thriving business throughout the towns of the 
empire.

162 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONIstanbul grew more beautiful and expanded across both sides of the Strait of 
Bosporus. One famous landmark is the royal residence of the sultans, Topkapi 
Palace . Mehmed II lived 12±181 began construction on this landmark. 
Suleiman I lived 1±1566 ordered many mosques, forts, and other great 
buildings constructed in the cities under his control. For example, he ordered 
the construction in Istanbul of the magnificent Suleymaniye Mosq ue. 
Istanbul remained a center of arts and learning. Poets and scholars 
from across Asia met in coffeehouses and gardens. They discussed works 
by Aristotle and other Greek writers, as well as the works of many Arabic 
scholars. Cultural contributions of the Ottomans included the restoration of 
some of the glorious buildings of Constantinople, most notably the cathedral 
of Saint Sophia which the Ottomans turned into a grand mosque. From the 
time of Mehmed II, who established a workshop for their production, Ottoman 
miniature paintings and illuminated manuscripts became famous. 
French Architecture  The spacious and elegant palace at 9ersailles 
became a political instrument. Louis ;I9 entertained the nobles there and kept 
them from conducting business elsewhere, such as fomenting rebellion in their 
home provinces. Louis ;I9’s grand buildings at 9ersailles helped legitimize 
his power. The palace at 9ersailles, for example, could accommodate hundreds 
of guests. During the rule of Louis ;I9 , some 1,000 employees worked in the 
palace or on the grounds. 
Financing Empires
As in other matters of building and maintaining empires, different methods 
of raising money worked²or fell short²in different empires. In all of the 
world’s empires, raising money to fund the goals of imperial expansion and 
extend state power was a key endeavor.
Taxation in Russia  Peter established new industries owned by the state, 
especially shipyards in St. Petersburg and iron mines in the Ural Mountains. 
He also encouraged private industries such as metallurgy >technology of metal 
products@, woodwork, gunpowder, leather, paper, and mining. He brought 
in Western European naval engineers to build ships according to Western 
models. 
When industrialization failed to bring in the revenue Peter needed for his 
military ventures, he raised taxes and began to compel workers to work in 
the shipyards²a sort of urban extension of serfdom. In 118, the tax on land 
in Russia was replaced by a tax on heads individuals, and peasants became 
more oppressed than ever.
Ottoman and Mughal Taxation  To finance an economy backed by 
a powerful military, the Ottomans levied taxes on the peasants and used 
tax farming  to collect it. The tax farmers²local officials and private tax 
collectors distant from the central government²grew wealthy and corrupt 
from skimming money from the taxes in their areas, as some of the zamindars 
did in the Mughal Empire. Agricultural villages continued to be burdened with 
163 EMPIRES: ADMINISTRATI ONSthe upkeep of officers and troops. This burden of taxes and the military would 
eventually contribute to the economic decline of the empire.
Tax Collection in the Ming Dynasty In Ming China as well as in the 
Ottoman Empire, tax collection was the responsibility of private citizens, in 
this case wealthy families, each seeing to the collection of land taxes in their 
area of the countryside. Land taxes made up the bulk of the taxes collected, 
and the rates tended to be low. Taxes were collected in the form of grains 
and, later, silver. Some grains were stored in local facilities. Others were sent 
on the Grand Canal to military locations. The state also collected taxes on 
salt, wine, and other goods. For many years, the vaults stored a surplus of 
grains. However, after about 1580, wars, extravagant imperial spending, and 
the repression of rebellions left the dynasty in bankruptcy.
Tributes  Empires, including China, also collected tributes from other 
states as a way to demand recognition of their power and authority. Typically 
as a form of wealth, tributes were given as a sign of respect, submission, or 
allegiance. For example, .orea was a tributary state for China. The Mexica had 
extensive tributary arrangements from the people they conquered, although 
most Aztec citizens, merchants, and artisans paid taxes. An Aztec official was 
stationed in each capital to collect tributes from local officials. 
The Songhai Empire also had tributary states. Askia the Great assigned 
governors and officials to preside over tributary states in the Niger 9alley. As 
long as local officials obeyed Songhai policies, they could rule their districts.

“Demonized as an enemy of the faith by the Muslim narrative sources, yet 
lionized as a warrior hero in the oral tradition, Sunni Ali, who reigned from

be held together by military conquests alone, but need>ed@ an effective and 
efficient administrative structure as well. Indeed, the organization of Songhay

One way historians contextualize is by examining what came before 
and what came after an event or development within a culture see page 
1. Contextualization is also useful across cultures. To contextualize a 
specific development across cultures, ask: In what other cultures were 
there similar developments" In what ways were those developments 
similar to the specific development in the culture under study" In what 
ways were those developments different from the specific development 
in the culture under study" As you answer these questions, think about 
origins, purposes, and outcomes.

Empires: Belief Systems
Paris is well worth a Mass.
–Henry of Navarre, 2ing of -rance (ruled 1589–110)
Essential Question:   How did different belief systems endure or change 
during the period from 1450–1750?
Religion, a key factor in the expansion of empires, was a divisive force 
as much as it was a unifying one. Christianity remained a dominant force in 
Europe, b ut its split into several factions during the 16th and 1th centuries led 
to significant historical changes.  French .ing Henry I9 , often known as Henry 
of Navarre, converted to Catholicism in 15 for the sake of solidifying his 
power and ensuring peace, as the quote above suggests. His action demonstrates 
the willingness of monarchs to approach ruling with practicality rather than 
theology. Henry I9 also sanctioned religious toleration of the Huguenots 
French Calvinists. 
Islam, too, experienced a split, and political rivalries between the Ottoman 
and Safavid empires deepened the breach between the Sunni and Shi’a branches 
of the religion. At the same time, Sikhism provided a way to combine Hindu 
and Sufi Muslim beliefs.
Protestant Reformation
The Roman Catholic Church faced many challenges in the European shift 
from feudalism to centralized governments. International in organization and 
influence and boasting a large bureaucracy of its own, the Church was subject 
to corruption. Efforts to curb corruption resulted in numerous Church councils 
and reform movements. However, efforts at reform were unsuccessful.
Theological disagreements began to surface as well. John Wycliffe and 
the Lollards in England in the late 1th century argued that priests were 
unnecessary for salvation. Wycliffe was vilified for translating parts of the 
Bible into the English vernacular to make it available to the mass of believers, 
who neither read nor understood Latin. In the early 1th century, Hussites, 
followers of Jan Hus in Bohemia, were declared heretics for beliefs similar 
to Wycliffe’s. Hus himself was burned at the stake. Huldrych =wingli 
campaigned in Geneva for a religion that would follow the exact teachings 
168 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONof the scriptures  and discard customs that had evolved later. For example, 
he opposed the requirement for celibacy of the clergy because he argued 
that the rule was imposed long after the scriptures were writte n. 
The power of the Church suffered during the so-called Babylonian 
Captivity 10±1, when the papacy was located in France rather 
than in Rome. The Captivity gave French rulers greater influence over the 
Church, even the ability to decide who should be pope. Newly centralizing 
rulers who coveted Church lands and authority began confiscating wealthy 
Catholic monasteries and sometimes established their own churches. In the 
eyes of believers, the Church suffered further when it failed to stop the 
Black Death. Connect: Write a paragraph connecting the Reformation 
with the problems of the medieval Church. See Topic 1.6.
Lutheranism  A monk named Martin Luther  in Wittenberg, a 
German city in the Holy Roman Empire 800±1806, concluded that 
several traditional Church practices violated biblical teachings. He objected 
to the sale of indulgences , which granted a person absolution from the 
punishments for sin, and to simony , the selling of church offices. As a 
result, Luther defiantly challenged the Church by nailing his charges, the  
95 Theses , to a church door. Luther advocated for the theological stance of 
“sola fide,” faith alone, for the basis of salvation for the Christian believer .
The Church reacted harshly. It, and the local political ruler, needed the 
money these practices generated. Luther persisted. In January 1521, Pope 
Leo ; excommunicated Luther. Several German political leaders saw an 
opportunity to free themselves from the power of the pope. They sided with 
Luther. Soon, what had begun as a minor academic debate became a major 
split in the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire. 
Luther was not a political or social revolutionary. When German 
peasants rebelled, he did not support them. But his theological ideas had 
social impact on the clergy as well as on women. Luther taught that women 
could have direct access to God just as men could. Luther’s emphasis 
promoted women’s literacy. He believed that women had significant roles in 
the family, particularly teaching their children to read the Bible. However, 
Protestants generally did not organize convents. As a result, Protestant 
women did not have the opportunity to become leaders in a vital institution 
the way Roman Catholic women did.
Calvinism  The French theologian John Calvin  broke with the Catholic 
Church around 150. In 156, he authored The Institutes of the Christian 
Religion  and helped reform the religious community in Geneva, Switzerland. 
The elect , those predestined  to go to heaven, ran the community, which 
was based on plain living, simple church buildings, and governance by the 
elders of the church. Calvin’s followers in France were called Huguenots. 
Other offshoots of Calvinism included the Reformed Church of Scotland, 
led by John .nox, and the Puritans  in England and later in Boston, who 
wanted to purify the Church of England of Catholic remnants. Historian and 
sociologist Max Weber pointed out that an important socioeconomic impact 
169 EMPIRES: BELIE F SYSTEMS 169of Calvinism is contained in the phrase “Protestant work ethic.” Calvinists 
were encouraged to work hard and reinvest their profits prosperity ostensibly 
showed that God favored their obedience and hard work. Prosperity also 
indicated their position among the elect. Calvinists viewed their work ethic as 
righteous living that elevated them to positions of secular leadership. Together, 
the various reform efforts are known as the Protestant Reformation .

Anglicanism  The last of the three major figures of the Reformation was 
England’s .ing Henry VIII  ruled 150±15. Henry wanted a male heir to 
succeed him. After his wife gave birth to several daughters, Henry asked the 
pope to annul his marriage so he could marry another woman, Anne Boleyn . 
But the pope refused out of worry over the reaction of Charles V , the powerful 
emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Henry, with the approval of the English 
Parliament, set himself up as head of the new Church of England, or  Anglican 
Church ²one that would be free of control by the pope in Rome.
The Orthodox Church and Reforms in Russia
Charles 9 had revitalized the concept of the universal monarchy and spent 
most of his reign defending the integrity of the Holy Roman Empire from the 
Protestant Reformation. Like Charles 9 , Peter the Great of Russia asserted 
his authority as he moved against the Orthodox Church. The Church had long 
been the force unifying the Russian people and the tsars, who claimed to rule 
170 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONby divine right. Peter confirmed his power over the Church by abolishing the 
position of patriarch, the head of the Church, and incorporating the Church 
into the government. In place of the patriarch, he established the Holy Synod , 
composed of clergymen overseen by a secular official who answered to the 
tsar. Peter raised the minimum age for men to become eligible to be monks to 
50, preferring that the young serve first as soldiers. Peter’s reforms were not 
welcomed by many peasants and Old Believers, a sect that opposed earlier 
reforms.
Counter-Reformation or Catholic Reformation
The Roman Catholic Church, all-powerful in Europe since the fall of Rome, 
did not sit quietly by and let the Reformation groups take over. Instead, it 
embarked on a vigorous Counter-Reformation  to fight against the Protestant 
attacks. A three-pronged strategy yielded such gains for the Church that it 
remains the largest Christian denomination in the world:
• The Church increased the use of the Inquisition , which had been 
established in the late 12th century to root out and punish nonbelievers. 
The Inquisition sometimes allowed the use of torture to achieve its 
ends.
• The Jesuits , or Society of Jesus, a religious order founded in 150 
by Ignatius of Loyola, also opposed the spread of Protestantism. The 
Jesuits undertook missionary activity throughout the Spanish Empire as 
well as in Japan and India. 
• The Council of Trent  155±156 corrected some of the worst of the 
Church’s abuses and concentrated on reaffirming the rituals such as 
marriage and other sacraments improving the education of priests. The 
Council also published the Index of Prohibited Books , a list of writings 
that the Church banned, including Protestant copies of the Bible and 
the writings of Copernicus. 
The Counter-Reformation was successful in that Catholicism remained 
predominant in the areas of Western Europe near the Mediterranean Sea. 
Moreover, later colonies of the European powers often followed the lead of 
the home country in religion. Therefore, most of the people in the Spanish, 
Portuguese, and French colonies became Catholic.
Charles 9 abdicated as ruler of the Holy Roman Empire in 1555, 
discouraged by his inability to stop the spread of Lutheranism. He left Spain 
to his son Philip II  and the Holy Roman Empire to his brother Ferdinand. 
Philip II took the Catholic crusade to the Netherlands and ruled its 1 
provinces from 1556 to 1581. He later tried to conquer and convert England. 
In 1588, his Spanish Armada  was defeated by English naval power.
171 EMPIRES: BELIE F SYSTEMSWars of Religion
Europe’s religious divisions led to frequent wars. In 156 and 15, the forces 
of Charles 9 fought the German Lutheran Schmalkaldic League. Conflict 
between Lutherans and the Holy Roman Empire resulted in the 1555 Peace 
of Augsburg , which allowed each German state to choose whether its ruler 
would be Catholic or Lutheran. As a result, churches and inhabitants were 
forced to practice the state religion. People who refused could move to another 
state where their preferred religion was practiced.
France  In France, Catholics and Huguenots fought for nearly half a 
century. Then, in 15, .ing Henry I9 , who had been raised as a Protestant, 
tried to unify the country by becoming a Catholic, reportedly saying that 
“Paris is well worth a Mass.” Five years later, in another step to bring peace, 
Henry issued the Edict of Nantes , which allowed the Huguenots to practice 
their faith. The edict provided religious toleration in France for the next 8 
years. In 1685, Louis ;I9 of France issued the Revocation of the Edict of 
Nantes. As a result, France experienced social and economic effects. For 
example, many skilled craftsmen left France, taking knowledge of important 
industry techniques and styles with them.
7hirty <ears¶ :ar  The final great religious conflict between Catholics 
and Protestants in Europe culminated in the 7hirty <ears¶ :ar 1618±
168, which led to economic catastrophe for most of the continent. The 
Thirty Years’ War was initially the result of religious conflict within the 
Holy Roman Empire it gradually developed into a more general conflict 
involving European powers. Much of the destruction was caused by troops 
who were allowed to loot as part of their compensation. The war resulted 
in widespread famine, starvation, and disease. 
The war culminated in the 3eace oI :estShalia , which allowed each area 
of the Holy Roman Empire to select one of three religious options: Roman 
Catholicism, Lutheranism, or Calvinism. After this settlement, France, Spain, 
and Italy were predominantly Catholic. Northern Europe was either Lutheran 
or Calvinist. England was Protestant with a state church. 
Allowing rulers of various areas of the Holy Roman Empire to choose 
a denomination had important political effects. It gave the countries and 
duchies much more autonomy than they previously had. Consequently, 
the states of Prussia now part of Germany and Austria began to assert 
themselves, although they still formally belonged to the Holy Roman Empire. 
Prussia, after suffering tremendous destruction during the Thirty Years’ War, 
developed a strong military to protect itself. The Prussian military tradition 
would become a key factor in European politics into the 20th century .

Islamic Religious Schisms
As in the Holy Roman Empire, religion and the state were closely tied in 
Islamic empires. Islam continued to be an enduring belief system, spreading 
its sphere of influence despite factions that developed within it.
Ottoman Empire  Until 15, much of the area had been controlled by the 
Byzantine Empire and followed the Eastern Orthodox religion. After the siege 
of Constantinople, the area became Ottoman and the dominant religion became 
Islam. A sultan replaced the emperor, and the Byzantine Empire’s Justinian Law 
was replaced by shariah . This is a strict Islamic legal system that deals with all 
aspects of life, such as criminal justice, marital laws, and is sues of inheritance. 
The Safavids  Using Shi’a Islam as a unifying force, Shah Ismail built a 
power base that supported his rule and denied legitimacy to any Sunni. This 
strict adherence to Shi’a Islam caused frequent hostilities within the Ottoman 
Empire.  
Mughal Toleration and Prosperity  Akbar tolerated all religions. He 
gave money or land to Hindus and Muslims. He also gave money for a Catholic 
church in Goa, on India’s southwest coast. He provided land grants for the 
relatively new religion of Sikhism , which developed from Hinduism and may 
have been influenced by the Islamic mysticism known as Sufism. See Topics  
1.2 and 1.. Sikhism, a monotheistic faith that recognized the rights of other 
faiths to exist, became the fifth most popular religion in the world by the 21st 
century. Akbar tried to ease tensions between Hindus and Muslims. He gave 
Hindus positions in his government²zamindars of high and low positions 
could be Hindu²and married Hindu wives. He exempted Hindus from poll 
taxes paid by non-Muslims in the empire. Because he enjoyed religious 
discussions, Akbar invited Catholic priests to Delhi to explain Christianity to 
him. 
Regarded as one of the world’s outstanding rulers, Akbar encouraged 
learning, art, architecture, and literature. He tried and failed to prohibit child 
marriages and sati, the ritual in which widows killed themselves by jumping 
on the funeral pyres of their husbands. He died in 1605 without successfully 
converting his Hindu and Islamic subjects to the religion c alled Din-i Ilahi , or 
“divine faith,” which he had promoted to reconcile Hinduism and Islam.

In the early 1600s, scientific thinking gained popularity in northern Europe as 
trends in Renaissance ideas, curiosity, investigation, and discovery spread. In a 
period of religious schisms, scientific thought represented a very different kind 
of thinking²one based on reason rather than on faith²that would set in motion 
a monumental historical change. In 1620, English scientist and philosopher 
Francis Bacon developed an early scientific method called empiricism , which 
insisted upon the collection of data to back up a hypothesis. Bacon challenged 
traditional ideas that had been accepted for centuries and replace them with 
ones that could be demonstrated with evidence.
Scientific thinking advanced through the correspondence of leading scholars 
with one another, even during the religious wars, and by the establishment 
of a Royal Academy of Science in France and England. Sir Isaac Newton, 
combining Galileo’s laws of terrestrial motion and Johannes .epler’s laws 
of planetary motion, published a work on gravitational force called Principia 
168. The ideas in Principia influenced science and mathematics and helped 
lead to a new vision of the world. Many intellectuals thought that science 
showed that the world was ordered and rational and that natural laws applied 
to the rational and orderly progress of governments and society. This thinking 
is a key to the Enlightenment see Topic 5.1.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“He is very valiant and has a great liking for warfare and weapons of war, 
which he has constantly in his hands: we have been eye-witnesses of this 
because, whenever we were with him, he was adjusting his >swords@, testing 
his >muskets@, etc . . . This is the great experience, which he has obtained of 
warfare over so many years, that he makes it in person and from the first has 
made him a fine soldier and very skilled, and his men so dexterous that they 
are little behind our men in Europe. He has introduced into his militia the 
use of and esteem for >muskets@, in which they are very practiced. Therefore 
it is that his realm has been so much extended on all sides. . . . All the above 
mentioned soldiers, who will total some 100,000, receive pay for the whole 
year.”

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“Let no one think that this Commandment entirely forbids the arts of 
painting, engraving, or sculpture. The Scriptures inform us that God Himself 
commanded to be made images of Cherubim >a category of angel@, and also 
the brazen serpent. The interpretation, therefore, at which we must arrive, is 
that images are prohibited only inasmuch as they are used as deities to receive 
adoration, and so to injure the true worship of God. . . .
He >the pastor@ will also inform the unlettered . . . of the use of images, that 
they are intended to instruct in the history of the Old and New Testaments, 
and to revive from time to time their memory that thus, moved by the 
contemplation of heavenly things, we may be the more ardently inflamed to 
adore and love God Himself. He should, also, point out that the images of the 
Saints are placed in churches, not only to be honored, but also that they may 
admonish us by their examples to imitate their lives and virtues.”

values shape how they see the past. An interpretation of history is a 
historian’s view of why events happened and why they were significant.

Comparison in  
Land-Based Empires
Foreigners appreciate only military power. . . . Thus,  
they submit to us wholeheartedly and do not dare to despise  
China once we display our hunting techniques to them. 
—Quinlong, Emperor of China,1735
Essential Question:   By what methods did empires increase their societal 
and cultural influence from c. 1450–c. 1750?
Building and maintaining large land-based  empires is a major theme in 
the period c. 1450 ±c. 1750 . These  empires grew as they incorporated lands 
they conquered. The ir rulers implemented policies to solidify or legitimize 
their rule over a diverse population. However, the conquered often did not 
totally assimilate to the life and culture of their conquerors. In some cases the 
conquered influenced the conquerors, helping to shape a blended culture.  The 
interconnection of hemispheres also led to blended cultures.

Suleiman I besieged the Habsburg-controlled city of Esztergom in 15 with the 
help of French artillery. The figure at the far left is a Janissary. Suleiman is on 
horseback.
178 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONNot all empires were able to maintain their authority. For example, the 
Gunpowder Empires declined, unable to compete with European trading 
companies, especially the British, and unable to resolve conflicts of heirs 
motivated by harem politics see Topic .1. Other factors in the decline 
included weak or corrupt leadership and failure to keep up with developments 
in military and naval technology. The expensive armies each empire needed to 
maintain control placed harsh financial burdens on the peasants and villages 
in the form of taxes and other obligations. Religious conflicts also divided and 
weakened the Gunpowder Empires. 
A deep religious schism divided Muslims and Hindus in Mughal India, 
just as a schism divided Sunni Ottomans and Shi’a Safavids and set the stage 
for conflict between the present-day countries of Iraq and Iran. Connect: 
Write a paragraph comparing the decline of Mughal India with the decline of 
the Mongol Empire. See Topic 2.1.
Military Might
The armies of these land-based empires were well trained, well organized, well 
equipped, and well led. Empires in Eurasia all relied on gunpowder weapons, 
including large cannons, in support of more traditional cavalry and infantry 
units. In the Americas, the fierceness of both the Aztec and Incan warriors 
allowed them to intimidate and conquer neighboring territories. 
Soldiers  In some cases, the rulers of land-based empires developed an 
elite group of soldiers to use in solidifying their control over their territories. 
For instance, both the Ottoman sultan and Safavid shah used enslaved soldiers 
to offset the power of troops who had more loyalty to their tribe or local 
governor than to the sultan or shah. The Janissaries in the Ottoman Empire 
helped to preserve the power of the Ottoman sultan and the Ghulams helped to 
protect the Safavid shah from rival clans. Both the Janissaries and the Ghulams 
were often recruited from minority religious or ethnic groups found within 
the empires. The Janissaries were often enslaved people taken from Christian 
areas of the Ottoman Empire, while the Ghulams came from the Georgian, 
Armenian, or Circassian populations within the Safavid Empire. The system 
of taking people as part of a “blood” tax in the Ottoman Empire this was 
known as devshirme or tribute was not limited to the Ottomans or Safavids. 
Aztecs also required enslaved people or prisoners as part of the tribute offered 
by conquered states. 
:arIare These strong militaries did not prevent conflict among the land-
based empires. The Ottoman Empire and Safavid Empire went to war over the 
territorial claims each had at its border. However, religion also played a role as 
an underlying cause of this conflict. The Ottoman Empire was a predominantly 
Sunni Muslim state, while the Safavids were mainly Shi’a. Each believed the 
other to practice a heretical type of Islam and was willing to go to war over 
this split. Religion was not as important a factor in the conflict between the 
Safavids and the Mughals as it was in the Ottoman-Safavid War. Instead, 
179 COMPARIS ON IN LAND-BASED EMPIRES 179control over resources and trade routes in present-day Afghanistan was at the 
core of the war between these two land-based empires.
Two Muslim powers conflicted when Morocco invaded the Songhai 
Empire in 151. Moroccan forces sacked the capital of Gao and ended the 
empire. However, Morocco was unable to hold onto all the Songhai territory.
Centralized Bureaucracy 
Controlling a large area with such diverse populations required land-based 
empires to establish an organized and centralized bureaucracy. Recruiting 
bureaucratic elites took several forms. In the Ming and Manchu dynasties of 
China, the civil service examination system was used to assess the abilities of 
the members of the scholar-gentry who wished to enter government service. In 
the Ottoman Empire, the devshirme system provided the sultan with a ready-
made pool of civil servants strictly loyal to him, while in the Safavid Empire, 
the shah would enlist a class of bureaucrats from the Persian population of the 
empire, known as “the men of the pen.”

In the Songhai Empire, the mansa , a Mandika word meaning “sultan,” 
employed bureaucrats from the scholarly class educated in the schools, or 
madrasas, of Timbuktu. While the Incas did not use a dedicated scholarly 
class to rule their empire as the Ming and Manchus did, they did organize 
their empire into a federal system of provinces headed by nobles loyal to the 
emperor. Further, these nobles oversaw a very organized political structure 
that was divided on the basis of a decimal system.
180 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITI ONDespite its many similarities to other land empires, the Aztec Empire 
was less centralized and bureaucratic than the other land empires. The Aztec 
created a tributary empire and had little to no direct control over the territory 
within the region of Mesoamerica. It kept control over this region through 
force, fear, and intimidation rather than through a centralized bureaucracy.

Taxation  Some form of taxation or revenue collection was necessary to 
support the bureaucracy and military of the land-based empires of this period. 
Taxation took many forms in these empires:
• Mughal zamindar tax collection:  Mughal emperors appointed tax 
officers or zamindars to collect taxes from the peasant class based on 
land and production.
• Ottoman tax farming:  Rather than employing government tax 
collectors, the Ottoman sultans appointed “tax farmers” to pay an 
annual fixed sum of money for an area to the central government and 
then recoup the outlay by collecting money or salable goods from the 
residents of the area. Many Janissaries were paid their salaries in this 
manner by collecting more money than they paid out to the central 
government.
• Aztec tribute lists:  As the Aztecs or Mexica formed a tributary 
empire, the main source of revenue that supported the Aztec noble 
class and military came from yearly offerings or tributes from the 
surrounding areas. The lists included whichever local product was 
made or valued but could also include a demand for people, many of 
whom became human sacrifices in Aztec religious rituals.
• Ming collection of “hard currency:”  The Ming Empire, like its 
predecessors, issued paper currency as a means to facilitate trade 
and tax collection however the use of paper money led to rampant 
counterfeiting and hyperinflation. The Ming then ordered that all taxes 
should be paid in the form of rice, and later silver coins, known as 
“hard currency.”
181 COMPARIS ON IN LAND-BASED EMPIRES Striving for Legitimacy
While the diversity of the populations of the land-based empires was beneficial 
to the economic and political strength of the empires, ruling over populations 
that included many ethnicities, religions, and tribal ties was challenging. 
Therefore many rulers turned to other than political means to unite their 
subjects in their loyalty to the state. Rulers used religion, art, and monumental 
architecture to legitimize their rule. Akbar attempted a syncretic approach to 
religion in the Mughal Empire, but he had little success in that area.
Sources of Legitimacy Examples
Religion • Rulers in Islamic empires used references to the title 
“caliph,” or successor to the Prophet.
• European monarchs claim to ¸divine right¹ that gave 
the monarch the mandate to rule by the Christian God.
• Conversion to Islam of Songhai rulers and noble class 
provides a religious and legal structure to the empire.
• Aztec (Mexica) use human sacrifice in religious rituals.
Art • Portraits of the Qing emperors and other high oɉcials
• Miniature paintings in the Ottoman Empire

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   WHY DID THE ISLAMI C GUNPOWDER 
EMPIRES  RISE  AND  DECLINE ?
The term “Gunpowder Empires” was coined by Marshall G. S. Hodgson in the 10s 
to refer to the large land empires of Southwestern and South Asia that flourished the 
from 150 to 150  The Venture of Islam: The Gunpowder Empires and Modern 
Times . The term is often used to describe the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals. 
Trade and the Rise of Empires  .enneth Pomeranz and Steven Topik, in their 
2005 book The World That Trade Created , described the empires as part of the growing 
global economy. These authors, taking economic and social perspectives, used coffee 
as one example of the international character of consumer goods: “Coffee’s role in 
sociability and prestige in Europe was enhanced by the arrival of emissaries of the 
Ottoman sultan in France and Austria in 1665±1666, who poured the exotic liquor for 
their aristocratic European guests during extravagant soirees.”
Reasons for Decline  Historians have given various reasons for their declines, 
but most fall into three categories: 1 ineffectiveness 2 intolerance of minorities 
and  failure to modernize. One reviewer summarized historian 9ladimir Minorsky’s 
reasons for the decline of the Safavid Empire: 
a. decline of theocratic ideology
b. opposition between old and new elements in the military class
c.  disturbance in equilibrium among the service classes, which lost interest in 
the cause they were supporting
d. the “shadow government” represented by the harem 
e. degeneration of the dynasty as a result of its insular nature
Military :eaNness  William McNeill pointed out that rulers and military 
administrators did not try to keep up with “subsequent European innovations in 
military and naval matters, leaving them woefully exposed to attack.” McNeill noted 
that the Ottomans’ guns were able to defeat their Islamic rivals, the Safavids, because 
“until about 1600, the Ottoman army remained technically and in every way in the 
very forefront of military proficiency.” Nevertheless, after the time of Suleiman, 
leaders did not themselves lead soldiers in battle, and military discipline declined just 
as efficiency and technology began to lag behind Western Europe.
Tolerance and Intolerance  Amy Chua, Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers 
Rise to Global Dominance—and Why They Fall , suggested a different reason for 
the eventual failure of the Gunpowder Empires. Her thesis was that intolerance 
ultimately became an obstacle to retaining great power. She suggested that empires 
were successful in holding their power when they were at their most religiously and 
ethnically tolerant. This thesis can help explain why the Ottoman Empire, with its 
relative tolerance, outlived the more intolerant Safavid and Mu ghal Empires.

The tsar labored at the reform of fashions, or, more properly speaking, of 
dress. Until that time the Russians had always worn long beards, which 
they cherished and preserved with much care, allowing them to hang 
down on their bosoms, without even cutting the moustache. With these 
long beards they wore the hair very short, except the ecclesiastics, who, 
to distinguish themselves, wore it very long. The tsar, in order to reform 
that custom, ordered that gentlemen, merchants, and other subjects, 
except priests and peasants, should each pay a tax of one hundred rubles 
a year if they wished to keep their beards the commoners had to pay one 
kopek each. Officials were stationed at the gates of the towns to collect 
that tax, which the Russians regarded as an enormous sin on the part of 
the tsar and as a thing which tended to the abolition of their religion.
These insinuations, which came from the priests, occasioned the 
publication of many pamphlets in Moscow, where for that reason alone 
the tsar was regarded as a tyrant and a pagan and there were many 
old Russians who, after having their beards shaved off, saved them 
preciously, in order to have them placed in their coffins, fearing that they 
would not be allowed to enter heaven without their beards. As for the 
young men, they followed the new custom with the more readiness as it 
made them appear more agreeable to the fair sex.

Understand the Context
The voyage by Christopher Columbus in 1492 that connected the Eastern and 
Western hemispheres led to the first global trade networks. They provided the 
framework for historical events for the following centuries. 
Establishment of Maritime Empires   Between 150 and 150, European 
states, starting with the Portuguese and Spanish, sought a transoceanic route 
to Asia. Europeans established trading post empires in the Indian Ocean that 
inadvertently brought them into contact with the Americas. 
Global Exchanges  Trans-Atlantic trade linked the Americas, Europe, 
and Africa for the first time. European colonists who wanted sugar and other 
crops to sell in the global market developed plantations in the Americas. Their 
desire for laborers fueled the trade in enslaved Africans. Trans-Pacific trade 
flourished as well. Silver mined in Latin America was the major commodity. 
Over time, the transfer of crops, animals, and disease between the Eastern 
and Western hemispheres, known as the Columbian Exchange, altered life 
everywhere. The introduction of potatoes, corn, and tomatoes to Europe led to 
population growth. The introduction of deadly pathogens, such as small pox 
and measles, devastated the populations of the Americas. 
Change and Continuity  Within the context of increasing European 
influence, regional commerce and established states in Afro-Eurasia continued 
to flourish. The Mughal, Ottoman, and Qing Empires expanded, creating 
ethnically diverse states. Across the globe, peasant and artisan labor intensified 
as the demand for goods and food increased. These developments set the stage 
for the revolutions that defined the period after 150. 14501550 165017501492

TECHNOLOGICA L INNOVATIONS 191
4.1
Technological Innovations 
The sailors, moreover, as they sail over the sea, when in cloudy weather they 
can no longer profit by the light of the sun, or when the world is wrapped up in 
the darkness of the shades of night, and they are ignorant to what point of the 
compass their ship’s course is directed, they touch the magnet with a needle, 
which (the needle) is whirled round in a circle until, when its motion ceases,  
its point looks direct to the north.  
—Alexander Neckham (1157-1217)
Essential Question:   How did cross-cultural interactions spread  
technology and facilitate changes in trade and  
travel from 1450 to 1750?
Although land-based empires were important during this period, various 
inventions allowed Europeans to venture long distances on the ocean. The 
magnetic compass, originally created in China for fortune telling, helped 
steer a ship in the right direction, as described by Alexander Neckham. The 
astrolabe, improved by Muslim navigators in the 12th century, let sailors find 
out how far north or south they were from the equator. The caravel, a small, 
three-masted sailing ship developed by the Portuguese in the 15th century, 
allowed sailors to survive storms at sea better than earlier-designed ships. 
Cartography , or mapmaking, and knowledge of current and wind patterns 
also improved navigation.
Demographic pressures pushed Europeans into exploration and trade. As 
the population grew, not all workers in Europe could find work or even food. 
Not all sons of the wealthy could own land because primogeniture laws  gave 
all of each estate to the eldest son. In the early 1th century, religious minorities 
searched for a place to settle where people were tolerant of their dissent. All of 
these groups, as well as those just longing for adventure and glory, were eager 
to settle in new areas. Those who left their homelands in search of work, food, 
land, tolerance, and adventure were part of a global shift in demographics.
Developments of Transoceanic Travel and Trade
Europe was never totally isolated from East and South Asia. The Indian Ocean 
trade routes had long brought silk, spices, and tea to the Mediterranean by 
way of the Red Sea. Islamic traders had long known of land routes from China 
to the cities of Baghdad and Constantinople and from there to Rome. Then, 
192 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONin the 16th century, more and more Europeans became active in the Indian 
Ocean, with hopes of finding wealth and new converts as their twin motives. 
However, Europeans faced competition from Middle Eastern traders based in 
kingdoms such as Oman. For example, the Portuguese set up forts in Oman 
but were repeatedly challenged by attempts to remove them. The Omani-
European rivalry  was one reason for Christopher Columbus’s search for a 
new route to India. 
The voyages by Columbus connected people across the Atlantic Ocean. 
European traders became go-betweens linking Afro-Eurasia and the Americas. 
• From the Americas, they purchased sugar, tobacco, and rum.
• From Africa, they purchased enslaved people.
• From Asia, they purchased silk, spices, and rhubarb.
This extensive trade transformed Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, France, and 
Holland into maritime empires , ones based on sea travel. 
Much of this trade was carried out by men. However, in Southeast Asia, 
Europeans conducted most of their business with women, who traditionally 
handled markets and money-changing services in those cultures.
Classical, Islamic, and Asian Technology
Western European countries such as Portugal, Spain, and England were 
developing their naval technology. They were aware of traditions of sailing 
that went back to the classical Greeks, such as using the stars to navigate. 
They combined this knowledge with new ideas developed by Islamic and 
Asian sailors and scholars, which they learned about because of the cross-
cultural interactions resulting from trade networks. Al-Andalus, in what is 
now Spain, was a place where Islamic ideas diffused into Europe.
The leading European figure in this development was Portuguese ruler 
Prince Henry the Navigator. While he never sailed far enough out to sea to 
lose sight of land, he strongly supported exploration. He financed expeditions 
along Africa’s Atlantic Coast and around the Cape of Good Hope. With his 
backing, Portugal explored African coastal communities and kingdoms before 
other European powers. 
Advances in Ideas  As scholars gathered knowledge, they improved the 
safety of sailing on the ocean. For example, Newton’s discovery of gravitation 
increased knowledge of the tides. As a result, sailors could reliably predict 
when the depth of water near a shore would be decreasing, thereby exposing 
dangerous rocks. As people kept increasingly accurate records on the direction 
and intensity of winds, sailors could sail with greater confidence.
Improvements in cartography also improved navigation. An astronomical 
chart is any map of the stars and galaxies. Mariners relied on these maps 
to guide ships’ direction, especially before the introduction of the compass, 
using the skies to help them determine their location. Ancient astronomers 
in Babylonia and Mesopotamia had created star charts as early as the 2nd 
193 TECHNOLOGICA L INNOVATIONS millennium B.C.E. Charts by Chinese astronomers date back to the 5th century 
B.C.E. Charts were also used widely by classical Greek astronomers. Using 
telescopes to help create astronomical charts began in 160, and the practice 
was widely used to map the stars by the end of the 1th century. Astronomers 
typically divided the charts into grids to help locate specific constellations and 
astronomical objects.
Advances in Equipment  Several developments in the equipment used on 
ships made sailing safer and faster than ever. Ships moved adroitly, aided by a 
new type of rudder, another idea imported from China. The astrolabe, improved 
by Muslim navigators in the 12th century, allowed sailors to determine how far 
north or south they were from the equator. 
The compass is the primary direction-finding device used in navigation. It 
works either with magnets or a gyroscope, which is a wheel or disk mounted to 
spin rapidly around an axis in various directions. Other compasses determine 
the location of the sun or a specific star. The magnetic compass, originally 
invented in China, allowed sailors to steer a ship in the right direction. It is 
the oldest and most familiar. It was discovered by mariners in both China and 
Europe in the 12th century. This type of compass works as Earth itself acts as 
an enormous bar magnet. Earth’s magnetic field is almost parallel to the north-
south axis of the globe, which means that freely moving magnets, such as those 
in a compass, take on the same orientation. 
The lateen sail , or a ship sail in the shape of a triangle, was a pivotal piece 
of technology. Used by Arab sailors and in the Indian Ocean, it significantly 
affected medieval navigation and trade. The ancient square sails that preceded 
the lateen allowed sailing only in a single direction and had to be used with 
the wind. The lateen, however, could catch the wind on either side of the ship, 
allowing it to travel in different directions. When used with the square sail, 
the lateen allowed sailors to travel successfully into large bodies of water, 
including oceans, for the first time, thus expanding trade rout es.

Lateen sails are still used on 
modern sailboats.
194 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONNew types of ships also improved trade. By adjusting the ratio of length to 
width of a ship, adding or reducing the number of masts, and using different 
types of sails, builders could adapt ships to improve their efficiency. (Connect:

Long-Term Results  The long-term result of combining navigational 
techniques invented in Europe with those from other areas of the world was a 
rapid expansion of exploration and global trade. About the only part of the Afro-
Eurasia world not affected by the rapid increase in global trade was Polynesia, 
since it was far removed from trading routes. 
The introduction of gunpowder, another Chinese invention, aided Europeans 
in their conquests abroad. Soon enough, however, sea pirates also used the new 
technology, particularly the Dutch pirates known as Sea Beggars. 
In North Africa and in the trading cities along Africa’s east coast, Islam 
spread rapidly as a result of the growth of the Abbasid Empire, centered in 
Baghdad, and the activities of Muslim merchants. Interactions among various 
cultures inside and outside of Africa brought extensive trade and new technology 
to the continent.
Navigational techniques continued to spread throughout the 1th century. 
Russia’s Tsar Peter the Great visited Western Europe in 16 to observe military 
and naval technology. His interest in European technology led him to hire 
technicians from Germany and elsewhere to help build Russia’s military and 
naval power.

1. Use the passages below to answer all parts of the question that 
follows.
“After the year 1500 there was no pepper to be had at Calicut that was not 
dyed red with blood.”
 9 oltaire, 156
“Gunpowder weapons were not new. The Chinese invented gunpowder and 
they made the first true guns in the tenth century, primarily for defensive 
purposes. The Mongols improved these Chinese weapons into a more 
effective offensive force, to blow open city gates. By 121, these weapons 
had reached Europe. Early modern Europeans, Turks, Mughals, and Chinese 
owed their strength in part to improvements in gunpowder weaponry. 
Combined with better military organization and seagoing capability, 
advanced weaponry inevitably affected political and social systems. 
As they spread throughout Eurasia and North Africa, gunpowder weapons 
changed warfare. Europeans learned how to make particularly deadly 
weapons, improving the technology in part because they had easier access 
to metals.”

4.2
Exploration: Causes and Events
You can never cross the ocean unless you have  
the courage to lose sight of the shore
—Christopher Columbus (1451-1506)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the state-
sponsored expansion of maritime exploration?
Thanks in part to improved navigation techniques, Italian cities with ports 
on the Mediterranean had a monopoly on European trade with Asia. By 
controlling access to the trade routes, the Italians controlled prices of Asian 
imports to Europe, driving Spain and Portugal, and later France, England, and 
the Netherlands, into the search for new routes to Asia. Explorers hoped to find 
riches overseas, especially gold and silver. In addition to these economic and 
political reasons, explorers were interested in converting others to Christianity. 
Also, technological breakthroughs in sailing and navigation made bold new 
voyages possible.
Christopher Columbus , quoted above and credited with “discovering the 
New World,” was fortunate in 12 to gain the support of the Spanish monarchs, 
Queen Isabella and .ing Ferdinand, for his voyages across the Atlantic. His 
journeys helped increase the interest in discovery, and the English, French, and 
Dutch supported later exploration.
The Role of States in Maritime Exploration
European states were seeking ways to expand their authority and control of 
resources in the era of empire-building. Conquests brought new wealth to 
states through the collection of taxes and through new trading opportunities. 
In time it also brought great material wealth, especially in silver, to European 
states. Rivalries among European states stoked efforts to expand before 
another power might claim a territory. Religion was also a motivating force 
for exploration and expansion. Many Europeans believed that it was their 
Christian duty to seek out people in other lands to convert them. 
For all these reasons, states were centrally involved in maritime exploration. 
9 oyages such as those Columbus undertook were expensive, and without the 
financial support of a state, they would most likely have been too expensive 
200 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONfor explorers and even most merchants to be able to afford. Since religion was 
tightly woven into the government of most European states, preserving and 
spreading a state’s religion became another reason for state involvement. 
Also, in the 1th century, Europeans generally measured the wealth of 
a country in how much gold and silver it had accumulated. For this reason, 
countries set policies designed to sell as many goods as they could to other 
countries²in order to maximize the amount of gold and silver coming into the 
country²and to buy as few as possible from other countries²to minimize the 
flow of precious metals out of the country. This theory, known as mercantilism , 
required heavy government involvement. 
Expansion of European Maritime Exploration
In no nation were the interests of the state and the interest of explorers 
as closely tied as they were in Portugal, which led the way in European 
exploration as it had in maritime innovations. See Topic 2.. 
Portuguese in Africa and India  The small kingdom of Portugal, bounded 
on the east by the Spanish kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, could expand only 
overseas. Three people led its exploration:
• Prince Henry the Navigator  1±160 became the first European 
monarch to sponsor seafaring expeditions, to search for an all-water 
route to the east as well as for African gold. Under him, Portugal began 
importing enslaved Africans by sea, replacing the overland slave trade. 
• Bartholomew Diaz  sailed around the southern tip of Africa, the Cape 
of Good Hope, in 188, into waters his crew did not know. Diaz feared 
a mutiny if he continued pushing eastward, so he returned home.
•  Vasco Da Gama  sailed farther east than Diaz, landing in India in 
18. There he claimed territory as part of Portugal’s empire. The 
Portuguese ports in India were a key step in expanding Portugal’ s trade 
in the Indian Ocean and with points farther east.
Portuguese in Southeast and East Asia  Early in the 16th century, the 
ruthless Portuguese admiral Afonso de Albuquerque won a short but bloody 
battle with Arab traders and set up a factory at Malacca in present-day 
Indonesia. He had previously served as governor of Portuguese India 150±
1515, sending strings of Indians’ ears home to Portugal as evidence of his 
conquests.
China’s exploration of the outside world came to an end after =heng 
He’s final voyage in the 10s. See Topic 2.. However, less than a century 
later, in 151, the outside world arrived on China’s doorstep in the form of 
Portuguese traders. At that time, Portugal’s superior ships and weapons were 
unmatched among the Europeans. As a result of this advantage, the Portuguese 
had already won control of both the African and Indian coasts. They had won a 
decisive victory over a Turkish-Egyptian-9enetian fleet at Diu, India, in 150. 
201 EXPL ORATION: CA USES AN D EVENTS 201Initial Portuguese visits had little impact on Chinese society. But the 
traders were followed by Roman Catholic missionaries, mainly Franciscans 
and Dominicans, who worked to gain converts among the Chinese people.
The Jesuits soon followed and tried to win over the Chinese court elite. 
Scientific and technical knowledge were the keys to success at the court. Jesuit 
missionaries in Macau, such as Matteo Ricci an Italian, arrived 1582 and 
Adam Schall von Bell a German, arrived 161, impressed the Chinese with 
their learning. However, they failed to win many converts among the hostile 
scholar-gentry, who considered them barbaric.
Trading Post Empire  To ensure control of trade, the Portuguese had 
constructed a series of forts stretching from Hormuz on the Persian Gulf built 
in 150 to Goa in western India built in 1510 to Malacca on the Malay 
Peninsula built in 1511. The aims of the fort construction were to establish 
a monopoly complete control over a market over the spice trade in the area 
and to license all vessels trading between Malacca and Hormuz. The forts gave 
Portugal a global trading post empire , one based on small outposts, rather 
than control of large territories. The Portuguese also restricted Indian Ocean 
trade to those who were willing to buy permits.
Portuguese Vulnerability   The Portuguese succeeded in global trade for 
several decades, but Portugal was a small nation, lacking the workers and the 
ships necessary for the enforcement of a large trade empire. Many Portuguese 
merchants ignored their government and traded independently. Corruption 
among government officials also hampered the trading empire. By the 1th 
century, Dutch and English rivals were challenging the Portuguese in East 
Asia, including islands that are today part of Malaysia and Ind onesia.
The Dutch captured Malacca and built a fort at Batavia in Java in 1620. 
From Batavia, the Dutch attempted to monopolize the spice trade. As a result, 
the English focused on India, pushing the Portuguese out of South Asia.
In the early 16th century, the Portuguese also travelled to Japan to trade, 
followed by Christian missionaries in 15. They formed large Catholic 
settlements until the 1600s, when Japanese rulers outlawed Catholicism and 
expelled the missionaries. 
Spanish in the Philippines  Portuguese explorers such as 9asco da 
Gama were the first Western Europeans to reach the Indian Ocean by sea 
by going around the southern tip of Africa. Spanish ships, however, became 
the first to circumnavigate the globe when the government sponsored the 
voyage of Ferdinand Magellan . He died on the voyage in the Philippine 
Islands in 1522, but one of the ships in his fleet made it around the world, 
proving that the earth could be circumnavigated. 
Spain annexed the Philippines in 1521 when Magellan’s fleet arrived 
there. The Spanish returned in 1565 and started a long campaign to conquer the 
Filipinos, who put up fierce resistance. Manila became a Spanish commercial 
center in the area, attracting Chinese merchants and others. Because of the 
Portuguese and Spanish occupations, many Filipinos became Christians.
202 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe Lure of Riches
Columbus and other European explorers sought a new route to Asia and hoped 
to find gold, silver, and other valuable resources. The Spanish found so little of 
value in their first two decades of contact that they considered stopping further 
exploration. The English, after sponsoring voyages in the 10s, made little 
attempt to explore or settle for almost a century.
However, European interest in the Americas was rekindled when the Spanish 
came into contact with the two major empires in the region, the Aztecs in 
Mesoamerica and the Incas in South America. These empires had the gold and silver 
that made exploration, conquest, and settlement profitable. In addition, Europeans 
soon realized that, by using enslaved Native Americans and later enslaved Africans, 
they could grow wealthy by raising sugar, tobacco, and other valuable crops. 
7raGe $cross the 3acific  China was a particularly enthusiastic consumer of 
this silver from the Western Hemisphere. Silver, for example, made its way from 
what is now Mexico across the Pacific Ocean to East Asia in heavily armed 
Spanish ships known as galleons  that made stops in the Philippines. At the trading 
post in Manila, Europeans exchanged silver for luxury goods such as silk and 
spices, and even for gold bullion. The impressive Manila galleons allowed the 
silver trade to flourish. Indeed, the Chinese government soon began using silver 
as its main form of currency. By the early 1th century, silver had become a 
dominant force in the global economic system.

sponsored expeditions in search of a northwest passage. In 155, for example, 
French explorer Jacques Cartier  sailed from the Atlantic Ocean into the St. 
Lawrence River at today’s northern U.S. border. He did not find a new route 
to Asia, but he did claim part of what is now Canada for France. Eventually, 
explorers such as Cartier and Samuel de Champlain  explored 160±1616 
realized there were valuable goods and rich resources available in the Americas, 
so there was no need to go beyond to Asia.
Like the Spanish, the French hoped to find gold. Instead, they found a land 
rich in furs and other natural resources. In 1608, they established a town and 
trading post that they named Quebec . French traders and priests spread across 
the continent. The traders searched for furs the priests wanted to convert 
Native Americans to Christianity. The missionaries sometimes set up schools 
among the indigenous peoples. In the 1680s, a French trader known as La 
Salle explored the Great Lakes and followed the Mississippi River south to its 
mouth at the Gulf of Mexico. He claimed this vast region for France.
Unlike the Spanish²or the English who were colonizing the East Coast of 
what is now the United States²the French rarely settled permanently. Instead 
of demanding land, they traded for the furs trapped by Native Americans. For 
this reason, the French had better relations with natives than did the Spanish or 
English colonists and their settlements also grew more slowly. For example, 
by 15, the European population of New France , the French colony in 
North America, was only 0,000. The English colonies included one million 
Europeans. 
English Exploration  In 1, the English king sent an explorer named 
John Cabot  to America to look for a northwest passage. Cabot claimed lands 
from Newfoundland south to the Chesapeake Bay. The English, however, 
did not have enough sea power to defend themselves against Spanish naval 
forces²although English pirates called “sea dogs” sometimes attacked 
Spanish ships. Then in 1588, the English surprisingly defeated and destroyed 
all but one third of the Spanish Armada. With that victory, England declared 
itself a major naval power and began competing for lands and resources in the 
Americas.
At about the same time the French were founding Quebec, the English 
were establishing a colony in a land called 9irginia. In 160, about one 
hundred English colonists traveled approximately 60 miles inland from the 
coast, where they built a settlement, Jamestown , on the James River. Both the 
settlement and the river were named for the ruling English monarch, James  I. 
Jamestown was England’s first successful colony in the Americas, and one 
of the earliest colonies in what would become the United States. The first 
colonies in the present-day United States were Spanish settlements in Florida 
and New Mexico.

Dutch Exploration  In 160, the Dutch sent Henry Hudson  to explore 
the East Coast of North America. Among other feats, he sailed up what became 
known as the Hudson River to see if it led to Asia. He was disappointed in 
finding no northwest passage. He and other explorers would continue to search 
for such a route. Though it would travel through a chilly region, it offered the 
possibility of being only half the distance of a route that went around South 
America.
Though Hudson did not find a northwest passage, his explorations proved 
valuable to the Dutch. Based on his voyage, the Dutch claimed the Hudson 
River 9alley and the island of Manhattan. On the tip of this island, they settled 
a community called New Amsterdam , which today is known as New York 
City. Like many port towns, New Amsterdam prospered because it was located 
where a major river flowed into the ocean. 
205 EXPL ORATION: CA USES AN D EVENTSNew Amsterdam became an important node in the Dutch transatlantic trade 
network. Dutch merchants bought furs from trappers who lived and worked in

and others to the Netherlands in exchange for manufactured goods that they

Historians of exploration might well focus a specialized study on the 
search for a northwest passage²on the details of each effort to find 
one and the outcome of the exploration. In a similar way, economic 
historians might well focus a specialized study on the expansion of trade 
networks as a global economy began to develop. However, to appreciate 
the interconnections of historical developments, historians would relate 
the exploratory and the economic developments, looking for ways in 
which developments in one field of study influenced developments in 
the other field. For example, the explorers failed in their mission to find a 
northwest passage, but they found instead that there were goods to trade 
on the land they traveled through, and they explored new territories that 
proved rich with trading possibilities. These findings, in turn, led to the 
desire for more exploration that would lead to new participants in the 
global trade network.

Columbian Exchange
We are crushed to the ground; we lie in ruins.  
;here is nothing but grief and suќering in 4exico and ;latelolco,  
where once we saw beauty and ]alor
—from “Flowers and Songs of Sorrow,” anonymous  
Aztec poet, (c. 1521–1540)
Essential Question:   What were the causes of the Columbian Exchange and 
its effects on the Eastern and Western Hemispheres?  
As the excerpt from the poem above suggests, initial contact and the 
subsequent conquest and colonization of the Americas proved disastrous for the 
native peoples. Overpowered by superior weapons and decimated by disease, 
many native populations declined, dissipated, or were forced to submit to new 
rulers and a new religion.
Although European conquest seriously damaged entire native societies and 
their ways of life, eventually new ways of life developed out of the interaction 
of three broad traditions of culture: indigenous American, European, and 
African. In the process, the Eastern and Western Hemispheres became linked 
in a new way, sharing disease, foods, and animals. For the role Christopher 
Columbus played in establishing the link, these interactions became known as 
the Columbian Exchange .
The Columbian Exchange had far-reaching effects beyond dramatic 
changes in population and biodiversity. It also contributed to a changing 
global economy, sometimes with unintended consequences. For example, 
Spain successfully mined silver in the Americas. However, this silver sparked 
inflation in Spain, which contributed to the downfall of the Spanish Empire.
Diseases and Population Catastrophe
Until the arrival of Columbus, the peoples of the Western and Eastern 
Hemispheres had been almost completely isolated from each other. For that 
reason, the indigenous people of the Americas had no exposure²and therefore 
no immunity²to the germs and diseases brought by Europeans. Although 
European horses, gunpowder, and metal weapons helped conquer indigenous 
Americans, disease was responsible for the majority of deaths. 
Spanish soldiers, called conquistadores , such as Francisco Pizarro and 
210 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONHernin Cortps, brought smallpox  with them. Smallpox pathogens are spread 
through the respiratory system. When Europeans, who were largely immune 
after millennia of exposure in Afro-Eurasia, had face-to-face contact with 
indigenous populations, they infected these populations with the deadly 
disease. 
As colonists began to settle in the Americas, so did insects, rats, and 
other disease-carrying animals. Measles, influenza, and malaria, in addition to 
smallpox, also killed many native peoples of the Americas. 
The indigenous population of the Americas fell by more than 50  percent 
through disease alone in less than a century. Some American lands lost up to 
0 percent of their original populations. It was one of the greatest population 
disasters in human history.
Source:  Wikimedia Commons
Deadly diseases such as smallpox that came from Europe spread rapidly 
in the Americas.
Animals and Foods
Germ and disease transmissions were only one part of the Columbian 
Exchange. Another major component of the exchange was the sharing of new 
crops and livestock in both directions. Before the exchange began around 1500, 
Mesoamerican peoples consumed very little meat. Although contemporary 
Mexican food sold in the United States is reliant on pork, beef, and cheese, the 
indigenous people of Mexico knew nothing of pigs or cows until Europeans 
introduced them. These animals, along with Mediterranean foods such as 
wheat  and grapes, were introduced to the Western Hemisphere and eventually 
became staples of the American diet. 
Another domesticated animal the Europeans brought to the Americas, the 
horse , transformed the culture of the American Indians living in the Plains 
region. With the arrival of the horse, Indians could hunt buffalo on horseback 
so efficiently²and over a larger region²that they had a surplus of food. That 
211 COLUMBIAN E XCHANGE 211efficiency gave them more time for other pursuits, such as art and spirituality. 
However, competition and even armed conflict among tribes increased, with 
those having the most horses having the most power. 
At the same time, European explorers took back Mesoamerican maize  
corn, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, peppers, and cacao  to their home countries, 
where people started to grow them. Potatoes became so popular in Europe that 
they are often thought of as being native to certain regions, such as Ireland. The 
introduction of these vegetable crops caused tremendous population growth in 
Europe in the 16th and 1th centuries.
Cash Crops and Forced Labor
People themselves also became part of the exchange. The coerced arrival 
of enslaved Africans to the Americas brought biological and demographic 
changes. For example, Africans brought okra and rice with them to the 
Americas. Tobacco and cacao produced on American plantations with forced 
labor were sold to consumers in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. 
Even though slave traders kidnapped millions of Africans from their 
homelands, populations actually grew in Africa during the 16th and 1th 
centuries. That population growth happened because of the nutritious foods 
that were introduced to the continent. Yams and manioc, for example, were 
brought to Africa from Brazil. 
The Lure of Sugar  While Spain and Spanish America profited from 
silver, the Portuguese empire focused its endeavors on agriculture. Brazil, the 
center of the Portuguese-American empire, with its tropical climate and vast 
tracts of land, was perfect for sugarcane  cultivation. As disease had decimated 
the indigenous population, however, there were not enough laborers available 
to do the cultivation. Moreover, many of the people who were forced to labor 
in the sugar fields escaped to the uncharted Brazilian jungle. In response, the 
Portuguese began to import enslaved people from Africa, especially from the 
.ongo .ingdom and cities on the Swahili coast.
Slavery  Sugar’s profitability in European markets dramatically increased 
the number of Africans captured and sold through the transatlantic slave 
trade . Sugar cultivation in Brazil demanded the constant importation of African 
labor. African laborers were so numerous in Brazil that their descendants 
became the majority population of the region. Slave importers sold more than 
0 percent of enslaved Africans to the Caribbean and South America. Only 
about 6 percent went to British North America. Until the mid-1800s, more 
Africans than Europeans went to the Americas.
Enslaved people often died from backbreaking working conditions, poor 
nutrition, lack of adequate shelter, and tropical heat and the diseases that 
accompanied such heat. Sugar plantations processed so much sugar that they 
were referred to as engenhos , which means “engines” in Portuguese. Because 
of the engenhos’ horrible working conditions, plantation owners lost from 5 
to 10 percent of their labor force per year. Slavery is discussed in more detail 
in the Topic ..
212 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONGrowing Cash Crops  The Spanish noticed Portugal’s success with 
plantation agriculture and returned to the Caribbean to pursue cash crop  
cultivation, such as sugar and tobacco. Cash crops are grown for sale rather 
than subsistence. Soon, sugar eclipsed silver as the main moneymaker for 
the European empires. (Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the economic 
practices of Spain in the Americas and Portugal in South, Southwest, and 
Southeast Asia. See Topic .2.
African Presence in the Americas
African cultures were not completely lost once captives arrived in the 
Americas. In fact, during the African Diaspora  (dispersion of Africans out 
of Africa, enslaved Africans retained some aspects of their cultures. 
Languages  With a few exceptions, Africans were not able to transplant 
their languages to the Americas. The captives were forced away from their 
communities, and they soon found themselves on ships among captives from 
all across West Africa and, on some slave ships, from across East Africa as 
well. 
Since captives were taken from myriad African cultural groups, most did 
not share a common language. Understandably, they found it difficult, if not 
impossible, to communicate en route. Because of their linguistic isolation 
on the ships and in the Americas, most Africans lost their languages after a 
generation. In spite of this forced isolation from their cultures, West Africans 
managed to combine European colonizers’ languages English, Spanish, 
French, or Portuguese, for example with parts of their West African 
languages and grammatical patterns to create new languages known broadly 
as creole . 
Because the Caribbean islands had a larger concentration of enslaved 
Africans than did North America, creole languages dominate there even 
today. In the United States, which had a smaller percentage of Africans in 
comparison to the total population, few examples of creole languages exist. 
One notable exception is the Gullah or Geechee language of coastal South 
Carolina and Georgia, in places where enslaved people once composed 5 
percent of the population.
Music  Africans brought their music with them. The syncopated rhythms 
and percussion they used influenced later styles. These include  gospel, blues, 
jazz, rock and roll, hip-hop, rap, samba, reggae, and country music. 
One reason many African descendants maintained their musical 
traditions was because enslaved Africans in America used them as a means 
of survival. They sang tunes from home to help them endure long workdays 
as well as to communicate with other Africans, such as when planning an 
escape. They blended European Christian music with their own religious 
songs, known today as Negro spirituals²essential elements of American 
folk music history. Enslaved people also invented the banjo, which is very 
similar to stringed instruments found in West Africa.
213 COLUMBIAN E XCHANGEFood  In addition to rice and okra, Africans brought their knowledge of 
how to prepare these foods. The dish known as gumbo , popular in the southern 
United States, has roots in African cooking. With influences on language, 
music, food, and much more, African culture has had a profound and lasting 
impact on life in the Americas.

Environmental and Demographic Impact
Contact between Afro-Eurasia and the Americas brought dramatic changes 
to both. Most changes resulted from the Columbian Exchange. In addition, 
though, Europeans used agricultural land more intensively than did American 
Indians. For example, colonists cut down trees to clear areas for planting 
crops, and they created large fields that they cultivated year after year. As 
a result, deforestation and soil depletion became problems in the Americas. 
In addition, Europeans often lived in more densely populated communities 
than did American Indians. This increased the strain on water resources and 
created more concentrated areas of pollution.

 —Anonymous West African griot (storyteller) song
Essential Question:   How were the empires of European states established  
between 1450 to 1750, and what economic and labor 
systems fueled them?
European nations, driven largely by political, religious, and economic 
rivalries, established new maritime empires and administered trading posts in 
Asia and Africa and colonies in the Americas. Asian trade frequently exchanged 
silver and gold for luxury goods such as silk and spices, while newly developed 
colonial economies in the Americas often depended on agriculture. 
American plantations relied on existing labor systems and also introduced 
new labor systems. Among these were indentured servitude , arrangements 
through which servants contracted to work for a specified period of 
years in exchange for passage. Another was chattel slavery , a system in 
which individuals were considered as property to be bought and sold. The 
appalling shock of free people being seized and enslaved is captured in the 
griot storyteller song of the West African Wolof people. The growth of 
the plantation economy increased the demand for enslaved Africans in the 
Americas, leading to significant demographic, social, and cultural changes.
State-Building and Empire Expansion
The explorations of European states see Topic .2 were the foundation of 
maritime empires. States claimed lands and established the basis of an empire 
in the areas they explored. 
219 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS Trading Posts in Africa and Asia
Certain regions of East and West Africa were the targets of European conquest 
during the late 15th century. Portuguese ruler Prince Henry the Navigator was 
keenly interested in navigational technology. See Topic .2. He financed 
expeditions along Africa’s Atlantic Coast and around the Cape of Good Hope, 
exploring African coastal communities before other European powers. 
With the cooperation of local rulers, first Portuguese and then other 
European traders set up trading posts along Africa’s coasts. Some local rulers 
traded enslaved people to the Europeans in exchange for gunpowder and 
cannons, giving those coastal governments a military advantage when battling 
neighboring villages. Some African city-states grew wealthy by selling 
enslaved Africans to Europeans. In particular, the .ingdom of Dahomey grew 
stronger because it raided other villages to enslave people, and sold them to 
European merchants. 
African States  In central West Africa, Portuguese explorers, traders, and 
missionaries made inroads into the .ongo and Benin kingdoms. Artwork from 
these societies bears signs of European as well as African cultural influences. As 
early as the 16th century, Benin artisans incorporated images of the European 
“intruder” into their carvings and sculptures. Yet the expansion of maritime 
trading networks supported the growth of some African states, including the 
Asante  Empire and the Kingdom of the Kongo . Their participation in trade 
led to an increase in their influence.
In 18, Portuguese explorer 9asco da Gama see Topic .1 invaded the 
Swahili city-states of East Africa, most of which were thriving commercial 
centers in the Indian Ocean trade. The Portuguese took over trade in .ilwa, 
Mombasa, and other city-states by sending heavily armed ships and building 
fortresses. This takeover threw the region into a devastating decline.
Japan  Just as European states were expanding their trade networks, Japan 
was sharply restricting its networks. Japan had tolerated the first Portuguese 
and Dutch traders and missionaries in the mid-16th century. Thousands of 
Japanese converted to Christianity. Some Christians, intolerant of other faiths, 
destroyed Buddhist shrines. In response, in 158, the Japanese government 
banned Christian worship services. Over the next 0 years, Japan took 
additional steps to persecute Christians and limit foreign influences. By 
the 160s, the government had expelled nearly all foreigners, banned most 
foreign books, and prohibited Japanese people from traveling ab road. 
For more than two centuries, Japan was partially isolated from the rest of 
the world. They allowed some Dutch merchants to live on a small island in 
Nagasaki harbor, in almost total seclusion. In addition, Japan continued some 
trade with the Chinese, mostly carried out by regional lords who were far from 
the capital city with easy access by sea to .orea, Taiwan, and Okinawa. The 
Japanese thought that they were through with the “uncouth” Europeans. 
However, Europeans and Americans would return in the mid-1th century.
China  After the voyages of =heng He in the 15th century, the Ming 
220 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONDynasty  tried to limit outside influence on China by restricting trade. The 
Ming prohibited private foreign trade, destroyed some dockyards, limited 
the size of ships that could be built, and began reconstructing the Great Wall. 
These changes were part of a broader pattern of conservatism under the Ming 
to undo the influence of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty that ruled China before 
them. For example, the Ming reemphasized the importance of Confucianism 
and reinvigorated the traditional exam system. Many of the limits on trade 
were eventually reversed, and China resumed its important role in global trade. 
European Rivalries on Five Continents
European rivalries fueled by political, economic, and religious motives  shaped 
the expansion of empires. Several powers established trading posts in India: 
• The British East India Company had begun a commercial relationship 
with the Mughal Empire in the 1th century. 
• Portugal controlled a coastal trading post in the southwestern state of 
Goa.
• France controlled Pondicherry, a city in the southeastern state of Tamil 
Nadu. 
During the mid-18th century, France and Great Britain, along with their 
respective allies, competed for power on five continents in the Seven Years’ 
War. Britain’s victory in that war in 16 drove the French out of India. The 
Portuguese remained in India until driven out in the mid-20th century .
British in India  At first, British trading posts in India were typical of those 
established by Europeans in India and elsewhere. The East India Company 
EIC established small forts on the coasts that focused solely on making a 
profit through trade. Limited by the power of India’s Mughal Empire, the EIC 
posts controlled very little territory.
However, the EIC then began to expand. It took advantage of the tensions 
between Muslims and Hindus in India and began to increase its political power 
through treaties with local rulers. With the help of European-trained Indian 
private forces called sepoys, the East India Company moved inland, spreading 
its influence. Ultimately, Britain intervened in India politically and militarily 
to such an extent that it controlled much of the subcontinent.
The British Global Network  The British also set up trading posts in West 
Africa, where the Asante Empire limited their impact. Trading posts in Africa, 
India, and elsewhere paved the way for globalization. Each post became a node, 
an intersection of multiple points serving as a trade center for goods from many 
parts of the world.
Europeans in the Americas
Before the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century, the Aztec Empire  in 
Mexico and the Inca Empire  in South America each included 10 million to 15 
million people. However, the spread of European diseases caused their populations 
to plummet. Both empires collapsed quickly when attacked by Spa nish forces.
221 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS In Mexico, helped by groups that the Aztecs had conquered, Cortps’s forces 
overthrew the Aztec by 1521 and established the colony of New Spain . The 
Spaniards melted down the Aztecs’ treasures and sent the gold back home. They 
destroyed Tenochtitlin and built their own capital, Mexico City , on its ruins.
In the Andes of South America, Francisco Pizarro  and his crew attacked 
the Inca and captured their ruler, Atahualpa . Pizarro offered to release 
Atahualpa if the Inca would fill a large room with gold. The Inca complied. 
However, in 15 the Spanish killed Atahualpa anyway. By 152, the Spaniards 
had completed their conquest of the Inca Empire.
Spain Versus Portugal  In the Treaty of Tordesillas  of 1, Spain and 
Portugal divided the Americas between them. Spain reserved all lands to the 
west of a meridian that went through eastern South America. Portugal reserved 
all lands east of this line. This arrangement put Brazil under Portugal’s rule, 
while Spain claimed the rest of the Americas .

222 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn addition to establishing colonies in Mesoamerica and South America, 
Spain explored other parts of North America north of present-day Mexico. The 
explorer Pedro Menpndez de Avilps established a fort in St. Augustine on the 
east coast of Florida in 1565, which became the oldest continuous settlement 
in what later became the United States. Spain would not be able to control all 
of North America, however, because the French, British, and Dutch later made 
claims and settlements there.
France Versus Britain  France and Britain continued to vie for dominance 
in North America. As British settlers moved into former Dutch territory in 
upper New York, they began to form ties with the powerful Iroquois, who had 
been in conflict with the French over trade issues for decades. The British 
hoped that the Iroquois could frustrate French trade interests. Over time, the 
Iroquois began to realize that the British posed more of a threat than the French. 
In a shift of alliances, the Iroquois and French signed a peace treaty known as 
the Great Peace of Montreal in 101. In the same war in which Britain drove 
France out of India, the British drove France out of Canada as well. The North  
American portion of this war is sometimes called the French and Indian War. 
Continuity and Change in Economic Systems
Although the intensification of trade and the increasing influence of Europeans 
brought some disruption to the Indian Ocean trading networks, on the whole, 
the system absorbed the changes and continued its familiar ways of doing 
business. Merchants in the Indian Ocean networks were used to paying taxes 
and fees to states controlling sea lanes and ports and operated often through

223 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS religious and ethnic ties. They did not use arms to protect their trade, and if the 
fees in one trading center became too high, they were free to move elsewhere. 
Europeans in the Indian Ocean Trade  The Portuguese, however, 
arrived with superior naval forces, religious zeal, and a determination to profit 
from the increasingly diverse products being traded, both from Asia to Europe 
and also within Asia. In addition to porcelain and silk from China, cloth from 
Gujarati weavers in western India, agricultural goods from Java, and spices 
from many places created an abundant market for trade and profit. In contrast 
to the ethnic and religious trading ties developed over hundreds of years, the 
Portuguese used their military superiority to take control of trade, creating a 
string of armed trading posts along the trade routes of the Indian Ocean. In 
150, for example, the Portuguese had a decisive victory in the Battle of Diu  in 
the Arabian Sea over the combined forces of Gujaratis, the Mamluks of Egypt, 
and the =amorin of Calicut with the support of 9enice, Portugal’s European 
competitor.  
Despite the differences between the traditional trading networks and those 
controlled by European powers, merchants in the Indian Ocean trade networks 
continued as before in many ways²paying for the right to use certain ports or 
passageways and developing trade links through traditional networks. 
Spain and Gold in the Americas  The Western European search for profit 
began with Columbus. On his first voyage, he was convinced that gold was 
plentiful on Hispaniola , the name he gave the island now occupied by Haiti 
and the Dominican Republic. But gold was sparse in the Caribbean. Desiring 
to return home with something valuable, Columbus and his crew kidnapped 
Tainos, indigenous peoples, and took them, enslaved, to Spain. 
In the early 1500s, the Spanish established a system called the encomienda  
to gain access to gold and other resources of the Americas. Encomenderos , or 
landowners, compelled indigenous people to work for them in exchange for 
food and shelter, as landowners required of serfs in Europe’s manorial system. 
This coercive labor system was notorious for its brutality. 
The Spanish crown often granted land to conquistadores  as a reward 
for their efforts. The  hacienda system  arose when landowners developed 
agriculture on their lands²wheat, fruit, vegetables, and sugar. They used 
coerced labor to work the fields. Most conquistadores were men and many had 
children with native women. This made the Spanish colonies unlike British 
colonies. 
Silver  While gold did not yield riches for Spanish conquistadores, the 
discovery of silver  in Mexico and Peru revived economic fortunes²for both 
individual explorers and Spain. The use of mercury to separate silver from 
its ore increased the profitability of silver mining. By the end of the 16th 
century, the cities of =acatecas, in Mexico, and especially Potost, in the Andes 
Mountains in modern-day Bolivia, became thriving centers of silver mining. 
For this industry to flourish, Spanish prospectors needed labor. The 
indigenous populations would do all but the most dangerous work in the 
mines. In response, Spanish authorities in Peru transformed the traditional 
224 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIncan mit’a system of labor obligation, in which young men were required to 
devote a certain amount of labor to public works projects, into a coerced labor 
system. 9illages were compelled to send a percentage of their male population 
to do the dangerous work in the mines for a paltry wage.
Silver and Mercantilism  The silver trade not only made individual 
Spanish prospectors wealthy, it also strengthened the Spanish economy. 
European powers at the time were adopting mercantilism , an economic 
system that increased government control of the economy through high tariffs 
and the establishment of colonies , claimed lands settled by immigrants from 
the home country. In the case of Spain, the main purpose of the colonies in the 
Americas was to supply as much gold and silver as possible. 
Another way to increase national wealth, according to the mercantilist 
system, was for a colonizing country to export more than it imported. A 
percentage of overseas silver production went directly to the Spanish crown. 
The empire used this wealth to build up the military and establish foreign trade.

225 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS During this era, Europeans sought sources of inexpensive labor in the 
Americas. Western European countries such as Portugal, Spain, and England 
were developing their naval technology, but Portugal was ahead of the others. 
In West Africa during the latter part of the 100s, Portuguese trading fleets 
arrived in the .ingdom of the .ongo seeking enslaved people. Initially they 
took the enslaved Africans back to Europe to work as domestic servants. 
Slavery existed in Africa²including the extensive enslavement of 
women as household workers²well before Europeans sought labor for 
their investments in the Americas. For example, in many societies, the entire 
community shared the land. In order to establish positions of wealth and power, 
individuals not only showcased the property they owned, but also showcased 
the enslaved people they owned. 
Europeans were also not the first foreigners to seek out African labor. Arab 
merchants during the Postclassical Era 600±150 often bought enslaved 
people during their travels to the Swahili Coast of East Africa. However, it 
was the Atlantic slave trade that wreaked the most havoc on African societies. 
Connect: Compose a graphic organizer comparing slavery during Sub-Saharan 
Africa’s early colonial period with slavery from 600 to 150. See Topic 2..  
Why Africans?  Several factors converged to make Africa a target for slave 
raids by Europeans after 150. Slavery in Latin America and the Caribbean 
began toward the end of the 16th century, when European conquistadores 
sought fortunes in gold, silver, and sugar. Land was plentiful, but labor to make 
the land profitable was scarce.
Europeans initially forced indigenous people to do the hard labor of mining 
and farming, but European diseases wiped out large portions of these coerced 
laborers. The enslaved indigenous people who survived often escaped bondage 
because, compared to Europeans, they were more familiar with the territory, 
had social networks that could protect them, and could easily camouflage 
themselves within the native population. Repeated efforts to enslave Native 
Americans failed, although other efforts to coerce labor did have some success.
Labor for Plantations  In North America, plantation owners recruited 
European indentured servants  who would come to work, mostly to grow 
tobacco, for a specified period in exchange for passage, room, and board. 
However, most of these people were not used to the backbreaking agricultural 
working conditions and the climate of the Americas. In addition, indentured 
servants were required to work for only about seven years. If they survived 
their indenture, they became free laborers. Thus, landowners did not think of 
indigenous captives and European indentured servants as ideal workers.
Transport of Enslaved Africans to the Americas  Capturing Africans 
for slavery was invariably violent. When African leaders along the coast 
realized that their kingdoms could economically benefit from the slave trade, 
they invaded neighboring societies in a quest for enslaved people to take back 
to the coast. At times, African rulers were also willing to hand over individuals 
from the lower rungs of their own societies, such as prisoners of war, servants, 
or criminals. 
226 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONHowever, .ing Afonso of .ongo understood that slave raids were not 
easily controllable. Though he had initially allowed slave trading in his 
kingdom, he had no intention of giving up his society’s elite to slavery, nor did 
he want .ongo to be depopulated. .ing Afonso also saw that his authority 
was undermined because his subjects were able to trade enslaved people for 
European goods without his involvement. Before the Europeans came, he had 
been able to control all trade in his domain.
The Horrors of the Journey  Captive Africans, swept away from their 
families, were taken to holding pens in West Africa known as barracoons, or 
“slave castles.” The modern country of Ghana has preserved these “Points of 
No Return,” where thousands upon thousands of Africans saw their homeland 
for the last time. Today, people can visit one such holding prison²the so-called 
House of Slaves on Ile de Gorpe Gorpe Island, on the coast of Senegal.
From these holding pens, slave traders next crammed their captives into 
the dank cargo section of a ship, providing them little water, food, or even 
room for movement. The grueling journey across the Atlantic was known as 
the Middle Passage , because it was the middle part of the captives’ journey. 
Many captured Africans attempted rebellions at sea, but most uprisings were 
crushed.  
During the journey to the Americas, which usually took about six weeks, 
up to half of a ship’s captives might die. Over the hundreds of years of the 
Atlantic slave trade, from the early 1500s to the mid-1th century, 10 to 
15 percent of all African captives perished before reaching the Americas.

Demographic, Social, and Cultural Changes  The growth of the 
planation economy and the expansion of slavery in the Americas led to 
significant changes that affected not only countless individual lives but also 
broad patterns of history. The physical migration of captives had significant 
impact on the demographics of both their African homes and the countries of 
their captivity. The exportation of enslaved people that was required to keep 
the population continuing in the country of captivity caused a century-long 
decline in population in African home countries. 
In addition to physical migration, slavery resulted in a migration of status, 
from free person to enslaved, setting up social classes that remain influential 
in post-slavery countries. Further, it disrupted family organization, since 
families were often separated, and more men than women were taken captive. 
Polygyny having more than one wife became more common. With people 
treated as commodities, as chattel slavery, social and family groupings were 
determined more by supply and demand than by the familial bonds of kinship. 
Each region in which slavery was introduced was affected in a unique 
way. However, in all of them, people with African roots helped shape and 
enrich the language and culture of the societies into which they were brought. 
The mixing of ethnic groups resulted in new groups of multiracial people, 
such as mestizos and mulattos.
The Indian Ocean Slave Trade  While most Africans who were enslaved 
and transported to the Americas came from west and central Africa, there 
was a long-running slave trade in the eastern part of the continent. By routes 
overland or in the Indian Ocean, enslaved East Africans were sold to buyers 
in northern Africa, the Middle East, and India. Many were transported to 
the islands off the southeast coast of Africa, such as Madagascar. The trade 
reached its peak in the 18th and 1th centuries.
228 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEnslaved people taken in the Indian Ocean trade suffered different fates 
from those taken across the Atlantic. People from the Indian Ocean region 
were more likely to work in seaports as laborers in the shipping industry and 
as household servants. Some worked as sailors or even soldiers. Living in 
towns or cities, they had some opportunity to develop communities and to 
work alongside free laborers. Those who ended up in Islamic communities 
had certain rights, such as the right to marry. As a result of the Indian Ocean 
slave trade, African words, musical styles, and customs can be found in Oman, 
India, and elsewhere.

“The widespread use of slavery was a systematic Spanish adaptation on 
the north Mexican frontier wherever nomadic Indians were encountered. 
Almost at the very moment that the New Laws 152 made slavery illegal 
in Mesoamerican Mexico, the Mixtyn War 151-152 in Nueva Galicia 
provided the initial reason for retaining the practice legally on the frontier 
for generations. The discovery of silver at =acatecas sealed the fate of 
Spanish-Indian relations not only on the Gran Chichimeca, but throughout 
most of the North. The inevitable resistance by hunter-gatherers to Spanish 
domination, the shortage of labor, and the semiautonomous political power 
wielded by provincial and local authorities insured the survival of slavery and 
encomienda in northern New Spain into the eighteenth century.”

231 MARITIME EM PIRES LINK REGIONS THINK AS A HISTORIAN:   PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE  IN PRIMAR Y 
SOURCES
One way to determine the accuracy of historical sources is to identify 
their purpose. However, their stated purpose is not necessarily their 
real purpose. Identifying their intended audience can help pin down the 
purpose of sources. 
Spanish historian, reformer, and later Dominican Friar Bartolomp de 
las Casas c. 18±1566 wrote what he referred to as eyewitness accounts 
of the suffering the Spaniards inflicted on the indigenous people. The 
following passage is from A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies  
published in Seville in 1552. Las Casas had used his observations to help 
pass the so-called New Laws in 152, which outlawed forcing indigenous 
people into slavery and attempted to ban the system of encomienda.
“In the Year 150, the Spaniards sailed to the Islands of St. John 
and Jamaica . . . with the same purpose and design they proposed 
to themselves in the Isle of Hispaniola, perpetrating innumerable 
Robberies and 9illanies as before whereunto they added unheard 
of Cruelties . . . . and Finally by afflicting and harassing them with 
un-exampled Oppressions and torments in the Mines, they spoiled and 
unpeopled this Contrey >country@ of these Innocents. These two Isles 
containing six hundred thousand at least, though at this day there are 
scarce two hundred men to be found in either of them, the remainder 
perishing without the knowledge of Christian Faith or Sacrament.”
Answer the following questions to help understand how the inten ded 
audience can reveal an author’s purpose. 
1. For what audience did Las Casas write these accounts" What does 
that audience suggest about his purpose for writing" 
2. Suppose these accounts had been written by a visitor from a 
competing European power eager to remove the Spanish from 
the Americas and take over the land for itself. What might be that 
author’s audience and purpose"
3. Read the historical perspectives on the brutality of the Spanis h on 
page 265. Then in a sentence or two explain the role of identifying 
purpose and audience in determining the accuracy of a historical 
source, referring to specific examples from that page.

—Charter, Dutch East India Company, 1602
Essential Question:   What economic strategies did maritime empires use 
to increase their power, and how did the developing 
empires affect political, economic,  religious,  and 
cultural dynamics?
Maritime sea-based empires transformed commerce from local, small-
scale trading, mostly based on barter, to large-scale international trade using 
gold and silver. These empires employed new economic models, such as joint-
stock companies, through which investors financed trade by buying shares in 
corporations such as the East India Company, supporting increased trade in 
Asia. New ocean trade routes were opened, aiding the rise of this extended 
global economy. The Atlantic trading system involved the movement of 
labor²including enslaved people²and the mixing of African, American, 
and European cultures and peoples, with all groups contributing to a cultural 
synthesis. Silver, sugar, and slavery were the keys to the development of these 
mercantilist empires.
Economic Strategies
In the 1th century, Europeans generally measured the wealth of a country in 
how much gold and silver it had in its coffers. To achieve this wealth, countries 
used economic strategies designed to sell as many goods as they could to other 
countries in order to obtain maximum amounts of gold and silver. To keep 
their wealth, countries would also spend as little of their precious metals as 
possible on goods from other countries. 
The accumulation of capital , material wealth available to produce more 
wealth, in Western Europe grew as entrepreneurs entered long-distance 
markets. Capital changed hands from entrepreneurs to laborers, putting 
laborers in a better position to become consumers²and even investors, as the 
above quote suggests. Despite restrictions by the Church, lending money at 
high rates of interest became commonplace. Actual wealth also increased with 
gold and silver from the Western Hemisphere.
233 MARITIME EM PIRES DEVELOPCommercial Revolution   
The transformation to a trade-based economy using gold and silver is known as 
the Commercial Revolution . The Commercial Revolution affected all regions 
of the world and resulted from four key factors: the development of European 
overseas colonies the opening of new ocean trade routes population growth 
and inflation, caused partly by the pressure of the increasing population and 
partly by the increased amount of gold and silver that was mined and put in 
circulation. The high rate of inflation, or general rise in prices, in the 16th and 
early 1th century is called the Price Revolution .
Aiding the rise of this extended global economy was the formation of 
joint-stock companies , owned by investors who bought stock or shares in 
them. People invested capital in such companies and shared both the profits 
and the risks of exploration and trading ventures. Offering limited liability , 
the principle that an investor was not responsible for a company’s debts or 
other liabilities beyond the amount of an investment, made investing safer .  
The developing European middle class had capital to invest from 
successful businesses in their home countries. They also had money with which 
to purchase imported luxuries. The Dutch, English, and French all developed 
joint-stock companies in the 1th century, including the British  East India 
Company  in 1600 and the Dutch East India Company  in 1602. In Spain and 
Portugal, however, the government did most of the investing itself through 
grants to certain explorers. Joint-stock companies were a driving force behind 
the development of maritime empires as they allowed continued exploration 
as well as ventures to colonize and develop the resources of distant lands with 
limited risk to investors. 
Commerce and Finance  The Dutch were long the commercial 
middlemen of Europe, having set up and maintained trade routes to Latin 
America, North America, South Africa, and Indonesia. Dutch ships were faster 
and lighter than those of their 
rivals for most of the 1th 
century, giving them an early 
trade advantage. The Dutch  
East India Company was also 
highly successful as a joint-stock 
company. It made enormous 
profits in the Spice Islands and 
Southeast Asia.

234 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONPioneers in finance, the Dutch had a stock exchange as early as 1602.  
By 160, the Bank of Amsterdam traded currency internationally. The Dutch 
standard of living was the highest in Europe as such goods as diamonds, 
linen, pottery, and tulip bulbs passed through the hands of Dutch traders.
France and England were not so fortunate. Early in the 18th century, both 
fell victim to speculative financial schemes. .nown as financial bubbles, the 
schemes were based on the sale of shares to investors who were promised a 
certain return on their investment. After a frenzy of buying that drove up the 
price of shares, the bubble burst and investors lost huge amounts of money, 
sending many into bankruptcy and inflicting wide damage to the economy .
Triangular Trade  The Europeans’ desire for enslaved workers in the 
Americas coupled with Portugal’s “discovery” of West Africa meant that Africa 
became the source for new labor. Enslaved Africans became part of a complex 
Atlantic trading system known as the triangular trade , because voyages often 
had three segments. A ship might carry European manufactured goods such 
as firearms to West Africa, and from there transport enslaved Africans to the 
Americas, and then load up with sugar or tobacco to take to Europe. Sugar was 
the most profitable good from the Americas. By the 100s, Caribbean sugar 
production and rum made from sugar were financing fortunes in Britain, and 
to a lesser extent, in France and the Netherlands.

235 MARITIME EM PIRES DEVELOPRivalries for the Indian Ocean Trade
After Europeans stumbled on the Americas, trade over the Atlantic Ocean 
became significant. However, states continued to vie for control of trade 
routes on the Indian Ocean as well. The Portuguese soundly defeated a 
combined Muslim and 9enetian force in a naval battle in the Arabian Sea 
in 150 see Topic . over controlling trade. They met a different fate, 
though, when they tried to conquer Moroccan forces in a battle on land in 
158. 
Its coffers depleted after the victory, Morocco looked inland to capture 
the riches of the Songhai .ingdom, despite the prohibition of waging war on 
another Muslim state. With thousands of soldiers, camels, and horses, as well 
as eight cannons and other firearms, Moroccan forces traveled months to reach 
Songhai. In 150, in a battle near Gao, the Songhai²despite their greater 
number of fighters²were overcome by the force of firearms. The empire 
crumbled. The Spanish and Portuguese soon overtook much of this territory.
Change and Continuities in Trade Networks
The trading networks involved a new global circulation of goods, wealth, and 
labor. Silver from the Spanish colonies in the Americas flowed to Asia, where  
Asians were eager to exchange their goods²silks, porcelain, steel products²
for silver. Asian goods were eagerly purchased in the Atlantic markets. 
New Monopolies  One way these patterns of trade were maintained was 
through monopolies  chartered by European rulers. Monopolies granted certain 
merchants²usually through a joint-stock company²or the government itself 
the exclusive right to trade. For example, the Spanish government established 
a monopoly first over all the domestic tobacco grown and then over all the 
tobacco grown in its American colonies. The profits from this monopoly 
greatly enriched the Spanish government. The income from tobacco in Spain 
made up about one-third of total revenues. 
Ongoing Regional Markets  At the same time, traditional regional 
markets continued to flourish in Afro-Eurasia. However, improved shipping 
offered merchants the opportunity to increase their volume of products. The 
increasing output of peasant and artisan labor²wool and linen from Western 
Europe, cotton from India, and silk from China²exchanged hands in port 
cities with global connections.

The Atlantic slave trade greatly weakened several West African kingdoms, 
such as .ongo. The loss of so many people slowed population growth. Trade 
competition led to violence among their societies, but also made African 
slave-raiding kingdoms economically dependent on goods from Europe. 
Such societies were slow to develop more complex economies in which they 
produced their own goods. Thus, the slave trade set the stage for European 
conquest and imperialism of the late 1th century. See Topic 6.2.
236 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEconomically, African societies that conducted slave raids, such as the 
Dahomey  and the Oyo, became richer from selling their captives to Europeans. 
This trade also had political effects, because when a society such as the Dahomey 
exchanged enslaved people for guns, its raiders easily took advantage of rival 
societies that had no firearms. Without firearms, neighboring groups could not 
fight off  slave raids, so raiding societies became even richer and more fortified 
with firearms. Intergroup warfare thus became more common and bloodier as 
a result of the slave trade.
Slavery and Gender  Those most affected by the slave trade were the 
peoples and civilizations of West Africa in present-day Ghana and Benin, from 
which most Africans were kidnapped or sold. Gender distributions in those 
regions became severely imbalanced, because more than two-thirds of those 
taken were males. The resulting predominance of women prompted a rise in 
polygyny  the taking of more than one wife and forced women to assume 
duties that had traditionally been men’s jobs. 
Impact of New Foods  While the Atlantic trading system weakened 
Africa in many ways, it also ultimately spurred population growth through 
an improved diet. The Columbian Exchange introduced new crops to the 
continent, such as the American crops maize, peanuts, and manioc also known 
as yucca or cassava, which became staples in the African diet.
Political and Cultural Changes for Indigenous Peoples
Earlier land-based empires, such as those of the Romans, Muslims, and 
Mongols, all grappled with how to deal with conquered people’s traditions 
and cultures. These empires either allowed traditions to exist or they tried 
to graft their ways onto those of their subjects. European empires in the 
Americas stood in stark contrast to these land-based empires. The Spanish and 
Portuguese empires managed to erase the basic social structures and many of 
the cultural traditions of the indigenous Americans within a century of when 
the first European explorers arrived. Europeans’ actions nearly depopulated 
the Americas. 
Political Changes: Colonial Administration  Indigenous political 
structures in Latin America were soon replaced by Spanish and Portuguese 
colonial administrations. Spanish royalty appointed viceroys  to act as 
administrators and representatives of the Spanish crown. To keep these viceroys 
from operating independently of the crown, Spain established audiencias , or 
royal courts, to which Spanish settlers could appeal viceroys’ decisions or 
policies. Slow transportation and communication networks between Europe 
and the Americas, however, made it difficult for the Spanish crown to exercise 
direct control over New Spain. As a result, the Spanish throne did not focus on 
colonial affairs in the Western Hemisphere.
Cultural Changes  The indigenous peoples of the Americas lost a great 
deal of their culture and history at the hands of conquerors. Conquistadors, 
such as Cortps in Mexico, ordered the burning of native books, which were 
237 MARITIME EM PIRES DEVELOPthought to be unholy. Thus, very few original accounts written in Nahuatl, the 
language of the Aztec, exist today.
The scarcity of firsthand accounts from indigenous peoples has shaped 
how historians view this period. For example, because the Spanish burned 
nearly all Aztec documents, most of the information about the Aztec comes 
from documents that were written by Spanish conquistadores and priests after 
the conquest. The authors’ biases and lack of familiarity with Nahuatl limits 
the value of these sources. However, some sources are considered reliable. 
For example, in 155, a Spanish priest named Bernardino de Sahag~n began 
compiling the Florentine Codex, one of the most widely cited sources about 
Aztec life before conquest. A codex is a type of book.
Spanish and Portuguese conquerors transplanted their own languages and 
religion into the Americas. The remnants of this cultural interaction are present 
today. Although indigenous languages thrive in certain regions²in Guatemala 
and in the mountains of Mexico, for example²Spanish predominates through 
much of Latin America, and Brazilians overwhelmingly speak Portuguese.
By 150, those born in America of Spanish origin, or creoles , enjoyed 
political dominance in New Spain. They soon began clamoring for independence 
from the Spanish throne. Connect: Create a two-column chart comparing the

The increase and intensity of newly established global connections between  
hemispheres extended the reach of existing religions. In some areas, the new 
connections contributed to the development of syncretic belief systems and 
practices. In other areas, the connections contributed to religious conflicts. 
Syncretic Belief Systems in the Americas
African religions in the Americas provide powerful examples of religious 
syncretism,  or the combining of different religious beliefs and practices. 
Africans melded aspects of Christianity, usually Roman Catholicism, with 
their West African religious traditions, such as drumming, dancing, and a 
belief in spirits that could take over and act through a person:
• Santería means “the way of the saints.” Originally an African faith, it 
became popular in Cuba and then traveled throughout Latin America 
and to North America.
• Vodun means “spirit” or “deity.” This belief system originated with 
African peoples of Dahomey, .ongo, and Yoruba who were enslaved 
and living in Saint-Domingue, which is now Haiti.
• Candomblé means “dance to honor the gods.” It is a combination 
of Yoruba, Fon, and Bantu beliefs from different parts of Africa. It 
developed in Brazil.
238 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEnslaved Africans in the United States also laid the roots for the African 
American church, a hybrid of Christianity and African spiritual traditions that 
remains one of the oldest and most stable institutions in African American 
communities.
Islam  About 1 in 10 of the enslaved Africans practiced Islam. While some 
of the men who sailed with Columbus may have been Muslims, these enslaved 
Africans became the first significant presence of Islam in the Americas.
Religion in Latin America  Several Catholic religious orders in Europe, 
such as the Dominicans, Jesuits, and Franciscans, sent missionaries to Latin 
America to convert people to Christianity. The missionaries were so successful 
that today most Latin Americans are Roman Catholic Christians. In recent 
decades, Protestant denominations have begun to gain members. 
Numerous examples of religious syncretism originated in the Spanish 
colonies. Catholic saints’ days that coincided with days honored by indigenous 
people were especially celebrated. In Mexico, a cult developed around the 
dark-complexioned Virgin of Guadalupe , who was revered for her ability to 
perform miracles. 
Global Interactions and Religious Conflicts
Syncretic religions also developed in Afro-Eurasia as global interactions 
intensified. Sufism, for example, with its focus on personal salvation, helped 
spread Islam and may have influenced Sikhism, which blended Muslim and 
Hindu belief systems. The Mughal leader Akbar see Topic .2 tried to 
mediate conflicts between Muslims and Hindus under his control.
Religion also played a role in conflicts as global interactions increased. 
The split between Sunni and Shi’a Muslims worsened conflicts between the 
Ottoman and Safavid empires. See Topic .1. The split between Catholicism 
and Protestantism, and between official state religions such as Anglicanism 
and other Protestant sects, helped drive the settlement of North America as 
people sought freedom to worship as they saw fit.

—John Easton, A 5arrati]e of the *auses >hich 3ed to 7hilip’s 0ndian >ar , 1858
Essential Question:   How did the development of state power result in 
external and internal challenges in the period between 
1450 and 1750?
As empires developed and changed, many social, political, and economic 
groups resisted state expansion through a variety of challenges to state power. 
Some of these revolts occurred in the home of the empire. For example, the 
Fronde  civil disturbances in France between 168 and 165 attempted to curb 
growing royal power. 
Other disturbances took place within colonies. For instance, Metacom’s 
War  165±168, also called .ing Philip’s War, was in part a result of English 
colonists using underhanded tactics such as that described in the quote above 
in their continuing pressure to control Native American lands. Several powers 
sought to create empires in the 16th and 1th centuries. They fought with one 
another and with indigenous peoples. 
Resistance to Portugal in Africa
By the 1th century, the Dutch and the English had pushed the Portuguese out 
of South Asia. See Topic 1.. The Portuguese looked to Africa, where it had 
carried out slave raids since the 15th century, to build a colony. In 162, Ana 
Nzinga  became ruler of Ndongo  in south-central Africa present-day Angola. 
In addition to the slave raids by Portugal, other African peoples were attacking 
Ndongo. In exchange for protection from neighboring powers and an end to 
Portugal’s raids, Nzinga became an ally of Portugal. Nzinga was baptized 
as Christian, with the governor of the Portuguese colony as her godfather. 
However, the alliance broke down. Nzinga and her people fled west, taking 
over the state of Matamba . She then incited a rebellion in Ndongo, allied 
with the Dutch, and offered freedom in Matamba to enslaved Africans. Nzinga 
ruled for decades, building Matamba into an economically strong state.
244 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONLocal Resistance in Russia
In contrast to the Portuguese empire, pressures on state power came from 
within Russia, not outside of it. While conditions had improved for serfs see 
Topic 1.6 in Western Europe by the 1th century, the same was not true for the 
serfs in Russia. Wars during the 1th and 15th centuries weakened the central 
government and increased the power of the nobility. 
As demand for grain increased, nobles imposed harsh conditions on 
serfs. But Russian serfs had long been oppressed. First the Mongols and later 
the Russian princes collected heavy tribute and taxes for services such as 
protection or to support the government’s army from the peasants. As a result, 
the peasants’ debts increased, and over time more peasants lost their lands and 
were forced into serfdom. 
Serfdom, Power, and Control  The practice of serfdom benefitted the 
government because it kept the peasants under control, regulated by the 
nobility. Serfdom also benefitted the landowners because it provided free 
labor. Although townspeople were also controlled and not permitted to move 
their businesses freely to other cities, the serfs were practically enslaved, their 
labor bought and sold along with the lands of their owners.
As Russian territory expanded west to the Baltic and east to Siberia, the 
institution of serfdom expanded with it. An agricultural state, Russia kept serfs 
tied to the land long after the practice had ended, practically if not legally, in

245 INTERNA L AND EXTERNA L CHALLENGES TO STATE POWER 245Western Europe. For example, Elizabeth I freed the last remaining serfs in 
England in 15. In contrast, a law of 16 chained Russian serfs to the lands 
where they were born and ensured their service to their landlords, who could 
buy and sell them and administer punishments. The village communes, called 
mirs, also controlled even the small landholders among the peasants. 
Cossacks and Peasant Rebellions  Southwest of Moscow, near the Black 
Sea, peasants who were skilled fighters lived on the grassy, treeless steppes . 
Many were runaway serfs who lived in small groups, influenced by the ways 
of the neighboring nomadic descendants of the Mongols. These fierce Cossack 
warriors were sometimes at odds with the central, autocratic government of 
the tsars. However, these fiercely independent warriors could also be hired as 
mercenaries to defend “Mother Russia” against Swedish, Tartar, and Ottoman 
forces. The Cossacks were thus important in Russia’s expansion to the Ural 
Mountains and farther east into Siberia.
A Cossack known as Yemelyan Pugachev  began a peasant rebellion 
against Catherine the Great in 1 for giving the nobility power over the serfs 
on their lands in exchange for political loyalty, leaving the peasants without ties 
or recourse to the state. Falsely claiming to be Catherine’s murdered husband, 
Peter III, Pugachev gathered a following of discontented peasants, people 
from different ethnic groups, and fellow Cossacks. At one point, these groups 
controlled the territory between the 9 olga River and the Urals. Within a year, 
though, the Russian army captured Pugachev and the Russian government 
executed him. The Pugachev Rebellion  caused Catherine to increase her 
oppression of the peasants in return for the support of the nobles to help her 
avoid future revolts.
Rebellion in South Asia
In the 16th and 1th centuries, the Mughal empire controlled much of what is 
now India and Pakistan. See Topic .1. The Mughals centralized government 
and spread Persian art and culture as well as Islam. However, much of the 
population remained Hindu. The Maratha²a Hindu warrior group²fought 
the Mughals in a series of battles from 1680±10. They created the Hindu 
Maratha Empire.  It lasted until 1818, effectively ending the Mughal rule of 
India.
Revolts in the Spanish Empire 
Spain also experienced rebellions within its territories. The Pueblo Revolt  
took place in 1680 against the Spanish in what is now New Mexico. The 
Pueblo and Apache, two indigenous groups, fought colonizers who were 
trying to force religious conversions. The indigenous people killed about 00 
Spaniards, drove the rest out of the area, and destroyed churches. The Spanish 
reconquered the area in 162.
246 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONStruggles for Power in England and Its Colonies
Although Spain colonized much of the Caribbean, England’s power there 
grew stronger. England defeated Spanish colonists and took control of much 
of Jamaica in 1655. Enslaved people in the Caribbean and former Spanish 
territories in the Americas fought to gain freedom in what were known as 
Maroon wars 128±10 and 15±16. 
Maroons were descendants of Africas who had escaped slavery in Jamaica. 
They escaped their owners and formed independent settlements. Queen 
Nanny , herself had escaped slavery, united all the maroons of the island. 
Jamaicans later recognized her as a national hero.
Slave revolts were common in the Americas, especially in those locations 
where enslaved Africans outnumbered free Europeans. The first recorded slave 
revolt in what is now the United States was the Gloucester County Rebellion  
in 9irginia in 166. In this rebellion, enslaved Africans and white indentured 
servants conspired together to demand their freedom from the governor. 
Authorities found out about their plot, ambushed them, and arrested them. 
Metacom’s War, discussed earlier in this topic, was the final major effort 
of the indigenous people to drive the British from New England. The war 
spread throughout New England and resulted in the destruction of 12 towns. 
Some Native American groups, including the Mohegan  and Pequot , sided 
with the English. Although Native American peoples continued to live in the 
region, the war ended with the subjugation of the Wampanoag people to the 
English colonists. 
Struggles for power took place within England as well. In 1685, James II  
became king. James was Catholic, and his anti-Protestant measures enraged 
many English people. A group of nobles invited William of Orange , who was 
James’s nephew and son-in-law, to invade England with an army and become 
the new king. He agreed, landing in England in 1688. James fled to France. In 
168, William and his wife Mary II  James’s daughter began their joint rule 
of England. Both William and Mary were Protestant, and the English throne 
remained in Protestant hands after that.
English people called this revolt the Glorious Revolution  or the Bloodless 
Revolution. It strengthened the power of Parliament, which passed a law 
forbidding Catholics to rule England. That revolution took place without much 
violence, but religious tensions continued in England and throughout much 
of the world. Connect: Create a graphic organizer of the rebellions that were

249 INTERNA L AND EXTERNA L CHALLENGES TO STATE POWER SHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 was one of the most significant events in New 
Mexico history. But 1680 was not the first time New Mexico’s Pueblos had 
attempted to rebel against the Spanish government. Beginning with the 
Acoma Revolt of 15, Spanish intolerance of Pueblo religious practices 
and a persistent abuse of Pueblo labor had prompted several revolts against 
the Spanish in the seventeenth century. These uprisings, however, were 
discovered and ruthlessly crushed before they could grow into broader 
action. . . . 
The Spanish remained at El Paso until 162. For a while it appeared that 
the revolt had indeed succeeded. Popay and the other Pueblo leaders began 
a systematic eradication of all signs of Christianity and Spanish material 
culture. Everyone was to bathe in a ritual which washed away any trace 
of baptism, and Christian marriages were invalidated until reconfirmed by 
native tradition. . . . 
But it was easier to order the eradication of all vestiges of the Spanish 
presence than to accomplish it. Many items of material culture which had 
been introduced by the Spanish²iron tools, sheep, cattle, and fruit trees, 
for example²had become an integral part of Pueblo life. A few individuals, 
deeply influenced by the teachings of the Franciscans, rescued and hid the 
sacred objects of their adopted religion to await the eventual return of the 
Spanish friars.”

Understanding the internal and external challenges to state power from 
150 to 150 requires understanding the broader context in which they 
developed. This understanding should go beyond simple identification, 
such as “The context in which internal and external challenges to state 
power took place was the widespread expansion of empires.” Instead, 
work to explain how or why the context specifically relates to the 
internal and external challenges to state power. That is, ask, “What 
specifically about the context sheds light on the challenges"” To answer 
that question, complete the following activities.
First, review the four features of the historical concept of em pire 
outlined on the last page of Topic .1. For each bullet point, explain 
in a sentence or two how that context relates to the internal o r  
external challenges to state power you read about in this topic . 
Next, copy the timeline on page 18 on separate paper, leaving 
plenty of room between dates. Then review this topic, adding into 
the timeline the rebellions, revolts, and wars that arose as ch allenges 
to state power. By situating these developments in a chronological 
context, you may discover additional explanations.

Changing Social Hierarchies
>e    order the said 1ews and 1ewesses of our kingdoms to depart and  
ne]er to return or come back to them or to any of them 
 —Ferdinand and Isabella, Edict of the Expulsion of the Jews, 1492
Essential Question:   How were social categories, roles, and practices 
maintained or changed from 1450 to 1750?
As societies faced rebellions from outside and within, social hierarchies 
began to develop and transform. In Europe, the treatment of Jews showed 
that majorities treated non-majority ethnic groups in different ways. Jews had 
been expelled from England 120, France 1, and, as stated above, Spain 
12. The Ottoman Empire, however, provided a safe haven for Jews fleeing 
discrimination in Europe.
Throughout the world, civilizations developed distinctive social hierarchies. 
Different groups²including royalty, nobility, landowners, scholars, and 
soldiers²sought power and influence. In some societies, merchants and 
artisans began to form a middle class. And peasants, serfs, poor people, and 
enslaved people often struggled to stay alive. 
Many states created policies that discriminated against some groups 
based on religion, ethnicity, or social class. For example, Huguenots²French 
Protestants in the predominantly Catholic country²suffered great persecution, 
and many fled to other European countries or to colonies. States also supported 
the formation of elite classes, including the boyars in Russia and the nobility in 
Europe. These elites both supported ruling power and challenged it.
Social Classes and Minorities in Gunpowder Empires
Tension between the military elite and absolutist rulers existed in three Islamic 
empires: the Ottoman Turkey, the Safavids Iran, and the Mughals India. 
They are called gunpowder empires because they succeeded militarily by using 
guns and cannons when they first became widely available. See Topic .1.
Ottoman Society  The Ottoman social system was built around a warrior 
aristocracy that soon began to compete for positions in the bureaucracy with 
the ulama , who were scholars and experts in Islamic law. Within the military, 
the Janissaries gained power and prestige. See Topic .2. Ultimately, the 
Janissaries tried to mount coups against the sultans. 
252 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONAs sultans became increasingly ineffective and incapable, strong advisors 
called viziers  gained influential positions in government, where they spoke for 
the sultan. However, the sultan still had considerable powers. These included 
timar,  a system in which the sultan granted land or tax revenues to those he 
favored. The sultan also used timar to reward soldiers and keep them loyal.
Treatment of Religious Minorities  One reason for the success of the 
Ottoman Empire was its relative tolerance toward Jews and Christians. After 
the Spanish monarch exiled Jews from his kingdom in 12, Sultan Mehmed 
II invited them to settle in Istanbul. Many did. Some Jews became court 
physicians and diplomats. Others contributed to the literary community and 
might have brought the printing press to the Ottoman Empire. While they 
were allowed to worship, they did not have full equality:
• They were permitted to live only in specified areas of the cities. 
• They paid a tax called a jizya that was required of all non-Muslims in 
the empire. 
• They could not hold top positions in the empire, which were reserved 
for Muslims. 
Religious Toleration in the Mughal Empire  The Mughal Empire in 
what is now India began in 1526. Probably its greatest emperor was Akbar 
the Great  ruled 1556±1605, remembered for his military successes and his 
administrative achievements. To help keep his huge, fractious empire together, 
Akbar, like Ottoman rulers, was tolerant of all religions. He ended the jizya 
tax. He gave grants of land and money to Hindus and Muslims, provided funds 
to build a Catholic church, and supported Sikhism. For more on Akbar’s 
religious toleration, see Topic ..
Women in the Ottoman Empire  Women also played social and political 
roles at court. Many wives and concubines of the sultan tried to promote 
their own children as likely heirs to the throne. This practice led to “harem 
politics,” a reference to the harem , a residence where a powerful man’s wives 
and concubines lived. 
One woman, Roxelana , became unusually powerful in the Ottoman 
Empire. When she was a young girl, Crimean raiders stole Roxelana from 
her home in Eastern Europe and sold her into slavery in the Ottoman Empire. 
She was forced to convert to Islam and entered the harem of Suleiman the 
Magnificent, sultan of the empire. Suleiman was notable for his military and 
administrative skill. Suleiman married Roxelana, which was highly unusual. 
She went from being enslaved to commissioning ambitious public works 
projects. 
Roxelana’s son succeeded Suleiman. During the son’s reign, viziers 
complained about a “sultanate of the women.” They believed members of the 
harem had too much influence on politics. Roxelana’s rise showed that it was 
possible²though rare²for people at this time to attain a different social class.Source : Titian, La Sultana Rossa,  c. 1550. John and Mable Ringling Museum

Roxelana became famous for her power as an Ottoman leader.
253 CHANGING SOCIA L HIERARC HIES253Other Social Classes  Merchants and artisans formed a small middle 
class in the empire. Below the middle class were the peasants, who were 
usually poor—particularly because they had to pay tribute to the government 
to help support the 
Ottoman armies. Below 
the peasants were the 
enslaved. They came from 
many areas as the Ottoman 
armies penetrated Central 
and Eastern Europe, 
capturing prisoners of war 
in Ukraine and elsewhere. 
Barbary pirates , those 
who plied the seas near 
North Africa along the

for the Berbers who 
lived there captured 
other Europeans in the 
Mediterranean and then

navy as enslaved galley 
workers. As many as

China’s Qing Dynasty  lasted from 16 until 112. Under this dynasty, the 
Manchu  people from Manchuria ruled over the majority Han Chinese and 
other ethnic groups. Like the Mongols some 00 years earlier, the Manchu 
were ethnically and culturally distinct from the people they ruled. However, 
they were less tolerant than the Mongol leaders, and they resolved to make 
their culture dominant in China. 
Like the Mongols, the Qing put their own people in the top positions of 
government. Also like the Mongols, the Qing maintained continuity with some 
traditional Chinese practices. For example, they maintained the Chinese civil 
service exams and bureaucracy. They recruited Han Chinese to work under or 
alongside Manchus. In time, some²but not all²Chinese came to accept the 
Qing Dynasty as legitimate rulers of China.

254 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONto wear Hanfu, or traditional Han clothing, all men were required to wear their 
hair in queues , the braided pigtail style of the Manchu. This policy was a test 
of loyalty for the Manchu, but it was also a humiliating reminder of the way 
Qing authority challenged traditional Confucian values. A man who refused to 
wear his hair in a queue could be executed. 
The Qing used Han Chinese defectors to carry out massacres against 
Han who refused to assimilate to Qing practices. These defectors played 
a massive role in the Qing conquest of China. Han Chinese General 
Li Chengdong , for example, orchestrated three separate massacres in the 
city of Jaiding within one month. By the end of those four weeks, there 
was hardly a person left alive in the city. Later, Han Chinese defector 
Liu Liangzuo  massacred the entire population of Jiangyin, killing between 
,000 and 100,000 people.
European Hierarchies
Like states in South and East Asia, European states also had a social 
hierarchy. In Europe the top level was royalty²members of a royal family. 
The aristocracy or nobility was the next highest level. Nobles were usually 
wealthy landowners. Nearly every state in Europe had laws that recognized 
a class of nobles and granted them special privileges. The nobility made up a 
small minority of the population but owned most of the land. They maintained 
their power through a system in which lands and titles passed down from one 
generation to the next through a system of inheritance.
The Nobility Makes Gains  In the Netherlands and England, the nobility 
held power and took an active part in the government. Dutch landowners 
provided the stable support for local provincial government. In England, large 
landowners controlled Parliament. However, the landowners had to contend 
with radical religious sects and the middle class, which were two growing 
segments of the social order.
The Nobility Faces Losses  Nobles struggled for power with royalty, the 
emerging middle class of merchants and skilled workers, the priestly class, and 
the common people. A failed uprising in France in the mid-1600s convinced 
Louis XIV  that he must keep power from the common people and the nobility. 
The nobility also faced criticism from writers and thinkers of the time. The 
English statesman Thomas More wrote this about the nobility: “Living in 
idleness and luxury without doing society any good no longer satisfies them 
they have to do positive evil.”
Power of Royalty over Nobility  Gunpowder, cannons, and other 
technological advances allowed rulers to destroy nobles’ fortresses and seize 
their lands. Many rulers believed they deserved absolute power. Louis ;I9 is 
famous for saying, “I am the state.” However, Frederick of Prussia saw things 
differently. He declared, “I am the first servant of the state.” (Connect: Trace 
the changes in social hierarchy from feudal Europe to the 1th century. See 
Topic 1.6.  
255 CHANGING SOCIA L HIERARC HIESGrowing Acceptance of Jews  Jews began to have a larger role in 
many countries starting in the 1th century. Their expulsion from Spain, by 
Ferdinand and Isabella, was particularly significant because so many Jews 
lived there. Many resettled in areas around the Mediterranean Sea, in northern 
Africa or the Middle East. Since the Hebrew word for Spain is Sepharad,  Jews 
who trace their heritage back to Spain became known as Sephardic Jews . In 
contrast, Jews from central and eastern Europe became known as Ashkenazi 
Jews . Jewish scholars once used the term Ashkenazi to refer to Germany. 
Under the influence of the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment, 
prejudices against Jews declined somewhat. Jews began to move more freely 
in Europe. They became particularly important in banking and commerce. 
The Netherlands was especially tolerant of religious dissent, and the Jewish 
minority faced less discrimination there than in most of Europe. Many Jews 
hoped the centuries of discrimination they had confronted were over . 
Russian Social Classes
Moscow
s social hierarchy continued that of .ievan Rus in the 11th century. 
The noble landowning class, the boyars , topped the social pyramid. Below 
them were the merchants. Last and most numerous were the peasants, who 
gradually sank into debt and. They became serfs,  peasants who received a plot 
of land and protection from a noble. In return, they were bound to that land 
and had little personal freedom. If the noble sold their land, control of the serfs 
went with it. Though not technically enslaved, serfs led very hard lives.
The boyar class experienced tensions with the rulers similar to the tensions 
between nobles and rulers in Western Europe. Boyars of Novgorod opposed the 
expansionist policies of Ivan IV , known as “Ivan the Terrible” for murdering 
his own son, among other crimes. After Ivan
s forces defeated Novgorod, Ivan 
confiscated the lands of his boyar opponents. He forced them and their families 
to move to Moscow, where he could keep them under surveillance.
Political and Economic Elites in the Americas
Social structures in the Americas changed drastically during this period 
because of the arrival of Europeans, the importation of African slave labor, and 
outbreaks of disease that killed tens of millions. The combination of European 
settlers, imported Africans, and the conquered indigenous populations led to 
the development of a new social hierarchy based on race and ancestry. Skin 
color became a signifier of power and status in many parts of the Americas 
and, in fact, in all European colonies. Racial and ethnic background defined 
social status in a formal way in the Spanish and Portuguese empires in the 
Western Hemisphere for centuries following the Europeans’ arrival. 
The Casta System in Latin America  At the top of the social pyramid 
in Latin America stood the peninsulares , those who were born on the Iberian 
peninsula. Next down the pyramid were the criollos , those of European

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“Nowadays, some 185 years after most of the Latin American nations 
obtained their independence, none of the Latin governments consider race 
to be an issue. All of these governments are firmly convinced that the racial 
caste system of colonial times has totally disappeared. This firmly held 
conviction is, however, not shared by academics and ordinary citizens who 
have noticed the distinct racial stratification of the Latin American societies. 
For these dissenters, the prevailing racial economic hierarchy and the easily 
uncovered attitudes that consider the dark-skinned unattractive and inferior 
clearly indicate that the racial caste system continues to operate.
Today’s racial caste system is, of course, not nearly as rigid as it was in 
colonial times. But the fact that it has survived 185 years of social, economic, 
and political advances implies that this system is deeply embedded in the 
Latin societies. Hence, it must have relevant social, economic, and political 
effects.”

Evidence in an argument can serve a variety of purposes. Its most common 
purpose is to support the claim at the heart of an argument. Specific facts 
or examples that demonstrate the truth of a more general assertion in the 
thesis fulfill this purpose. Evidence can also modify a claim by providing 
facts, examples, or reasoning that show that parts of the claim are true but 
that other parts are not. Evidence can also refute, or disprove, a claim. 
Evidence that serves this purpose provides facts, examples, or reasoning 
that support an alternative or opposing claim. 
Consider the claim in bold type below in this argument: When 
.ing Ferdinand expelled the Jews from Spain in 12, he provided for a 
three-month period for them to ready themselves for departure. The .ing 
promised that the state would “take and receive them under our Security, 
protection, and royal safeguard” and “that during the said time, no one 
shall harm them, nor injure them, no wrong shall be done to them against 
justice.” Although the King’s promises sound respectful of the Jews’ 
rights to safety, the very act of expulsion marked them as inferior 
and exposed them to relentless harms.  
The statements below are from an account written by an Italian Jew in 
15 Internet Jewish History Source Book. For each statement,  deter -
mine whether it could best be used to support, modify, or refute the claim

1. “ When the edict of expulsion became known. . .  vessels came 
from Genoa to the Spanish harbors to carry away the Jews. The 
crews of these vessels. . . acted maliciously and meanly toward 
the Jews, robbed them, and delivered some of them to the famous 
pirate of that time who was called the Corsair of Genoa. To those 
who escaped and arrived at Genoa the people of the city showed 
themselves merciless, and oppressed and robbed them, and the 
cruelty of their wicked hearts went so far that they took the i nfants

Essential Question:   How did economic developments from 1450 to 1750 
affect social structures  over time?
By 150, most of the world was integrated within a system of economic, 
political, and cultural connections. Better technology enabled the Eastern and 
Western hemispheres to connect. Meanwhile, Western European maritime 
powers created trading empires in the Indian Ocean trading network and in the 
Americas. Religions and other cultural practices continued to spread as a result 
of these interactions, but they also were transformed as new or syncretic forms 
developed. Coercive labor systems continued to exist in this newly connected 
world. However, new forms developed as new economic systems sought to 
exploit natural resources and to generate wealth for Western European nations.
Transoceanic Travel and Trade
The most significant change to the global economy in this period was the 
integration of the Western Hemisphere into the global trading network. This 
change resulted from Western European states wanting to find a sea route to 
Asia. They borrowed and developed technology that made ocean travel easier:
• astronomical charts
• astrolabe
• compass
• magnetic compass
• lateen sail 
• carrack
• caravel
• fluyt
262 WORLD H ISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe result was the Columbian Exchange: a biological exchange of crops, 
animals, people, and diseases between the Eastern and Western Hemisphere. 
The Columbian Exchange had wide-ranging effects on both hemispheres.
The Atlantic System  The Columbian Exchange also caused the 
development of a transoceanic trading network called the Atlantic System. 
The Atlantic System was made up of the regions of Western Europe, Western 
Africa, and the Americas and involved the movement of goods and people 
among those regions. Columbian Exchange forever changed who grew what 
foods where and how they grew them. It also unleashed deadly diseases 
on populations that had no immunity to them. In addition, it led to massive 
migrations, many of them forced, and new social structures.
As people migrated or were forced to migrate within the Atlantic System, 
cultural changes occurred. For instance, religion spread and often created 
syncretic belief systems and practices.

Economic Changes
European transoceanic voyages resulted in the integration of the Western 
Hemisphere within the global trading network. This integration had profound 
effects on the global economy. Maritime trading empires emerged, led by the 
Portuguese and followed by the Dutch and the English. As a result, Europeans 
established trading ports and cities along the coasts of Africa and the Indian 
Ocean. This brought Europeans into contact²and often into conflict²with 
existing merchant networks. 
One consequence of this contact and conflict was that Europeans came to 
dominate global trade at the expense of Arab, Indian, and Chinese merchants.

deposits of silver in Spain’s colonies helped further integrate Europeans into 
the global economy. Asian markets and merchants, especially in China, desired 
silver. Shipments of silver to Asia from the Americas became a regular feature 
of the global trade network and helped finance the increasing volume of trade 
between Asia and Europe. Some experts estimate that the amount of silver in 
the global economy tripled in the 16th century.
Mercantilism and Capitalism  European rulers soon came to see the 
benefits of encouraging the expansion of trade, as the wealth that could be 
amassed was considerable. To ensure they participated in wealth accumulation 
from trade, many European monarchs devised mercantilist economic policies 
that would provide the ruler with a steady stream of income. While expanded 
international trade continued to be an important goal of European monarchs, 
mercantilism eventually gave way to capitalism as the predominant economic 
system in the new global economy. Investors formed joint-stock companies, 
also called chartered companies, so they could share the risks and rewards of 
global trading opportunities.

The new global flow of goods and profits produced some significant benefits. 
The flow of wealth into Europe helped to expand the middle class and provided 
the capital that would lead to the Industrial Revolution. However, the huge 
amounts of gold and silver flowing into Spain and China from the Americas 
also produced negative economic effects. In particular, the increase in the 
quantity of money in circulation caused inflation.

Europe, Africa, and Asia continued to prosper. Funding for the arts increased 
as merchants and governments used their rising profits and revenue to sponsor 
artists and authors. Some rulers used their sponsorship of the arts to produce 
art and architecture that helped to legitimize their rule. Other art symbolized 
the growing importance of global trade.

The new global economy also brought about significant disruptions. The 
Columbian Exchange and the Atlantic System caused a demographic 
shift in Africa as the Atlantic slave trade intensified. Slavers captured and 
sold millions of African men. These African men ended up on American 
plantations, producing cash crops that included sugar, cotton, and tobacco. 
As a result, some African communities experienced a gender imbalance. 
Africa’s population declined because of the Atlantic slave trade. Eventually, 
the population increased as people grew new crops, such as manioc.
Traditional forced labor systems, such as serfdom, continued in areas 
of Afro-Eurasia. However, other coerced labor systems developed in the 
Americas as a result of the Columbian Exchange and the Atlantic System, 
in addition to the chattel slavery of the Atlantic slave trade. Many European 
settlers first arrived in the Americas as indentured servants, contracted to work 
for a period of time before they were free to pursue other jobs or occupations. 
The encomienda and hacienda systems, as well as the adoption of the Inca 
mit’a system, are examples of other coerced labor systems in the Spanish 
American colonies. 
New Social Structures  As Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans 
coexisted in the new American colonies, the social structures of the Americas 
changed. New social systems appeared that were based on racial or ethnic 
identity. This division led to a rigid and hierarchial society, with white 
Europeans or Americans of European descent possessing the majority of wealth 
and political power. A new subculture appeared that consisted of people who 
were of mixed European and African heritage. Societal conflicts eventually led 
to revolutions.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   HOW HARSH WERE THE SPANIS H?
After the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, Spanish conquistadors 
created a vast colonial empire in the Americas. In 1552, the Dominican friar 
Bartolomp de Las Casas described the greed, ruthlessness, and cruelty that 
Spanish officials inflicted on native populations. Ever since, historians have 
debated the accuracy of his observations. 
Origins of the Black Legend  Writing in 11, Spanish historian 
Juliin Judertas labeled this belief in the evils of Spanish rule as the Black 
Legend. He argued that during the 16th and 1th centuries, other Europeans 
were jealous of Spanish wealth and power. As a result, they were prepared 
to believe the worst about Spain’s rule. Judertas suggested that historians 
focused so much on cruelty that they ignored the positive achievements of 
Spanish colonialism. 
Debating the Black Legend  Besides jealousy, another factor affecting 
how historians viewed Spain was religion. During the centuries of struggle 
between Protestants and Catholics, the Black Legend fit with the negative 
views many Protestants had toward Catholics. In the United States, where 
Protestants dominated the writing of history in the 1th century, acceptance 
of the Black Legend was common. 
In the first half of the 20th century, many Spanish historians shared the 
perspective of Judertas. Their works reflected the intense national pride that 
many Spaniards felt about their past. In defending Spanish colonization, 
they developed what their critics called a White Legend to counter the Black 
Legend. 
Emphasis on Reform  One American historian active in the debate over 
Spanish colonization was Lewis Hanke. He argued against the Black Legend 
by trying to show that Las Casas was just one of many Spanish reformers. 
Through the efforts of these reformers, Hanke argued, the Spanish empire 
was “one of the greatest attempts the world has seen to make Christian 
precepts >rules@ prevail in the relations between peoples.” 
Defenders of the Black Legend thought Hanke had exaggerated the 
strength of Las Casas and the reformers, thereby making the Spanish look 
better than they were. Others emphasized that despite any attempts at reform, 
what actually happened was extraordinarily harsh.
The Global Context  In recent years, historians taking a more global 
approach to history have compared colonial empires more systematically than 
did previous historians. While they have noted differences among Europeans 
in the Americas, they have found widespread examples of brutality. Whether 
the Spanish were any worse than other Europeans remains hard to determine.

After analyzing the task and developing questions you need to answer 
to complete it see page 18, the next step in writing a long essay 
is to gather and organize your evidence. Gathering evidence  relies 
on recall²how much you remember from your reading and other 
studies. Organizing evidence  requires the skills of seeing patterns and 
connections and using historical reasoning. 
Suppose you are answering this long essay question: “Develop an 
argument that evaluates the extent to which continuity or change over 
time characterized the participation of China in the expanding global 
trade networks from 150 to 150.” Gather the evidence by writing down 
everything you know about China’s role in global trade networks between 
150 and 150. Answer the questions you developed in the application 
activity on page 18. Your essay might include the following: 
• Emperor .angxi relaxed the limits on foreigners, opening 
Chinese ports to European merchants and missionaries.
• China exported silk, porcelain, spice, and tea and imported little.
• Confucian philosophy preferred farmers who produced food 
over merchants who transferred food from one person to 
another.
• Confucian philosophers respected the Jesuits.
• China regarded its culture as superior to those of other countries.
• With the Silk Roads and Indian Ocean trade networks pouring 
gold and silver into China for their goods, the Chinese felt 
wealthy and in no need of foreign commodities.
After writing everything you can remember, organize your evidence. 
Review your notes, looking for patterns related to the task. Which pieces 
of evidence represent a continuity" Which represent a change" Make a 
simple chart to place the evidence in the correct category. Then evaluate 
the extent to which change outweighed continuity or vice versa.

1. Farmers of all provinces are strictly forbidden to have in their possession 
any swords, short swords, spears, firearms, or other types of weapons. 
If unnecessary implements of war are kept, the collection of annual rent 
nengu may become more difficult, and without provocation >prompting@

against samurai who receive a grant of land kyu Ø nin must be brought to 
trial and punished. However, in that event, their wet and dry fields will 
remain unattended, and the samurai will lose their rights chigyo Ø  to the 
yields from the fields. Therefore, the heads of the provinces, samurai who 
receive a grant of land, and deputies must collect all the weapons described 
above and submit them to Hideyoshi’s government.
2. The swords and short swords collected in the above manner will not be 
wasted. They will be used as nails and bolts in the construction of the Great 
Image of Buddha. In this way the farmers will benefit not only in this life 
but also in the lives to come.
. If farmers possess only agriculture implements and devote themselves 
exclusively to cultivating the fields, they and their descendants will prosper. 
This compassionate concern for the well-being of the farms is the reason for

c. 1750 to c. 1900
Understand the Context
Between 1750 and 1900, people continued becoming more integrated into a 
global trade network. New technology, from machinery for spinning thread 
to locomotives to telegraphs to steel mills, fostered closer integration. The 
increased use of machinery in producing goods, a shift known as the Industrial 
Revolution, caused manufacturing output to skyrocket. It began in Great 
Britain and affected all of the world by 2000. The Industrial Revolution set the 
stage for dramatic changes in international relations, politics, and demography.
Foreign Power  As global trade increased, industrializing countries 
protected the access of their businesses to resources for manufacturing and 
to markets for selling goods by establishing control over overseas lands. 
However, these lands often rebelled against foreign domination. Among the 
first to rebel were the United States and Haiti in the 18th century .
A New Type of Country  Industrialization provided the background for 
reorganizing states. Before the 1800s, most people lived in large multi-ethnic 
empires or small homogenous kingdoms. After 1800, people increasingly 
lived in nation-states, a country in which everyone shared the same culture, 
and everyone who shared a culture lived in the same country. Breaking up 
empires and combining kingdoms to create nation-states frequently led to war.
Movements of People  Industrialization was also the context for massive 
human migrations. As demand for labor shifted, millions moved in search of 
work. For example, many Europeans voluntarily resettled in the Americas 
and Australia. South Asians were coerced into taking jobs in southern Africa. 
Millions of Africans were enslaved and taken forcibly to the Americas. These 
movements diversified communities across the world.

THE ENLIG HTENMENT 275
2755.1
The Enlightenment
Except our own thoughts, there is nothing absolutely in our power.
—René Descartes (1596 -1650)
Essential Question:   How did the Enlightenment shape the intellectual and 
ideological thinRing that affected reform and revolution 
after 1750?
As empires expanded and trade routes led to more interactions, intellectuals 
in the 1th and 18th centuries such as Descartes began to emphasize reason 
over tradition and individualism over community values. These shifts were 
called the Enlightenment.  The ideals of this movement, such as individualism, 
freedom, and self-determination, challenged the roles of monarchs and church 
leaders and planted the seeds of revolution in the United States, France, and 
around the world.
An Age of New Ideas
Growing out of the Scientific Revolution and the humanism of the Renaissance, 
Enlightenment thought was optimistic. Many writers believed that applying 
reason to natural laws would result in progress. While not denying the existence 
of God, they emphasized human accomplishments in understanding the natural 
world. Such beliefs led to the conclusion that natural laws governed the social 
and political spheres as well. While traditional religion did not disappear, it 
became less pervasive.
New ideas emerged about how to improve society. Schools of thought 
including socialism  and liberalism  arose, giving rise to the period being called 
“the Age of Isms.” Opposing socialism and liberalism were the currents of 
conservatism , particularly popular among the European ruling class.  (All of 
these “isms” are defined later in this topic.
The clash between new ideas and old political structures led to revolutions 
that often had two aims: independence from imperial powers and constitutional 
representation. The breakup of empires and the emergence of new forms of 
government often followed. These developed out of the concept of nationalism , 
a feeling of intense loyalty to others who share one’s language and culture. The 
idea that people who share a culture should also live in an independent nation-
state threatened to destroy all of Europe’s multiethnic empires.
276 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONNew Ideas and Their Roots
In the 17th century, Francis Bacon  emphasized empirical methods of scientific 
inquiry. Empiricism  is the belief that knowledge comes from sensed  
experience, from what you observe through your experience, including through 
experiments. Rather than relying on reasoning about principles provided by 
tradition or religion, Bacon based his conclusions on his observation of natural 
data.
Hobbes and Locke  In the same century, philosophers Thomas Hobbes 
(author of Leviathan , 1651 and John Locke (author of Two Treatises of 
Government, 160  viewed political life as the result of a social contract . 
Hobbes argued that people’s natural state was to live in a bleak world in which 
life was “nasty, brutish, and short.” However, by agreeing to a social contract, 
they gave up some rights to a strong central government in return for law and 
order. 
Locke, on the other hand, argued that the social contract implied the right, 
even the responsibility, of citizens to revolt against unjust government. Locke 
thought that people had natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of property. 
Another of Locke’s influential ideas is found in  An Essay Concerning Human 
Understanding 160, in which he proposed that a child was born with a 
mind like a “blank slate” ( tabula rasa  waiting to be filled with knowledge. 
In a world in which most people believed that an individual’s intelligence, 
personality, and fate were heavily determined by their ancestry, Locke’s 
emphasis on environment and education in shaping people was radical.
The Philosophes  In the 18th century, a new group of thinkers and writers 
who came to be called the philosophes  explored social, political, and economic 
theories in new ways. In doing so, they popularized concepts that they felt 
followed rationally upon those of the scientific thinkers of the 1th century. 
Taking their name from the French word  philosophe “philosopher” , these 
writers included Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin  Franklin from America, 
Adam Smith from Scotland, and several French thinkers
Of particular importance to writers of the new constitutions in France and 
America in the 18th and 1th centuries were the ideas of Baron Montesquieu . 
His famous work The Spirit of Laws 18 praised the British government’s 
use of checks on power because it had a Parliament. Montesquieu thus 
influenced the American system, which adopted his ideas by separating its 
executive branch the president from its legislative branch Congress and 
both from its third branch the federal judiciary. 
Francois-Marie Arouet, pen name Voltaire , is perhaps best known for his 
social satire Candide  162. He was famous during his lifetime for his wit and 
for his advocacy of civil liberties. Exiled for three years due to a conflict with 
a member of the French aristocracy, V oltaire lived in England long enough 
to develop an appreciation for its constitutional monarchy and a regard for 
civil rights. He brought these ideas back to France, where he campaigned for 
277 THE ENLIG HTENMENTreligious liberty and judicial reform. His correspondence with heads of state 
such as Catherine the Great of Russia and Frederick the Great of Prussia and 
his extensive writings, including articles in Diderot’s Encyclopedia,  are still 
quoted today. His idea of religious liberty influenced the U.S. Constitution.
A contemporary of V oltaire was the writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau , who 
expanded on the idea of the social contract as it had passed down through the 
work of Hobbes and Locke. One of Rousseau’s early works was Emile, or On 
Education  162 in which he laid out his ideas on child-rearing and education. 
A later work, The Social Contract  162, presented the concept of the General 
Will of a population and the obligation of a sovereign to carry out that General 
Will. An optimist who believed that society could improve, Rousseau inspired 
many revolutionaries of the late 18th century.
Adam Smith  One of the most influential thinkers of the Enlightenment 
was Adam Smith . In his book The Wealth of Nations 16, Smith responded 
to mercantilism by calling for freer trade. While Smith did support some 
government regulations and saw the benefits of taxes, he generally advocated 
for laissez-faire, a 
French phrase for “leave 
alone.” This approach 
meant that governments 
should reduce their 
intervention in economic 
decisions. Smith believed 
that if businesses and 
consumers were allowed 
to make choices in 
their own interests, the 
“invisible hand” of the 
market would guide them 
to make choices beneficial 
for society. His ideas 
provided a foundation for 
capitalism,  an economic 
system in which the 
means of production,

Deism  The Enlightenment’s emphasis on reason led some thinkers 
to reexamine the relationship of humans to God. Some adopted Deism , the 
belief that a divinity simply set natural laws in motion. Deists compared the 
divinity to a watchmaker who makes a watch but does not interfere in its day-
to-day workings. Deists believed these laws could be best understood through

ideas, many Deists viewed regular church attendance as an important social 
obligation and a way people received moral guidance.

The Age of New Ideas Continues
In Europe and America, Enlightenment thinkers reacted to the social ills 
caused by increasing urbanization and industrialization. Poverty in the cities 
increased. Poor workers lived in slums without proper sanitation and without 
political representation. Various writers proposed solutions to the observable 
problems. Some wanted more government regulations and programs, and 
many Christians called for greater private charity. But some conservatives 
blamed the poor themselves and called on them to change. Conservatism is a 
belief in traditional institutions, favoring reliance on practical experience over 
ideological theories, such as that of human perfectability.
Utopian Socialism  The economic and political theory of socialism  refers 
to a system of public or direct worker ownership of the means of production 
such as the mills to make cloth or the machinery and land needed to mine 
coal. Various branches of socialism developed in the 19th century, providing 
alternative visions of the social and economic future. Those who felt that society 
could be channeled in positive directions by setting up ideal communities were 
often called utopian socialists :
279 THE ENLIG HTENMENT• Henri de Saint-Simon,  of France, believed that scientists and 
engineers, working together with businesses, could operate clean, 
efficient, beautiful places to work that produced things useful to 
society. He also advocated for public works that would provide 
employment. He proposed building the Suez Canal in Egypt, a project 
that the French government later undertook and which opened in 186.
• Charles Fourier  identified some 810 passions that, when encouraged, 
would make work more enjoyable and workers less tired. Like other 
utopian socialists, Fourier believed that a fundamental principle of 
utopia was harmonious living in communities rather than the class 
struggle that was basic to the thinking of Karl Marx.
• Robert Owen  was born in Great Britain. He established intentional 
communities—small societies governed by the principles of utopian 
socialism²in New Lanark, Scotland, and New Harmony, Indiana. He 
believed in education for children who worked, communal ownership 
of property, and community rules to govern work, education, and 
leisure time.
In the later 19th century, socialist groups such as the Fabian Society 
formed in England. The Fabians were gradual socialists: they favored 
reforming society by parliamentary means. Writers H. G. Wells, Virginia 
Woolf, and George Bernard Shaw were prominent Fabians.  By the mid-20th 
century, socialist principles would influence most of Western Europe. 
Classical Liberalism  Others advocated classical liberalism , a belief 
in natural rights, constitutional government, laissez-faire economics, and 
reduced spending on armies and established churches.  Most classical liberals 
were professionals, writers, or academics. In Britain they pursued changes in 
Parliament to reflect changing population patterns so that new industrial cities 
would have equal parliamentary representation. Classical liberals backed the 
Reform Bills of 182, 186, and 188, all of which broadened male suf frage. 
Feminism  This period saw the emergence of the movement for women’s 
rights and equality based on Enlightenment ideas. The French writer Olympe 
de Gouges fought for these rights in the era of the French Revolution. In 
18, France had adopted the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the 
Male Citizen,” a pioneering document in the history of human rights. In 
1791, de Gouges published a “Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the 
Female Citizen,” to point out that women’s rights had not been addressed. 
In 1792 in England, the pioneering writer Mary Wollstonecraft  published 
A Vindication of the Rights of Women. In it, she argued that females should 
receive the same education as males. Universal education, she argued, would 
prepare women to participate in political and professional society, enabling 
them to support themselves rather than relying on men. Wollstonecraft’s 
ultimate goal was for women to gain the same rights and abilities as men 
through the application of reason. Women won the full right to vote in 128.
280 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn 188 in Seneca Falls, New York, activists gathered to promote women’s 
rights and suffrage the ability to vote. In the convention’s “Declaration of 
Sentiments,” organizers Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton declared, 
“All men and women are created equal.” They demanded women deserved the 
right to vote and hold office, hold property and manage their own incomes, and 
be the legal guardians of their children. The Seneca Falls Convention was a 
landmark in the history of the women’s rights movement.
Abolitionism  Reform movements to provide rights and equality extended 
to freedom for enslaved people and the end of serfdom. Abolitionism , the 
movement to end the Atlantic slave trade and free all enslaved people, gained 
followers in the 18th century. Slave trading was banned earlier than slavery 
itself. The first states to ban the slave trade were with Denmark in 180, 
Great Britain in 180, and the United States in 1808. In most countries, the 
slave system depended on a steady supply of new enslaved people in order 
to function. As a result, as soon as the slave trade stopped, slavery began to 
decline. In most parts of the Americas, slavery was abolished within 0 years 
of the end of the slave trade. The United States was the rare country where 
numbers increased after the importation of enslaved people ended. The last 
country in the Americas to end slavery was Brazil, in 1888. 
The End of Serfdom  Serfdom in Europe had been declining as the 
economy changed from agrarian to industrial. Peasant revolts pushed leaders 
toward reform. Queen Elizabeth I abolished serfdom in 1574. The French 
government abolished all feudal rights of the nobility in 18. Alexander II

281 THE ENLIG HTENMENTof Russia abolished serfdom in 1861. The Russian emancipation of 2 million 
serfs was the largest single emancipation of people in bondage in human 
history. 
Zionism  Yet another “ism” in the late 1th century was the emergence of 
Zionism —the desire of Jews to reestablish an independent homeland where 
their ancestors had lived in the Middle East. After centuries of battling anti-
Semitism , hostility toward Jews, and pogroms—violent attacks against Jewish 
communities—many European Jews had concluded that living in peace and 
security was not a realistic hope. To be safe, Jews needed to control their own 
land. Leading the movement was an Austro-Hungarian Jew,  Theodor Herzl . 
Support for =ionism increased after a scandal in France known as the 
Dreyfus Affair . In 18, Alfred Dreyfus, a military officer who was Jewish, 
was convicted of treason against the French government. However, the 
conviction had been based on forged documents by people promoting anti-
Semitism. Dreyfus was ultimately pardoned after time in prison, but the case 
illustrated how widespread anti-Semitism was in France, one of the countries 
where Jews seemed least oppressed. 
=ionists faced many obstacles. The land they wanted was controlled by 
the Ottoman Empire, and Palestinian Arabs were already living in the region. 
Both the Ottomans and the Palestinians were predominantly Muslim, which 
added a religious aspect to the conflict. However, the =ionist movement grew 
in strength until 18, when the modern country of Israel was founded.

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:  DESCRI BE AN ARGUMENT 
The Enlightenment was a time of lively debate and argument centered 
on the human capacity to reason—a key aspect of argument itself. 
Arguments can use reason in a variety of ways. For example, deductive 
reasoning, sometimes called “top-down reasoning,” builds an argument 
from a general proposition All men are mortal to a more specific 
premise Socrates is a man and finally to a conclusion that must be true 
if the other premises are true Therefore, Socrates is mortal. Inductive, 
or “bottom up” reasoning, in contrast, uses specific facts to form an 
uncertain generalization (Chicago has never received snow on any day in 
August, so it’s likely that no future August day will see snow. Arguments 
284 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONcan also use reasoning by analogy, a form of inductive reasoning, to 
assert that two things known to be alike in some ways are likely similar 
in other unknown ways (Human mammals experience a wide range of 
emotions, so it is likely nonhuman mammals experience a similar range. 
Most arguments use several different kinds of reasoning to develop their 
ideas fully. Knowing how to describe the structure of an argument and the 
types of reasoning can help you evaluate the strength of its conclusions.

“Let us bring up women, not to aspire to advantages which the Constitution

education suits them. . . . The paternal home is better for the education of 
women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, 
than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.” —Talleyrand  
“Contending for the rights of women, my main argument is built on this 
simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become 
the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge . . . . If 
children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, 
their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an 
orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering 
the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation 
of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations. . . .>I@ 
earnestly wish to see woman placed in a station in which she would 
advance, instead of retarding, the progress of those glorious principles 
that give a substance to morality. My opinion, indeed, respecting the 
rights and duties of woman, seems to flow so naturally from these 
simple principles, that I think it scarcely possible, but that some of the 
enlarged minds who formed your admirable constitution, will coincide 
with me.” ²Mary Wollstonecraft 12
REFLECT ON THE TOPIC ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. In one to three paragraphs, explain how the Enlightenment shaped the 
ideological and intellectual thinking that affected reform and revolution 
in the period after 1750.
NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONS 285
5.2
Nationalism and Revolutions
Every nation gets the government it deserves.
—1oseph de 4aistre (1753-1821)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the various 
revolutions in the period from 1750 to 1900, including 
influences of the Enlightenment and emerging 
nationalism?
The age of new ideas led to political and philosophical conflicts. Like the 
English statesman Edmund Burke, the French thinker Joseph de Maistre was 
a conservative who went against the tide of Enlightenment thinking. In the 
view of conservative thinkers such as Burke and Maistre, revolutions were 
bloody, disruptive, and unlikely to yield positive results. However, try as 
conservatives might to quell revolutionary change, the desire of common 
people for constitutional government and democratic practices erupted in 
revolutions throughout the 19th century. And many nations did, indeed, get a 
new form of government that responded to the new wave of thinking with its 
key ideals: progress, reason, and natural law.
The American Revolution
The ideals that inspired the American Revolution had their roots in European 
Enlightenment philosophy. The economic ideas of the physiocrats also played 
a part in the American Revolution, providing a defense of free market ideas 
in opposition to English mercantilism. Additionally, the American colonists 
had become increasingly independent politically. Colonial legislatures were 
making decisions usually made by Parliament. Moreover, great distances 
separated the colonists from Parliament and the king in London. With economic 
and political desires for independence grew a new social spirit. 
Declaration of Independence  On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of 
Independence expressed the philosophy behind the colonists’ fight against 
British rule. In the document, Thomas Jefferson picked up the phrase 
“unalienable rights” from John Locke. For Jefferson, these rights were to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In the war that followed, the colonists 
triumphed in 18 with crucial help from Britain’s long-time enemy, France.
286 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe New Zealand Wars
New =ealand had been occupied by Polynesian people, the Maori, since at least 
the mid-1200s. In the period between their arrival and the arrival of Europeans 
the Maori developed a rich culture. The people were divided into individual 
tribes, or iwi, who sometimes engaged in warfare. After colonization by the 
British, made official by annexation of New =ealand in 180, English control 
over Maori affairs increased, as did pressure for their land. These issues resulted 
in a series of wars between the Maori and British collectively known as the 
New =ealand Wars. Though the Maori tribes fought together, developing a 
sense of Maori nationalism, by 182, the British had won. 
The French Revolution
In France in the 180s, revolutionary ideals took on their own spin, summarized 
in the slogan liberté, égalité, et fraternité liberty, equality, and fraternity. 
These ideas, which struck many people as radical, were popularized throughout 
Europe in the writings of the philosophes . 
Economic Woes  However, additional causes led to the French Revolution. 
France had long spent more than it was taking in, partly to finance a series of 
wars. Among this spending was the economic aid that France supplied the 
Americans in their revolution. To address its financial situation, the French 
government called a meeting of the Estates-General in spring 18. Three 
sectors of society, or estates, made up the Estates-General: the clergy religious 
officials, the nobility, and the commoners. However, inequality in voting 
caused the commoners who made up  percent of French society to break 
away and form a new body, the National Assembly. 
The Revolution Begins  In the early days of the French Revolution, 
moderates such as Marquis de Lafayette seemed to be on the point of establishing 
a constitutional monarchy. The National Assembly began meeting in Paris, but 
then the King threatened to arrest the leaders. Angry crowds rioted in Paris and 
elsewhere in France. On July 1, 18, a crowd in Paris stormed the Bastille , 
a former prison that symbolized the abuses of the monarchy and the corrupt 
aristocracy. In the French countryside, peasants rose up against nobles, even 
burning some manor houses. Some royal officials fled France. The king was 
forced to accept a new government with a National Assembly in charge.
The date July 1, 18, became French Independence Day. The most 
permanent changes were enacted early in the Revolution—the abolition 
of feudalism and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man , a 
statement declaring basic human rights. Louis XVI and the nobility refused 
to accept the limited monarchy, which led to dissatisfaction among radical 
groups such as the Jacobins and inspired the establishment of the First French 
Republic in 1792. The Reign of Terror , a period during which the government 
executed thousands of opponents of the revolution, including the king and 
queen, sprang from the Jacobins. After a period of turmoil and war, the brilliant 
general Napoleon Bonaparte became emperor of France in 180.
287 NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONS 287The Haitian Revolution 
At the end of the 18th century, revolutionary forces were also at work in the 
rich French sugar and coffee colony of Haiti  on the western third of the island 
of St. Domingue, also known as Hispaniola. Enslaved Africans began the 
rebellion by killing their masters and burning their homes. They were soon 
joined by Maroons,  individuals who had already escaped slavery in Haiti. 
The examples of the recent American and French revolutions led formerly 
enslaved Toussaint L’Ouverture  to join the revolts in 11 and then to lead 
a general rebellion against slavery. Besides being well-read in Enlightenment 
thought, L’Ouverture proved to be a capable general. His army of enslaved 
Africans and Maroons established an independent government and played the 
French, Spanish, and British against each other. 
Haiti  In 1801, after taking control of the territory that would become the 
independent country of Haiti, L’Ouverture produced a constitution that granted 
equality and citizenship to all residents. He also declared himself governor 
for life. Haiti next enacted land reform: plantations were divided up, with the 
lands being distributed among formerly enslaved and free black people.
L’Ouverture worked with the French but they betrayed and imprisoned 
him. He died in France in 180. But he had cemented the abolition of slavery 
in Haiti, which he set on the road to independence from France.
In 180, L’Ouverture’s successor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, orchestrated 
a Haitian declaration of permanent independence. Thus, Haiti became the 
first country in Latin America to 
win its independence and the first 
black-led country in the Western 
Hemisphere. It was also the only 
country to become permanently 
independent as a result of a slave 
uprising.
Comparing the Haitian and 
French Revolutions  Both the 
Haitian and French revolutions 
grew out of the Enlightenment’s 
insistence that men had natural 
rights as citizens, and that legal 
restraints were limiting the 
freedom of people by forcing 
them into various estates (social 
classes. However, in the case of 
the Haitians, the restraints were 
more severe—the rebellion was 
led by people who had no rights 
at all.

288 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONCreole Revolutions in Latin America
On the Latin American mainland, revolutionary ideals were taken up by 
creoles . Born of European ancestry in the Americas, the creoles were well 
educated and aware of the ideas behind the revolutions in North America and 
France. They considered themselves superior to the mestizos , who were born 
of European and Indian parents. Colonists who were born in Spain or Portugal, 
known as peninsulares , felt superior to everyone. At the bottom of the social 
ladder were the enslaved Africans the indigenous population, and mulattoes , 
those of African and either European or indigenous ancestry. Some of these 
social distinctions remain today.
There were many reasons for discontent in the colonies, each of which 
encouraged some people to desire independence from Spain:
• Many creoles were wealthy owners of estates, mines, or businesses. 
They opposed Spain’s mercantilism, which required colonists to buy 
manufactured goods only from Spain and sell products only to Spain. 
• Creoles wanted more political power. They resented that Spain tended 
to give important government jobs in the colonies to peninsulares. 
• Mestizos wanted political power and a share of the wealth of the 
colonies. Many had jobs in the towns or worked in the mines or on the 
estates of the peninsulares and creoles.
The Bolívar Revolutions  In many parts of South America, the desire for 
independence from Spain grew among the creole class. Fearing the masses, 
the creoles refused the support of mestizos, indigenous people, and mulattos 
people of mixed African and European heritage. The creoles had seen 
the result in Haiti of a slave uprising as well as the excesses of the French 
Revolution during the Reign of Terror. Some creoles, such as Simón Bolívar , 
continued to push for Enlightenment ideals in Latin America. He promoted 
independence of areas that became Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. 
Boltvar was born in 9enezuela in 18 to a family whose ancestors had 
been village aristocrats in Spain. The family had grown very wealthy in 
Venezuela, and Bolívar had access to this wealth for his revolutionary causes. 
After considerable military success in Latin America fighting the Spanish, his 
forces achieved the formation of a large area that he called Gran Colombia. 
He hoped it would become a federation similar to the United States, one based 
on Enlightenment ideals. He described himself as a liberal who believed in a 
free market and the abolition of slavery. Bolívar’s goals and concerns for Latin 
America are outlined in his “Jamaica Letter” 1815: “Generous souls always 
interest themselves in the fate of a people who strive to recover the rights to 
which the Creator and Nature have entitled them, and one must be wedded to 
error and passion not to harbor this noble sentiment.”
The new nations of Latin America suffered from the long wars of 
independence. Armies loyal to their generals led to the rise of the caudillos—
strong, local leaders with regional power bases. These men intervened in 
289 NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONSnational politics to make or break governments. Sometimes the caudillos 
defended the interests of the regional elites and sometimes of the indigenous 
population and the peasants, but in general they disregarded representative 
forms of government and the rule of law.
Results of the Creole Revolutions  Although the constitutions of the 
newly independent countries in Latin America legally ended slavery and 
some social distinctions, governments were often conservative.  The first 
constitution of Peru, for example, forbade voting by those who could not read 
or write in Spanish, which effectively denied most indigenous people the vote 
until the constitution was changed in 1860.  The creoles formed powerful and 
conservative upper class, as they had before the wars of colonial independence. 
Women gained little from the revolutions in Latin America. They were still 
unable to vote or enter into contracts. Most women received little education 
until late in the nineteenth century, and most remained submissive to men. 
One notable exception was Manuela Sienz 1±1856, who was the lover 
of Simyn Boltvar. She actively participated in fighting alongside Boltvar, for 
example, in 1822 in a battle near Quito, Ecuador. An excellent rider as well 
as courageous fighter, she rose to the rank of colonel. On one occasion, she 
saved Bolívar’s life, for which she received the nickname “Liberator of the 
Liberator.” (Connect: In a brief paragraph or outline, trace the connections 
between creole elites and revolutions in Latin America. See Topic .5 
Later Challenges to Spanish Colonialism  Spain’s grip on parts of its 
empire lasted throughout the 19th century. In the Caribbean, Puerto Rico 
and Cuba were among its final colonial holdings. Both islands saw uprisings 
against Spanish rule beginning in the year 1868. 
While many individuals and organizations contributed to the spirit of 
revolution in Puerto Rico, the role of Lola Rodríguez de Tió  was unique. 
A recognized poet during an era of little educational opportunity for women, 
Rodrtguez de Tiy became famous for her eloquent critiques of Spain’s 
exploitive rule over Puerto Rico. Her home became a meeting place for 
political thinkers and revolutionaries. At such meetings, she began to read 
lyrics to a revolutionary song, “La Boriquexa,” which encouraged her fellow 
Puerto Ricans, “Awake from your sleep, for it’s time to fight” 
The 1868 uprising forced Rodrtguez de Tiy into exile in 9enezuela. She 
was allowed to return in 1885, but her critical writings again ended in exile²
this time in Cuba. Once there, she wrote and worked for Cuban independence, 
earning her exile from there, too, to New York. She returned to Cuba in 18 
and spent her remaining years as a campaigner for social justice there.
Revolt in the Philippines
The Philippines, too, remained a Spanish colony throughout the 1th century. 
Educational opportunities, even for well-to-do Filipinos, were limited and 
controlled by religious authorities. As a result, many young men (often creoles 
and mestizos from wealthy families traveled to Europe, especially Madrid 
290 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONand Barcelona, to attend universities. An atmosphere of nationalist fervor and 
republicanism, inspired by Enlightenment thinking, existed in 1880s Europe, 
and these Filipino students embraced it. 
José Rizal became the most prominent of these young agitators, all of 
whom contributed to magazines, pamphlets, and other publications advocating 
for greater autonomy for the Philippines. Called the Propaganda Movement , 
it did not call for revolution or independence. But Spanish authorities viewed 
its members with suspicion. Rizal’s arrest in 182 and execution in 186 
shocked Filipinos and helped spur the first nationalist movement with the 
organization and strength to truly challenge Spanish rule. A serious military 
upheaval, the Philippine Revolution, began in 186.

As nationalism spread beyond Europe, people often created an identity under 
one government where none had existed before. Nationalism increased in 
France and in other areas of Europe and in the Americas. More than in the past, 
people felt a common bond with others who spoke their language, shared their 
history, and followed their customs. Nationalism thrived in France and beyond 
its borders in areas conquered by Napoleon, particularly those in the Germanic 
areas of the declining Holy Roman Empire. Nationalism was a unifying force 
that not only threatened large empires, but it also drove efforts to unite people 
who shared a culture into one political state. 
,talian 8nification  Count di  Cavour, the prime minister of Piedmont-
Sardinia, led the drive to unite the entire Italian Peninsula  under the only 
native dynasty, the House of Savoy. At the time, the region was divided among 
a patchwork of kingdoms and city-states, and most people spoke regional 
languages rather than Italian. Cavour himself spoke French better than he spoke 
Italian. Like other classical liberals, he believed in natural rights, progress, and 
constitutional monarchy. But he also believed in the practical politics of reality, 
which came to be called realpolitik . Thus, he did not hesitate to advance the 
cause of Italian unity through manipulation. In 1858, he maneuvered Napoleon 
III of France into a war with Austria, hoping to weaken Austrian influence on 
the Italian Peninsula. Napoleon III backed out of the war after winning two 
important battles, partly because he feared the wrath of the Pope, who did not 
want his Papal States to be controlled by a central Italian government. 
Nevertheless, it was too late to stop the revolutionary fervor, and soon 
several areas voted by plebiscite, or popular referendum, to join Piedmont the 
.ingdom of Sardinia. To aid the unification effort, Cavour adopted the radical 
romantic revolutionary philosophy of Giuseppe Mazzini , who had been 
agitating for Italian resurgence ( Risorgimento  since early in the nineteenth 
century. Cavour also allied with the Red Shirts military force led by Giuseppe 
Garibaldi , which was fighting farther south in the .ingdom of Naples. 
*erPan 8nification  In Germany, nationalist movements had already 
strengthened as a result of opposition to French occupation of German states 
291 NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONSunder Napoleon Bonaparte. Following the Congress of Vienna, which settled 
the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, revolutions occurred in a number of European 
states, including Prussia and Austria. The revolutions of 188 were the result 
of both nationalism especially a desire for independence and liberalism  
a desire for representation under constitutions that recognized civil liberties.
Prussian leader Otto von Bismarck , who like Cavour favored realpolitik,  
used nationalist feelings to engineer three wars to bring about German 
unification. Bismarck manipulated Austria into participating in two wars, the 
first with Prussia against Denmark 186  and the second between Prussia 
and Austria Seven Weeks’ War of 1866. After winning both wars, Bismarck 
manipulated France into declaring war against Prussia. His armies beat the 
French soundly in the Franco-Prussian War 180. In each of these three wars, 
Prussia gained territory. In 181, Bismarck founded the new German Empire, 
made up of many territories gained from the wars, including Alsace-Lorraine, 
an area long part of France on the border between France and the new Germany.
Global Consequences  By 181, two new powers, Italy and Germany,  
were on the international stage in an environment of competing alliances. 
Balance of power would be achieved briefly through these alliances, but 
extreme nationalism would lead to World War I.
Unification did not solve all Italian troubles . Poverty in Italy, more in the 
south than in the north, led to considerable emigration in the late nineteenth 
century²particularly to the United States and to Argentina, where the 
constitution of 185 specifically encouraged immigration , the movement of 
people into the country from other countries.

292 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONBalkan Nationalism  The Ottoman Empire had been the dominant force in 
southeastern Europe for centuries. But for many reasons, the 17th century saw 
the beginning of its long, slow decline. A failed attempt to conquer 9ienna in 
168 signaled the beginning of successful efforts by Austria and Russia to roll 
back Ottoman dominance in the Balkans. It was largely due to the increasing 
involvement and contact with Western European ideas and powers that Balkan 
nationalism developed. 
In Greece, which by 1800 had been under Ottoman control for more than 50 
years, increased contact with Western ideas meant exposure to Enlightenment 
principles. It also meant exposure to the reverence with which Greece and 
its ancient culture were viewed across Europe. Together, these developments 
helped reawaken Greek cultural pride and stoke the fires of Greek nationalism. 
A protracted civil war against Ottoman forces brought some success. However, 
it took the intervention of a British, French, and Russian fleet, which destroyed 
an Ottoman fleet in 182, to help assure Greek independence. 
Events in other Balkan regions, such as Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania, 
followed a similar, but by no means identical, course. The waning of Ottoman 
control led to greater freedom and an influx of new ideas, including nationalism. 
People began to rally around important cultural markers, such as language, 
folk traditions, shared history, and religion. Later, outside powers, such as 
Russia or Austria, aided in achieving independence.

and Russian forces, the Greeks won their independence by 182. 
293 NATION ALISM AND REVOL UTIONSOttoman Nationalism  The 180s and 1880s saw the development in 
the Ottoman state of Ottomanism —a movement that aimed to create a more 
modern, unified state. Officials sought to do this by minimizing the ethnic, 
linguistic, and religious differences across the empire. Taking control of 
local schools and mandating a standard curriculum was a major part of this 
drive. But the effects of nationalism were not limited to Balkan territories 
and Ottoman officials. Ethnic and religious groups within the Ottoman 
Empire had nationalist urges of their own, and they viewed Ottomanism with 
suspicion. Ironically, this attempt to create a more unified state actually served 
to highlight and intensify subject people’s feelings of difference and promote 
their desire for independence.
The Future of Nationalism  While nationalism continues to shape how 
people view themselves and their political allegiances, some signs suggest 
that nationalism might be starting to decline. In Europe, many countries 
have agreed to use the same currency, to allow people to travel freely across 
borders, and to coordinate public policies. These changes might reflect a shift 
away from nationalism and toward a larger political grouping. Like city-states 
and empires, nations might someday give way to other forms of political 
organization.

—Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations  (177)
Essential Question:   What factors contributed to and characterized 
industrialization in the period from 1750 to 1900?
In addition to new ideas, new technologies were reshaping societies.  
These technologies led to a dramatic change in society and economies. 
This change was so dramatic that it is called the Industrial Revolution.  
The rigid structure of early factory work described by Adam Smith, 
Scottish economist and philosopher, is one of the most enduring images of 
the Industrial Revolution. Industrialization,  the increased mechanization 
of production, and the social changes that accompanied this shift, had their 
roots in several influences. Among these were the Columbian Exchange 
and rise of maritime trading empires, increased agricultural productivity, 
and greater individual accumulation of capital. As the Industrial Revolution 
spread from Great Britain to Europe and North America, and then to the 
world, it reshaped society, increasing world population, shifting people 
from farm to city, and expanding the production and consumption of goods.
Agricultural Improvements
Just before the Industrial Revolution, in the early 1700s, an agricultural 
revolution  resulted in increased productivity. Crop rotation  (rotating 
different crops in and out of a field each year and the seed drill  (a 
device that efficiently places seeds in a designated spot in the ground 
both increased food production. Also, the introduction of the potato from 
South America contributed more calories to people’s diets. As nations 
industrialized, their populations grew because more food was available to 
more people. And because of improved medical care, infant mortality rates 
declined and people lived longer. With these demographic changes, more 
people were available to work in factories and to provide a market for 
manufactured goods. 
298 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONPreindustrial Societies
During the early 18th century, most British families lived in rural areas, grew 
most of their food, and made most of their clothes. For centuries, wool and flax 
had been raised domestically, and people spun fabrics they needed. 
However, one result of the commercial revolution and the establishment 
of maritime empires see Topic .5 was that Indian cotton became available 
in Britain, and before long it was in high demand. Wool and flax could not be 
produced quickly enough or in a large enough quantity to compete with cotton 
imports. To compete with Indian cotton, investors in Britain began to build 
their nation’s own cotton cloth industry. Using imported raw cotton produced 
by slave labor in the Americas, the British developed the cottage industry  
system, also known as the putting-out system, in which merchants provided 
raw cotton to women who spun it into finished cloth in their own homes. 
Home spinning was hard work and pay was low, but cottage industries 
gave women weavers some independence. While working in their own 
homes, they were also close to children. But cottage industry production was 
slow. Investors demanded faster production, spurring the development of 
technologies and machinery that turned out cloth in more efficient ways. 
Growth of Technology
By the mid-eighteenth century, the spinning jenny  and the  water frame  
reduced the time needed to spin yarn and weave cloth. The spinning jenny, 
invented by James Hargreaves  in the 1760s, allowed a weaver to spin more 
than one thread at a time. The water frame, patented by Richard Arkwright  
in 1769, used waterpower to drive the spinning wheel. The water frame was 
more efficient than a single person’s labor, and this mechanization doomed the 
household textile cottage industry, as textile production was moved to factories 
big enough to house these bulky machines. Arkwright was thus considered the 
father of the factory system .
Interchangeable Parts  In 18, inventor Eli Whitney  created a system 
of interchangeable parts  for manufacturing firearms for the U.S. military. 
In Whitney’s system, if a particular component of a machine were to break, 
the broken component could easily be replaced with a new, identical part. 
Entrepreneurs adapted this method of making firearms to the manufacture of 
other products. The system of interchangeable parts was a pivotal contribution 
to industrial technology. 
Whitney’s system directly led to the division of labor. Factory owners no 
longer had to rely on skilled laborers to craft every component of a product. 
Instead, with specialization of labor, each worker could focus on one type 
of task. For example, one worker might cast a part, and then another worker 
would install the part on the finished product. In the early 20th century, Henry 
Ford expanded the concept of the division of labor, developing the moving 
assembly line  to manufacture his Model T automobiles. (Connect: Compare 
the technological improvements of Islamic and Asian states with those in the 
Western world during the Industrial Revolution. See Topic .1.
299 INDUSTRI AL REVOL UTION BEGINS 299Britain’s Industrial Advantages
Britain had many environmental and geographic advantages that made it a 
leader in industrialization. Located on the Atlantic Ocean with its many 
seaways , the country was well placed to import raw materials  and export 
finished goods. 
Mineral Resources  Britain also had the geographic luck of being located 
atop immense coal deposits. Coal was vital to industrialization because when 
burned it could power the steam engine. The burning of this fossil fuel, an 
energy source derived from plant and animal remains, was also essential in 
the process of separating iron from its ore. Iron production (and later steel 
production allowed the building of larger bridges, taller buildings, and stronger 
ships. Coal mining became the major industry of northern and western Britain, 
including South Wales, Yorkshire, and Lancashire. When the United States 
industrialized, coal-mining areas developed in West 9irginia, Pennsylvania, 
and Kentucky. 
Resources from the Colonies  As a colonizing power, Britain also had 
access to resources available in its colonies, including timber for ships. Largely 
because of the wealth they accumulated during the trans-Atlantic slave trade,

300 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONenough British capitalists had excess capital  (money available to invest in 
businesses. Without this capital, private entrepreneurs could not have created 
new commercial ventures.
Abundant Rivers  Britain, the northeastern United States, and other 
regions also had a natural network of rivers supplemented by publicly funded 
canals and harbors. These water routes made transport of raw materials and 
finished products inexpensive.
Strong Fleets  Britain also had the world’s strongest fleet of ships, 
including naval ships for defense and commercial ships for trade. These ships 
brought agricultural products to Britain to be used to make finished products 
for consumers. 
Protection of Private Property  A vital factor that aided industrialization 
in Britain was the legal protection of private property. Entrepreneurs needed 
the assurance that the business they created and built up would not be taken 
away, either by other businesspeople or by the government. Not all nations 
offered these legal guarantees.
Growing Population and Urbanization  The increases in agricultural 
production caused two shifts in society. As farmers grew more food, they could 
support more people. As they grew it more efficiently, society needed a smaller 
percentage of the population working in agriculture.
This growing population in rural areas did not remain there. Migration was 
sometimes the best of bad options. English towns had traditionally allowed 
farmers to cultivate land or tend sheep on government property known as “the 
commons.” However, this custom ended with the enclosure movement  as 
the government fenced off the commons to give exclusive use of it to people 
who paid for the privilege or who purchased the land. Many farmers became 
landless and destitute. The enclosure movement was thus instrumental in a 
wave of demographic change—forcing small farmers to move from rural areas 
to urban areas such as Manchester  and Liverpool.  The people who moved 
then became the workforce for the new and growing industries.

Industrialization Spreads
No exertions of the masters or workmen could have answered the demands  
of trade without the introduction of spinning machines.
 —1ohn AiRen, A +escription of the Country . . . Around 4anchester, 1795
Essential Question:   How did different types and locations of production 
develop and change over time?
Although the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, it soon spread 
elsewhere. The British cottage industry system for the production of cotton, in 
which merchants provided raw cotton to be spun into cloth in workers’ homes, 
was supplanted by the industrialization of cotton manufacture in factories. 
Cotton became an increasingly valuable commodity in the world economy as 
industrialized Britain, with higher productivity, was able to replace Indian and 
Middle Eastern goods. After Britain industrialized, Belgium and then France 
and Germany followed, and eventually Russia and Japan became industrialized. 
These countries possessed many of the characteristics that allowed Britain to 
industrialize, including capital, natural resources, and water transportation.
Spread of Industrialization
After Britain industrialized, Belgium, and then France and Germany followed. 
Like Britain, these countries possessed capital, natural resources, and water 
transportation. The United States, Japan, and Russia also transformed as 
industrialization spread.
France and Germany  Despite some favorable factors for industrialization, 
France had sparsely populated urban centers, which limited the amount of 
labor available for factories. Also, the French Revolution 18±1 and 
subsequent wars involving France and its neighbors consumed both the 
attention and the capital of France’s elites. These factors delayed the Industrial 
Revolution in France.
Germany was politically fragmented into numerous small states, which 
delayed its industrialization. However, once Germany unified in 181, it 
quickly became a leading producer of steel and coal. 
The United States  The United States began its industrial revolution in 
the 1th century. By 100, the United States was a leading industrial force 
305 INDUSTRI ALIZATION S PREADSin the world. Human capital  the workforce was a key factor in U.S. 
success. Political upheaval and widespread poverty brought a large number of 
immigrants to the United States from Europe and East Asia. These immigrants, 
as well as migrants from rural areas in the United States, provided the labor 
force to work in the factories.

Sugar Caribbean Islands, Brazil Britain (refined sugar)
Cattle and Hogs United States, Ireland, Argentina Britain, United States (meat)
Cotton United States Britain (textiles)
Russia  Russia also began to industrialize, focusing particularly on 
railroads and exports. By 100, Russia had more than 6,000 miles of railroad 
connecting its commercial and industrial areas. The Trans-Siberian Railroad 
stretched from Moscow to the Pacific Ocean, allowing Russia to trade easily 
with countries in East Asia, such as China and Japan. The Russian coal, iron, 
and steel industries developed with the railroad, mostly in the 180s. By 
1900, Russia had become the fourth largest producer of steel in the world. 
However, the economy remained overwhelmingly agricultural until after the 
Communists seized power in 1917. 
Japan  The first country in Asia to industrialize was the one that had 
the least contact with Europe since the 1th century: Japan. In the mid-1th 
century, Japan went through a process of defensive modernization. That is, it 
consciously adapted technology and institutions developed in Europe and the 
United States in order protect its traditional culture. By learning from the West, 
Japan built up its military and economic strength so it could maintain its own 
domestic traditions. In the last four decades of the 19th century, Japan emerged 
as a leading world power. For more details on Japan, see Topic 5.6. 
Shifts in Manufacturing
While Middle Eastern and Asian countries continued to produce manufactured 
goods, these regions’ share in global manufacturing declined.
Shipbuilding in India and Southeast Asia Shipbuilding initially 
saw a resurgence in India at the end of the 17th century, largely due to the 
political alliances formed between India and western countries. However, 
Indian shipbuilding ultimately suffered as a result of British officials’ 
306 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONmismanagement of resources and ineffective leadership during the period 
of British colonization in the late 1th and 18th centuries. In 180, Britain 
designated ships of the British East India Company as the Indian Navy. The 
Indian Navy was disbanded by 186, however, when Britain’s Royal Navy 
took complete control of the Indian Ocean.
Iron Works in India British colonial rule in India also affected the 
country’s mineral production. During the period of company rule— British 
East India Company control over parts of the Indian subcontinent from 1757 
to 1858²steep British tariffs led to the decline of India’s ability to mine and 
work metals. The British also began to close mines completely, especially 
after the Rebellion of 185, because they perceived that the mines were being 
used to extract lead for ammunition.
The ongoing fear of another uprising led to the Arms Act of 188, which 
restricted not only access to minerals, but also to the subsequent production 
of firearms. British colonizers limited India’s ability to mine and work metals 
in areas such as the mineral-rich state of Rajasthan. By the early 1th century, 
most of the mines in Rajasthan were abandoned and the mining industry was 
extinct.
Even though British colonial rule ended in 18, mining and metalworking 
remained practically nonexistent in India until the early 20th century. Lack 
of technological innovation after so many years of abandoned mines led 
to a relatively crude, labor-intensive method of mining, which created the 
false impression that India’s mineral resources were inaccessible. (Connect: 
Identify the similarities in how Britain treated its colonies in South Asia and 
its colonies in the Americas. See Topic .8.
Textile Production in India and Egypt  India and Egypt were both among 
the first to engage in the production and trade of textiles. Just as it stifled 
the production of ships and iron, British colonization also affected textile 
production in India. As the textile industry flourished in India, it undermined 
the British textile mills in Britain, specifically in Lancaster. The owners of the 
Lancaster textile mills pressured the British government in India to impose an 
“equalizing” five percent tax on all textiles produced at the more than 80 mills 
operating in Bombay, thus undermining their profitability.
Egypt’s textile industry, too, experienced difficulties as a result of Europe’s 
worldwide economic reach. In the 18th century, Egypt exported carpets, silks, 
and other textiles to Europe. By the mid-1th century, however, the huge 
growth in European textile production had changed matters. Egypt had lost 
not only its export market in textiles, but much of its domestic market as well.

307 INDUSTRI ALIZATION S PREADSMULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS  
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“The economic relations of Russia with western Europe are fully comparable 
to the relations of colonial countries with their metropolises. The latter 
consider their colonies as advantageous markets in which they can freely sell 
the products of their labor and of their industry and from which they can draw 
with a powerful hand the raw materials necessary for them. This is the basis 
of the economic power of the governments of western Europe, and chiefly for 
that end do they guard their existing colonies or acquire new ones. Russia was, 
and to a considerable extent still is, such a hospitable colony for all industrially 
developed states, generously providing them with the cheap products of her 
soil and buying dearly the products of their labor. 
But there is a radical difference between Russia and a colony: Russia is an 
independent and strong power. She has the right and the strength not to want to 
be the eternal handmaiden of states which are more developed economically. 
She should know the price of her raw materials and of the natural riches hidden 
in the womb of her abundant territories, and she is conscious of the great, not 
yet fully displayed, capacity for work among her people. She is proud of her 
great might, by which she jealously guards not only the political but also the 
economic independence of her empire. She wants to be a metropolis herself. 
On the basis of the people’s labor, liberated from the bonds of serfdom, there 
began to grow our own national economy, which bids fair to become a reliable 
counterweight to the domination of foreign industry.”

Technology in the Industrial Age
Railroad iron is a magician’s rod, in its power  
to evoke the sleeping energies of  land and water. 
—9alph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)
Essential Question:   How did technology shape economic production 
during the period from 1750 to 1900?
As the Industrial Revolution spread, it became increasingly important 
economically. Although he later came to be troubled by the role of technology, 
Ralph Waldo Emerson initially saw the innovations of the industrial age 
as a delightful way to mold nature in the service of humankind. The steam 
engine and then the internal combustion engine, powering railroads, ships, and 
factories, increased access to resources and increased the distribution of goods 
those resources helped produce.
The next technological wave, known as the second industrial revolution, 
came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and involved chemicals, steel, 
precision machinery, and electronics. Electrification lit the streets, and the 
telephone and radio made world-wide, instantaneous communication a reality.
The Coal Revolution 
The new machinery of the Industrial Revolution benefitted from a new power 
source, one more mobile than the streams that had powered the first factories 
with their water power. The version of the steam engine  made by James Watt 
in 1765 provided an inexpensive way to harness coal power to create steam, 
which in turn generated energy for machinery in textile factories. Within 50 
years, steam was producing power for steam powered trains. 
Water Transportation  Steamships revolutionized sailing. The use of 
coal made energy production mobile and dependable. Instead of being fixed in 
one place as a river was, coal-powered steam engines could be built anywhere 
and could be used on ships and trains. Further, unlike the wind, engines could 
be turned on by people when needed and turned off when not. As a result, 
ocean-going ships and boats on lakes were no longer dependent on winds for 
power. On rivers, steam-powered ships were able to travel quickly upstream 
on rivers, up to five miles per hour, instead of having to sail up or be towed by 
311 TECHNOLOG Y IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGEpeople and animals along the shore. Over time, steam-powered ships replaced 
sailing ships in worldwide travel. As a result, coaling stations , especially at 
critical points on trade routes, such as Cape Colony in South Africa and various 
islands in the Pacific, became important refueling points.

186 in Utah.
312 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIron In addition to powering steam engines, coal made possible the 
mass production of iron. Throughout the 100s and into the early 1800s, 
improved processes helped iron producers increase outputs. One of these was 
the introduction of coke, a refined form of coal that made possible the use of 
much larger iron producing furnaces. Cast iron was strong but brittle, making 
it difficult to stretch and shape. But in 1, Englishman Henry Cort patented 
the process for making the less strong but much more workable wrought iron. 
Each was a valuable component in transportation and industry, but greater 
improvements were still to come.
A Second Industrial Revolution
The United States, Great Britain, and Germany were key players in what is 
known as the second industrial revolution , which occurred in the late 19th 
and early 20th centuries. The innovations of the first industrial revolution were 
in textiles, steam power, and iron. The developments of the second industrial 
revolution were in steel , chemicals, precision machinery, and electronics. 
Steel Production  The mass production of steel, an alloy of iron and 
carbon, became possible with the introduction of the Bessemer Process in 
1856. This process involved blasting the molten metal with air as a means of 
removing impurities as well as helping keep the metal from solidifying. Over 
the years, Bessemer’s innovation was refined and improved, allowing steel to 
become the strong and versatile backbone of the industrial society. 
Oil In the mid-1800s, the first commercial oil wells were drilled, tapping 
into a vast new resource of energy. Petroleum, like coal, is a fossil fuel, an 
energy source derived from plant and animal remains. At first, the most 
important product from petroleum was kerosene, which was used for lighting 
and heaters. In 18, inventors developed chemical techniques to extract 
kerosene from petroleum. 
These techniques led to other developments, such as precision machinery 
and the internal combustion engine, which in turn led to automobile and airplane 
technologies. When automobiles were introduced in the early 1900s, gasoline 
as fuel became a more important product from petroleum than kerosene.
Electricity  The harnessing of electrical power had to wait for the 
development of an effective electrical generator. In 1882 in London, the first 
public power station began production. Electrification led to street lighting and 
electric street trains in the 180s. 
Communications  The development of electricity and electronics over the 
years helped lead to important developments in communication technology. 
Inventors had been working with the idea of transmitting sound by electrical 
means since the early 19th century. Finally, a patent for the telephone was issued 
to Alexander Graham Bell  in 186. Early phone systems were notoriously 
low in quality, but Thomas Edison’s 1886 design of a refined voice transmitter 
made telephone use more practical.
313 TECHNOLOG Y IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGERadio developed after the experiments of Italian physicist Gugliemo 
Marconi . In 1901, he was able to send and receive a radio signal across the 
Atlantic Ocean. After further refinements and inventions, radio become a form 
of popular mass media with an impact unlike any previously seen.
Global Trade and Migration
Railroads, steamships, and a new invention called the telegraph made 
exploration, development, and communication possible. The telegraph 
allowed immediate communication. The construction of railroads, including 
the Transcontinental Railroad  that connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans 
when it was completed in 186, facilitated U.S. industrial growth. Like the 
canals, the railroads were heavily subsidized by public funds. The vast natural 
resources of the United States timber, coal, iron, and oil, for example and 
the ability to transport them efficiently contributed to the development of the 
United States as an industrial nation. 
The desire for capital , money available to invest in a business, was a 
driving force domestically and abroad. Products of industrialization, such as 
the railroad, steamship, and the telegraph, directly linked farmers, miners, 
manufacturers, customers, and investors globally for the first time in history .
With the development of the railroad and steamships, such countries as 
Great Britain, Germany, and the United States intensified industrialization, 
increasing the need for resources. Industrialized countries sought to protect 
their access to resources and markets by establishing colonies. 
Whereas earlier trade and migration often centered on coastal cities, 
railroads, steamships, and the telegraph also opened up to exploration and 
development the interior regions around the globe. Access to these areas 
increased trade and migration. (Connect: Write a paragraph describing how 
the Silk Roads set the stage for the industrial developments of the 1800s. See

INDUSTRIALIZATION : GO=ERNMENT ’S ROLE317
5.6
Industrialization: 
Government’s  Role
It is our purpose to select from the various institutions prevailing among 
enlightened nations such as are best suited to our present conditions,  
and adapt them in gradual reforms and improvements of our policy  
and customs so as to be upon an equality with them.
—Emperor 4eiji. letter to President <lysses .rant,1871
Essential Question:   What economic strategies did different states and 
empires adopt, and what were the causes and effects 
of those strategies? 
As Western domination and technology spread, they met with varying degrees 
of acceptance in different nations. Each country experienced competing 
pressures between preservation of traditional values and modernization. 
Egypt and some other countries early adopted policies that encouraged the 
use of industrialized innovations, such as the steam engine, to boost textile 
productivity. Others, such as China, had weakened central governments under 
European ascendency that were unable to promote industrialization effectively.
The Ottoman Empire  The Ottoman Empire, although bordering Europe, 
had not adopted Western technology or Enlightenment ideas. Moreover, 
rampant corruption led to rapid decline, and ethnic nationalism among the 
empire’s diverse population led to widespread unrest. The empire earned the 
nickname “the sick man of Europe.” Europeans, particularly Russians, saw 
opportunities to expand their own empires at the expense of the weakening 
Ottomans. Though they feared the results of a power vacuum from a total 
collapse of the Ottoman Empire, they dismantled it after World War I. A 
smaller nation-state, the Republic of Turkey, and several independent countries 
replaced the former empire.
China  China suffered two great humiliations at the hands of Europeans 
in the 1th century: the Opium War and the split into “spheres of influence.” 
In the 20th century, China shook off foreign domination and briefly became 
a republic. However, its traumatic 19th century left a central government too 
weak to promote industrialization effectively for decades. See Topic 6.5.
Japan  In Japan, in contrast, the central government grew stronger in its 
struggle to maintain independence and territorial integrity in the face of Western 
318 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONchallenges. As the quote at the beginning of this chapter from Emperor Meiji’s 
letter to President Grant indicates, Japan actively sought Western innovations 
that it felt would help make it the equal of Western countries. 
Ottoman Industrialization 
Suffering from problems of overexpansion and failure to modernize, the 
Ottoman Empire underwent palace coups, declining trade, and weakening 
leadership in the 1800s. The empire no longer covered the grand areas of 
Suleiman the Magnificent, who had taken his army to the gates of 9ienna in 
1529. 
The Rise of Muhammad Ali  One part of the Ottoman Empire where the 
sultan ruled in name but had little power was Egypt. In fact, the Mamluks , 
formerly enslaved Turks who formed a military class, had ruled there for some 
600 years. In 1801, the sultan sent an Ottoman army to retake Egypt. In the 
conflict with the Mamluks, an Albanian Ottoman officer, Muhammad Ali , 
rose to prominence, and local leaders selected him to be the new governor of 
Egypt. The sultan lacked the power to do anything but agree.
Because of his power, Ali was able to act somewhat independently of the 
sultan. He joined the sultan’s military campaigns when it benefited him, and 
also undertook several campaigns without the sultan’s permission, including 
in the Sudan and Syria. He also began his own reforms in Egypt.  He began by 
making over the country’s military on a European model. He also established 
schools, sent military officers to be educated in France, and started an official 
newspaper²the first in the Islamic world.

Jean-Franoois Portaels, portrait of Muhammad Ali, 18
319 INDUSTRIALIZATION : GO=ERNMENT ’S ROLE319As part of his reform of the Egyptian economy, Ali taxed the peasants at 
such a high rate that they were forced to give up their lands to the state. The 
government could then control the valuable cotton production and make money 
on the export of cotton and other agricultural products. Secularizing religious 
lands put more agricultural produce in the hands of the government, resulting 
in large profits during the period of the Napoleonic wars 1±1815, when 
prices for wheat were high in Europe.
Muhammad Ali also pushed Egypt to industrialize. He had textile factories 
built to compete with those of the French and British. In Cairo, he had factories 
built to produce armaments. In Alexandria, he set up facilities to build ships so 
that Egypt could have its own navy. The city of Cairo had dozens of small shops 
turning out locks, bolts of cloth, and other parts for uniforms and weaponry. 
Ali is called the first great modern ruler of Egypt partly because of his vision 
of state-sponsored industrialization.
Japan and the Meiji Restoration
Japan’s transition to a modern, industrialized country took less than half a 
century to accomplish. No country made such a rapid change.
A Challenge to Isolation  Between 1600 and 185, Japan had very little 
contact with the rest of the world. However, the rising imperial powers in the 
world were not content to let Japan keep to itself. The great powers of Europe, 
such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Russia, all wanted to sell goods in 
Japan. Further, in the age of coal-powered ships, trading states wanted to be 
able to refuel in Japan as they sailed to and from China and other parts of East 
Asia. 
Japan Confronts Foreigners  In 185, a naval squad led by Commodore 
Matthew Perry  in 185 sailed into Yedo and Tokyo Bay, asking for trade 
privileges. The next year, Perry returned with even more ships, demanding 
that the Japanese engage in trade with the United States. Faced with the power 
of the U.S. warships, the Japanese gave in to U.S. demands. Soon they yielded 
to similar demands by other foreign states. 
The arrival of Perry, and the threat he posed, caused Japanese leaders to 
realize the danger they and their culture were in. They had seen how even 
a large, traditionally powerful country such as China had been humiliated 
by Westerners. They had watched as the British had gone to war to force 
the Chinese to accept opium imports. While some Japanese argued that the 
country could defend itself, many reformers feared it could not. They argued 
that the country should adopt enough Western technology and methods so it 
could protect its traditional culture. To accomplish this goal, they overthrew 
the shogun and restored power to the emperor in 1868, an event know as the 
Meiji Restoration.
Reforms by the Meiji State  Japan systematically visited Europe and the 
United States and invited experts to Japan in order to study Western institutions. 
Then, Japan adopted reforms based on what it admired:
320 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITION• It formally abolished feudalism in 1868 by the Charter Oath .
• It established a constitutional monarchy based on the Prussian model in 
which the emperor ruled through a subordinate political leader.
• It established equality before the law and abolished cruel punishments.
• It reorganized the military based on the Prussian army, building a new 
navy and instituting conscription.
• It created a new school system that expanded educational opportunities, 
particularly in technical fields.
• It built railroads and roads. 
• It subsidized industrialization, particularly in the key industries of tea, 
silk, weaponry, shipbuilding, and a rice wine called sake.
The government financed all of these reforms with a high agricultural tax. 
The taxes proved a good investment because they stimulated rapid economic 
growth. The government’s ability to collect increased taxes also provided 
revenue for the bureaucracy, now centered in Tokyo. 
However, in replicating the methods of Western countries, the Japanese 
also replicated some of industrial society’s problems. For example, accounts 
of abuse and exploitation of female Japanese mill workers are similar to the 
experiences that British female mill workers had recorded decades earlier.

321 INDUSTRIALIZATION : GO=ERNMENT ’S ROLEThe Role of Private Investments  While the relationship between 
industry and centralized government was key to modernization in Japan, 
private investment from overseas also became important. Once new industries 
were flourishing, they were sometimes sold to zaibatsu , powerful Japanese 
family business organizations like the conglomerates in the United States. 
The prospect of attracting investors encouraged innovation in technology. For 
example, a carpenter founded a company in 1906 called Toyoda Loom Works 
that made an automatic loom . The company prospered, modified its name, 
and grew into today’s Toyota Motor Company.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows. 
“It was cotton production, especially, that characterized the beginnings of 
Egypt’s integration into the global capitalist system. Cotton was an important 
part of the British Industrial Revolution, as textile mills in Lancashire 
and elsewhere came to symbolize the changes that occurred as a society 
transitioned from a feudal mode of production to a capitalist one. Egypt’s 
initial role in this chain of developments was to supply cotton to British textile 
mills, especially when the American Civil War cut off supplies of cotton from 
the southern United States Beckert, 200, p. 105. 
. . . Many of the major changes in Egyptian agriculture, and in rural Egyptian 
society more broadly, can be traced to the development of the global capitalist 
system. As the British promoted cotton cultivation in Egypt, large estates took 
over land that had supplied the means of subsistence for peasants under pre-
capitalist modes of production. The result was that µthe great majority of the 
peasantry was by the end of the nineteenth century either landless or land-
poor, while a new class of large landowners—an agrarian bourgeoisie—had 
emerged’ Beinin and Lockman, 18, p. 8. This agrarian bourgeoisie assumed 
much of the power in rural Egypt, yet the influx of foreign capital during this 
development of agricultural production in Egypt meant that the foreigners who 
controlled the capital also held much of the power over Egypt as a whole.”

As historians make connections between cultures and eras, they look 
for not only consistent patterns but also for divergent ones. For instance, 
the pattern in France and Germany was consistent: these countries 
realized their need to follow Britain’s charge towards industrializing 
production in order to strengthen their economic presence. This 
trend towards industrializing reveals their interest in gaining a global 
economic presence, perhaps even economic dominance. The states you 
read about in this topic, however, did not follow that pattern.

industrializing shared by the Ottomans and Japanese. In a few para 

Economic Developments 
and Innovations
Man is an animal that makes bargains: no other animal does this  
- no dog exchanges bones with another. 
—Adam Smith (1723-1790)
Essential Question:   How did the development of economic systems, 
ideologies, and institutions contribute to change 
between 1750 and 1900?
Industrialization and modernization led to new philosophies and business 
structures. In the Wealth of Nations 16, Adam Smith, arguing that humans 
are naturally transactional, provided a foundational text in support of capitalism 
and the establishment of private entrepreneurship and shaped the economics 
and politics of the industrial age and the centuries to follow. Mercantilism, 
a system of economic protectionism, was replaced by a laissez-faire “leave 
alone” in French policy that promoted minimal governmental involvement in 
commerce and encouraged countries to reduce tariffs on trade.
These economic ideas were reflected in, and supported by, emerging 
transnational institutions, including banks such as the Hong .ong and Shanghai 
Banking Corporation HSBC and manufacturers such as Unilever. As trade 
increased, so did the availability, affordability, and variety of consumer goods.
(σecWsRn%usiness2UJDni]DWiRn
New ways of organizing businesses arose during the Industrial Revolution. 
Some manufacturers formed giant corporations  in order to minimize risk. A 
corporation is a business chartered by a government as a legal entity owned 
by stockholders  (individuals who buy partial ownership directly from the 
company when it is formed or later through a  stock market . Stockholders 
might receive sums of money, known as dividends, from a corporation when 
it makes a profit. If a corporation experiences a loss or goes bankrupt, the 
stockholders are not liable for the losses. The most that stockholders can lose 
is what they paid for the stock in the first place.
Markets with One Seller  Some corporations became so powerful that 
they could form a monopoly , control of a specific business and elimination of 
all competition. For example, Alfred Krupp of Essen, Germany, ran a gigantic 
company that used the Bessemer process , a more efficient way to produce 
steel, gaining a monopoly in the German steel industry. In the United States, 
John D. Rockefeller created a monopoly in the oil industry.
326 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONCompanies Working Across Boundaries  British-born Cecil Rhodes , 
founder of De Beers Diamonds, was an especially enthusiastic investor in a 
railroad project that was to stretch from Cape Town, in modern-day South 
Africa, to Cairo, Egypt. Connecting all of the British-held colonies with a 
transportation network could make governance easier and aid in conducting 
a war, if necessary. The project was never completed because Britain never 
gained control over all the land on which such a railroad was to be built. 
The overwhelming majority of railway workers in Africa were natives who 
were paid far lower wages than their European counterparts. Thus, railroad 
technology was a means of extracting as many resources as possible from 
subject lands while paying colonial laborers as little as possible.
De Beers was one of many transnational  companies—those that operated 
across national boundaries—that emerged in the 19th century. For example, 
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation , a British-owned bank 
opened in its colony of Hong .ong in 1865, focused on finance, corporate 
investments, and global banking. The Unilever Corporation , a British and 
Dutch venture, focused on household goods²most famously, soap. By 180 
it had soap factories in Australia, Switzerland, the United States, and beyond. 
Unilever sourced the palm oil for its soaps first from British West Africa 
and later the Belgian Congo, where it operated huge plantations. Because 
these companies were transnational, they gained wealth and influence on 
a scale rarely approached before. (Connect: Defend or refute the claim—  
mercantilism was necessary for the eventual growth of transnational 
companies. See Topic ..  
Corporations  A sole proprietorship is a business owned by a single 
person, and a partnership is a small group of people who make all business 
decisions. A corporation differs from these two other major forms of business 
ownership in that a corporation is a more flexible structure for large-scale 
economic activity. It replaced the traditional system of a single entrepreneur 
engaging in high-risk business endeavors with a system of larger companies, 
collectively engaging in lower-risk efforts. By spreading risk, investments 
became much safer and more attractive.

327 ECONOMIC DEVELO PMENTS AND INNOV ATIONS 327Despite critics’ charges that corporations undermined individual 
responsibility, they became a common form of business organization. They 
eventually dominated many areas of business, from banking to manufacturing 
to providing services. With their growth, corporations gained great economic 
and political power. For example, the decision by a corporation about where 
to build a new factory could create thousands of new jobs for a community . 
Banking and Finance  Another way to reduce risk was through insurance, 
especially marine insurance. Lloyd’s of London, with beginnings in a coffee 
house where merchants and sailors went for the most reliable shipping news, 
helped establish the insurance industry. The number of banks rose as merchants 
and entrepreneurs looked for a reliable place to deposit money and to borrow it 
when needed to build a factory or hire workers for a new enterprise. 
(σecWRn0Dss&ulWuUe 
A culture of consumerism  as well as of leisure developed among the working 
and middle classes of society in Great Britain, and for some people, living 
standards rose.  Consumption needed to keep up with production, so producers 
began to advertise heavily, particularly to the middle class whose members 
had some disposable income, money that can be spent on nonessential goods. 
Leisure activities such as biking and boating became popular during the 
late 1800s. In the 1880s, the penny-farthing bicycle below left was replaced 
by the newer safety bicycle below right. The older style featured one large 
wheel and one small one. This allowed riders to travel fast, but the danger of 
falling over was high. The newer style, by using a chain connecting different 
sized gears on the wheels, could go the same speed, but with less risk.

328 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONCompanies encouraged their workers to participate in athletics, because 
they believed that sports rewarded virtues such as self-discipline and playing 
by the rules. The sales of athletic equipment also generated business for those 
who made everything from soccer` balls to sports stadiums.
Perhaps because workers spent most of their waking hours in a bleak 
industrial environment, material goods and leisure entertainment became 
important escapes. In Europe, soccer known there as football, became 
popular, while baseball dominated sports in the United States. Particular sports 
developed along class lines: tennis and golf in England, for example, were 
played by the upper classes, while certain types of rugby were played only by 
the lower classes.
The commercialization of the demand for public culture was also seen in 
the construction of music halls and public parks, particularly during the second 
half of the 19th century. Both the halls and the parks were built to accommodate 
a wide range of social classes. One aim of this mingling of classes was for the 
lower classes to see more civilized, rational behavior so that they would be 
encouraged to emulate it. The manner in which one class may have ultimately 
influenced the other is difficult to quantify, yet the enduring presence of such 
public mingling places remains intact.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“It is especially difficult to explain why consumers chose to use the increasing 
incomes which they had at their disposal for consumption rather than for 
saving or investment. Some historians suggest that consumption increased 
because consumers shared an almost instinctive desire to enjoy a higher 
standard of living and improve their material and psychological well-being. 
Others believe that consumers consumed in order to emulate those around 
them; as Perkin suggests, ‘If consumer demand was the key to the Industrial 
Revolution, social emulation was the key to consumer demand. By the 
eighteenth century nearly everyone in England and the Scottish Lowlands 
received a money income, and nearly everyone was prepared to spend a 
large part of it in  keeping up with the Joneses .’ Other historians maintain 
that consumers were manipulated by the machinations of advertisers and 
other commercial interests. According to Royle, ‘The lubricant to make 
the consumer society of the late twentieth century function smoothly was 
advertising, which was made all the easier with the advent of television.’ ”

Using reasoning processes of comparison, causation, andor continuity

different historical developments. For example, they can explain the 
relationship between the historical development of state-building and 
the historical development of global trading networks by asking such 
questions as:
• How were these developments the same, and how were they 
different? 
• What caused each development, and what were the effects? Did 
one development cause the other? 
• What degree of change did the development bring about? In other 
words, to what extent was continuity preserved or disrupted?  
Two developments during the period 1750 to 1900 have earned the

Reactions to the  
Industrial Economy

—4ary Harris ¸4other¹ 1ones, (1837-1930)
Essential Question:   What conditions led to calls for change in industrial 
societies, and what were the effects of those efforts?
The harsh conditions of industrial life provoked resistance and calls for 
reform. “Mother” Jones, a labor organizer, described the severe deprivations 
of the coal miners working underground all day, and other activists told of 
the horrors of factory work. Philosophers such as John Stuart Mill sought to 
address this growing inhumanity of the industrial era through social reforms 
Others, such as the utopian socialists, argued for completely changing a 
system they considered to be basically flawed. Workers formed trade unions to 
advocate for higher pay and safer working conditions. Various ideologies and 
political movements emerged, some promoting alternative visions of society. 
The Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin, China, and Japan also 
instituted reforms to promote industrialization. In response, in each, faced 
reactions against the results of economic change. 
Labor Unions
Dangerous and unsanitary working conditions, low wages, and long hours 
were common in factory work in the 19th century. A committee of Britain’s 
Parliament released a study called the Sadler Report in 18. The report 
described these conditions. It made many people in Britain, particularly in 
Parliament, aware of the need for reforms. 
Workers also responded to low pay and harsh conditions. They began to 
form  labor unions  —organizations of workers that advocated for the right to 
bargain with employers and put the resulting agreements in a contract. For 
most of the 19th century, unions in Great Britain had to organize in secret 
because the government treated them as enemies of trade. However, by the 
20th century, unions became more acceptable and membership increased. 
333 REACTIONS TO T HE INDUSTRI AL ECONOM Y Unions improved workers’ lives by winning minimum wage laws, limits on 
the number of hours worked, overtime pay, and the establishment of a five-day 
work week.
Voting Rights  Unions sparked a larger movement for empowerment 
among the working class. In 182, 186, and 188, the British parliament 
passed reform bills to expand the pool of men who could vote, thereby giving 
more representation to British cities. The acts reduced property ownership 
qualifications as a requirement for voting. These reforms laid the foundation 
for expansion of the franchise right to vote to all men in 118. British women 
would not gain equal suffrage voting rights until 128.
Child Labor  Along with unions, social activists and reformers hoped 
to improve the living conditions of the least powerful in society. Reformers’ 
achievements especially benefited children. A law in 18 declared that 
children under the age of 10 were banned from working in the coal mines. 
In 1881, education became mandatory for British children between the ages 
of 5 and 10. This focus on education, as opposed to work for monetary gain, 
permanently redefined the role of children in urban society.
The Intellectual Reaction 
As trade and production became increasingly global, the ideas of early 
economists such as Adam Smith see Topic 5.1 were taken in new directions. 
While Smith wrote in an age of individual entrepreneurs and small businesses, 
people of the 1th century witnessed the rise of large-scale transnational 
businesses. This shift caused people to think about society in new ways. For 
example, utopian socialists tried to create new communities to demonstrate 
alternatives to capitalism. 
John Stuart Mill  Some economists, clergy, and intellectuals criticized  
laissez-faire capitalism as inhumane to workers. One of these was a British  
philosopher, John Stuart Mill 1806±18. He championed legal reforms 
to allow labor unions, limit child labor, and ensure safe working conditions 
in factories. While his ideas were controversial in his time, many of them 
eventually become widely adopted in industrial societies.
Mill’s philosophy was called utilitarianism.  Rather than state a set of 
timeless moral rules, as many religions or ethicists did, utilitarianism  sought 
“the greatest good for the greatest number of people.” Unlike utopian socialists, 
who wanted to replace capitalism, utilitarians wanted to address the growing 
problems they saw with it. They viewed themselves as moderate, rational 
advocates of gradual reform.
334 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONKarl Marx
While most reformers wanted to fix what they considered problems with 
capitalism, some people wanted more extensive changes. Karl Marx  1818±
188 was a German scholar and writer who argued for socialism. Unlike 
utopian socialists, whom he scorned because he thought they wanted to escape 
problems rather than confront them, he wanted to look at how the world 
actually operated. He called his approach to economics “scientific socialism.” 
In 188, .arl Marx and his wealthy supporter Friedrich Engels  published 
a pamphlet (now called the  Communist Manifesto  that summarized their 
critique of capitalism. According to Marx, capitalism was an advance on 
feudalism because it produced tremendous wealth, but that it also produced 
needless poverty and misery. This contradiction between wealth and poverty 
occurred because capitalism divided society into two basic classes. 
• The proletariat  was essentially the working class, working in factories 
and mines, often for little compensation. 
• The bourgeoisie  included the middle class and investors who owned 
machinery and factories where workers produced goods. 
Marx said that market competition drove the bourgeoisie to exploit the 
proletariat for the sake of higher profits. Because the bourgeoisie owned the 
means of production , such as machines, factories, mines, and land, they 
received most of the wealth produced. The proletariat, who did the physical 
and dangerous work, received very little, just enough to survive. Marx exhorted 
the proletariat to recognize their shared interest as a class and take control of 
the means of production and share the wealth they created fairly. 
For Marx, socialism would replace capitalism. It, then, would later be 
replaced by a final stage of economic development, communism , in which all 
class distinctions would end. (Connect: Create a chart comparing utopian and 
Marxist thought. See Topic 5.1.
Ottoman Response to Industrialization
In the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was no longer at the peak of its political 
power. However, it maintained some economic power. Sultan Mahmud II  
ruled 1808±18 reformed the Ottoman system. In 1826, he abolished the 
corps of Janissaries, which had opposed him, and developed a new artillery 
unit trained by Europeans. When the Istanbul Janissaries revolted, he had 
them massacred. The abolition of the feudal system in 181 marked the final 
defeat of the Janissaries’ power. Military officers were no longer able to collect 
taxes directly from the populace for their salaries. Instead, tax collections 
went directly to the central government, which paid military personnel, thus 
ensuring their loyalty.
335 REACTIONS TO T HE INDUSTRI AL ECONOM Y Mahmud’s reforms also included building roads and setting up a postal 
service. To fight the power of popular religious charities, he set up a government 
directory of charities. To operate the central administration of government,  
Mahmud II created European-style ministries.
Reorganization  Reforms after Mahmud during the years 18±186 
are called Tanzimat  reorganization and include the following changes:
• The sultans in this period worked to root out long-standing and 
widespread corruption in the central government.
• Education had long been under the control of the ulama, the educated 
class of Muslim scholars. Now the sultans created a secular system of 
primary and secondary schools. Secular colleges were also gradually 
set up, one for each special purpose: military, engineering, translation, 
civil service, and so on.
• The sultans codified Ottoman laws and created new ones, including a 
commercial code 1850 and a penal code 1858. These codes made it 
easier for foreigners to do business in the empire. 
• In 1856, the sultan issued an edict known as the Hatt-i Humayun 
Ottoman Reform Edict that updated the legal system, declaring 
equality for all men in education, government appointments, and 
justice regardless of religion or ethnicity. The new legal system also 
regulated the millets , which were separate legal courts established by 
different religious communities, each using its own set of religious 
laws. Christians in the Balkans protested the new regulations because 
they felt that their autonomy was being threatened. Muslims, on 
the other hand, protested the reforms because they conflicted with 
traditional values and practice.
Although not achieving religious equality, the Tanzimat reforms continued 
to have wide effects in areas such as the military and education. These effects 
continued even when succeeding sultans blocked other reforms. 
Ottoman Economy and Society  The reforms under Mahmud II and the 
Tanzimat occurred during a period of economic change in Turkey. After the 
Napoleonic wars ended in 1815, prices for food and other crops declined in the 
Ottoman Empire. However, a global economy was in place, built partially on 
the flow of wealth into the Mediterranean from European colonial expansion 
in the Americas. Ottoman workers were increasingly paid in cash rather than 
in goods. Financial enterprises such as banking increased. These economic 
changes occurred along with the slow spread of industrialization. The growth 
of industry affected men and women differently. For example, most new 
industrial jobs went to men.
Legal reforms also benefited men more than women. Traditionally, under 
shariah, women had been allowed to hold money, to gain from inheritance, 
and to receive some education. The reforms of Mahmud II made the law more 
secular, and ended the right of women to distribute their property or cash 
through trusts to family members. 
336 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONAlthough women had indirect control of their property, the new 
nonreligious courts ended even these limited rights. Many reforms had no 
effect on women. Since women were excluded from the army, the professions, 
higher education, and commerce, reforms in these areas did not affect them 
directly. The Tanzimat reforms of 18 did not even mention women.
Opposition to Reform  When Sultan Abdulhamid took power in 186, 
he supported the efforts at internal reforms. He accepted a new constitution 
for the Ottoman Empire and he continued to emphasize primary education and 
secularization of the law. A few girls were allowed to attend girls’ secondary 
schools by the beginning of the 20th century.
However, fearful of any “seditious” reform, the sultan and the central 
government maintained tight control over the empire. Abdulhamid eventually 
drove the advocates for reform, known as “Young Turks” into exile. Further, 
his government whipped up anger against minority groups, particularly 
Armenians and Assyrian Christians. Between 18 and 186, between 
100,000 and 250,000 Armenians were killed throughout several provinces in 
what has become known as the Hamidian massacres. For this bloodshed, he 
received the nickname the Red Sultan.
5efRUP(σRUWsin&KinD
Like other powers, China under the Qing Dynasty felt pressure to modernize. 
Its major reform effort of the late 1th century was known as the Self-
Strengthening Movement . It developed as a way for the government to face 
the internal and external problems confronting China. Government officials 
hoped to strengthen China in its competition with foreign powers by advancing 
its military technology and readiness and by training Chinese artisans in the 
manufacture of items for shipyards and arsenals. French and British advisors 
helped Chinese reform efforts. A stable government capable of collecting 
revenue allowed China to repay debts and participate in trade. For the Chinese, 
their existence as an independent state depended upon economic solvency. 
Reform in the name of modernization seemed inevitable. 
As another step toward reform, the Chinese government set up its own 
diplomatic corps and a customs service to help collect taxes on imports and 
exports. The government’s strategy was to graft some modern ideas and 
technology onto Chinese tradition rather than to create major change.
Demand for reform increased after China’s defeat in the Sino-Japanese 
War 18±185. People formed clubs to call for change. One club, led by a 
civil servant named .ang Youwei, was able to meet with Emperor Guangxu . 
Kang convinced the ruler to support a set of sweeping reforms known as the 
Hundred Days of Reform . The reforms included the abolition of the outdated 
civil service exam, the elimination of corruption, and the establishment of 
Western-style industrial, commercial, and medical systems. 
Cixi’s Initial Conservatism  However, the emperor’s aunt and adopted 
mother and the most powerful political figure in the country, Empress 
337 REACTIONS TO T HE INDUSTRI AL ECONOM Y Dowager Cixi , was a conservative. At first, she opposed the reforms and 
wanted to protect traditional social and governmental systems. In a coup d’état, 
Cixi imprisoned the emperor and immediately repealed his reform edicts. 
She feared the influence of foreigners, so she resisted any new technology 
that would extend their reach into her country. For example, she stopped the 
extension of railroad lines and telegraph networks into the Chinese interior.
Reform of the Civil Service  However, toward the end of Cixi’s rule, she 
came to recognize the problems with the civil service system. It was designed 
according to Confucian ideals of respect for rank and hierarchy as well as values 
of civic participation and action. By the 19th century, though, the wealthy were 
using the civil servants to get favors. Revenue dropped off for the government 
as a result of bribes going into the pockets of corrupt civil servants. Moreover, 
non-qualified persons were purchasing civil service posts. China abandoned 
nearly 2,500 years of tradition, one that had yielded an educated bureaucracy of 
scholar-gentry. In spite of this concession, the empress’s overall conservatism 
caused her to fail to cope with demands of modernity in China.
China and Foreign Powers  Unlike Turkey, where Europeans had 
little to gain from either passage or opposition to progressive reforms, in 
China, Europeans encouraged change. When reforms were met with the 
conservatism of Empress Cixi and the 1900 Boxer Rebellion against foreign 
influence see Topic 6.2, the Chinese government, including its provincial 
governors, continued to modernize, with some help from American and 
European advisors. Weakened by internal rebellion and fearing encroachment 
from Japan, China had to accept territorial “protection” from Western powers, 
who in return demanded trade concessions. 
In 111, the Chinese chose to become a republic. See Topic .1. In 
addition, they resisted being swallowed up by their external enemies. China’s 
attempts to preserve its territorial integrity benefited from the efforts of 
the United States to maintain stability in Asia by preventing Japan from 
encroaching farther on its territory after the Russo-Japanese War of 105. 
U.S. efforts were exemplified by the Treaty of Portsmouth, which settled the 
war and was negotiated with the help of President Theodore Roosevelt. 
Resistance to Reform in Japan
Just as China ended its long-standing civil service system, the Japanese also 
ended a traditional system of exercising authority. In 181, Japan gave samurai 
a final lump-sum payment and legally dissolved their position. They were no 
longer fighting men and were not allowed to carry their swords. The bushido , 
their code of conduct, was now a personal matter, no longer officially condoned 
by the government.
Some samurai adjusted to the change by serving the government as 
genros , or elder statesmen. Others, particularly those from the provinces of 
Satsuma and Choshu, resisted the change. They defended their right to dress 
and wear their hair in traditional ways and to enjoy relative autonomy from 
338 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONthe centralized government. The last battle between the samurai shogunate 
forces and those loyal to the emperor occurred in the 180s. Dismayed by 
defeat, the samurai became the main victims of Japan’s rapid modernization. 
Ironically, some of their leaders were the same people who had supported the 
Meiji Restoration in the 1860s. 
Rise and Decline of Liberalization  Some reforms in Japan worked better 
than others. The new schools quickly improved literacy rates, the economy 
rapidly industrialized, and the country began to develop traits of democracy 
such as a free press, strong labor unions, and respect for individual liberties. 
However, by the 120s, army officers again began to dominate the government.
Limits to Reform  
Turkey, China, and Japan each followed its own path in responding to 
industrialization in the 19th century. Of the three, Turkey began to make 
changes earliest. However, Sultan Abdulhamid, though he supported reforms 
at first, became more conservative during his time as ruler. China began to 
make changes only later in the century. In contrast to Abdulhamid, China’s 
Cixi started as skeptical of reform but became more liberal during her reign. 
Japan responded to industrialization with dramatic, rapid changes beginning 
with the Meiji Restoration in 1868. However, the speed and depth of its 
reforms prompted a backlash from conservative members of society.

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:   EXPLAIN THE HISTORIC AL SITUATION   
OF A SOURCE 
Knowing the historical situation of a source—including the other 
contemporaneous opinions swirling about a topic—helps situate the 
source in a spectrum of viewpoints. 
In 18, Samuel Laing, a British politician, wrote a paper called 
“The Causes of, and Remedies for, the Existing Distress of the Country,” 
in reaction to evidence “that as wealth increases, poverty increases in a 
faster ratio.” He proposed systematic, government sponsored emigration 
as one solution to the problem. 
5ead the e[cerpts Eelow from /aing¶s paper and then answer the 
questions that follow to help explain its historical situation. 
“The truth appears to be, that while emigration is advocated simply 
as a matter of profit and loss, and regarded as a cheap and convenient 
mode of shoving misery out of sight, it is not calculated to answer 
the selfish ends of its promoters. But if it were taken up in a spirit of 
charity, and as part and parcel of a comprehensive scheme for raising 
the condition of the poorer classes, and prosecuted by the government 
and society from a sense of duty rather than of self-interest, there seems 
every ground for hoping that emigration might become an instrument 
of great good, not only to the colonies, but to the mother country. If 
the owners of estates, for instance, where the agricultural population 
is clearly redundant, were, with a disinterested view to the good of 
their dependants, to assist them in emigrating, and if the government 
was, under proper guarantees, and with proper discrimination, to 
cooperate in the enterprise, there seems no doubt that much practical 
good might be accomplished. Colonies . . . might be planted in the 
North American settlements with every prospect of success; indeed 
with the certainty that those who, if they had remained at home, 
would have been squalid paupers, will, in a few years, become a 
body of respectable freeholders, and an important acquisition to their 
adopted country. By the same process the condition of those at home 
might be greatly ameliorated, provided active steps were taken by 
the landlord to eradicate the evils which had led to the multiplication 
342 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONof a pauper population. A great writer has said, “Do the duty that 
lies nearest to thee, and already, in so doing, thy next duty will have 
become clearer.” . . . Every step taken in advance with a good motive 
and in a right direction, clears away a thousand difficulties. When it 
is clearly seen that a measure will benefit human beings, and injure 
nothing but abstract theories, let the government strike boldly in, and 
the theories will soon veer round and prove that what has been done 
is right. . . .  Do not let the government risk the certain good that 
is effected under the present system by any hazardous experiment 
unsanctioned by experience; but, on the other hand, do not let them 
sink spellbound under the influence of theories of laissez faire , and 
omit opportunities of doing practical good where it is in their power. 
Let them leave the principle of self-interest to do all the good it can, 
but remember that it can never be a substitute for the higher principles 
of duty and charity, and that emigration, like any other expedient for 
the relief of society, must be conducted in a disinterested spirit of 
enlightened benevolence, in order to accomplish its object.”

5.9
Society and the Industrial Age
Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for the well-housed and fed  
to draw round the bright fire and thank .od they were at home" and for  
the homeless, starving wretch to lay him down and die. 
—Charles +icRens, 6liver Twist (1839)
Essential Question:   How did industrialization cause change in e_isting 
social hierarchies and standards of living?
Industrialization affected not only governments and economies but also 
people’s everyday lives. Dickens illustrated the sharp contrasts in the industrial 
age between the emerging middle class, who enjoyed the benefits of the new 
prosperity, and the urban poor, who were ill-treated. Young children worked 
in factories. Women experienced substantial changes in their lifestyle. Poor  
women took jobs in domestic service and the textile industries, spending less 
time at home. Middle-class women, with no economic responsibilities, felt 
limited by household roles. The middle classes also started spending their free 
time seeking entertainment in theaters, concert halls, and sports facilities. 
(σecWsRn8UEDn$UeDs 
For the first half of the 1th century, urban areas grew rapidly and with little 
planning by governments. This development left a damaging ecological 
footprint and created inhumane living conditions for the cities’ poorest 
residents, members of the working class. Working families crowded into 
shoddily constructed tenement  apartment buildings, often owned by factory 
owners themselves. Tenements were often located in urban slums  (areas 
of cities where low-income families were forced to live, where industrial 
by-products such as polluted water supplies and open sewers were common. 
In conditions like these, disease, including the much-feared cholera, 
spread quickly. So did other public health menaces, such as fire and crime 
and violence. Over time, municipalities created police and fire departments, 
and several public health acts were passed to implement sanitation reform 
by creating better drainage and sewage systems, supplying cleaner water, 
removing rubbish, and building standards to reduce accidents and fire.  
Eventually, industrialization led to increased living standards for many. 
While life could be very hard for poor and working class people, the growing 
middle class had increased access to goods, housing, culture, and education. 
344 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe wealth and opportunities of the middle class were among the reasons 
people continued to stream into cities from rural areas. People living in poverty 
on farms or in villages hoped to find a better life in an urban center. Many did.
Effects on Class Structure  As industrialization spread, new classes of 
society emerged in Britain. At the bottom rungs of the social hierarchy were 
those who labored in factories and coal mines. They were known as the 
working class . Though they helped construct goods rapidly, the technology of 
interchangeable parts and the factory system’s division of labor had deprived 
workers of the experience of crafting a complete product. In comparison to 
the artisans of earlier generations, workers needed fewer skills, so managers 
viewed them as easily replaceable. Competition for jobs kept wages low.

Industrialization created new jobs in factories upper and offices lower that pulled people from rural 
areas into urban areas, a process that continues around the world today.
345 SOCIET Y AND THE INDUSTRI AL AGE345While industrialization created low-skilled jobs, it also required those who 
managed the production of goods to have education and sophisticated skills. 
A new middle class emerged, consisting of factory and office managers, small 
business owners, and professionals. They were white-collar  workers, those 
held by office workers. Most were literate and considered middle class.
At the top of the new class hierarchy were the industrialists and owners of 
large corporations. These so-called captains of industry soon overshadowed 
the landed aristocracy as the power brokers and leaders of modern society.
Farm Work Versus Factory Work  Before industrialization, family 
members worked in close proximity to one another. Whether women spun 
fabric in their own homes or landless workers farmed the fields of a landlord, 
parents and children usually spent their working hours close to each other. 
Industrialization disrupted this pattern. Industrial machinery was used in large 
factories, making it impossible to work from home. Thus, individuals had to 
leave their families and neighborhoods for a long workday in order to earn 
enough money to survive. 
In a factory, work schedules were nothing like they were on a farm or 
in a cottage industry. The shrill sounds of the factory whistle told workers 
when they could take a break, which was obviously a culture shock to former-
farmers who had previously completed tasks according to their own needs and 
schedules. Considering that workers commonly spent 14 hours a day, six days 
a week in a factory, exhaustion was common. Some of these exhausted workers 
operated dangerous heavy machinery. Injuries and death were common.
Effects on Children  The low wages of factory workers forced them to 
send their children to work also. In the early decades of industrialization, 
children as young as five worked in textile mills. Because of their small size 
and nimble fingers, children could climb into equipment to make repairs or into 
tight spots in mines. However, the dust from the textile machinery damaged 
their lungs just as much as it did to adults’ lungs. 
Children who worked in coal mines faced even more dangerous conditions 
than those in mills:
• They labored in oppressive heat, carting heavy loads of coal.
• Coal dust was even more unhealthy to breathe than factory dust.
• Mine collapses and floods loomed as constant threats to life.
Effect on Women’s Lives  The Industrial Revolution affected women in 
different ways, depending on their class position. Because their families needed 
the money, working-class women worked in coal mines until the practice of 
hiring women for coal mining was declared illegal in Britain in the 180s and 
were the primary laborers in textile factories. Factory owners preferred to hire 
women because they could pay them half of what they paid men.
Middle-class women were spared factory work, yet in many ways they 
lived more limited lives than working-class women. Middle-class men had to 
346 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONleave the house and work at an office to provide for their families. If a wife 
stayed at home, it was an indication that her husband was capable of being the 
family’s sole provider. Being a housewife thus became a status symbol. 
By the late 1800s, advertising and consumer culture contributed to a “cult 
of domesticity” that idealized the female homemaker. Advertising encouraged 
women to buy household products that would supposedly make the home a 
husband’s place of respite from a harsh modern world. Pamphlets instructed 
middle-class women on how to care for the home, raise children, and behave 
in polite society and urged them to be pious, submissive, pure, and domestic. 
For working-class women the cult of domesticity was even more taxing, as 
they had to manage the household, care for their children, and work full time. 
Industrialization also spurred feminism. When men left a community to 
take a job, their absence opened up new opportunities for the women who 
remained home. One political sign of this feminism came in 188 at Seneca 
Falls, New York, when 00 people met to call for equality for women.
Effects on the Environment  The Industrial Revolution was powered by 
fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Although burning coal 
produced more energy than burning wood, the effects were extremely harmful. 
Industrial towns during the late 19th century were choked by toxic air pollution 
produced by coal-burning factories. Smog smoke and fog from factories led 
to deadly respiratory problems. Water became polluted, also, as the new 
industries dumped their waste into streams, rivers, and lakes. Cholera, typhoid, 
and other diseases ravaged neighborhoods. 
Source:  John Leech, 3unch, July , 1858.
Before London built a system of public sanitation, the Thames 
River, the source of the city’s drinking water, was filled with 
sewage and industrial pollution. The river spread deadly diseases 
throughout the city.
347 SOCIET Y AND THE INDUSTRI AL AGEIndustrial Revolution’s Legacy
The Industrial Revolution brought about profound changes. Mass production  
made goods cheaper, more abundant, and more easily accessible to a greater 
number of people than ever before. Growth of factories attracted people to 
move, both from rural areas to cities and from agrarian countries to industrial 
ones. Both low-skilled workers and high-skilled professionals moved to take 
advantage of new opportunities provided by industrialization. 
However, the natural by-products of industrial production polluted air 
and water supplies. Industry forever changed the nature of work and the lives 
of workers. Working populations became concentrated in urban centers, as 
opposed to being spread among rural areas. The workplace shifted from homes 
to factories, dramatically altering family life. The Industrial Revolution created 
a new²and many said unequal²working relationship between workers and 
owners. More crowding and more poverty brought more crime.
Global inequalities also increased because of industrialization. States that 
industrialized early desired more raw materials to power their production. They 
searched the world for items such as cotton and rubber. By exploiting overseas 
natural resources, they undercut early industrialization in Egypt, China, and 
India, and ushered in a second wave of colonization.

populated enclave was once renowned for jam-packed, filthy tenements, 
garbage-covered streets, prostitution, gambling, violence, drunkenness, and 
abject poverty. . . . 
Few historians devoted much attention to Five Points in the early years of

CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE  IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGE351
5.10
Continuity and Change  
in the Industrial Age
Capital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power.
—-riedrich Engels and 2arl 4ar_, The Communist Manifesto (1848)
Essential Question:   How did the Industrial 9evolution demonstrate both 
continuity and change? 
The Industrial Revolution, an era that began in the late 18th century, produced 
economic, social, cultural, political, and environmental changes not seen 
since the first Agricultural Revolution, more than 10,000 years before. The 
Industrial Revolution changed how goods were produced, how people earned 
their living, and how businesses were structured. The Industrial Revolution 
also caused sweeping social changes. 
An expansion of the middle class in industrial economies occurred. A 
working class, dependent on factory jobs, emerged. The role of women was 
transformed, as they made up a significant portion of the factory work force. 
Politically, the Enlightenment proved to be a long-lasting and influential 
intellectual movement that influenced events during the Industrial Revolution. 
The effects of the Industrial Revolution inspired the works of economic 
and political philosophers like Adam Smith and .arl Marx. The Industrial 
Revolution altered life locally as well as globally. Rivalries among nations, 
which had existed previously, continued into and throughout this era leading 
to political and economic conflict. Additionally, rigid social orders, based on 
economic or ethnic status, continued within industrial economies. 
Economic Continuities and Changes
The Industrial Revolution transformed the production and consumption of 
goods. In Western Europe, access to abundant natural resources, transoceanic 
trade routes, and  financial capital combined with an increasing population 
resulted in a leadership role in industrialization. The Scientific Revolution, 
begun in the previous era and influenced by scientific knowledge transferred to 
the West from the Islamic world, helped to bring about inventions that would 
lead to the establishment of the factory system and the mass production of 
goods. However, the invention of the machines used to mass produce goods 
352 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONmeant a change from the era of skilled artisans working at their own pace 
to craft unique and well-built products. With automation, many factory jobs 
required only unskilled labor working on an assembly line doing repetitive 
tasks to produce identical goods. As a result, many consumer goods were now 
more readily available, more affordable, and in greater variety than ever before.
Industrialization Around the World  New methods of industrial 
production associated with the Industrial Revolutions spread and changed the 
economies of other areas of the world outside of Western Europe. As a result, the 
United States, Russia, and Japan experienced increased industrial production 
and built more railroads. In the cases of Japan and Egypt, industrialization was 
encouraged through state sponsored efforts to modernize their economies with 
varying degrees of success. However, the industrial economies of Western 
Europe and the United States continued to dominate the global economy while 
the manufacturing output of Middle Eastern and Asian economies declined.

Sources of Raw Materials  Some regions of the world continued to 
produce minerals, crops, and other resources as they had done in previous eras. 
Latin America and Africa were important sources of minerals and metals used 
in industrial processes. Cotton from Egypt, South Asia, and the Caribbean was 
grown and exported to Great Britain and other European countries. Southeast 
Asian areas continued to be sources for spices but also for rubber, tin, and 
timber. 
New sources of raw materials were also made possible by the invention 
of the steam ship and steam locomotive. Maritime trade was made faster and 
cheaper due to steam power, and railroads built in interior regions helped to 
access and exploit previously untapped natural resources. Other inventions 
such as the telegraph helped to improve communication across these far flung 
and sometimes remote areas. These and other technological innovations made 
the movement of goods and people easier and cheaper and led to an increase 
in global trade.
Western Europe  Western Europe began to change from a mercantilist 
economic system designed to make a country wealthy through tightly regulated 
trade to a capitalist system in which private companies were freer to pursue 
their own profits. Philosopher and political economist Adam Smith believed 
that the private pursuit of profit would result in general prosperity . 
353 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGE 353While industrialization and capitalism produced great wealth overall, many 
people had hard, short lives. In response to this suffering, many reformers 
argued for changes. One of these was the German philosopher Karl Marx. 
He argued that the working class, whom he called the proletariat, were being 
exploited by the capital class, or bourgeoisie. He called for workers to unite 
and take control of the means of production, a change that would revolutionize 
society.
Social Continuities and Changes
Industrialization caused significant changes to social structures of Western 
Europe and, later, the United States. Prior to industrialization, the population 
of Western Europe was primarily rural and involved in farming. As factories 
were built in urban centers in greater numbers, mainly due to a new steam 
engine design invented by James Watt, agricultural workers soon migrated to 
find employment in these industrial cities. 
Physical Labor  As the Industrial Revolution spread, the need for factory 
labor increased. An industrial working class emerged. Members of this class 
were paid low wages, worked long hours in poor conditions, lived in squalid 
housing, and resided in crowded and polluted parts of the new industrial cities. 
Much of their daily lives revolved around their jobs in the factories. This was 
a change from the agricultural economy of the previous era, when farmers 
and farm laborers could more or less set their own work schedule based on 
the seasons. In response to their working and living conditions, the working 
class formed worker associations, or labor unions, that used labor strikes and 
collective bargaining to win concessions on wages, working conditions, and 
hours from the factory owners.
2Ifice /aEor  Along with the emergence of the industrial working class, 
the Industrial Revolution also changed the size and make-up of the middle class. 
In pre-industrial society, the middle class was often made up of professionals 
such as doctors and lawyers as well as local merchants or shopkeepers. As 
industrialization occurred, while these pre-industrial occupations continued 
to be part of the middle class, other occupations were added to it, including 
the middle-management of factories, banks, insurance companies, shipping 
agents, and, of course, trading companies.

354 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe Wealthy  The Industrial Revolution also transformed social 
hierarchies in the period from 1750 to 1900. Wealthy owners of industrial 
companies who made money from investments rather than from land overtook 
the aristocracy in wealth and prestige. These capitalists soon made up the 
highest of the upper class in industrial societies. 
Gender and Industrialization  The role of women changed significantly 
during the Industrial Revolution. In an agricultural economy, women provided 
labor at critical times during the planting and harvesting season but were rarely 
paid for their labor. In a proto-industrial system, women were able to earn 
some extra money in the manufacturing of textiles. 
Despite these activities, women were still mainly supported by the labor 
and income of their male family members. This pattern began to change with 
the Industrial Revolution. Due to the low wages paid by the factories, all family 
needed to work. Hence, a woman’s income was just as important to the welfare 
of the family as a man’s. Despite the importance of female labor, women were 
often paid less than men for the same work and denied high-wage jobs.
Political Continuities and Changes
As during the Enlightenment, philosophers living through the Industrial 
Revolution era developed new political ideas about the individual and 
government. During the Industrial Revolution, most people had little to no 
formal voice in government such as the right to vote, but they demanded the 
ability to exercise their “natural rights.” Among these were the rights to petition, 
protest, and rebel against their governments. Sometimes these protests were 
based on nationalism and the right of people to choose their own governments. 
However, political movements of the Industrial Revolution were almost 
always connected to the interests of the growing middle and working classes. 
For example, labor leaders advocated formation of international unions so that 
workers in various countries could unite to demand higher wages. But the 
vast majority of the protests were for the right to vote and to end aristocratic 
privileges. A series of uprising throughout European cities in 188, known as 
the Revolution of 188, were a sign of the growing interest in more pluralistic, 
more democratic governments :
• In Paris , protesters called for greater freedom of the press. 
• In Berlin, people wanted a parliament to check the monarch’s power. 
• In cities in Hungary, people demanded freedom from Austrian control. 
People wanted not just general natural rights, but specific rights recognized by 
their government.
Voting Rights  As the number of wealthy capitalists and the middle class 
grew, more frequent calls for greater political participation were made. As 
a result, some political reforms were enacted that included the extension of 
voting rights to city dwellers, non-landowners, and, eventually, to the working 
355 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE IN T HE INDUSTRI AL AGE class. However, the voting franchise was extended to male voters only. 
Women would not gain the right to vote in Western industrial countries until 
the early 20th century. Sometimes voting rights were extended through the 
legislative process, as in Great Britain. However, in other instances, protests 
and revolutions forced governments to enact political reforms. 
One factor in all of these political reforms was the size and influence of the 
middle class. In countries where the middle class was large and economically 
significant, democracy emerged. However, in regions where the middle class 
was small or insignificant, dictatorships remained in place.

The economic changes of industrial capitalism countered the laborer’s vision of social 
equality, citizenship, and independence. As two distinct classes developed, the rich and the 
poor, advocating for equal rights became a movement that spanned the 1th century.
Protections for Workers  Reforms that began in one country often 
spread. For example, Otto V on Bismarck’s social reforms spread throughout 
Europe and eventually the world. All industrializing nations grappled with the 
new challenges that factory life introduced. Among these nations, Germany 
implemented the most comprehensive set of social reforms to protect 
industrial workers. Under the leadership of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, 
Germany started workers’ accident compensation insurance, unemployment 
insurance, and old age pensions for employees. Bismarck was concerned 
that if his government did not address these problems, socialists and more 
radical citizens would demand stronger government action. 
356 WORLD HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITION
Another effect of the expansion of voting rights was the emergence of 
political parties that represented the working class. These “labor parties” 
advocated for minimum wages, shorter work days, paid sick and holiday 
leave, better working conditions, and health and unemployment insurance.

UNIT 5 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  DID OTTOM AN REFORMS  SUCCEE D?
The industrial era was a period of massive political, economic, and 
social upheaval. Historians have argued over how effectively the 
Ottomans adapted to these changes. 
A Long, Slow Decline  Historians in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries, living in a period when Turkish power was low, generally 
viewed the Ottoman Empire as the “sick man of Europe.” Some mark 
its fall as beginning with its failure to conquer 9ienna in 168. In 
his widely used college textbook, $ +istory of the 0odern :orld 
first published in 150, R. R. Palmer stated that the long slide of 
the 1th-century Ottoman Empire put the empire “behind modern 
industrial nations in its scientific, mechanical, material, humanitarian, 
and administrative achievements.” Its reforms did little to stop the 
slide.
Strength Through Reforms  Recent historians, living in a period 
of increasing Turkish influence in the Middle East, have seen more 
vigor in the Ottomans than did previous scholars. They have credited 
1th-century reforms with providing a stable foundation for the 
success of the Republic of Turkey, established in 12. For example, 
the historian Donald Quataert argued that the Ottomans stabilized 
the economy and gave Europeans more confidence to invest in 
railroads, ports, and public utilities. These projects provided a modern 
infrastructure for the empire, although at the loss of some autonomy 
for the Ottoman government.
While acknowledging the difficulties that capitulations caused, 
Suraiya Faroqhi emphasized that “more recent studies prove that 
Ottoman commerce and artisan production were more varied than they 
might appear at first glance.” Justin McCarthy called the changes in 
the Ottoman system “neither small nor cosmetic,” pointing to “human 
rights, a constitution, Christians in high office, a parliament, the 
middle class in charge of the state, and the power of Islam eroded” as 
evidence of progress on multiple fronts. McCarthy further suggested 
that the empire fell not because of lack of successful reforms or the 
failure to modernize but because of the military power of its rivals.
Develop an Argument:  Evaluate the extent to which historical 
evidence supports one of the perspectives on Ottoman reform.

WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  DEVELO P A THESIS
The thesis statement must 1 assert a historically defensible claim, 2 lay 
out a line of reasoning, and  directly address the topic and focus of the 
task.  
Historically Defensible Claim  A  t h e s i s ,  o r  c l a i m ,  i s  a  n o n f a c t u a l  
statement asserted to be true. It is a statement about which people can 
disagree because it requires an explanation or evaluation. A historically 
defensible claim is one that can be supported with sound historical evidence. 
For example, Marx forwarded the claim that the materials and modes of 
production rather than philosophical ideas shape social structures. He used 
examples from history of the influence of changing production methods²
hunter-gatherer, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, and communism²as 
evidence to defend his claim.
Line of Reasoning  A thesis or claim also conveys a line of reasoning for 
the argument that will be used to explain the relationships among pieces of 
evidence. In Marx’s thesis, for example, the line of reasoning is causation  
the modes of production cause the structure of social relations. Other lines of 
reasoning include comparison and continuitychange. Each line of reasoning 
needs to be embedded in a strong thesis statement. Here are two examples:
&omparison thesis statement  Social relations fundamentally differed  
under the production methods of the feudal system and the production 
methods of capitalism.
&ontinuitychange thesis statement  W h i l e  s o c i a l  r e l a t i o n s  c h a n g e d  
as the purposes and modes of production changed, the resulting social 
structures continued to have an underprivileged class, a continuity with 
long-lasting effects. 
Topic and Focus of Task A strong thesis or claim directly addresses 
the topic and focus of the task. It must be limited to the time and geography 
stated in the long essay question. 
Part of the task will be to “evaluate the extent to which . . . . .” In this 
context, “extent” means degree, scale, magnitude, scope, size, or level. To 
determine extent, you need to carefully analyze and evaluate the similarities 
or differences, continuities or changes, or causes and effects, depending on 
the task you are given. Which were most important, significant, influential, 
long-lasting, or in other ways largest in scope" And, just as important, what 
are your reasons and evidence for evaluating the extent as you did? 
/ong (ssay 4uestion Develop an argument that evaluates the extent 
to which the course of state-sponsored industrialization in Egypt under 
Muhammad Ali and in Japan under the Meiji regime between 150 and 
1900 was similar or different. 
 359
7hesis that clearly addresses the topic and tasN  Between 1750 and 
100, the governments of both Muhammad Ali in Egypt and the Meiji 
regime in Japan employed state-sponsored programs of industrialization 
to help them create a European-style military, but a difference in the nature 
and purpose of each program’s products led to significantly differing 
courses. (Note that the word significantly begins to address extent.
Application: Read the following long essay question and a thesis 
statement developed to address it. Evaluate the thesis statement on how 
well it 1 expresses a historically defensible claim, 2 embeds a line of 
reasoning, and  addresses the topic and task, including evaluating extent, 
and stays within the limitations of the question. Revise the thesis statement 
as appropriate so that it meets all three standards.

The position of women in Japan is apparently unlike that of the sex in 
all other parts of the East, and approaches more nearly their European 
condition. The Japanese women are subjected to no jealous seclusion, 
hold a fair station in society, and share in all the innocent recreations of 
their fathers and husbands. The minds of the women are cultivated with 
as much care as those of men; and amongst the most admired Japanese 
historians, moralists, and poets are found several female names. But, 
though permitted thus to enjoy and adorn society, they are, on the other 
hand, >kept in@ complete dependence on their husbands, sons, or other 
relatives. They have no legal rights, and their evidence is not admitted in 
a court . . . At home, the wife is the mistress of the family; but in other 
respects she is treated rather as a toy for her husband’s amusement, than 
as the rational, confidential partner of his life.

When I encountered silk workers I was even more shocked than I had been 
by the situation of weaving workers.… At busy times they go straight to 
work on rising in the morning, and not infrequently work through until 
12:00 at night. The food is six parts barley to four parts rice. The sleeping 
quarters resemble pigsties, so squalid are they. What I found especially 
shocking is that in some districts, when business is slack, the workers are 
sent out into service for a fixed period, with the employer taking all their 
earnings… Many of the girls coming to the silk districts pass through the 
hands of recruiting agents. In some cases they may be there for two to 
three years and never even know the name of the neighboring town. The 
local residents think of those who have entered the ranks of the factory 
girls in the same manner as tea house girls, bordering on degradation.  If 
one had to take pity on just one group among all these workers, it must be 
first and foremost the silk workers.Enrollment in Japanese Primary Schools

de Sagasta, 186.
Every day we see men with unscrewed-on heads who have no love for order 
nor true affection for their families, who spend their lives on gambling and 
rambling around cold-bloodedly, they leave their children on the street, 
because their wives, whose sphere of action is reduced only to love and 
suffering, do not know how to oppose forcefully the squandering nor how 
to stop in time the abuses from their husbands nor save in this way the 
interests of their children. 
Emancipation protects women from this catastrophe. A woman, 
educated in the management of business, even if she does not make a 
profession of it, knows how to prevent or remedy the problem once it 
has occurred. She does not go through the pain of seeing her children 
begging for bread from door to door, because she has a thousand resources 
to satisfy their needs honorably. She goes to work, and thus she raises 
her children without the need for others’ support that could lead her to 
corruption and to spend a miserable and humiliating life. Love can dry 
tears and sweeten the bitterness of life, but it cannot satisfy hunger nor 
cover nakedness. Love cannot be developed on a sublime and heroic level 
unless one is prepared to work, to put sentiment into practice. 
Emancipation, conceding to women great rights, instills in them a 
great heart that takes them closer to the true perfection to which men can 
aspire here on earth. A woman who, to her physical beauty and spirituality, 
adds education and the ability to act for good in her vast sphere, is the 
ideal type imagined by Christianity, and she is going to carry out progress 
in this century.

Industrialization from  
c. 1750 to c. 1900
Understand the Context
Technological change provided the framework for the historical changes 
between 1750 and 1900. Industrial growth fostered a wider exchange of 
commodities, the expansion of overseas empires, and new patterns of migration. 
Imperialism  Competition among industrializing states increased the 
desire for colonies. Some states strengthened control over existing colonies, 
as the British did in India. Empires expanded into new regions, evident in 
the rapid European colonization of Africa. Economic imperialism emerged 
in parts of Latin American and Asia. Europeans used Social Darwinism and 
religious ideologies to justify their control of others. In general, the Portuguese 
and Spanish declined, the British and French and Russia expanded, and the 
United States and Japan emerged as new empires. 
Resistance to Imperialism  In response to imperialism, anticolonial 
movements developed as part of a larger trend of emerging nationalism. 
Resistance to imperialism took many forms, including rebellion, the 
establishment of peripheral states, and religiously influenced responses. These 
movements set the stage for decolonization in the 20th century.
Migration  New means of transportation and the pull of economic 
opportunity spurred long-distance migration and a larger trend of global 
urbanization. Although many people chose to migrate, coerced migration 
was also common, as slavery and indentured servitude continued to play a 
significant role in the global economy. Increased migration changed the 
demographics and cultures of both sending and receiving societies. 17501850 180019001780

RATIONALES FOR IM PERIALISM 367
3676.1
Rationales for Imperialism
Take up the White Man’s Burden—  
Send forth the best ye breed—  
Go bind your sons to exile  
To serve your captives’ need;  
To wait in heavy harness,  
6n fluttered folk and wild·  
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,  
Half-devil and half-child.
—Rudyard Kipling, “The White Man’s Burden,” 1899
Essential Question:   What ideologies contributed to the development of 
imperialism between 1750 and 1900?
Rudyard Kipling was an English writer who spent his youth in British 
colonial India. The speaker in his poem urged the whites of Western countries 
to establish colonies for the good of the “inferior” people of the word. Whether 
Kipling actually supported this idea is not clear, but his poem was used to justify 
it. Proponents justified European colonization using a variety of explanations, 
from a belief in nationalism, a desire for economic wealth, a sense of religious 
duty, and a belief they were biologically superior. These various motives for 
establishing overseas empires—a policy called imperialism —would lead to 
conflicts in Asia and a scramble to colonize Africa. See Topic 6.2.
Nationalist Motives for Imperialism
In Western Europe, revolutions, the rise of nationalism, and the creation of 
nation-states characterized much of the 1800s. With a strong sense of identity 
and loyalty to a state, many world powers boldly asserted authority over other 
territories. Building an empire in Asia or Africa was one way for a country to 
assert its national identity in the global arena. Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, 
and the Netherlands would long possess overseas colonies.
European Nationalism  After losing its American colonies, Britain looked 
for new lands to open to settlement. In 188 the first British settlers arrived in 
the colony of New South Wales on the east coast of the island continent of New 
368 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONHolland²today’s Australia. See Topic 6.2. Britain was also expanding its 
influence in South Asia, gradually taking control of India from the East India 
Company. By 1857 Britain controlled the entire Indian subcontinent. Ceylon 
Sri Lanka, Burma Myanmar, the Malay States which included Singapore, 
and parts of Borneo in Southeast Asia were also under British control.
France compensated for its humiliating defeat by Prussia in the Franco-
Prussian War 180±181 by expanding its overseas territories. It had already 
occupied Algeria in Northern Africa, New Caledonia and other islands in the 
South Pacific, Senegal in Western Africa, and Indochina in Southeast Asia.
Italy and Germany were newly unified states in the late-1th century. 
Each wanted colonies not only for economic and strategic reasons but also 
for prestige. However, neither began acquiring an empire until the mid-1880s.
While Spain had led the quest for colonies in the first wave of imperialism 
during the 16th and 1th centuries, its power was greatly diminished by the 
19th century. It did not play a dominant role in this second wave of imperialism.
Japan in East Asia  Japan asserted its nationalist pride through incursions 
into Korea. This irritated China, a country that had exerted a strong presence 
in .orea for centuries. The conflict grew into the Sino-Japanese War  18±
185. Japan’s victory gave it control of .orea. Japan also seized Taiwan, 
which was known as Formosa  from the time of Portuguese colonization in the

the late 19th and early 20th centuries that encouraged the growth of Japanese

Cultural and Religious Motives for Imperialism
The Kipling quotation that opens this topic epitomized the condescending 
attitudes shared by imperialism’s proponents. Referring to colonized peoples 
as children reflected how colonizers saw themselves as benevolent protectors 
on a “civilizing mission” rather than invaders. 
Racial Ideologies and the Misuse of Science  The attitudes of whites 
toward others were a form of racism. Colonial powers generally believed 
that they were inherently superior to those they subjugated. Pseudoscientists, 
people who present theories as science that are actually incompatible with the 
scientific method, strengthened these attitudes. They claimed to have proof 
of the intellectual and physical inferiority of nonwhite races. Phrenologists , 
people who studied skull sizes and shapes, believed that a smaller skull size 
proved the mental feebleness of Africans, indigenous Americans, and Asians. 
These ideas have been proven false.
Legitimate science was also subverted to support imperialism. British 
scientist Charles Darwin’s  19th-century theory of evolution by natural 
selection stated that over millions of years, biological competition had “weeded 
out” the weaker species in nature and that the “fittest” species were the ones 
that survived. Some thinkers adapted Darwin’s theory of biological evolution 
to society, creating the theory known as Social Darwinism. While Darwin 
369 RATIONALES FOR IM PERIALISMhimself was not a Social Darwinist, advocates used the “survival of the fittest” 
theory to argue that the spread of European and U.S. power proved the 
biological superiority of whites. Writers and politicians then used Social 
Darwinism to justify further imperialism by powerful countries.
Cultural Ideologies  Based on technological superiority over indigenous 
societies, colonial powers felt justified in superimposing aspects of their 
own cultures on their colonies. For administrative purposes, many colonies 
combined into a single colony peoples from several cultures who often spoke 
different languages and had different customs. Colonizers introduced their 
own language, which helped to unify these often diverse colonies. They also 
introduced their political, educational, and religious institutions and exerted 
other cultural influences on architecture and recreational activities. Expressing 
the belief of many, Congregationalist minister Josiah Strong wrote in 1885, “Is 
there room for reasonable doubt that [the Anglo-Saxon] race . . . is destined 
to dispossess many weaker races, assimilate others, and mold the remainder, 
until, in a very true and important sense, it has Anglo-Saxonized mankind?”  
Religious Motives  Missionaries were among the most tireless “civilizing” 
influences. Like the Spanish and Portuguese Catholic missionaries who 
combined conquest and evangelism during the Age of Discovery, British

and Feejee Islands, and Through the Colonies of New Zealand, New South Wales  188.
The image of a New Zealand village reflects how Europeans viewed native village people as simple. 
370 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONProtestant missionaries of the 18th and 19th centuries also participated 
in colonization. Critics charged that missionaries supported imperialism 
by persuading people to give up their traditional beliefs, such as ancestor 
veneration, and adopt the faith of most Europeans, Christianity. This change 
in religion could pave the way for others who were more focused on economic 
gain. In response, missionaries pointed out that they commonly combined 
religious and humanitarian efforts:
• Missionaries often set up schools for instruction in religion that also 
taught secular subjects, which prepared students to become teachers, 
lawyers, and other professionals. 
• Many missionaries provided improved medicines and medical care. 
• Some missionaries, most famously David Livingstone  from Scotland, 
worked in Sub-Saharan Africa to end the illegal slave trade. 
Economic Motives for Imperialism 
Some people believe the ideological motivations were more accurately 
justifications for pursuing economic motives. Seeking ways to maximize 
profits, companies chartered by the British, French, and Dutch governments 
signed commercial treaties with local rulers in India, East Africa, and the East 
Indies. These treaties gave the Europeans the right to establish trading posts and 
forts to protect their interests. Originally, these companies formed primarily 
for the spice trade. Many companies had quasi-governmental powers, raising 
armies and conquering territory to form colonies. 
As the Industrial Revolution transformed European economies, the desire 
for the sources for raw materials and markets for manufactured goods provided 
by colonies enticed imperial powers to increase their expansion. Imperial 
powers often competed with one another over the best potential resources, 
markets, and trade as demands for low-wage labor, access to markets, and 
control of natural resources increased.
East India Company  The English monarch granted the  East India 
Company  EIC a royal charter in 1600 giving it a monopoly on England’s 
trade with India. After driving the Portuguese out of India, the company traded 
primarily in cotton and silk, indigo, and spices. 
Eventually, the EIC expanded its activities from the Persian Gulf to East 
Asia. By the beginning of the 18th century, it had become the major agent of 
British imperialism in India, and after 18 it became the British government’s 
managing agency in India. Starting in 1620, the EIC engaged in the slave trade, 
and during the 19th century it illegally exported opium to China in exchange 
for tea. The East India Company is often referred to as the English East India 
Company or, after 1707, the British East India Company to distinguish it from 
the Dutch East India Company.
371 RATIONALES FOR IM PERIALISMDutch East India Company  In 1602 the Dutch government gave the 
Dutch East India Company  9ereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, or 
VOC  a monopoly on trade between the Cape of Good Hope at the southern 
tip of Africa and the Straits of Magellan at the southern tip of South America. 
The 9OC concentrated on the islands around Java, replacing the Portuguese 
who had controlled the region. Corruption and debt led the government to take 
control of the company’s possessions in 1799, creating the Dutch East Indies 
today’s Indonesia.
The “New Imperialism”  After the Industrial Revolution and the 
Napoleonic Wars, Britain was the leading economic power throughout the 
first half of the 1th century and already had a sizable colonial empire. Its 
colonies provided raw materials such as cotton, wool, jute, vegetable oils, and 
rubber for its factories, as well as foodstuffs such as wheat, tea, coffee, cocoa, 
meat, and butter for its growing cities. Its colonies—especially settler colonies 
such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa—also provided markets for 
British manufactured goods.
As the Second Industrial Revolution progressed, other nations began 
to challenge Britain’s economic lead. They looked to Asia, Africa, and the 
Pacific to expand their markets, provide raw materials for their factories, and 
food for their growing urban populations.Source:  Getty Images

372 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS 
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“The English in India had always been somewhat more detached from the 
indigenous environment than the Dutch in Indonesia. After the 1780s, their 
isolation gradually intensified and became obvious with the decline in status 
of Eurasian Anglo-Indians. . . . The club became the center of British social 
life in India and the other Asian colonies during the 9ictorian era. In clubs, one 
could feel like a gentleman among other gentlemen while being served by a 
native staff. . . . The large clubs of Calcutta remained closed to Indians until 
16. This type of color bar was especially disturbing because it excluded 
from social recognition the very people who had carried their self-Anglicizing 
[becoming more like the British] the furthest and loyally supported British 
rule. . . . 
In most regions of Africa . . . the Europeans saw themselves as foreign 
rulers separated from the African cultures by an abyss. . . . A process of great 
symptomatic significance was the rejection of the highly educated West 
Africans who had worked with the early mission. They had envisioned the 
colonial takeover as an opportunity for a joint European-African effort to 
modernize and civilize Africa. Instead, they were now, as ‘white Negroes,’ 
despised by all.”
Jurgen Osterhammel, Colonialism , 1997

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that 
follows. 
“Gentlemen, we must speak more loudly and more honestly! We must say 
openly that indeed the higher races have a right over the lower races. . . . 
I repeat, that the superior races have a right because they have a duty. 
They have the duty to civilize the inferior races. . . . In the history of 
earlier centuries these duties, gentlemen, have often been misunderstood; 
and certainly when the Spanish soldiers and explorers introduced slavery 
into Central America, they did not fulfill their duty as men of a higher  
race. . . . But, in our time, I maintain that European nations acquit themselves 
with generosity, with grandeur, and with sincerity of this superior civilizing 
duty. I say that French colonial policy, the policy of colonial expansion, the 
policy that has taken us under the Empire [the Second Empire, of Napoleon 
III], to Saigon, to Indochina [French Southeast Asia], that has led us to Tunisia, 
to Madagascar±I say that this policy of colonial expansion was inspired  
by . . . the fact that a navy such as ours cannot do without safe harbors, 
defenses, supply centers on the high seas . . . . Are you unaware of this? Look 
at a map of the world.”

COLONIZATION  OF AFRICA
In 188±1885, in response to Germany’s arrival as a competitive force

Conference to develop some guidelines and agreements for colonizing 
Africa. See Topic 6.2.

REFLECT ON THE TOPIC ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. In one to three paragraphs, explain the part ideologies played in the 
development of imperialism between 1750 and 1900.
STATE E XPANSION 375
6.2
State Expansion
You must singularly insist on their total submission and obedience, avoid 
developing the spirits in the schools, teach students to read and not to reason.
—King Leopold II (1835–1909), Letter to Christian Missionaries, 1883
Essential Question:   By what processes did state power shift in various 
parts of the world between 1750 and 1900?
King Leopold II of Belgium wanted the Belgian government to conquer 
colonies in a large swath of central Africa—the Congo Basin. The government 
was ambivalent, so Leopold established a private colony himself. However, 
the Belgian Parliament found the king’s rule so abusive that in 1908 it took 
control of the region away from him. Similarly, the Dutch government revoked 
the charter of the Dutch East India Company for abusing its power to make 
treaties, build forts, and maintain armed forces in Southeast Asia. While these 
unusual shifts of power were taking place, other European governments, as 
well as the United States, Russia, and Japan, continued territorial expansion 
through conquest and settlement.
Imperialism in Africa
Europe had a long-standing relationship with Africa because of the slave trade. 
Although most European countries had declared the importation of Africans 
as slave labor illegal by the early 1800s, Europeans continued to export guns, 
alcohol, and other manufactured goods to Africa and import African natural 
resources, such as palm oil, gold, and ivory. England desired palm oil in 
particular because it kept the machinery in its textile factories from becoming 
rusty. In the last part of the 19th century, European tastes for African diamonds 
and ivory kept European empires thriving throughout the African continent. 
Connect: Write a paragraph connecting late 1th century imperialism with the 
African slave trade. See Topic ..
Expanding Beyond Trading Posts  For most of the 1800s, European 
presence in Africa was restricted to trading posts, with a few exceptions. The 
French seized Algeria in 1830, declaring they wanted to prevent pirate attacks. 
Dutch immigrants had lived in South Africa since the 1600s and British 
colonists became more numerous starting in the early 1800s. In the second 
376 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONhalf of the 1800s, European nations expanded their presence in Africa with the 
help of better military technology. For example, the discovery of quinine,  a 
medicine that treats the tropical disease malaria, reduced the danger of living 
in warm, humid regions. The steamship assisted the early trips of individual 
explorers and business owners.
British Control of Egypt  Europeans had long dreamed of dramatically 
shortening the water route to Asia by building a canal connecting the Red Sea 
with the Mediterranean Sea. A 100-mile-long canal could save a trip around 
the entire continent of Africa. This feat was finally accomplished in 186 when 
the Suez Canal was completed. A French company managed the project, but 
most of the labor was performed by as many as 1.5 million Egyptians. Many of 
them were corvée laborers,  unpaid workers who were forced to work on the 
project as a form of taxation. Thousands died in the course of ten years. When 
unrest in the region threatened British commercial interests and the operation 
of the canal in 1882, Britain seized control of Egypt away from the Ottoman 
Empire.
British West Africa  Great Britain established several colonies in West 
Africa before the mid-19th century. In these colonies, Britain spread Western 
education, the English language, and Christianity:
• Sierra Leone  was established in 1787. It was a home for freed people 
from throughout the British Empire who had been enslaved. 
• Gambia was established in 1816. It, and Sierra Leone, were used as 
bases to try to stop the export of enslaved people from the region. 
• Lagos became a crown colony in 1861 and served as a base for the 
annexation of much of the rest of what is now Nigeria. 
• Britain acquired parts of what is now Ghana in stages. For example, the 
Gold Coast  became a crown colony in 18, but the Asante Empire to 
the north did not come under British control until 1901.
Britain used both diplomacy and warfare to expand its empire. For 
example, in 1873, Britain signed a treaty with King Jaja of Opobo in present-
day Nigeria—an area rich in  palm oil—recognizing him as ruler and agreeing 
to trade terms favorable to both sides. Other African rulers agreed to similar 
diplomatic treaties with foreign powers, believing they were protecting their 
sovereignty and trade rights. However, as European competition increased for 
control of African lands, the treaties came to be meaningless and warfare was 
the inevitable result as Africans resisted takeover but met with overpowering 
military strength.
The French in Africa  France drove the Ottomans out of Algeria in 1830. 
By 1870 Algeria had become a settler colony , attracting Spanish, Italian, and 
Maltese as well as French immigrants. In the 180s the French also established 
trading posts in Guinea, the Ivory Coast, and Niger to compete with British 
West African colonies.
377 STATE E XPANSION 377The European Scramble for Africa  
Tensions mounted among industrialized European nations as they competed 
for natural resources in Africa. Leaders feared that the “Scramble for Africa,” 
the competing efforts of Europeans to colonize Africa, would lead to war.
Berlin Conference  Unlike many German leaders who had imperial 
ambitions, Otto von Bismarck had little interest in colonies. However, he 
did want to keep peace in Europe. So in 188±1885, he hosted the Berlin 
Conference, a meeting of European powers to provide for the orderly 
colonization of Africa. No Africans were invited to the conference. European 
powers peaceably agreed to colonial boundaries and to the free movement of 
goods on Africa’s major rivers such as the Niger River and the Congo River.
In most of the continent, Europeans established colonial borders that were 
merely artificial lines that meant little to the people who lived within them. 
These borders divided long-unified societies into different colonies and united 
longtime rival groups into the same colonies. When these colonies became 
independent states in the later 20th century, these borders became the cause of 
extensive warfare by making national unity very difficult.
South Africa and the Boer Wars  During the Napoleonic Wars  
1±1815, the British replaced the Dutch in the Cape Colony  in the southern 
tip of Africa. The British introduced the use of English but allowed people to 
use the Dutch language as well. Many of the Dutch-speaking Afrikaners , the 
descendants of 17th-century Dutch settlers, moved east of the Cape Colony, 
where they came into conflict with indigenous groups, including the =ulus, 
with whom they fought several wars.
Throughout the 19th century, the British and Afrikaners continued to 
fight over land. This conflict came to a boil in the Boer Wars  1880±1881, 
18±102. These conflicts were bloody and brutal. In the end, the British 
army drove the Afrikaners and the Africans from their lands, forcing many into 
refugee camps. These settlements, which were segregated by race, came to be 
known as concentration camps . Medical care and sanitation were very poor, 
and food rations were so meager that many of the interned died of starvation. 
Once news arrived in Britain about the wretched conditions of the camps, 
activists tried to improve the lives of displaced refugees. However, while 
white camps received some attention, conditions in black camps remained 
terrible. Of the 100,000 blacks interned in concentration camps, nearly 15,000 
perished. 
By the end of the Boer Wars, the British had absorbed the settler colonies 
of British and Afrikaner peoples and the black Africans in the southern tip of 
Africa into its empire. Millions of Afrikaner and black African farmers had 
been displaced onto poor land, making it hard for them to earn a decent living.  
Congo  By 1875, Western European nations were poised to penetrate 
Africa’s interior. King Leopold II  of Belgium ruled 1865±10 oversaw the 
invasion and pacification of the Congo in central Africa in order to persuade 
the Belgian government to support colonial expansion. Unlike other European 
378 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONrulers, .ing Leopold owned the colony personally, using colonial officials 
against indigenous Congolese and a ruthless system of economic exploitation 
that allowed him to keep the profits made by the Congo Free State , which 
totaled some 220 million francs 1.1 billion in today’s dollars. 
9isitors to the colony reported on the brutal conditions for the laborers who 
were forced to harvest ivory and rubber. For example, Leopold’s agents severed 
the hands of Congolese workers in order to terrorize others into submission. 
Workers who could not meet their quotas were beaten or killed, while others 
were worked to death. Although the term slavery  was not commonly used 
when describing imperial activities, laborers in the Congo often received no 
payment for their backbreaking work, and their spouses were held captive so 
that the workers would not run away. As many as 8 million people perished 
under King Leopold’s reign of terror in the Congo. In 1908, Belgium took over 
control of the Congo as a regular colony, and conditions improved. Connect:

379 STATE E XPANSIONIndependent Countries  By 1900, the only African countries unclaimed 
by Europeans were Abyssinia  modern-day Ethiopia and Liberia,  a country 
founded by formerly enslaved people from the United States. Because 
Liberia had a dependent relationship with the United States, it was not fully 
independent. Italy attempted to conquer Abyssinia in 1895, but the native 
forces were too strong for the Italians.
Imperialism in South Asia
Portugal, France, and England competed for control of India’s spices, gems, 
and trade with regions to the east. Portugal established a coastal trading port 
on the southwestern coast, in Goa, in the early 16th century. However, it 
never extended its control inland. France established trading ports in the 17th 
century. However, its loss to Britain in the global conflict known as the Seven 
Years’ War  156±16 drove the French out of India. 
England’s East India Company  EIC, steadily encroached on the land 
of the weak Mughal Empire. Eventually, Britain controlled the entire Indian 
subcontinent, from Pakistan in the west to Kashmir in the north to Bengal in 
the east to the island of Ceylon  Sri Lanka in the south. At first, the EIC’s 
small forces of British soldiers protected the firm’s employees. As the British 
crept into India’s interior, they began recruiting native Indian soldiers, called 
sepoys, to join the British colonial army. However, as explained in the next 
topic, the sepoys ignited an unsuccessful rebellion against the British in 1857. 
Imperialism in East Asia
China did not experience imperialism in the same way that South Asia or 
Africa did. It maintained its own government throughout a period of European 
economic domination. As a result of superior military strength, European 
nations carved out sSheres oI influence  within China over which they had 
exclusive trading rights and access to natural resources. See Topic 6.5.  
Internal problems within the Qing government, such as the Taiping Rebellion , 
made it easier for foreign countries to dominate the economic affairs of China. 
During the Taiping Rebellion, which began in 1850, failed civil servant 
applicant Hong Xiuquan and starving peasants, workers, and miners attempted 
to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. With the help of some warlords along with 
French and British intervention, the Qings prevailed in 186.
In the midst of the war, adding to China’s internal problems, the Yellow 
River Huang He changed course, flooding farmland in some areas and leaving 
others open to drought. With agricultural lands devastated, famine followed 
during which many Chinese starved to death. Adding to the troubles, the 
bubonic plague broke out at this time. By the end of the fighting, the rebellion 
was probably responsible for the deaths of more than 20 million people, more 
than half of whom were civilians.
Between 1899 and 1901, an anti-imperialist group called the Boxers—
named because many of their members practiced martial arts, which were 
380 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONknown as Chinese boxing—was attacking Chinese Christians and Western 
missionaries. The Empress Dowager Cixi see Topic 5.8 encouraged the 
Boxers and in 1900 ordered that all foreigners be killed. However, most of 
the estimated 100,000 people who were killed were Chinese Christians. Only 
about 200±250 foreigners died during the Boxer Rebellion . The empress and 
the Qing court suffered a humiliating defeat that undermined their legitimacy. 
Western powers and influence continued to erode Chinese sovereignty in 
subsequent years.
Japan  Industrialized countries outside of Europe also desired colonies. 
Japan had sharply limited its contact with other countries since the early 
1600s. In 185, United States Commodore Matthew Perry came to Japan in 
large warships to secure a treaty that opened Japanese ports to trade. In the 
following decade, Japan overthrew its traditional government in an uprising 
called the Meiji Restoration and began to rapidly industrialize, hoping it could 
become strong enough to protect its distinctive culture. As part of this change, 
Japan began to look outward for territorial gains. An island nation with few 
natural resources and little arable land, it sought lands and natural resources to 
fuel its own growth. 
Partly to relieve population pressures in rural areas and partly to gain 
knowledge of foreign places, Japan’s government began to encourage 
agricultural workers to take seasonal contract work on Hawaii, Guam, and 
other locations. Through a  Colonization Society  established in 1893, leaders 
began plans to establish colonies in Mexico and Latin America. Japan set up 
an empire in East Asia that included parts of China, Korea, Southeast Asia, and 
Pacific islands that lasted from the 180s until the end of World War II.
Imperialism in Southeast Asia
Portugal and Spain originally controlled European trade with Southeast Asia. 
After 1600, the power shifted and the English and Dutch supplanted them.
The Dutch in Southeast Asia  Dutch imperialism in Southeast Asia 
began with a private company, just as English imperialism in South Asia had. 
In 161 the Dutch seized control of the Spice Islands now part of Indonesia, 
so called because they produced spices such as cloves and nutmeg that were in 
great demand in Europe. The Dutch East India Company  VOC  took over 
the spice trade from the Portuguese, setting up several trading posts on the 
archipelago. Although the trade was very profitable for the 9OC, corruption 
caused the company to go bankrupt by 1800. Once the 9OC folded, the Dutch 
government itself took control of the Dutch East Indies . By the mid-19th 
century, the islands were producing cash crops to support the Dutch economy.
Plantations produced tea, rubber, and sugar for export purposes, a situation 
that limited rice cultivation and eventually created enormous hardships  for 
Indonesian farmers who relied on rice to survive. Although criticism of this 
agricultural policy forced the Dutch government to implement humanitarian 
reforms, the reforms failed to meet the needs of the Indonesian people.
381 STATE E XPANSIONThe French in Southeast Asia  The French government also wanted an 
imperial presence in Asia. After it defeated China in the Sino-French War of 
188±1885, France gained control of northern 9ietnam. France later pressured 
Siam to cede control of the territory of modern-day Laos to the French. By the 
180s, France controlled Cambodia, Laos, and all of modern-day 9ietnam. 
Together, these nations became known as French  Indochina . French motives 
for imperialism were like those of the Dutch—a desire for cash crops. Soon 
rubber plantations dotted the landscape of Cambodia and 9ietnam.
The British in Southeast Asia  British influence in Southeast Asia began 
when the East India Company acquired the island of Penang off the northwest 
coast of the Malay Peninsula in 186. In 182, the British founded the port of 
Singapore. Chinese immigrants soon made it the most important seaport in 
Southeast Asia. Eventually, Britain controlled all of the Malay Peninsula, 
Burma Myanmar, and northern Borneo. British investors were originally 
attracted by the region’s mineral wealth, especially tin and gold. In addition, 
Britain promoted the planting of cash crops such as pepper, tobacco, palm oil, 
and rubber. By the end of the 19th century, Malaya  was the world’s greatest 
producer of natural rubber.
Siam  Only one Southeast Asian nation, Siam —modern-day Thailand—
managed to escape the clutches of 19th-century European imperialism. Siam’s 
monarchs deftly handled diplomatic relations with the British and French, 
whose colonies bordered Siam. The Siamese government also instituted a 
series of modernizing reforms, similar to 
Japan’s Meiji reforms. The government 
began to industrialize by building 
railroads, and it set up Western-
style schools in order to create an 
educated populace who could 
fill the ranks of an efficient 
government bureaucracy.
Australia and New 
Zealand
After the loss of its American 
colonies, Britain began to 
consider the possibility of 
establishing various kinds of 
settlements in Australia , finally 
deciding to locate a penal 
colony  there. In 188 the first 
convicts, along with some free 
settlers, arrived in Australia, and 
the east coast became known as 
New South Wales. In the 1820s,

On the royal coat of arms for Siam, the kingdom 
was represented by a three-headed elephant.
382 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONBritain took possession of the entire continent. For decades, the chief economic 
activity of the colony was to house convicts. The discovery that Australia was 
well-suited to producing fine wool provided a new industry, and in the 180s 
larger numbers of free settlers began to arrive. The discovery of copper in 182 
and gold in 1851 helped spur growth.
When Britain annexed the settler colony of New Zealand  in 1839, it was 
made a part of New South Wales. Two years later, after the Treaty of Waitangi  
guaranteeing that the rights of the original Maori  inhabitants would be 
protected by the British crown, it became a separate colony. Nevertheless, open 
war broke out as European settlers encroached on Maori lands. The Australian 
gold rushes provided a market for foodstuffs raised by New Zealand farmers, 
both European and Maori. For many years, sheep grazing and dairy farming 
provided the base for the colony’s economy.

During the 19th century, the United States continued taking land from 
indigenous peoples, as Europeans had done since Columbus arrived. One 
notorious episode was the forced relocation of Eastern Woodlands peoples from 
the Southeast to a new Indian Territory  in what is now Oklahoma. So many 
Native Americans died from exposure, malnutrition, disease, and exhaustion 
that this forced migration became known as the Trail of Tears .
In 182, President James Monroe issued the Monroe Doctrine , which 
stated that European nations should not intervene in the affairs of the countries 
in the Western Hemisphere. Implied in the doctrine was a desire to be an 
imperial power in the Americas. This desire played out in the U.S. war with 
Mexico 185±188, through which the United States gained vast territories in 
the Southwest from Mexico.
Expansion on Land  White Americans believed that they had a Manifest 
Destiny ²a natural and inevitable right to expand to the Pacific Ocean. The 
United States bought Alaska from Russia in 186. Two years later, in 186, the 
completion of a transcontinental railway spurred development of the American 
West. As white settlers moved westward to take advantage of offers of free land, 
Native Americans were forced onto reservations. By 1893, the U.S. Bureau of 
the Census declared that the western frontier was now closed.
Expansion Overseas  The United States turned its focus to lands overseas. 
The United States was not a global power for most of the 19th century. The 
Second Industrial Revolution brought newfound prosperity to the young 
republic. Economic considerations, as well as feelings of nationalism and 
cultural superiority, drove Americans’ desire for territorial conquest. A group 
of American planters overthrew Hawaii’s constitutional monarchy in 1895, but 
the islands did not become a U.S. territory until 1900. In the meantime, the U.S. 
victory in the Spanish-American War  in 1898 brought Guam, Cuba, Puerto 
Rico, and the Philippines under U.S. control. President Theodore Roosevelt, a 
proponent of Social Darwinism, was especially eager to expand U.S. influence 
383 STATE E XPANSIONthroughout the Western Hemisphere. The 10 Roosevelt Corollary to the 
Monroe Doctrine stated that if countries in Latin America demonstrated 
“instability,” the United States would intervene. It did several times. For 
example, in 10 Roosevelt sent U.S. troops to occupy a Caribbean island 
nation, the Dominican Republic, until it repaid its foreign debts.

Russian Expansion
Empress Catherine II “the Great” set out to expand the Russian Empire in 
all directions during her reign 162±16, annexing about half of Poland as 
well as territory won from the Ottoman Empire. Her grandson, Alexander I, 
annexed Finland, Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and part of Armenia during 
his reign 1815±1825. 
Beginning in the 10s, Russian merchants sponsored voyages to Alaska. 
In 1808 the Russian-American Company, which was similar to the British and 
Dutch East India companies, established permanent headquarters in Novo-
Arkhangelsk modern-day Sitka. From there they explored the west coast of 
384 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONNorth America. In 1811, they selected the site for a settlement at Fort Ross in 
California. They abandoned Fort Ross in 18 and in 186 sold Alaska to the 
United States, ending Russian plans to make the North Pacific a Russian sea.
Russia continued to push into Central Asia during the 19th century, 
leading to an intense rivalry between the Russian and British empires as they 
competed unsuccessfully for dominance in Afghanistan—a rivalry that came 
to be known as the Great Game . Russia also succeeded in annexing lands 
from China, most notably a large portion of Manchuria.

Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“The American continents, by the free and independent condition which they 
have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for 
future colonization by any European powers. . . .
We should consider any attempt on their [Europeans’] part to extend their 
system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. 
With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power we have 
not interfered and shall not interfere. But with the Governments who have 
declared their independence and maintain it, and whose independence we 
have, on great consideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could 
not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in 
any other manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light than 
as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States.”

—Túpac Amaru II, c. 1780
Essential Question:   How and why did internal and e_ternal factors influence 
state building between 1750 and 1900?
In response to European imperialism, nationalist movements emerged 
throughout South America, Africa, and Asia. Often the movements’ leaders, 
such as T~pac Amaru II in Peru, had European style educations. Many had 
developed a deep understanding of such Enlightenment ideals as natural 
rights, sovereignty, and nationalism. Some worked in official posts in colonial 
government. Some colonial elites used the education that imperialism provided 
them to drive out their conquerors in the 20th century. Anti-imperial resistance 
often created new states. 
Nationalist Movements in the Balkans
At its most powerful, the Ottoman Empire stretched deep into Europe. However, 
by the early 19th century, it was losing its hold on its remaining European 
territories in the Balkan Peninsula . Inspired by the French Revolution, ethnic 
nationalism emerged as the peoples of the Balkans sought independence. The 
growing ethnic tensions in the region set the stage for World War I.
Serbia 1815 and Greece 182 won independence only after long wars. 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Bulgaria all rebelled against 
Ottoman rule. In 1877, Serbia and Russia came to their aid in what was to be 
the last and most important Russo-Turkish War. After the war ended in 1878, 
the Treaty of Berlin freed Bulgaria, Romania, and Montenegro but placed 
Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Austria-Hungary.
389 INDIGENOUS RESPONSES TO STATE E XPANSIONResistance and Rebellion in the Americas
In North America, following the British victory over the French in the French 
and Indian War, the British issued the Proclamation of 1763.  This act reserved 
all the land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River for 
Native Americans²the first time a European government had recognized the 
territorial rights of indigenous peoples. However, the British colonists resented 
this interference in colonial affairs. After winning independence, citizens of the 
new United States soon overran the Ohio and Illinois river valleys, displacing 
Native Americans.
Cherokee Nation  After 1800, the Cherokee assimilated to white settler 
culture, adopting colonial methods of farming, weaving, and building. They 
developed a syllabic alphabet for writing their language. Within a short time, 
almost the entire tribe was literate, and the Cherokee Phoenix  became the 
first Native American newspaper in the United States. The Cherokee nation  
adopted a constitution based on the U.S. Constitution. 
But assimilation did not save the Cherokee from white Americans’ greed. 
After the discovery of gold in 1829 on Cherokee land in Georgia, attempts 
began to force the Cherokee off their land. After Congress passed the Indian 
Removal Act  of 1830, the Cherokee and other Southeast Native American 
tribes were forced to relocate to what is now Oklahoma. U.S. expansionism 
continued, affecting many Native American peoples.
Ghost Dance  In the northwestern United States around 186, prophet-
dreamers among the Northern Paiute Indians announced that the dead would 
soon come back and drive out the whites, restoring the lands and traditions of 
Native Americans. The Ghost Dance  rituals of dances and songs were meant 
to hasten this event. The Ghost Dance spread from the Sierra Nevada to the 
Missouri River and from northern Texas to the Canadian border. It reached the 
Sioux by 1890, coinciding with the Sioux revolts. Sioux warriors wore “ghost 
shirts.” However, the Ghost Dance resistance movement fell at the Wounded 
.nee Massacre in 180, marking the end of the Indian Wars.
Túpac Amaru II  José Gabriel Condorcanqui was a cacique  hereditary 
chief in southern Peru. He was descended from the last Inca ruler, T~pac 
Amaru, and took the name Túpac Amaru II . Born around 10, he continued 
to identify with his Inca heritage in spite of having received a formal Jesuit 
education. In 1780 he arrested and executed a colonial administrator, charging 
him with cruelty. This action led to the last general Indian revolt against Spain, 
which at first was supported by some criollos  Spaniards born in America. The 
revolt spread throughout southern Peru and into Bolivia and Argentina before 
T~pac Amaru II and his family were captured in March 181. They were taken 
to Cuzco, the former capital of the Inca empire. There Túpac Amaru II was 
forced to watch as his wife and sons were executed before he was tortured and 
executed himself.
390 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONFrench Intervention in Mexico  In 186 a group of Mexican conservatives 
conspired with Emperor Napoleon III of France to overthrow the liberal 
government of Benito Juárez , a full-blooded =apotec. Mexico owned France 
money, and Napoleon III wanted to further his imperialist ambitions. He 
offered to make a European noble, Archduke Maximilian, the emperor of 
Mexico. Maximilian was crowned on June 10, 186. After three more years of 
war, Mexicans forced the French to withdraw from Mexico. Maximilian was 
executed on June 1, 186, and Juirez resumed the presidency.
South Asian Movements
By the mid-19th century, sepoys,  Indian soldiers under British employ, made up 
the majority of the British armed forces in colonial India. Most were Hindus or 
Muslims. In 185, the British began using rifle cartridges that had been greased 
with a mixture of the fat of cows and pigs. Hindus, who view the cow as sacred, 
and Muslims, who refuse to slaughter pigs, were both furious. Both were 
convinced that the British were trying to convert them to Christianity. Their 
violent uprising, known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 or the Sepoy Mutiny, 
spread throughout cities in northern India. The British crushed the rebellion, 
killing thousands, but the event marked the emergence of Indian nationalism.
After the Indian Rebellion, Britain also exiled the Mughal emperor for his 
involvement in the rebellion and ended the Mughal Empire. In its place, the 
British government took a more active role in ruling India. From 1858 until 
India won independence in 1, the British Raj, the colonial government, 
took its orders directly from the British government in London.
Under the Raj, many Indians attended British universities. In 1885, several 
British-educated Indians established the Indian National Congress. Though 
begun as a forum for airing grievances to the colonial government, it quickly 
began to call for self-rule. Connect: Compare the motives and outcomes of the 
Haitian Revolution with those of the Indian Rebellion of 185. See Topic 5.2.

The first meeting of the Indian National Congress in 1885 was dominated by 
Hindu representatives. As a result, many Indian Muslims were suspicious of it.
391 INDIGENOUS RESPONSES TO STATE E XPANSIONSoutheast Asian Resistance
By the 1880s, the only independent country remaining in Southeast Asia was 
Siam Thailand. The rest of the region was under the control of the Spanish, 
Dutch, British, and French.
Vietnam  From the beginning of French colonialism in the region, many 
9ietnamese resisted. By 188, when 12-year-old Ham Nghi became emperor, 
his top advisers were vocal critics of the French. The French soon tried to 
assert their control by raiding the royal palace, but the young emperor had been 
removed for safety. Ham Nghi’s supporters continued to resist French rule until 
he was captured in 1888 and exiled to Algeria. The resistance continued until 
1895 under Phan Dinh Phung, who became a hero to future revolutionaries in 
the 9ietnamese resistance movement.
Philippine Resistance  The Philippines  came under Spanish control in 
the 16th century, but there was no public education there until 186. However, 
wealthy Filipinos sent their sons to Europe to study. One of those young 
men, José Rizal , started a reform movement called Liga Filipina Philippine 
League in 182. Though the Liga was loyal to Spain, the Spanish feared 
it. They promptly arrested and executed Rizal, an action that shocked many 
Filipinos.
There had been numerous rebellions throughout the history of Spanish rule, 
but now, for the first time, Filipinos had nationalist ambitions and the education 
needed to carry them out. In 186 several revolts broke out in provinces around 
Manila, marking the beginning of the Philippine Revolution . The Spanish-
American War  broke out in 1898, and after a decisive American victory in the 
Battle of Manila Bay, exiled Filipino revolutionaries returned. Based on U.S.  
sympathy for Philippine independence, the rebels expected freedom.
However, the Treaty of Paris  ending the war merely transferred control 
of the Philippines from Spain to the United States. By the time the treaty was 
ratified in February 18, hostilities had broken out in what was to be known 
as the Philippine-American War . The war ended in a U.S. victory in 1902. An 
estimated 20,000 Filipino troops were killed, and more than 200,000 civilians 
died as a result of the war. Of the ,00 Americans who lost their lives, nearly 
two-thirds of them died of disease. Organized resistance continued until 106, 
but the Philippines remained a U.S. possession until 16. 
Resistance in Australia and New Zealand
The Aboriginal  people have been in Australia for an estimated 50,000 years 
and have the oldest continuous culture on Earth. At the time of European 
settlement, there may have been as many as 1 million people in 500 clans, 
speaking 700 languages. 
Australia  In 1788, the British began sending convicts and soldiers to 
establish colonies in New South Wales. The government instructed the settlers  
392 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONto treat the indigenous inhabitants kindly. However, the colonial government 
did not recognize indigenous land ownership. Further, because the indigenous 
inhabitants were not considered British subjects, they were not protected by 
law. Thousands of Aboriginal people were killed as they tried to defend their 
territory and resources from European settlers.
New Zealand  Compared to the Aboriginals in Australia, New Zealand’s 
Maori  were newcomers, having arrived from Polynesia in the 1th century. 
Under the 180 Treaty of Waitangi , Britain had promised to protect the 
property rights of the Maori. Within a short time, the Maori became alarmed 
by British settlement patterns, and the first of a series of Maori Wars broke 
out. The British were eventually able to overcome the Maori in 186. Relations 
deteriorated again in the 1850s as the Maori became reluctant to sell more 
land to settlers, fearing for their future. Ignoring the promise of the Treaty 
of Waitangi, the government attempted to pressure the Maori to sell land, 
sending troops in 1861 to dislodge the Maori from the property in question. 
Another decade of fighting ensued. The war ended in an uneasy peace in 
182, but by 100 the Maori had lost most of their land.
African Resistance
Organized African resistance to imperialism developed later than Indian 
resistance. One reason for this difference in timing is that European powers 
had been in India much longer than they had been in Africa. In addition, British 
colonial governments in India were partially run by Indians, while colonial 
governments in Africa were largely run by military officials from Europe. 
However, by the end of the World War I 11±118, Western-educated 
Africans had a shared identity and nationalism known as Pan-Africanism .
Sokoto Caliphate  In West Africa in the 18th century, rulers often mixed 
Islamic and traditional religious practices. In 180, a group of Muslim 
intellectuals led by Usman dan Fodio  15±181 started a drive to purify 
Islam among the Hausa tribes of the region. He created a caliphate with its 
seat at the new town of Sokoto. The Sokoto Caliphate  established the slave 
trade as a means of economic growth at a time when the British were trying 
to stop it. The British navy attempted to intercept the ships of the Sokoto 
Caliphate, free the enslaved people, and relocate them in their colony Sierra 
Leone. The Sokoto Caliphate was the largest African empire since the 16th 
century. It was finally subdued in 10 when the British made it part of their 
colony of Nigeria.
South Africa  From 1811 to 1858, the British fought the native Xhosa  
people, who did not want to be ruled by Europeans, whether Dutch or English. 
In 1856±185, in the region east of the Cape Colony, some of the cattle of 
the local Xhosa were getting sick and dying, perhaps from diseases caught 
from the cattle of the British settlers. The Xhosa began to kill their cattle 
and destroy their crops in the belief that these actions would cause spirits to 
remove the British settlers from their lands. Some 00,000 head of ;hosa 
393 INDIGENOUS RESPONSES TO STATE E XPANSIONcattle may have been killed. The immediate result of the Xhosa Cattle Killing 
Movement  was famine and the deaths of thousands of people. However, the 
British were not driven out of the area.
In the 1870s, the British fought the Zulu Kingdom, located on the South 
African coast of the Indian Ocean, which had become a well-organized and 
centralized state. At first, this Anglo-Zulu War went in favor of the Zulus, but 
eventually the British defeated them, and their lands became part of the British 
colony of South Africa.
Samory Touré’s War  In West Africa in 1868, Mande chieftain Samory 
Touré  180±100 led a group of warriors to establish a powerful kingdom in 
Guinea, extending it until the early 1880s. He opposed French attempts to 
annex West Africa, first fighting them in 188. The French finally succeeded 
but offered Samory their protection. When he was unable to extend his 
kingdom to the east, he again went to war with the French in 1891. After his 
forces were ejected, he tried to reestablish his kingdom in the upper Ivory 
Coast. The French finally captured him in 188 and sent him into exile.

394 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMahdist Revolt  In East Africa in 1881, a Sudanese Islamic cleric, 
Muhammad Ahmad  18±1885, declared himself the Mahdi , or “guided 
one,” who would restore the glory of Islam. The Sudanese had resented 
Egyptian rule for decades, and the arrival of the British in 1873 only fueled 
their resentment. Ahmad turned the political movement into a religious one, 
forming an army to fight against Egypt. By 1882, the Mahdist army had taken 
control of the area around the capital, Khartoum. The next year, a joint British-
Egyptian military expedition launched a counterattack against the Mahdists. 
The Mahdists finally overran the British-Egyptian forces in January 1885. 
After Ahmad’s death in June of that year, the Mahdist movement disintegrated, 
weakened by infighting among rival leaders. The British returned to Sudan  in 
186, and finally defeated the Mahdists in September 188.
Yaa Asantewaa War  Beginning in 1823, the British made several attempts 
to subjugate the Asante Empire  in present-day Ghana in West Africa. The first 
four were unsuccessful. The fifth and final war is known as the Yaa Asantewaa 
War or the War of the Golden Stool. It began in March 100, when the British 
governor of the Gold Coast demanded the Golden Stool, a symbol of national 
unity. Yaa Asantewaa  180±121, a mighty warrior queen, led a rebellion 
against the British. It was the last African war led by a woman, and it resulted 
in the deaths of 2,000 Asante and 1,000 British. The death toll was higher 
than in the first four wars combined. The war ended in September 100 with 
a British victory. Yaa Asantewaa was exiled, and Asante as Ashanti became 
part of the Gold Coast colony.

SOURCES
Perspective, or point of view, is a powerful filter of experience. Historical 
accounts from varying perspectives require historians to understand 
the significance of the point of view and use that understanding to 
determine how useful a source is, and for what purpose. For example, 
firsthand indigenous responses to state expansion between 150 
and 1900 provide historians with a perspective of the people whose 
lands and cultures were being taken over. At the same time, accounts 
of colonization solely through the lens of the colonizers would also 
provide a limited perspective. As the final word on what happened, each 
type of source has limitations. For this reason, historians are able to 
present a more accurate picture of the past when they examine sources 
with varying points of views and appreciate the significance of those 
perspectives.

Global Economic Development
Peruvian guano [bird droppings] has become so desirable an article to the 
agricultural interest of the United States that it is the duty of the Government 
to employ all the means properly in its power for the purpose of causing that 
article to be imported into the country at a reasonable price. 
—U.S. President Millard Fillmore, December 2, 1850
Essential Question:   How did environmental factors contribute to the global 
economy between 1750 and 1900?
Economics was among the most influential of the several motives driving 
imperialism. Britain industrialized rapidly during the 1700s and 1800s. In 
order to feed industries’ desires for raw materials, such as cotton, copper, 
and rubber, Europe looked to Asia and Africa. American agriculture, as 
noted by President Fillmore, looked to South America for fertilizer. The 
people of these continents were also potential consumers of European 
and American manufactured goods. Finally, colonial peoples provided 
the labor for large-scale projects, such as building railroads or telegraph 
lines. Colonial workers were paid meager wages for difficult and dangerous 
labor. In short, natural resources, new markets, and low-wage labor drove 
economic imperialism.
Technological Developments
The Industrial Revolution did not just take place in factories. It affected 
transportation and communication as well. 
Railroads  Before the introduction of railroads , transportation from the 
interiors of colonies to coastal ports was by water or by roads. Most colonies 
had few roads, and those that existed were usually poorly maintained and 
often unusable during rainy seasons. Transportation by water was limited to 
coastal areas and river basins. The introduction of railroads lowered the cost of 
transporting raw materials for shipment to Europe. At the same time, railroads 
helped open up colonial markets for manufactured goods.
Europeans often pointed to their railroad projects as evidence that 
imperialism helped the peoples of Asia and Africa. However, providing new 
transportation technology to the colonies primarily served the interests of the 
399 GLOBAL ECONOMIC DE=ELOPMENTcolonizers. In India, the British built a complex railway network that stretched 
from the interior to the coasts in order to ship raw materials out of the country 
easily.
British-born Cecil Rhodes 185±102, founder of De Beers Diamonds, 
was an especially enthusiastic investor in a railroad project that was to stretch 
from Cape Town, in the Cape Colony of South Africa, to Cairo, Egypt. 
Connecting all of the British-held colonies with a transportation network could 
make governance easier and aid in mobilizing for war, if necessary. The project 
was never completed because Britain never gained control over all the land 
on which it was to be built. The overwhelming majority of railway workers 
in Africa were natives who were paid far lower wages than their European 
counterparts. Thus, railroad technology was a means of extracting as many 
resources as possible from subject lands while paying colonial laborers as little 
as possible.
Steamships  Because they required huge quantities of coal as fuel, early 
steamships  could travel only limited distances. However, steamboats could 
transport people, mail, and goods on navigable rivers such as the Ganges in 
South Asia and the Congo in Africa. After the development of more efficient 
steam engines in 1870, steamships became practical for long distances. In 
the 1870s, the development of compression refrigeration equipment made it 
possible to ship perishables such as meat and dairy products across oceans. 
Telegraph  Invented in 1832, the electric telegraph  transformed 
communications. Instead of taking days, weeks, or even months, news could 
travel instantaneously. Telegraph service was introduced in India in 1850, just 
five years after it started in Britain. Telegraph lines often followed railroad 
routes. Submarine underwater telegraph cables soon crossed oceans. In 1866 
the first permanent transatlantic cable was laid between the United States and 
England. Telegraph service between England and Australia was introduced 
in 182, and in 18 service between Portugal and Brazil allowed instant 
communication between Europe and South America.
Agricultural Products
When Europeans arrived in Asia and Africa, they found mainly agricultural 
economies, with most people raising enough food to live on—subsistence 
farming—with perhaps a little left over to sell. Subsistence farming is still 
common throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of Latin 
America. Under control of imperialist powers, subsistence farmers abandoned 
their traditional ways and grew cash crops  instead. These were crops such 
as tea, cotton, sugar, oil palms, rubber, and coffee that were grown for their 
commercial value rather than for use by those who grew them. Imperial 
demands for cash crops had a damaging effect on subject nations. As cash 
crops replaced food crops, food prices rose.
400 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe growing European middle classes created a demand for meat. Cattle 
ranches in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay produced beef for export. Sheep 
herders in Australia and New Zealand exported lamb and mutton. New 
technology allowed meat to be shipped over long distances. Meat could 
be processed and canned in packing plants or shipped fresh or frozen in 
refrigerated steamships.
Guano , bat and seabird excrement, is rich in nitrates and phosphates. 
These make it an excellent natural fertilizer. Because of the dry climate in Peru 
and Chile, vast quantities of guano had accumulated before people began 
mining it in the 1th century. Between 180 and 1880, millions of tons of 
guano were dug by hand and loaded onto ships for export, often by indentured 
Chinese or Polynesian laborers.

401 GLOBAL ECONOMIC DE=ELOPMENTRaw Materials
The demand for raw materials that could be processed into manufactured 
goods and shipped away—often back to the providers of raw materials—
turned colonies into export economies.  Imperial attention focused on the 
tropical climates that were conducive to the presence of raw materials, unlike 
some imperial countries.
Cotton  Britain’s Parliament banned Indian cotton  textiles in 1721 
because they competed with the native wool industry. Soon after, cotton from 
Britain’s southern colonies in America shifted production. The colonies would 
provide the raw materials, and England would manufacture textiles. During 
the Industrial Revolution, Britain’s great textile mills got 80 percent of their 
cotton from the United States.
When the American Civil War erupted, northern warships blockaded 
Confederate ports, cutting off the supply of cotton. As a result, farmers all 
over the world, from Australia to the West Indies, replaced food production 
with cotton to make up for the shortage. Cotton farmers in India were able 
to benefit from the shortages caused by the Civil War, but Egypt benefited 
most. Egypt had already developed a fine long-staple variety of cotton and 
ramped up production. By the end of the 19th century, 93 percent of Egypt’s 
export revenue came from cotton. Raw cotton production from Egypt and 
India supported the manufacturing of textiles that Britain exported all over the 
world.
Rubber  Natural rubber  is made from the latex sap of trees or vines. 
It softens when warm and hardens when cold. In 1839, Charles Goodyear 
developed a process known as vulcanization that eliminated these problems 
and helped create the modern rubber industry. Rubber was used to produce 
tires for bicycles and eventually automobiles, hoses, gaskets, waterproof 
clothing, and shoe soles, among other items.
Rubber trees are native to the Amazon rainforest of South America, where 
they grew wild but widely dispersed. Latex could also be extracted from vines 
native to Central Africa, though they were destroyed in the process. Each source 
provided about half the world’s rubber supply, but they soon were inadequate 
to meet the demand as rubber became an important industrial material. In both 
sources, “rubber barons” forced indigenous people into virtual slavery. In some 
cases, companies mutilated or killed workers who failed to meet their quotas.
In 186, the British India Office obtained rubber tree seeds from Brazil. 
After being propagated in England, the seedlings were sent to Ceylon Sri 
Lanka and Singapore. Before long, thousands of acres of forest were cleared 
to make room for rubber plantations in Malaya, Indochina, the Dutch East 
Indies, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
Palm Oil  The machinery in Europe’s factories required constant 
lubrication to keep it working, creating a demand for palm oil , which was 
402 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONalso used for candle making. The oil palm originated in West Africa, where it 
was used as a staple food product for 5,000 years. Palm oil was so valued that 
it was used in place of money in many African cultures. Palm oil became an 
important cash crop in West Africa, where prisoners of tribal war were often 
enslaved to help with the palm oil crops. European colonists established oil 
palm plantations in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.
Ivory  The tusks of elephants provide the product ivory . Most of the ivory 
trade was with Africa, since both male and female African elephants have large 
tusks, which average six feet in length. Ivory was prized for its beauty and 
durability. It was used primarily for piano keys, billiard balls, knife handles, 
and ornamental carvings. In the mid-19th century, the European scramble for 
ivory preceded the scramble for colonies. The Ivory Coast C{te d’Ivoire got 
its name from the fact that the French originally set up trading posts there for 
the acquisition of ivory and the purchase of enslaved people.
Minerals  Some of the most valuable products were mineral ores used in 
manufacturing. They came from around the world:
• Mexico produced silver. 
• Chile produced copper , which was used for telegraph cables and 
electrical power lines. 
• Northern Rhodesia now =ambia and the Belgian Congo produced 
copper. 
• Bolivia, Nigeria, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies produced tin, 
which helped meet the growing demand for food products in tin cans.
• Australia and South Africa, as well as parts of West Africa and Alaska, 
produced large deposits of gold.
Diamonds  Because of his frail health, Cecil Rhodes was sent to South 
Africa in 1870 to join a brother on a cotton farm. In 1871 the brothers joined 
the diamond  rush and went to Kimberley, the center of mining activity. After 
completing a degree at Oxford University, Rhodes acquired some of the De 
Beers mining claims and formed the De Beers Mining Company  in 1880. By 
1891, De Beers accounted for 90 percent of the world’s diamond production. 
Rhodes also had a large stake in the world’s largest gold fields, which were 
discovered in 1886 on South Africa’s Witwatersrand. Connect: Analyze 
Africa’s changes in trade from the trans-Saharan trade, including the effects of 
the slave trade, through the industrial era. See Topics 2. and ..
By the age of 29, when Rhodes was elected to the Cape Parliament, he 
was the most powerful man in Southern Africa. He sought to expand to the 
north, into Bechuanaland Botswana and what became known as Rhodesia 
and is now Zimbabwe and Zambia, with the dream of building a railroad from 
Cape Town to Cairo—and claiming all the land along the route for the British 
Empire. In 1890, Rhodes became the prime minister of the Cape Colony where 
his racist policies paved the way for the apartheid , or racial segregation, that 
plagued South Africa during the 20th century.
403 GLOBAL ECONOMIC DE=ELOPMENTGlobal Consequences
Industrialization was accompanied by the need to find raw materials that could 
be turned into finished products to be sold globally²often bought with the 
profits from raw materials. As urban populations grew, the demand for food 
was increasingly met by imports made possible by new technology such as 
refrigeration. As the industrialized nations grew wealthier, stock exchanges 
developed, allowing more people to invest their capital, and the need to protect 
global markets and investments grew rapidly.
Consequences of Commercial Extraction  Farmers were allowed to 
raise only cash crops, such as sugar, cocoa, or groundnuts, at the expense of 
other agricultural products. This use of land led to monocultures,  or a lack 
of agricultural diversity, particularly in developing nations. Large areas were 
often cleared of forests to make room for farming, which took its toll on both 
biodiversity and the climate. Cash crops such as cotton rapidly depleted the 
soul’s natural fertility. Moreover, crop diseases and pests spread more easily 
when there was only one crop planted in an area. 
Today, many former colonies have been unable to rediversify their land 
use because the development of monocultures has badly damaged croplands. 
As a result, they often must import basic agricultural goods in order to feed 
their people.

“Fermented drinks such as alcohol also have the benefits of killing parasites

production was eating up nearly half of the wheat harvest in Britain. There was 
no possible way for Britain’s domestic agriculture to feed the rapidly expanding 
population and keep them in beer, too. There just wasn’t enough farmland for 
every new mouth in the industrial era. Calories had to come from an outside

Economic Imperialism
Let us ask, where is your conscience? I have heard that the smoking of opium 
is very strictly forbidden by your country; that is because the harm caused by 
opium is clearly understood. Since it is not permitted to do harm to your own 
country, then even less should you let it be passed on to the harm of other 
countries – how much less to China! 
—Lin Zexu, Chinese Commissioner in Canton,  
letter to British Queen Victoria, January 15, 1840
Essential Question:   What economic factors contributed to the imperialism 
in the global economy between 1750 and 1900? 
For centuries, India was the world’s leading supplier of finished cotton 
textiles. By the late 18th century, the Industrial Revolution and a new source of 
cotton from America had allowed Britain to flood the market with inexpensive 
textiles, pushing independent Indian textile artisans out of business. By the 
late 19th century, India was producing only raw cotton for Britain, not cotton 
textiles. After Britain’s textile factories processed India’s cotton, the colonial 
government sold some of its factory-made or “finished” textiles back to the 
Indian subcontinent at inflated prices.
Another critical raw material for Britain was the drug opium. The poppies 
from which it is obtained grew easily on South Asia’s fertile lands, and selling 
it to the Chinese became very profitable for Britain. The Chinese, as Lin =exu 
expressed in the letter to Queen 9ictoria, objected to the export of opium to 
their country, and the conflict resulted in the first Opium War. The Chinese 
paid a heavy price for their attempt to curtail the opium trade and ended up 
losing much trading independence.
The Rise of Economic Imperialism
The agricultural influence and power of raw materials shifted away from Asia 
and Latin America to industrialized states such as Britain, the United States, 
France, Japan, and Germany between the late 19th century and the beginning 
of the 20th century. Economic imperialism , a situation in which foreign 
business interests have great economic power or influence, developed as 
businesses took advantage of natural resources beyond their borders. People, 
raw materials, and refined materials were the main resources exploited. Cash 
crops and mineral resources were produced on a large scale. As in the colonial 
408 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONera of the 15th to the 18th centuries, colonial powers served their own economic 
interests by turning colonies into export economies that produced goods not for 
domestic use but to be sent to colonial powers to sell for profit. 
Economic Imperialism in Asia
England’s defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 created an opening for the 
British and Dutch to take over the spice trade in Asia from the Spanish and 
Portuguese, who formerly had a monopoly on it.
India  The English East India Company  formed in 1600 to engage in the 
lucrative spice trade. However, the company soon ran into opposition from the 
Dutch. By the mid-1600s cotton and silk textiles from India had replaced spices 
as the East India Company’s major import, and by the 1700s the company 
dominated the world textile trade. Indian weavers learned to create fabrics with 
patterns that would appeal to European tastes. With the Industrial Revolution, 
India began supplying raw cotton to the textile mills of Britain, and the demand 
for finished Indian textiles decreased.
Dutch East Indies  The Dutch East India Company  had a monopoly on 
trade with the Dutch East Indies in present-day Indonesia, where the Spice 
Islands  were located. By the second half of the 18th century, it had switched its 
focus from shipping to agricultural production. The Dutch government revoked 
the company’s charter in 1799 and took direct control of the Dutch East Indies. 
In 1830, the Dutch government introduced the Culture System , which forced 
farmers to choose between growing cash crops for export or performing corvée 
labor , compulsory unpaid work. Under this system, villagers either had to set 
aside one-fifth of their rice fields for such export crops as sugar, coffee, or 
indigo, or work in a government field for 66 days if they had no land. If the 
crops failed, the villagers were held responsible for the loss. The practice was 
finally abolished in 180.
China  Chinese goods such as porcelain, silk, and tea were in great demand 
in Great Britain. However, the Chinese were not interested in British goods, 
and in this trade imbalance, British silver reserves became very low. To make 
up for this shortfall, the East India Company began forcing farmers in India 
to grow opium , an addictive drug that also relieves pain and reduces stress. 
The company then sold it for silver in China, where millions of people became 
addicted to the illegal drug. The company then used its profits to buy tea and 
other goods.
The Chinese emperor criminalized the use of opium in 1729. However, the 
ban had little effect. The Chinese objection to the importation of this drug led to 
the first Opium War 18±182. The Chinese government seized the British 
opium warehoused in the port of Canton Guangzhou. War broke out when 
British warships destroyed a Chinese blockade keeping ships from Canton, 
the only port China allowed to trade with foreigners. The British attacked 
and occupied Canton and engaged in several other successful battles, finally 
capturing Nanking Nanjing. 
409 ECONOMIC IM PERIALISM 409The conflict between Britain and China revealed the fate of nonindustrialized 
nations. China had not anticipated the power that industrialized nations were 
gaining or the shift in the balance of power that was taking place. Industrialized 
nations in Europe would begin to dominate and defeat states that lacked the 
military technology needed to stand against British steamships and weaponry.
The resulting Treaty of Nanking  required China to open up four additional 
ports to foreigners, cede the island of Hong Kong to Britain, and pay damages. 
It also forced the Chinese to allow free trade, which the British took to include 
trade in opium.
Neither Britain nor China was completely satisfied with the Treaty of 
Nanking. The British wanted the use of opium legalized, while the Chinese 
were unhappy about the concessions they had been forced to make. Hostilities 
erupted in October 1856 after Chinese officers boarded a British trading ship, 
searched it, lowered the flag, and arrested some Chinese sailors. The French 
joined the British in what came to be known as the second Opium War 1856±
1860. The Treaty of Tientsin Tianjin following that war allowed foreign 
envoys to reside in Beijing, opened several new ports to Western trade and 
residence, and allowed freedom of movement for Christian missionaries. After 
additional negotiations, opium was legalized, and China ceded to Britain the 
southern portion of Kowloon Peninsula, which was adjacent to Hong Kong. 
Connect: Compare how Western states and the Qing Dynasty treated the 
Chinese population. See Topic ..
SSheres oI ,nfluence Japan, France, Germany, Russia, and the United 
States sought the same trading privileges that Britain attained after winning 
the Opium Wars. By the end of the century, these nations began forcing China 
to give them exclusive trading rights in areas known as sSheres oI influence . 
It was at this time that the Open Door policy, proposed by the United States, 
allowed for a system of trade in China to be open to all countries equally in 
order to keep any one power from total control of China. See the map on the

Economic Imperialism in Africa
Before colonization, most farming in Africa was to raise food crops. After 
colonization, land that had been devoted to growing food was converted to 
cash crop production to provide raw materials for European industries and 
goods for European markets. In exchange, the Africans received cotton textiles, 
canned food, and alcoholic beverages. This unequal trade structure made the 
colonies economically dependent on the imperial powers.
Reliance on a single cash crop, one grown to be sold, in a country or 
region left many Africans vulnerable during periods of drought, economic 
decline, or falling world prices. Food production declined as farmers chose to 
plant cash crops such as cotton, which would increase the value of their land. 
Food shortages, even famines, could arise because the most arable land was 
devoted to growing crops for export.
410 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEgypt  had embraced cotton as a cash crop before the American Civil War 
and more than doubled production between 1861 and 186. By the end of the 
century, cotton accounted for 93 percent of Egypt’s exports. It was also the 
leading cash crop in Sudan , where the Plantation Syndicate, a group of British 
weaving companies, dictated land use to farmers. When the British colonized 
Uganda , they encouraged cotton as a cash crop there as well, and it soon 
replaced enslaved people and ivory as the chief export.
In Kenya , most native peoples were herders. Groups like the Kikuyu 
were moved to reserves with poor soil and bad climates. In the fertile Rift 
9alley, the colonial government gave the land to white settlers, forcing most 
Africans to relocate. Those who remained were forced to provide cheap 
labor for white farmers. African farmers were also forbidden to participate 
in export of any cash crops, and prohibited from growing some cash crops, 
such as coffee and tea.PACIFIC

411 ECONOMIC IM PERIALISMAfter missionaries introduced it to the area in the 1880s, cocoa became the 
major cash crop on the Gold Coast.  This region soon became the largest cocoa 
producer in the world. Cocoa was also an important cash crop in the Ivory 
Coast, Nigeria, and the Portuguese colonies of São Tomé and Angola.
Palm oil, palm kernels, and peanuts also called groundnuts were already 
major exports from West Africa before colonization. It was a valuable raw 
material because it was used as a lubricant for the machines of the industrial 
revolution in Europe.
Slavery in Africa  Slavery was outlawed in British colonies in 1833, but it 
persisted elsewhere in Africa. The French army often used enslaved people as 
payment for its African soldiers, and French colonial administrators relied on 
enslaved people for many of their staff. It was not until 1912 that slave raiding 
and trading was suppressed in most of Africa. Slavery was not abolished by 
law throughout Africa until the first quarter of the 20th century.
Slave labor was used to produce many of the cash crops, especially oil 
palms which produced palm kernels as well as palm oil, coffee, and cocoa. 
Some companies felt a moral responsibility to oppose the use of enslaved 
people in the production of the raw materials they used. For example, cash 
crop production in French-ruled colonies in Africa came about as a result of the 
end of the slave trade in the French Empire in 188, along with the economic 
transformations brought about in France by the Industrial Revolution. Quaker-
owned Cadbury’s, for example, stopped buying slave-grown cocoa from 
Portuguese African colonies in 1908 after the slave trade was exposed.

412 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONEconomic Imperialism in Latin America
In the second half of the 19th century, Latin America was subjected to imperialist 
aggression from both Europe and the United States. The “new imperialism” 
was concerned with a world capitalist economy as the industrialized nations of 
Europe and the United States sought raw materials, low-wage labor, and new 
markets for their goods. The emerging middle classes of Latin America were 
hungry for the latest European news and fashions.
Britain replaced Spain as Latin America’s major trading partner. Companies 
based in Britain became the largest investors in Latin America, followed by 
ones from France and Germany. Europeans invested over 10 billion in Latin 
America between 180 and 11, primarily in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil. 
Role of the United States  The United States was not yet as established 
a world power as Britain or France. However, the Second Industrial 
Revolution brought newfound prosperity to the young republic. U.S. corporate 
investments came later and were concentrated at first in Mexico and Cuba. 
These investments supported infrastructure and industry, especially railways, 
shipping, and the emerging banking and financial sectors. They also financed 
mining, guano, and meat processing and packing plants. In 182, the Monroe 
Doctrine, the U.S. policy of opposing European colonialism in the Americas, 
told the world that Latin America was in the U.S. sphere of influence.
Investments in Argentina  In the late 19th century, Britain had invested 
more in Argentina  than in its own colony of India. As much as 10 percent of 
British foreign investment was in Argentina. British investors, entrepreneurs, 
and business leaders helped turn Argentina into the richest country in Latin 
America and one of the dozen richest in the world by the outbreak of World War 
I. They improved breeding stock and developed large-scale farming throughout 
the grassy plains, known as the Pampas . They also financed infrastructure and 
building projects, such as the railroad and telegraph systems. Because of its 
location on the shallow Rio de la Plata, Buenos Aires needed to build a new 
port to facilitate passenger service and the massive import and export of goods 
and services. The British financed and designed the new port, Puerto Madera.
Mining in Chile  Spain colonized the region of present-day Chile between 
150 and 1818. Chile’s economic development was initially dependent on the 
export of agricultural produce. The wealth of these raw materials brought 
dependency on Spain and tension among neighboring states. Copper would 
come to dominate Chile’s exports. The mining sector in Chile would come to 
be one of the pillars of the Chilean economy, making up for more than one- 
third of government income. 
Rubber Industry in Brazil  Brazil once had a booming rubber industry. 
However, it declined after people began growing rubber in Malaysia at a lower 
cost. The shift of rubber production demonstrated how trade was organized to 
the advantage of companies based in Europe and the United States. Economic 
competition brought prosperity to some regions, but it was always fragile.
413 ECONOMIC IM PERIALISMCentral America and the Caribbean  Foreign investors often used their 
governments to act as “strong men” to help them achieve the ends they wanted. 
The United Fruit Company was an American corporation that traded in tropical 
fruit, primarily bananas, grown on Latin American plantations and sold in the 
United States and in Europe. The United Fruit Company allied itself with large 
landowners to pressure governments to maintain conditions that would be 
favorable for the U.S. company. In a short story, the writer O. Henry coined the 
term “ banana republics ” to describe small Central American countries under 
the economic power of foreign-based corporations. The banana republics were 
politically unstable states with an economy dependent upon the exportation of 
a limited-resource product, such as bananas or minerals. 
Patterns of imperial control over territories and transportation networks 
in Central America, the Caribbean coast of Colombia, Ecuador, and the West 
Indies continued as companies sought political dominance to gain monopolies 
over natural resources. 
Economic Imperialism in Hawaii
The power of investments to transform and dominate small or weak states 
could also be seen in the Pacific islands. A group of American businesses 
and sugar planters in Hawaii went so far as to overthrow the constitutional 
monarchy in 1893, hoping that the islands would be annexed by the United 
States. In 1898, Hawaii became a territory of the United States.
Contextualizing Economic Imperialism
The Industrial Revolution developed the demand for raw materials and the 
technological ability through steamships, railroads, and military weapons to 
control other territories. These set the stage for economic imperialism.

415 ECONOMIC IM PERIALISMSHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“It was at this moment that the East India Company EIC ceased to be a 
conventional corporation, trading and silks and spices, and became something 
much more unusual. Within a few years, 250 company clerks backed by the 
military force of 20,000 locally recruited Indian soldiers had become the 
effective rulers of Bengal. An international corporation was transforming 
itself into an aggressive colonial power. . . .
We still talk about the British conquering India, but that phrase disguises a 
more sinister reality. It was not the British government that seized India at 
the end of the 18th century, but a dangerously unregulated private company 
headquartered in one small office, five windows wide, in London, and 
managed in India by an unstable sociopath—[Robert] Clive.
In many ways the EIC was a model of corporate efficiency: 100 years into its 
history, it had only 5 permanent employees in its head office. Nevertheless, 
that skeleton staff executed a corporate coup unparalleled in history: the 
military conquest, subjugation and plunder of vast tracts of southern Asia. 
It almost certainly remains the supreme act of corporate violence in world 
history. For all the power wielded today by the world’s largest corporations—
whether ExxonMobil, Walmart or Google²they are tame beasts compared 
with the ravaging territorial appetites of the [militarized] East India Company. 
Yet if history shows anything, it is that in the intimate dance between the 
power of the state and that of the corporation, while the latter can be regulated, 
it will use all the resources in its power to resist.”

CAUSES O- MIGRATIO N IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLD417
6.6
Causes of Migration in an 
Interconnected World
I would advise all my friends to quit Ireland—the country most dear to me; 
as long as they remain in it they will be in bondage and misery.
—An Irish settler who had lived in Wisconsin for a year,  
in a letter to The Times  of London, May 14, 1850
Essential Question:   How did environmental and economic factors 
contribute to patterns of migration between  
1750 and 1900?
An increasingly global economy characterized by economic imperialism 
and the availability of different modes of transportation promoted a new era 
in migrations. As industrialization grew, populations moved to urban centers. 
Some workers who left their homelands, such as the Lebanese merchants in 
the United States or the Italian laborers in Argentina, could travel back to 
their native country for visits or to retire. Others, like the Irish settler quoted 
above, chose a permanent resettlement as relief from economic and political 
difficulties. Other movements of people were coerced. To meet the demands 
for workers, coerced and semi-coerced migration of people resulted in slavery, 
indentured servitude, and convict labor. 
Migration through Labor Systems
The desire for low-wage labor was linked to the exploitation of natural resources 
in the system of economic imperialism. Even though slavery was gradually 
being abolished in imperial territories in the 19th century, the demand for the 
agricultural goods that enslaved workers had produced was still increasing. 
European states recruited new laborers to work on plantations, where they 
produced enormous wealth that fueled industrial growth at home:
• Indian laborers migrated to British colonies in the Caribbean, South 
Africa, East Africa, and Fiji. 
• Chinese laborers migrated to California and British Malaya to build 
railroads and serve as farmhands, gardeners, and domestics. 
• Japanese laborers migrated to Hawaii, Peru, and Cuba to work on  
sugar plantations. 
418 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONSlavery  Most countries in the Americas abolished the African slave trade 
in the early 19th century. Slavery itself continued, but without a fresh supply 
of enslaved people, the institution declined. Only in the United States did the 
number of enslaved people increase after the abolition of the slave trade. The 
last countries to abolish slavery in the Americas were the United States 1865, 
Cuba 1886, and Brazil 1888. 
In spite of prohibitions, Africans continued enslaving one another well 
into the 20th century. As slavery was being abolished, labor was still desired, 
so imperial countries turned to other forms of coerced labor.
Indentured Servitude  People who worked for a set number of years 
before becoming free were indentured servants. Many people became 
indentured as a way to pay for their transportation from a desperately poor 
community to one with more opportunity. Others were forced to do so to pay 
off a debt. 
Some of these servants intended to work temporarily, earning money for 
their family, and then return home. But many stayed in their new country. As a 
result, indentured laborers brought their home cultures to their new lands and 
altered the demographics of these lands. For example, the cultures of Mauritius 
in the Indian Ocean off Southeast Africa, Fiji in the South Pacific, and 
Trinidad in the Caribbean added a strong Indian influence.
Asian Contract Laborers  Many Chinese and Indian workers were 
an early substitute for the slave trade. They were forced or tricked into

419 CAUSES O- MIGRATIO N IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLD419servitude. Britain first tried this form of labor after ending the slave trade 
in 1806. They imported 200 Chinese to Trinidad. Between 18 and 18, 
the British, French, Dutch, and Spanish had imported between 250,000 
and 500,000 Chinese workers to their colonies in Southeast Asia, Africa, 
and the Caribbean. About 125,000 Chinese were sent to Cuba alone, where  
80 percent worked the sugar plantations.
The life of an Asian contract workers was riddled with difficulty and 
unjust treatment. While they were not property, they were unskilled laborers 
or porters who were exploited as substitutes for slave labor, often working for 
subsistence wages. The media of the time brought the treatment of them to 
the attention of the public by criticizing the system as a new form of slavery. 
In 1855, Britain stopped its trade. In 1862 Congress banned the contract Asia  
labor trade in the United States, and in 18, under international pressure, 
Portugal ended it. A treaty between China and Spain in 1877 terminated the 
contracts of Chinese workers still in Cuba.
British Penal Colonies  In the late 1700s, Great Britain established a 
penal colony  in Australia after losing its original one in Georgia as a result 
of the American Revolution. The British government shipped convicts  from 
England, Scotland, and Ireland as well as British colonies such as India, to 
Australia. There, they performed hard labor and suffered harsh treatment. 
Actual imprisonment of the convicts was rare. Most performed labor for 
free settlers, worked for the government in record keeping, or worked on 
government projects such as road and railway building. The majority of 
convicts earned their freedom after a prescribed number of years of service. 
Some people sent to penal colonies were never allowed to return to Great 
Britain. In addition, because transportation back home was expensive, the 
majority decided to stay in Australia. By 1850, the British government ended 
the transportation of convicts to Australia, largely because a stay in Australia 
was not considered much of a punishment.
Australia also attracted free settlers, especially after gold was discovered 
there in 1851. Some 50,000 Chinese came during this gold rush. Eventually 
Australia became one of Britain’s most successful settler colonies.
French Penal Colonies  The French also had penal colonies in Africa, 
New Caledonia, and French Guiana. New Caledonia, an island part of an 
archipelago in the southwest Pacific Ocean 50 miles from Australia, served as 
a penal colony from 186 to 18 for both convicts and political prisoners. The 
penal colony in French Guiana, which included Devil’s Island, was notorious 
for its harsh treatment of convicts. Prisoners were underfed and forced to do 
hard labor. Although the French stopped transporting convicts in 1938, Devil’s 
Island continued to hold prisoners until 1953. Connect: Describe the changes

420 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMigration in the Face of Challenges
The word diaspora  is often applied to mass emigrations from a country or 
region that may take place over a period of many years. The African slave trade 
was responsible for one of the biggest diasporas in history, the involuntary 
emigration of millions of people between the 16th and 1th centuries. Most 
diasporas, however, were the result of poverty, political conditions, or famine.
India  Poverty was the principal reason that drove Indians to leave the 
subcontinent. In 18, the British began sending Indians to Mauritius as 
indentured laborers to replace enslaved workers on the sugar plantations. By 
188, Indians were working on plantations in British Guiana Guyana, Dutch 
Guiana Surinam, Natal South Africa, Fiji, and British and French islands in 
the Caribbean. Most Indian laborers signed five-year contracts. Many renewed 
their contracts, and some decided to stay permanently, accepting a piece of 
land or a lump sum rather than their passage back to India. Over 1.5 million 
Indians were shipped to colonies in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Oceania 
before Britain abolished the indenture system in 116. Between 1880 and 
1938, two systems recruited labor in Southeast Asia. 
• The kangani foreman who oversees workers system in Ceylon and 
Malaya recruited from their own extended family.
• The maistry  supervisors system in Burma recruited laborers within a 
structured system with defined hierarchies and sent them to plantations, 
usually in Southeast Asia. Conditions were highly exploitative.
China  The Chinese diaspora did not begin in earnest until the middle 
of the 19th century, with the gold rushes in California, South Australia, and 
western Canada. However, most Chinese migrants were not engaged in mining. 
Despite prejudices toward Chinese immigrants, the Chinese were instrumental 
in the development of the U.S. Transcontinental Railroad. Some Chinese paid 
their own way, but many more left China as indentured laborers. The vast 
majority of Chinese emigrants were males who planned to return to China 
after their time abroad.
People left China for many reasons, some to escape poverty or famine, 
others for better opportunities. Beginning in the late 18th century, a population 
explosion in coastal cities and contacts through foreign trade led large numbers 
of Chinese to emigrate  to Southeast Asia. Most of them were illiterate, landless 
peasants looking for opportunities abroad. However, most of the Chinese did 
not arrive in Southeast Asia until the mid-1th century, after the first Opium 
War made it easier for them to leave. Many people left as a result of the poverty 
and disorder brought on by the Taiping Rebellion 1850±186. See Topic 
6.2. After the middle of the century, most Chinese emigrated to the Americas, 
Europe, Australia, or New Zealand. 
421 CAUSES O- MIGRATIO N IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLDIreland  People emigrated from Ireland for many reasons. Some left for 
political reasons. Britain abolished the Irish Parliament in 1801 when Ireland 
became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Roman 
Catholics and Protestant dissenters faced religious discrimination from their 
British rulers. Evictions of tenant farmers increased after the 186 repeal of 
the Corn Laws, which had regulated the import and export of grain. During 
the Great Famine  185±18 that destroyed the potato crop for four years, 
as many as  million people emigrated from Ireland. Most went to the United 
States, but many others went to England, Scotland, Canada, or Australia.
Emigration continued even after the famine ended; as many people left 
Ireland in the first four years after the famine was over as left during the height 
of the famine. The Irish had been going to Great Britain and the United States 
to build canals since the 18th century, and they continued to leave to help build 
railroads. During the 18th and 19th centuries, 300,000 free Irish emigrated to 
Australia, and 5,000 Irish convicts were transported there. In the second half 
of the 1th century, about 5,000 Irish went to Argentina, although only about 
20,000 remained there. The rest moved on to the United States.

422 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONItaly  The first wave of Italian emigration began with the unification of 
Italy in 1861 and continued until 100. More than  million people left Italy 
during those four decades. More than half of them went to other countries in 
Europe, with most of the rest going to North and South America, Australia, 
and New Zealand. The main reason for the Italian diaspora was poverty. Two-
thirds of the emigrants during this period were men with traditional skills. 
Farmers had an increasingly difficult time making a living in harsh conditions, 
especially in a society where land was subdivided over generations. Some 
left for political reasons, while others left for economic reasons related to 
organized crime, especially in South Italy. Those who left often sent money 
back to family members, encouraging further emigration.
Migration to Settler Colonies
Large numbers of British citizens lived in all the colonies of the British 
Empire. Most who moved abroad permanently went to settler colonies such 
as Canada, South Africa, Australia, or New Zealand. Those who went to other 
colonies such as India, Malaya, or .enya, usually did so with no intention of 
staying permanently. Many went as officers or soldiers in the British army, as 
government officials in the Colonial Service , or as managers for plantations 
or other colonial enterprises. 
Technical Experts  Engineers and geologists migrated to South Asia 
and Africa. One was Andrew Geddes Bain, who emigrated to Cape Town, 
South Africa, in 1816. Bain initially worked on eight major roads and 
passes but moved on to a career in geological studies. Bain prepared the first 
comprehensive geological map of South Africa in 1852. In 185, he reported 
back to the British government about the copper mines in Namaqualand.  
British engineers were so numerous in the colonies that they formed a type 
of diaspora. They spread Western science and technology through the world. 
However, as they did, they blended their knowledge with the experience of 
engineers from the colonial lands. Together, people from Europe and the 
colonies collaborated on both public works and private industrial projects. 
Argentina  During the 19th century, Argentina was part of Britain’s 
“informal” empire. Britain invested more in Argentina than it did in India, 
the so-called “Jewel in the Crown” of the British Empire. Unlike most of 
the people who emigrated to make a new life for themselves, the British 
who settled in Argentina during the 19th century were not trying to escape 
poverty or persecution. They were primarily businessmen, traders, bankers, 
and engineers. They founded banks, developed the export trade in agricultural 
products, built railroads and other infrastructure, and imported luxuries that 
appealed to the growing Argentine middle class. 
Japan  Before 1868, Japan was closed to the rest of the world. However, 
by 1893, the Japanese government had decided that Japan should acquire an 
overseas empire and established the Colonization Society . Its aim was to 
export Japan’s surplus population as well as commercial goods. In 1892 the 
423 CAUSES O- MIGRATIO N IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLDSociety made an unsuccessful attempt to start an agricultural settler colony in 
Mexico. The failure of that attempt did not deter the society from sending 0 
Japanese to Peru in 1899 for contract work. At the same time, many young 
Japanese men were leaving Japan to study in the United States, congregating 
mostly in such cities as San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle on the West Coast. 
Tensions and anti-immigrant sentiment toward Japanese people intensified 
as immigrants assimilated to life in America. In 1907, the Gentlemen’s 
Agreement between the United States and Japan was an informal agreement 
that the U.S. would not impose restrictions on Japanese immigration, and 
Japan would not allow further emigration to the U.S. The agreement was never 
ratified and was ultimately ended by the Immigration Act of 12.
Migration,Transportation, and Urbanization
Improvements in transportation technology allowed some who migrated for 
work reasons to return to their home societies, either for a period of time or 
permanently. For example, in 1885, an agreement between the governments of 
Japan and Hawaii allowed Japanese laborers to go to Hawaii to work on the 
sugar plantations under three-year contracts. Approximately 29,000 Japanese 
went to Hawaii over the next nine years. During that time, thousands more 
Japanese went to other destinations in the South Pacific, including Australia, 
New Caledonia, and Fiji, under similar contracts. Most planned to return home 
after a few years.

Italian immigrants were so important to 
the economic and cultural development of 
Argentina that the city of Mendoza erected  
a monument to them in what is known as  
the Plaza Italia.
424 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIndustrial workers from Italy had similar arrangements for working in 
Argentina and then returning home, though many Italians settled permanently 
in Argentina. Since most industry was located in urban areas, both internal and 
external migrants often settled in cities, which increased in size and influence 
around the globe.

“Due to its structural weakness, the local silk industry could not withstand 
foreign competition from the silk of Japan and China and later on the 
introduction of artificial fabrics. It is also argued by many historians that the 
decision of many Christians to emigrate from the mountain was also stirred 
by increasing urbanization, the emergence of a middle class, and the fear of 
conscription in the Ottoman army. 
Commenting on the post-1860 generation of peasants, Akram .hater >wrote@:
‘Having grown in relative prosperity, these peasants were facing 
limitations that threatened to send them economically a few steps 
backward. At the end of the 1880s silk was no longer the golden 
crop it had been ten or twenty years before. At the same time, 
rising land prices and shrinking inheritance combined to make the 
economic future bleak. So it was that many peasants arrived at the 
year 1887 with a sense of malaise [uneasiness]. They did not have 
much land, and what little they had did not promise to make them 
a ‘good’ living. . . . Although some villagers did migrate seasonally 
to neighboring cities like Aleppo and Bursa, these areas provided 
limited opportunities as they were experiencing their own economic 
crises. . . . These drawbacks made a number of peasants look for other 
ways out of their dilemma—namely, how to make enough money 
quickly to guarantee their status as landowners and not slip back into 
the ranks of the landless laborers. About the only option that appeared 
on the economic horizons was emigration.’ ”

It shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come, or having so come after 
the expiration of said ninety days to remain within the United States. 
—Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
Essential Question:   How and why did patterns of migration affect society 
between 1750 and 1900?
Migration in the 19th century—whether undertaken freely to escape poverty 
or seek opportunity or coerced as part of an imperialist labor system—led to 
demographic changes with long-lasting results. Laborers tended to be male and 
from particular ethnic groups, such as the Indian indentured servants brought 
to work on sugar plantations in the Caribbean or the Chinese laborers recruited 
to complete the transcontinental railroad in the United States. These migrants 
often formed ethnic enclaves and created cultural groups that maintained 
elements of their native culture and religion while absorbing the influences 
of their new locations. For example, many Indians in Trinidad and Tobago 
practiced Hinduism and contributed to Caribbean musical traditions. These 
migrants also left behind women who sometimes took on the roles formerly 
filled by men and thus brought about change in migrants’ home societies. 
Migrant groups often experienced racial and ethnic prejudice. The Chinese 
Exclusion Act, noted above, was the first major U.S. federal legislation that 
specifically suspended immigration of a specific ethnic group. 
Changes in Home Societies
The experiences of migrants and the families they left behind varied widely 
depending on the norms of their home cultures. Migrant laborers were more 
often male than female, so in some places their migration—whether internal 
or external—brought a shift in demographics and gender roles in the societies 
they left. In some societies, males waited to emigrate until a male relative 
was available to live with and help support the women and children who did 
not emigrate with the males. In these places, women’s roles were much the 
same as before their husbands left. However, in other places, women gained 
some autonomy and authority as they took on responsibilities once filled by 
their husbands and took a meaningful place in society outside the bounds 
430 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONof family responsibilities. If they later followed their husbands to another 
country, they often participated more fully, though far from equally, in family 
decision-making than women who had not been on their own. If their husbands 
returned, women who had taken up their husbands’ responsibilities sometimes 
continued to play a role outside of domestic life, while those who had been put 
in the care of male relatives remained in traditional gender roles. 
Most male migrants sent remittances, funds from their foreign earnings, 
back home. If the remittance were large enough, women often reduced 
their hours working outside the home and spent more time with family 
responsibilities while also exercising considerable decision-making power 
over how the money was spent. In some places, the receipt of remittances 
correlates to girls’ longer school attendance; in other places boys seem to  have 
been the greater beneficiaries of remittance-supported education.

Immigrants were interested in a new economic start but intent on carrying 
with them their own traditions and culture. Ethnic enclaves , clusters or 
neighborhoods of people from the same foreign country, formed in many 
major cities of the world. In these areas inhabitants spoke the language of their 
home country, ate the foods they were familiar with from home, and pursued a 
way of life similar to that they had known in their home countries. At the same 
time, they influenced the culture of their new  homes which absorbed some of 
the migrants’ cultural traditions.
Chinese Enclaves
Many Chinese emigrated in search of work during the latter half of the 1th 
century—some to work on sugar plantations or for other agricultural endeavors, 
others to work in industry and transportation. Together, they spread Chinese 
culture around the world. 
Southeast Asia  The Chinese who migrated to Southeast Asia thrived 
under colonial rule. In Indochina, the French encouraged them to engage 
in commerce. In Malaya, they managed opium farms and controlled opium 
distribution for the British. In the Dutch East Indies, some Chinese held posts 
with the colonial government. As time went on, many Chinese throughout the 
region became business owners and traders, often founding family businesses. 
Some Chinese acquired great wealth as moneylenders or through international 
trade. By the end of the 19th century, the Chinese controlled trade throughout 
Southeast Asia and were a significant presence in the region. 
The Americas  Chinese immigrants first came to the United States in 
large numbers during the height of the California gold rush . Many worked in 
mines, but others found work on farms or in San Francisco’s garment industry.

431 E--ECTS  O- MIGRATIO N431Between 18 and 18, some 225,000 Chinese laborers were sent to 
Cuba and Peru on eight-year contracts. Almost all of them were male, and 80 
percent of them were sent to work on sugar plantations alongside enslaved 
Africans in Cuba and replacing enlaved workers in Peru, where slavery had 
been abolished. Other Chinese in Cuba were employed as servants, in cigarette 
factories, and in public works projects. Several thousand contract laborers in 
Peru helped build the Andean railroad and worked in the guano mines. In the 
1870s, some Chinese built settlements in the Peruvian Amazon, where they 
were active as merchants and grew rice, beans, sugar, and other crops.
In each area they lived, Chinese immigrants left their cultural stamp. Some 
Peruvian cuisine is a fusion of Chinese foods and ingredients and cooking 
styles of Peru. As in other areas, Chinese immigrants sometimes married local 
people and thus contributed to the multicultural diversity of populations. 
Indian Enclaves 
The British Empire abolished slavery in 1833. However, it was replaced with a 
system that was little better, indentured servitude. Indians were among the first 
indentured servants sent to work in British colonies.of family responsibilities. If they later followed their husbands to another 
country, they often participated more fully, though far from equally, in family 
decision-making than women who had not been on their own. If their husbands 
returned, women who had taken up their husbands’ responsibilities sometimes 
continued to play a role outside of domestic life, while those who had been put

432 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONIndians in Africa  Many Indians went to Mauritius,  islands off the 
southeast coast of Africa, and Natal , a colony that is today part of South 
Africa, as indentured servants on sugar plantations. In Natal and British East 
Africa, they built railways. Nearly 32,000 indentured Indian workers went 
to .enya to work on railroad construction between 1886 and 101, but only 
about ,000 chose to stay. Today, Indians continue to make up significant parts 
of the population of these regions.
Both Hindus and Muslims emigrated from India to South Africa. The 
Hindus brought with them their caste system and the social laws that stem 
from it, but they soon abandoned the caste system. In contrast, many kept up 
Hindu traditions and had alters in their homes to honor deities.
The Hindu and Muslim Indian population of South Africa was divided 
by class, language, and religion. However, Indians in South Africa shared 
the injustice of discrimination, which became central to the work of a young 
Indian named Mohandas Gandhi . He arrived in Pretoria, South Africa, in 
1893, where he intended to practice law. After suffering repeatedly from racial 
discrimination, Gandhi became an activist. He founded the Natal Indian 
Congress  and worked to expose to the world the rampant discrimination 
against Indians in South Africa. In 11 Gandhi returned to India, where he 
became a leader in the Indian nationalist movement against British rule.
Indians in Southeast Asia  Between 18 and 1 India was the major 
source of labor for the British Southeast Asian colonies of Ceylon, Burma, 
and Malaya. Many Indians went to Malaya as indentured laborers. Indentured 
servitude was eventually replaced by the kangani system , under which entire 
families were recruited to work on tea, coffee, and rubber plantations in Ceylon, 
Burma, and Malaya. Their lives were less restricted than those of indentured 
laborers, and they had the advantage of having their families with them. It is 
estimated that about 6 million Indians migrated to Southeast Asia before the 
kangani system was abolished. Because Southeast Asia was relatively close, 
Indian workers there often kept close ties with India.
Indian traders settled in many countries where there were indentured 
laborers. They also looked for business opportunities throughout the British 
Empire, such as British East Africa.
Indians in the Caribbean Region  So many Indians were sent to work 
on the sugar plantations in and around the Caribbean that today they comprise 
the largest ethnic group in Guyana  and Trinidad and Tobago , and the 
second largest group in Suriname, Jamaica, Grenada, Saint 9incent and the 
Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Martinique and Guadeloupe. In many of the other 
Caribbean nations Indians constitute a sizable proportion of the population. In 
addition, they have blended ethnically with migrants from other parts of the 
world, creating a unique culture, affecting national cuisines, film, and music. 
Many of the countries in the region celebrate the arrival of the Indians with 
annual holidays or festivals.
433 E--ECTS  O- MIGRATIO NIrish Enclaves in North America
Before the American Revolution, most Irish who came to North America were 
Protestant descendants of Scots who had previously migrated to Ireland. They 
are often referred to as Scots-Irish . Most came as indentured servants. Those 
who paid their own passage often went west to the frontier.
After the American Revolution, most new Irish immigrants who came 
to the United States settled in northern cities. Many others went to British 
North America Canada, where they were able to get cheap land grants. By 
the 1830s, most new Irish immigrants were poorer than earlier settlers, and 
Catholic. Most of those who settled in cities worked in factories. Many of 
the men who came to the United States helped construct the canal system . In 
Canada as well as the United States, many Irish farmed. Most Irish immigrants 
were able to create decent lives for themselves and their children.
Half of the  million Irish who fled Ireland during the Great Famine 
came to North America. Most of this huge wave of Irish immigrants faced 
many hardships, not the least of them anti-immigrant nativist and anti-
Catholic sentiments in the United States. Nevertheless, immigration from 
Ireland continued strong after the Great Famine ended until the 1880s, when 
it gradually slowed. Many of these new immigrants were single women who 
came to the United States looking for work and husbands. More than half 
became domestic servants. Many of the men who came during this period were 
unskilled laborers.
Wherever they settled, the Irish in the United States spread their culture—
their lively dance music and holiday traditions such as the celebration of St. 
Patrick’s Day. They also had a strong influence on the conditions of laborers 
through their efforts at promoting labor unions, and their great numbers 
ensured the spread of Catholicism in the United States.
Second-generation Irish were often either white-collar  or skilled blue-
collar  workers. Many became “stars” of the new popular culture  that was 
taking root at the end of the century as boxers, baseball players, and vaudeville 
performers. Many second-and third-generation Irish, such as the Fitzgeralds 
and the Kennedys, became very wealthy and powerful.
Italians in Argentina
During the 18th and 19th centuries only the United States surpassed Argentina  
in the number of immigrants it attracted. The 1853 Argentine Constitution not 
only encouraged European immigration, but it also guaranteed to foreigners 
the same civil rights enjoyed by Argentine citizens.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Italians made up almost half of 
the European immigrants to Argentina. Today people of Italian descent make 
up more than 55 percent of the Argentine population. As a result, Italians have 
had an enormous influence on all aspects of Argentine culture and language. 
Argentine Spanish has absorbed many Italian words, and Italian is still widely 
spoken in Buenos Aires.
434 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONArgentina was underpopulated and had an enormous amount of fertile land, 
which appealed to Italian immigrants. Most of them were farmers, artisans, and 
day laborers. Wages in Argentina were much higher than in Italy. Agricultural 
workers, for example, could earn five to ten times as much in Argentina as in 
Italy. In addition, the cost of living, even in Buenos Aires, was much lower 
than that of many rural Italian provinces. Both of these factors allowed most 
immigrants to raise their standard of living greatly in a very short time. By 
10, Italian immigrants owned nearly 0 percent of Buenos Aires’ commercial 
establishments.
Prejudice and Regulation of Immigration
In the United States and Australia, native-born residents resented immigrants 
from China who were willing to work for lower wages. In response to these 
resentments, governments institutionalized discrimination against the Chinese. 
Regulation in the United States  
Nativists were powerful enough in California that a revised constitution ratified 
in 1879 included several provisions that targeted people from China:
• It prohibited the state, counties, municipalities, and public works from 
hiring Chinese workers. 
• It prevented individuals from China, and any others who were not 
considered white, from becoming citizens on the grounds that they were 
“dangerous to the well-being of the State.” 
• It encouraged cities and towns either to remove Chinese residents from 
within their limits or to segregate them in certain areas.
With many thousands of Chinese living in the United States by 1882, 
Congress banned further Chinese immigration by passage of the Chinese 
Exclusion Act . Initially limited to a ten year period, the policy was extended 
periodically and made permanent in 102. This act, which was finally repealed 
in 1, showed the discrimination in the United States.
After the U.S. Congress excluded Chinese immigrants, some of them began 
to move to Mexico. Mexican President 3orfirio 'ta] promoted immigration as 
well as development, especially in the northern area bordering the United States. 
Rather than working as laborers in the mines or railroads, most worked as truck 
farmers, shopkeepers, or manufacturers.
White Australia  
Before the Australian gold rushes of the 1850s and 1860s, most of the Chinese in 
Australia were indentured laborers, convicts, or traders. During the gold rushes, 
the Chinese population grew to around 50,000. In response to the influx of Chinese 
miners, the parliament of the province of 9ictoria passed a Chinese Immigration 
Act in 1855 that limited the number of Chinese who could come ashore from each 
ship. Many Chinese got around this law by landing instead in South Australia.
435 E--ECTS  O- MIGRATIO NIn December 1860, white miners in the goldfields of New South Wales 
attacked the area where Chinese miners were quartered, killing several and 
wounding many others. Several other attacks followed. One of the worst 
occurred on June 0, 1861, when several thousand white miners attacked the 
Chinese and plundered their dwellings.
In response to this violence, the New South Wales Legislative Council 
passed the Chinese Immigration Regulation and Restriction Act  in 
November of that year. The act, eventually repealed in 186, was an attempt 
to restrict the number of Chinese immigrants from entering the colony. By the 
end of the gold rushes in 1881, New South Wales passed the ,nflu[ oI Chinese 
Restriction Act , which attempted to restrict Chinese immigration by means of 
an entrance tax. 
After the gold rushes, the Chinese in Australia turned to other sources of 
income, such as gardening, trade, furniture making, fishing, and pearl diving. 
While Chinatowns  Chinese enclaves developed in cities across Australia, 
the Chinese made their biggest economic contributions in the Northern 
Territory and north Queensland regions. Eventually, however, anti-Chinese 
sentiment grew. Because the Chinese artisans and laborers would work for 
less than white Australians, resentment increased. Anti-Chinese leagues also 
began to develop.
Although the number of Chinese in Australia was declining, they were 
becoming more concentrated in Melbourne and Sydney and thus more visible. 
After six separate British self-governing colonies in Australia united under a 
single centralized government in 1901, the new parliament took action to limit 
non-British immigration. The new attorney general stated that the government’s 
policy was to preserve a “white Australia.” The White Australia Policy , as it 
was known, remained in effect until the mid-1970s. Connect: Compare the 
experiences in Australia of Chinese and Japanese immigrants. See Topic 6.6.

those who ha]e a diќerent complexion or who ha]e slightly flatter noses than 
ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much.
—Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness , 1899
Essential Question:   What was the relative signiÄcance of the effects of 
imperialism from 1750 to 1900?
Industrial capitalism caused significant developments between 150 to 100. 
The manufacturing capacity of industrialized nations caused an increase in 
the availability, affordability, and variety of both capital financial assets and 
consumer goods. However, this increased industrial capacity also led to an 
increased demand for natural resources—“the conquest of the earth”—to use 
in manufacturing these goods. Additionally, domestic markets soon became 
saturated, leading industrialized nations to seek out foreign markets to soak 
up the excess production. Competition for these markets increased among 
industrialized economies, especially those in the West. To reduce competition 
and increase profits, Western nations continued to look to empire-building, 
begun in the previous era, as a solution to these challenges. 
Ninetheenth-century imperialism also caused significant effects, including 
increased migration, the rise of independence movements within the colonies, 
and increased political and economic rivalry among Western European nations 
that would lead to catastrophic events in the early 20th century.
Changes in Standards of Living
Due to increased automation, the use of interchangeable parts, the division 
and specialization of labor, and the assembly line, the efficiency of industrial 
production increased. This efficiency led to greater output, especially of such 
consumer goods as textiles, home furnishings, clothing, and porcelain. As the 
supply of consumer goods increased, the availability of goods rose and the 
prices fell. In addition, increased global industrial production led to greater 
competition and variety of both consumer and capital goods. For some people, 
standards of living improved with the proliferation of consumer goods. 
One way economists measure standard of living is by tracing patterns 
in real wages²those adjusted for inflation. Real wages signify the amount 
440 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONof goods or services that can be bought. In the early years of the Industrial 
Revolution, some studies show that real wages grew slowly, but after 1819   
the pace of growth accelerated, and between 1819 and 1852 they doubled.  The 
growth of real wages paralleled the rise in consumption. By these measures, 
standards of living increased for people of all income groups. 
At the same time, however, the distribution of income the wealth gap 
became more pronounced. Additionally, some of the rise in income was offset 
by the growing problems in an industrialized society—pollution, crowded 
cities, and the costs of wars. With these taken into consideration, standards of 
living may not have risen for many people. 
Overseas Expansion
As more countries industrialized and the capacity to produce goods increased, 
overproduction became a serious economic issue. Domestic markets could 
no longer consume the amount of goods being produced. As a result, 
international trade transformed industrial economies from mercantilist to 
capitalist systems. Industrialized economies looked to increase exports of 
their products. The desire to increase exports, however, caused both economic 
and political rivalries among industrialized countries as businesses sought out 
new international customers and enlisted their government’s assistance to help 
open previously closed or inaccessible markets.Average Percentage of GD P*

As production increased, new and greater amounts of natural resources 
were required by industrial economies. In addition, such common industrial 
resources as coal and iron, tin, bauxite, rubber, and copper were also imported 
from sources in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. A key effect of 
industrial capitalism, therefore, was the expansion of imperialism in the 19th 
441 CAUSATIO N IN THE IMPERIAL AGE441century. Industrialized countries, especially those in Western Europe, the U.S., 
and Japan, saw the benefits of controlling trade and resources of other areas of 
the world. This trend was a continuation from the previous era during which 
European countries created colonies in the Western Hemisphere and in the 
Indian Ocean. 
In contrast, the dependent colonial economies that provided raw material 
to and markets for the imperial powers often saw little economic development 
from participation in the world economy. Reliance on the cash crops introduced 
by imperial powers often left them vulnerable to natural disasters and volatile 
markets. 
In this era, however, states and people in regions that had previously been 
able to resist European colonization found themselves increasingly dominated 
by Western powers. Most areas of Africa came under the direct control of 
European colonizers. Large portions of South Asia and Southeast Asia were 
colonized, mainly by Great Britain and France, respectively. Even China, the 
most dynamic civilization in previous eras, succumbed to the domination of 
Western and Japanese imperialists. Western powers were able to achieve this 
level of dominance because of the technological advances associated with the 
Industrial Revolution. Advances in military technology, ship building, and 
medicine helped Western European nations  assert control over these other 
regions. 
Seeds of Revolution and Rebellion
In the late 1700s, the former North American colonies of Great Britain  revolted 
against its colonial rule and declared themselves the independent nation of 
the United States of America. Shortly after, France threw off the yoke of the 
monarchy and established a republic. In the early 1800s, former Spanish and 
Portuguese colonies in South America also became independent states. 
As western imperialism took hold in other parts of the world, the seeds 
of resistance and rebellion that would, in time, lead to new nation-states took 
root. Westernization assimilation of Western culture was often resisted in 
colonized or dominated areas. In South Asia, for example, Indian soldiers 
known as sepoys rose up in rebellion against the British East India Company. 
While the rebellion was brutally suppressed by British soldiers, the effect 
was the disbandment of the British East India Company and the direct rule 
of India by the British government, commencing a period now known as the 
British Raj. Similarly, westernization was opposed in China by the Boxers 
who attempted to rid China of Western influence, especially from Christian 
missionaries. These nascent independence movements would lead to the more 
widespread and successful nationalism of the post-World War II period.
442 WORLD  HISTOR Y MODERN : AP® EDITIONMigration and Discrimination
One of the more significant effects of modern imperialism was the migration 
from dependent or less industrial areas of the world to the dominant industrial 
economies. People emigrated from rural areas to urban areas within countries 
and from less developed areas of Europe to more developed areas of Europe. 
Immigrants looking for economic opportunity left many European 
countries and settled in the United States and Canada, often making up a large 
proportion of the industrial workforce. Some immigrants signed contracts to 
travel to areas to work for a prescribed period of time, pay back the cost of 
their transport, and then either settle in these areas or return to their homelands. 
These indentured laborers, as they were called, came from China, Japan, South 
Asia, and Europe and found themselves working and living in the Americas, 
Southeast Asia, Africa, or Australia. If they chose to settle in their host 
country, they often formed enclaves, or communities, with others from their 
home country. Often, these immigrants were faced with discrimination based 
on race, religion, or other factors. The spread of global capitalism resulted 
in the accumulation of wealth by the middle and upper classes, while the 
working classes in the industrial economies, already exploited by the profit 
motive, found themselves in direct competition for jobs with immigrants from 
nonindustrial countries.
REFLECT ON THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. Causation There are many ways to determine the relative significance 
of the effects of a historical development. These are some of the criteria 
for ranking the relative impact of effects:
• The depth of change it brought about in people
• The number of people it affected
• How long the effect lasted
• The importance of the change it represented
 Choose one of the effects of imperialism and evaluate it based on these 
criteria for determining significance.
2. In one to three paragraphs, explain the relative significance of  the 
effects of imperialism from 1750 to 1900.

UNIT 6 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   HOW DID COLONIZATION  PROMOTE  
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC GROWTH&
In the 19th century, the European powers believed that building a 
modern economy required establishing colonies. They focused on the 
economic and political benefits of imperialism. 
Problems with Imperialism  By the early 20th century, as the 
struggles of the workers and the burden of imperialist wars began to take 
a toll, some historians focused on the costs of imperialism. British writer 
J. A. Hobson argued in his book Imperialism: A Study 10 imperialist 
competition for new resources and markets was a flaw in capitalism. The 
accumulation of capital in the hands of a few profit-seeking capitalists 
pressured governments to take over underdeveloped nations and to protect 
access to them. Hobson then explained how this was justified, based on 
the needs of a growing population or hopes for quick profits, but that 
those supporting this greed for territorial acquisition did not consider the 
associated political and economic costs. 
Hobson believed that the system could be improved through greater 
global cooperation and planning. In contrast, Russian revolutionary 
9ladimir Lenin wrote in Imperialism, The Highest Stage of Capital 
Development 11 that imperialist conflicts would cause capitalist 
states to destroy each other and usher in the era of communism. 
%enefits to SoPe  In the late 20th century, historians living in an age 
of increasing globalization re-studied the roots of the world economy. 
Immanuel Wallerstein, an American social scientist, popularized world-
systems theory. He described a dynamic system of two main regions: 
• The core included highly developed nations that accumulated 
capital and demanded resources and markets from under- or less-
developed regions
• The periphery consisted of regions that provided resources and 
markets as well as labor needed by the core 
Wallerstein traced the roots of this world-system to the mid-16th century. 
Colonialism became the means by which peripheral states became 
incorporated into the world economy. However, Wallerstein noted that 
politics and culture vary within the world economy, so nations could be 
semi-peripheral at some point and possibly move to the core—or the 
other way around. He cited Spain as an example. Although this world-
system caused inequalities, its dynamic nature insured its durability.

WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  WRITE  THE INTROD UCTION
After you analyze the task, gather and organize evidence, and develop 
an effective thesis statement, much of the hard work in writing a long 
essay is behind you. The most challenging task still remaining is to write 
an introduction that 1 serves as a blueprint for the rest of the essay and 
2 casts the topic in a broader historical perspective.
The Introduction as Blueprint  In generic terms, a good introduction 
conveys the framework or limits of the topic as well as a clear debatable and 
defensible claim. The claim should be expressed in one or more sentences in 
the same location—ideally the introduction. The introduction also suggests 
the organizational pattern and reasoning process that will unfold in the rest of 
the essay. In other words, it conveys without saying, “Here’s what I’m going 
to argue. Here’s the reasoning process I am going to use to convince you. 
Here’s the order I will use to present my ideas.” The reasoning process may 
be causation, continuity and change, or comparison. Each reasoning process 
suggests a unique organization. See Write as a Historian in Topic  .. 
Historical Perspective  A good introduction also relates the topic of 
the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that 
occur before, during, or that continue after the time frame of the question. 
In other words, it conveys without saying, “Here’s how this topic relates 
to what came before it/what came after it/what else was going on in other 
parts of the world or other aspects of society, and any number of broader 
historical patterns and trends.” The introduction is a good place to point out 
the historical perspective, but it will need further development later in the 
essay. A simple reference to a historical perspective is not sufficient to earn 
points on the exam.
Application  Find both the blueprint and historical perspective in the 
following introduction. How does the introduction answer these questions:
• What is the author’s argument? 
• What reasoning process will the author use? 
• What order will the author likely use? 
• How does the topic relate to broader historical events, 
developments, or processes?
The new global capitalist economy that developed between 1750 and 
1900 brought many obvious changes as smokestacks and ships laden 
with raw materials for industry became commonplace. One of the 
most dramatic changes, however, was the effect of industrialization on 
patterns of migration, from the countryside to the city and from one 
country to another. These changes in turn brought about significantly 
different social conditions that laid the foundation for challenges many 
countries continue to face today.

LONG ESSAY QUESTIONS
Directions:  Write essay responses to 1, 2, and EITHER 3 or 4. The suggested 
writing time for each essay is 40 minutes.
1. In the period 1750 to 1900, some European powers suffered a decrease 
in influence, and new empires emerged²one in the Americas and one 
in Asia.  
Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which the global 
balance of power shifted during that era.
2. From 1750 to 1900, nationalist movements emerged throughout South 
America, Africa, and Asia as resistance to imperialist powers increased.  
Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which internal factors 
influenced the process of state building during that era. 
3. European powers divided up much of Africa and India from 1750 
to 1900, but indigenous peoples had their own opinions about 
imperialism.  
Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which the responses 
of native people to imperialism were similar in India and Sub-Saharan 
Africa between 1750 and 1900. 
4. As the economy grew increasingly global from 1750 to 1900, 
working people in Eurasia, the Americas, Australia, and Africa began 
moving into urban centers and across borders, but many had the same 
motivations their ancestors had.  
Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which the migration 
patterns from 1750 to 1900 show changes or continuities over time.

UNIT 7:   Global Conflict  
After 1900
Understand the Context
The 20th century was a time of great social and political change, much of which 
resulted in tension and division. People and states challenged existing political 
and social orders, while new technologies and scientific advancements both 
advanced understanding of the universe and enabled the two world wars to be 
increasingly destructive. 
Shifting Powers  Challenges to existing states and political establishments 
set the stage for shifting powers throughout the 20th century. Long-established 
states such as the Ottoman Empire dissolved, while new political experiments 
such as communism emerged in Russia, China, and elsewhere. The ongoing 
power of nationalism and traditional rivalries, combined with economic 
instability, soon embroiled most of Europe and its colonies, the United States, 
Japan, and China in the First World War. Though dubbed “the war to end all 
wars,” it was not. World War II was far larger and bloodier. Additional conflicts 
occurred as colonized regions fought for independence.
A Changing World  Rapid advances in technology altered the 
understanding of the universe and the natural world in the 20th century. 
Advancements in communication, transportation, industry, agriculture, and 
medicine brought people longer lives, greater opportunities to find meaningful 
work, and better access to information. However, emerging military 
technologies also made war more deadly. World War I featured advancements 
such as the aircraft, while World War II enabled the development of the atomic 
bomb. Mass atrocities were also brought about by the intentional destruction 
of entire ethnic or religious groups of people, including the Holocaust during 
World War II. Totalitarian governments, such as the one under Joseph Stalin 
in the Soviet Union, adopted repressive policies that resulted in the deaths of 
many millions of people.19002000 1950A political

SHIFTING POWER453
4537.1
Shifting Power
I shall never, under any circumstances, agree to a representative form  
of government because I consider it harmful to the people whom God  
has entrusted to my care. 
—Russian Tsar Nicholas II (1905)
Essential Question:   How did internal and external factors contribute to 
change in various states after 1900?
An intense period of rebellion continued into the early 100s. Nicholas II, the 
last Russian tsar, clearly did not understand the force of the political opposition 
to his rule that resulted in his assassination in 118. In the 20th century’s first two 
decades, rebellions erupted against long-standing authoritarian governments 
in Russia, China, and Mexico. Revolutionaries unseated ruling governments in 
each country, challenging the existing political and social order and instituting 
their own political philosophies and practices. Established land-based and 
maritime empires collapsed under pressure from internal and external forces. 
By the end of the century, a new global order had emerged.
Revolution in Russia
By the early 20th century, Russia was falling behind most of Europe, the 
United States, and Japan in wealth in power. 
Russia’s  most obvious challenges were internal. While governments 
in other industrializing states in the 19th century were actively promoting 
economic growth, Russia was not. It was slow to expand education for 
peasants, build roads and other parts of its transportation networks, and support 
entrepreneurs with loans and contracts. Further, the tsarist government resisted 
calls for political reform. It did was reluctant to recognize civil liberties and to 
allow more citizens to participate in government. 
These internal problems led to external ones. Without a strong economic 
base to support a military, Russia then became weaker in international affairs:
• It lost the Crimean War (1853–1856) against the Ottoman Empire,, 
which was supported by Great Britain and France.
• It lost the Russo-Japanese War 10±105 in a battle for power in 
East Asia.
454 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn the fall of 1917, the Bolsheviks , an organization representing the 
revolutionary working class of Russia under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, 
seized power and set up a communist government with Lenin at its head. 
The communists  believed that workers eventually should own the means of 
production and that collective ownership would lead to collective prosperity 
and a just society. Toward that long-term goal, the Soviet government abolished 
private trade, distributed peasants’ crops to feed urban workers, and took over 
ownership of the country’s factories and heavy industries (see Topic 7.4)
Key Events Leading to Revolution in Russia
Internal •  Bloody Sunday, January 22, 1905: Thousands of workers 
marched peacefully to petition the tsar asking for better working 
conditions, higher wages, and universal suɈrage. The tsar’s troops 
and police began shooting. About 1,300 marchers were killed.
•  The Revolution of 1905:  In strikes responding to Bloody Sunday, 
400,000 workers refused to work. The tsar tried to appease the 
protesters. However, by the end, thousands of workers had been 
killed, inQured, or exiled.
External •  Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905): Russia and Japan both 
wanted to expand their influence in 2orea and Manchuria. Japan 
won easily, the first time in modern history that an East Asian state 
had defeated a European power.
•  World War I: Germany declared war on Russia in 1914. Russians 
quickly realized how poorly trained and armed their troops were. 
Civilians suɈered from extreme food shortages.
The success of the Bolsheviks in taking power shook the world. They 
were the first example of communists running a large country. Throughout the 
capitalist world, from Europe to the United States to Japan, people worried that 
communists were a danger to their governments as well. The conflict between 
communism and capitalism would become an important issue shaping world 
affairs in the rest of the 20th century.
Upheaval in China
China was another land-based empire that collapsed in this period from 
problems it faced at home and from other countries. The Qing Dynasty had 
come to power in China in 1644. Finally, a revolution overthrew it in 1911, 
creating a republic led first by Dr. Sun Yat-sen . However, his rule was short. 
Internal Challenges  China faced daunting domestic concerns in the 19th 
century, each of which weakened support for the government. One of these was 
ethnic tension. China consisted of dozens of ethnic groups. The largest group 
was the Han. The rulers of the Qing Dynasty were Manchus, from a region 
northeast of China. Many Chinese, particularly the Han, never fully accepted 
the Qing as legitimate rulers of China. By the late 1th century, the Qing had 
ruled China for over two centuries, but they had remained ethni cally distinct. 
455 SHIFTING POWERA second problem was the constant danger of famine. China experienced 
rapid population growth between the mid-100s and mid-1800s, but could not 
expand the amount of farmland or productivity rapidly enough to provide a 
stable food supply. Any natural disaster, such as a drought or a flood, could 
result in the early deaths of thousands of people. 
Third, government revenues were very low. The imperial government had 
not updated the tax system to adjust to changes in the economy. As a result, 
compared to Europe or the United States, taxes in China were low. This meant 
that the government did not have the resources to maintain roads, bridges, and 
irrigation canals. 
External Challenges  China had been one of the wealthiest, most 
powerful, most innovative states in the world for much of its recorded history. 
However, starting in the late 18th century, it faced growing threats to its 
position by industrialization in Europe. In the late 18th century, Europeans 
interested in the Chinese market could trade only in the city of Canton 
Guangzhou. Europeans commonly bought tea, rhubarb, porcelain, and silk. 
In Europe, Chinese fashions, table settings, and art objects were very popular. 
The Chinese received European silver in exchange for they sold. However, the 
Chinese did not desire the products Europeans produced, and they looked down 
on Europeans as violent and less civilized. In response to growing European 
influence in China, many Chinese did rally behind the empress in the 180s.  
Chinese Republic  However the desire to support the empress against 
foreign pressure was not enough to save the Qing Dynasty. In 111, the last 
Chinese dynasty was overthrown by a revolutionary movement led by Sun 
Yat-sen. Though a Christian, Sun believed that China should continued to 
follow such Confucian principles as loyalty, respect for ancestors, and efforts 
to promote social harmony. He combined these traditions with ideas he later 
elaborated upon in his book The Three People’ s Principles:
• Democracy:  Sun believed in sovereignty, not for all the people but 
for those Chinese who were “able.” In Confucian terms, this meant a 
country governed by active and pragmatic experts in the name of the 
people. He felt that expelling foreign capitalists from China would 
enable China to redistribute revenues from land taxes more fairly , since 
the revenues would not have to be used to pay debts to foreigners.
• Nationalism:  Sun advocated patriotism and loyalty, primarily to central 
authority.
• Livelihood:  Sun wanted to end the extreme unequal distribution of 
wealth in China and the harsh economic exploitation.
Sun Yat-sen’s Legacy  Sun never had enough military strength to rule 
all of China. 9arious warlords controlled the majority of the country. Sun 
recognized the weakness of his position. After two months in office, he gave 
up his position to a military leader.
456WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe party Sun led, the Chinese Nationalist Party, or .uomintang, would 
later regain power. It would rule China for two decades before losing a civil 
war with Chinese Communists see Topic .5.While both the .uomintang 
and the Communists would honor Sun as the founder of the Chinese republic, 
neither would fully implement his principles. 
Self-Determination in the Ottoman Collapse
By the beginning of the 20th century, the once-mighty Ottoman Empire²
now “the sick man of Europe”²had relatively few exports and a waning 
agricultural economy. The empire relied mostly upon its position as a trade 
center. Egypt, by contrast, continued to make profits from cotton.
The Young Turks  As Ottoman prosperity declined, a group of reformers 
known as the Young Turks  emerged. They advocated for a constitution like 
those of the European states. They also advocated 7urNification an effort 
to make all citizens of the multiethnic empire identify with Turkish culture, 
which was heavily Islamic. For the millions of Armenians in the empire, 
who were mostly Christians, this was difficult. In response, some Young 
Turks scapegoated, or unfairly blamed, Armenians for the empire’s economic 
problems. Connect: Compare the cultural assimilation forced on Armenians 
to that forced on American Indians. See Topic 6.. 
)iJht $Jainst )oreiJn ,nfluence  Turks resented many Europeans, 
particularly the British and the French, for their economic policies. Foreign 
investments had given Europeans undue power in the empire. Further, 
Europeans had imposed trade privileges that were unprofitable for the 
Ottomans. Because of these resentments,  the Ottoman Empire secretly allied 
with Germany in World War I. See Topic .2. After Germany’s defeat in 
World War I, the Ottoman Empire was dismantled by the victorious powers. 
It was replaced by a smaller nation-state, the Republic of Turkey, and several 
independent countries.
9ictorious Allied forces immediately sent troops to occupy Anatolia. 
Although the sultan of the Ottoman Empire remained on his throne, he had 
little power. He served as a mere puppet for British forces that hoped to control 
the lands of the former empire. 
The Rise of Atatürk  During the war, a group called the Turkish National 
Movement organized an army to fight for self-determination. Led by Mustafa 
.ePal the Turkish Nationalists defeated British and other forces in 121. The 
Republic of Turkey was established in 12, with .emal as the first president. 
The new national assembly awarded him the surname Atatürk  “father of the 
Turks” in recognition of his role in establishing the new republic.
Atatrk’s policies focused on reforming Turkey to make it more like the 
Western democracies. He was determined to create a secular nation, not one 
with strong Islamic influences. He implemented several reforms: establishing 
public education for boys and girls, abolishing polygyny, and expanding 
457 SHIFTING POWERsuffrage to include women. As a symbolic gesture, he wore mainly Western 
suits and hats and encouraged others to do the same. Despite his reforms, he 
ruled as a dictator for 15 years. He did not give up power before his death  
in 1938.
Power Shifts in Mexico 
Mexico entered the 20th century as an independent nation firmly under the 
control of a dictator, 3orfirio 'ta] . He oversaw a period of stability and some 
economic progress. However, he had allowed foreign investors, particularly 
those from the United States, control over many of the country’s resources. 
Additionally, the wealthiest 1 percent of the population controlled  percent 
of the land. Typical Mexican peasants were landless.
Revolution  In 1910, Díaz jailed Francisco Madero , the opposition 
candidate for president. This act, combined with the growing opposition 
to Díaz’s strong-armed policies, accommodation to foreign powers, and 
opposition to land reform, ignited the Mexican Revolution.  Madero escaped 
and set up revolutionary offices in El Paso, Texas. Then, in 111, Madero’s 
troops, under the command of )rancisco ³3ancho´ 9illa  defeated Mexican 
troops, sending Díaz into exile. One revolutionary leader, Emiliano Zapata , 
began the actual process of redistributing land to impoverished peasants. 
Until 120, Mexico suffered from political instability and devastating 
violence. Between 110 and 120, conflict resulted in around 2 million deaths, 
out of a population of around 15 million people. Political violence continued 
for another decade. However, two results came out of conflicts between 110 
and 10 that provided Mexico with stability for the rest of the century:
• Mexico adopted a new constitution in 11. It included the goals of 
land redistribution, universal suffrage, and public education. These 
principles continued to guide Mexico’s government.
• The Institutional Revolutionary Party , or 35, was formed in 1929. 
Though widely criticized as corrupt, the PRI dominated Mexican 
politics. Until 2000, all presidents were PRI members.

On the surface, modern revolutions appear to follow a similar pattern. 
In The Anatomy of Revolution 18, Crane Brinton described the 
similarities of four political revolutions: the English Revolution of the 
160s, the American Revolution of 16, the French Revolution of 
1789, and the Russian Revolution of 1917. Brinton thought that all four 
revolutions went through four stages.
1. Citizens become dissatisfied with government.
2. Moderates gain more power.
3. Radicals take over in a “terror” phase.
4. The process culminates in a period of relative calm and 
acceptance.
Within this pattern, each revolution had unique revolutionary 
circumstances and outcomes. For example, Brinton acknowledged 
that the American Revolution, unlike the other three, lacked a “terror” 
phase. He concluded his study by noting that some top-down reforms 
imposed by government or elite leaders brought more lasting social 
change than the political revolutions he described.

CAUSES OF WORLD WAR I 461
7.2
Causes of World War I
The next great European war will probably come out of  
some damned foolish thing in the Balkans.
—German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck (1888)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and consequences  
of World War I?
In the years before World War I, social and political developments, including 
shifting powers, contributed to the escalation of tensions that resulted in 
global conflict. European nations, expanding their empires, competed for raw 
material resources in Africa and Asia. A series of mutual alliances created 
entanglements that committed nations to defense systems that would draw 
them into war. Arms races involving Germany, Great Britain, and Russia gave 
military establishments great influence.
The immediate cause of the war’s outbreak had its roots in yet another 
cause of conflict²a rising wave of nationalism. As Bismarck predicted, this 
clash erupted in the Balkans when Serbian nationalists, protesting  Austria-
Hungary’s control over the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, assassinated 
Austro-Hungarian $rchGuNe )ran] )erGinanG . Thus World War I began.
Immediate Causes of the Great War
World War I, which lasted from 1914 to 1918, was known as the  Great  
War ²not because of its positive nature, but because of the immense 
scale of the fighting. No previous war had involved as many nations from 
different parts of the world or killed as many soldiers and civilians. However,  
World War I did more than create an enormous body count. It fundamentally 
weakened the Western European powers, thus encouraging the growth of 
nationalism and appeals for self-rule within European colonies in Asia and 
Africa. Treaties signed at the end of this war helped set the stage for World 
War II. World War I was one of the most significant events of the 20th century.
A long series of events led up to World War I. The immediate cause was 
the assassination by Gavrilo Princip  of $rchGuNe )ran] )erGinanG  the 
heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, on June 28, 11. 
Princip, a Serbian, was a member of the Black Hand , a nationalist 
462WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONorganization devoted to ending Austro-Hungarian presence in the Balkans. 
From the Austro-Hungarian perspective, however, the Black Hand was a 
terrorist group. 
Immediately after the assassinations, Austria-Hungary sent an ultimatum 
to the Serbian government, demanding that it end all anti-Austrian agitation 
in Serbia. When the Serbian government rejected the ultimatum, Austria-
Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28, 11. Austria-Hungary looked to 
its ally Germany, a stronger nation with more firepower, for military assistance 
to punish Serbia. Serbia, populated by ethnic Slavs, looked to other Slavic 
countries, particularly Russia, for help. On August 1, Germany declared war 
on Russia, and two days later on France. The following day, Britain declared 
war on Germany, and on August 6 Austria declared war on Russia. By the end 
of August 11, Japan’s entrance into the conflict changed a relatively minor 
incident into a true world war.
Long-Term Causes of the Great War
Princip’s actions were not the sole cause of World War I. Tensions in Europe 
had been simmering for decades. One way to remember the sources of these 
tensions is with the acronym MAIN: Militarism, Alliances, Imperialism, and 
Nationalism.
Militarism  Defined as aggressive military preparedness, militarism  
celebrates war and the armed forces. European powers had been competing for 
dominance one way to prove their strength was to invest in the military. Great

The arrest of Gavrilo Princip after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in 
Sarajevo, Bosnia, June 28, 11.
463 CAUSES OF WORLD WAR I 463Britain and Germany in particular spent a great deal of money on building up 
their armies and navies, heavily recruiting young men to join their armed forces 
and building more ships and amassing other military hardware. Because of the 
Industrial Revolution, it was possible to mass-produce weapons and supplies. 
A nation’s militaristic attitude influenced its public to view war as a festive 
competition, more like a game than a gravely serious matter. “Everybody said, 
µIt’ll be over by Christmas,’” a British soldier named Bill Haine recalled.
Alliances  In their quest for power, European nations also formed secret 
alliances ²groups whose members secretly agree to protect and help one 
another when attacked. When one member of an alliance was attacked in any 
way, the other members were expected to stand up for that particular member. 
This system explains why Russia and Germany were ready to jump into the 
conflict between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. 
Furthermore, countries that were allied with other countries were also 
sworn enemies of members of other alliances. For example, Britain and France 
were allies with Russia in the alliance called the Triple Entente , and all three 
viewed Germany as a rival²for different reasons. France was bitter about its 
defeat in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) and the loss to Germany of 
Alsace-Lorraine, a major industrial region with rich deposits of iron ore. Both 
Britain and France competed with Germany for colonies in Africa. After the 
war began, the Triple Entente became known as the Allies  as they were joined 
by Italy, Japan, China, the United States, and other countries. By the end of the 
war, there were a total of 2 Allies and “Associated Powers.”
The Allies’ rival alliance before the war was known as the Triple 
Alliance , composed of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. However, 
when the war began, Italy remained neutral until 115, when it switched 
its allegiance and joined the Allies. At the outbreak of the war, the Ottoman 
Empire and Bulgaria joined the former Triple Alliance, which was now 
called the Central Powers .

464WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONImperialism  The alliance system developed largely because Western 
European countries became bitter rivals for global domination. One of the 
most important ways these nations could assert their power and generate 
wealth was to own overseas colonies. During the latter half of the 19th century, 
for example, Western European countries scrambled for any available land 
in Africa to add to the colonies they already owned in Asia, the Americas, 
and the Pacific. Once European powers had claimed nearly all the land in 
Africa, they began fighting with one another over colonies. Thus, imperialism 
was a driving force behind tensions in Europe leading up to the archduke’s 
assassination. Connect: Describe the development of imperialism and how it 
could have led to the tensions of the early 20th century. See Topic 6.2.
Nationalism  The assassination of the archduke in June 1914, the 
immediate cause of war, illustrates the growth of nationalism, the final long-
term cause of the Great War. On a basic level, nationalism originates from 
a feeling of pride in one’s national identity. Multinational empires such as 
the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire had to contend with 
different nationalist movements among their subject peoples. Serbs like Princip 
wanted to rid their land of Austro-Hungarian domination, and Arabs were tired 
of the limitations the Ottoman Empire imposed on them. Both groups sought 
self-determination ²the idea that peoples of the same ethnicity, language, 
culture, and political ideals should be united and should have the right to form 
an independent nation-state. Militant nationalists among Serbs and Arabs 
fought for the Allies, thus extending the boundaries of the Great War.
Consequences of the Great War
As the 20th century began, most Europeans looked forward to a bright future. 
They expected a century of peace guaranteed by alliances, prosperity as a 
result of their colonial empires, and continued progress. All of that optimism 
was shattered on one fateful day in 1914.
Virtually every major event during the remainder of the 20th century was 
a direct or indirect result of World War I. The war led to the downfalls of four 
monarchies: Russia, Austria-Hungary, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire. It 
redrew the maps of Europe and the Middle East with the disintegration of 
Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Germany lost all its overseas colonies 
to various Allied nations, and the former Ottoman provinces of Iraq, Palestine, 
Syria, and Lebanon came under the control of Britain and France. But the war 
also led to the beginning of the end of colonialism.
New technologies made World War I the deadliest and most destructive 
war in human history. It disrupted European economies and had profound 
social consequences, including the rise of communism and fascism, colonial 
revolts, and genocide. There was a massive shift of power from Europe to the 
United States.

“Germany’s military culture developed a constellation of mutually reinforcing 
characteristics that enhanced tactical efficacy. Unleashed in war, however, 
these characteristics propelled the army to ever greater, and in the end, 
dysfunctional extremes of violence. . . . These interactive and self-generating 
characteristics . . . include:
• risk-taking 
• the dogmatic conviction that annihilation was the sole goal of war 
• resulting prescriptions for correct fighting (the offensive, concentration of

• minutely technical planning 
• focus on the tactical and operative rather than the strategic 
• disregard of logistics and thus growing unrealism 
• the conviction indeed requirement of one’s qualitative superiority over one’s 
enemies 
• a romantic ruthlessness and actionism (exaggerated drive for action) on the 
part of officers in order to bridge the gap between risk and reality 
• and finally the acceptance of self-destruction (and thus willingness to destroy 
everyone else, as well).

British poet Wilfred Owen’s “Dulce et Decorum Est” is one of the most 
famous war poems of the 20th century. Most of the poem describes the horrors 
of modern warfare, and the final lines of the excerpt, translated as “It is sweet 
and noble to die for one’s country,” he labels “The old Lie.” No previous war 
had involved as many nations from different parts of the world and none had 
killed as many soldiers and civilians.
At the outbreak of World War I, Britain was the only major power going 
into the war without universal conscription , compulsory enlistment in the 
armed forces. Realizing that patriotism could be contagious, the British Army 
began to recruit “Pals Battalions” made up of men who already knew each 
other. The first of these was made up of a group of stockbrokers from the City 
of London. Other Pals Battalions were recruited in cities throughout Britain, 
such as Liverpool and Manchester. Because the men who volunteered were 
friends or associates, these battalions were especially close knit. By the end of 
the war, one out of four British men had served in the military.
Changes in Warfare
Many modern films such as 6aving 3rivate 5yan, set during World War  II, 
and Platoon , set during the Vietnam War,  show that war is not a glorious 
experience, but most Europeans saw warfare differently during the first 
few months of World War I. “Everybody said, µIt’ll be over by Christmas,’ 
” a British soldier named Bill Haine recalled. The war began in June 11. 
470 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONHundreds of thousands of teenage boys enthusiastically enlisted in the military, 
dreaming of heroism. Wartime assemblies sounded more like high school pep 
rallies, in which speakers naively predicted swift and easy victories in battles 
against supposedly inferior enemies. Leaders of some of the socialist parties 
were among the few Europeans who spoke out against the war. Even socialists 
were divided on the issue, however, as many supported the war efforts of their 
nation.
At the time, few people actually understood how brutal 20th-century 
warfare could be. As the war dragged on, the world became aware of the 
horrific effects of new advances in war technology and tactics, such as trench 
warfare, poison gas, machine guns, submarines, airplanes, and tanks. 
•  The defining experience for most soldiers in this war was the 
time spent in the trenches, long ditches dug in the ground with the 
excavated earth banked in front in order to defend against enemy fire. 
Trench warfare  was not a glorious way to fight a war. Combatant 
nations dug hundreds of miles of trenches facing one another, and 
soldiers slept, ate, and fought in the trenches for months at a time. 
Trenches were often cold, muddy, and rat-infested. Many soldiers 
died from diseases caused by unhygienic conditions. Erich Maria 
Remarque’s 12 novel, $ll 4uiet on the :estern )ront,  and the 1930 
film based on it give a vivid sense of a soldier’s life in the trenches. 
Remarque was a young German soldier during World War I.
•  Poison gas  was one of the most insidious weapons of the new style 
of warfare. Chlorine, phosgene, and mustard gas were used during 
World War I. Soldiers were soon equipped with gas masks, which were 
effective when used immediately. Although fatalities were limited, 
the effects of a gas attack could be extremely painful and long lasting. 
Many veterans suffered permanent damage to their lungs. After the 
war, international treaties outlawed the use of poison gas.
•  Developed in the late 1800s, machine guns could fire more than 500 
rounds of ammunition per minute, increasing the deadly impact of 
warfare. The weapon made it difficult for either side in a battle to gain 
new territory.
•  Although primitive submarines  had been used briefly in the American 
Civil War, they played a much larger part in World War I, wreaking 
havoc on the shipping lanes of the Atlantic Ocean.
•  Airplanes  in 11 were still light, small, and unable to carry many 
weapons. Therefore, they did not present much of a threat to troops, 
vehicles, or ships. At first, airplanes were used mainly to carry on 
reconnaissance observation of enemy lines. By 115 they were being 
fitted with machine guns and aerial combat began. Individual “air 
aces” would engage in “dog fights” with enemy aircraft.
•  The British developed tanks  to protect troops as they moved across 
vast areas of difficult terrain, even over trenches, with the ability to fire 
471 CONDUCTING WORLD WAR I 471at the enemy. They were developed by the Royal Navy, and originally 
referred to as landships . They got their name from the fact that during 
their development, they were disguised as water tanks.
With both the Central Powers and the Allies using brutal weapons and 
tactics, neither side could defeat the other. The result was a bloody four-year 
stalemate  in which the death toll and suffering rose ever higher.
The United States Enters the War
Economic ties between the United States and the Allies were one underlying 
reasons for U.S. entry into the war in 11. In addition, many Americans 
believed that the Allied nations were more democratic than the Central Powers 
were. A third reason was growing resentment against the Germans, especially for 
U-boat  (submarine attacks on ships carrying civilians, including Americans. 
On May , 115, a German submarine attacked and sank the Lusitania , an 
ocean liner carrying more than 100 U.S. citizens among its passengers. 
The event that finally pushed the United States into the war was the 
interception of the Zimmermann  Telegram  in January 1917. In this document, 
the German government offered to help Mexico reclaim territory it had lost to 
the United States in 188 if Mexico allied itself with Germany in the war .
Total War
Combatant nations intensified the conflict in World War I by committing all 
their resources to the war effort. This strategy, known as total war , meant 
that a nation’s domestic population, in addition to its military, was committed 
to winning the war. Thus, millions of civilians, including women, worked 
in factories producing war materials. Workers imported from China helped 
make up for labor shortages in Britain, France, and Russia. Entire economies 
were centered on winning the war. Governments set up planning boards that 
set production quotas, price and wage controls, and the rationing of food and 
other supplies. They censored the media and imprisoned many who spoke out 
against the war effort.
Propaganda was another component of total war. Propaganda  is 
communication meant to influence the attitudes and opinions of a community 
around a particular subject by spreading inaccurate or slanted information. 
Governments invested heavily in army and navy recruitment campaigns and 
other wartime propaganda. Posters and articles in newspapers and magazines 
often depicted the enemy crudely or misrepresented the facts of the war 
completely. For example, American and British propaganda demonized the 
German army, exaggerating reports of atrocities against civilians. Likewise, 
German propaganda demonized the Americans and the British. 
The use of highly emotional and often misleading information fomented 
hatred and bitterness across borders, among civilians as well as soldiers. Other 
propaganda was more subtle. For example, the U.S. government sent artists 
to the front lines in Europe to illustrate scenes of battle and glorify Allied 
soldiers.
472 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONA Global War
World War I was fought in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Pacific and Atlantic 
Oceans. Not since the Seven Years’ War of the late 18th century had there 
been such a global war . Most of the major combatants in World War  I ruled 
colonies in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and the Pacific. Competition for these 
colonies was one major reason for war. Imperialism extended the boundaries 
of the war, and major battles were fought in North Africa and the Middle East. 
Japan entered the war on the side of the Allies so that it could take control of 
German colonies in the Pacific²the Marshall Islands, the Mariana Islands, 
Palau, and the Carolines. Japan also occupied Tsingtao Qingdao, a German-
held port in China.
The British seized most of Germany’s colonies in Africa. However, the 
Germans held on to German East Africa, later called Tanzania. The British also 
defended the Suez Canal from an attack by the Ottoman Empire. 
Colonial troops reinforced their home countries’ forces in several battles. 
About half a million Australians and New =ealanders enlisted to fight the 
war. These troops formed a special corps known as ANZAC  and fought in a 
bloody year-long campaign at Gallipoli , a peninsula in northwestern Turkey, 
that resulted in heavy Allied losses with little to show for the effort. Canadian 
troops fought in several European battles. Britain drafted Africans and Indians 
for combat roles in Europe. Some 0,000 Gurkha soldiers from Nepal fought in 
the Indian Army. Approximately 1. million soldiers served in the Indian Army Posters recruiting sailors and soldiers for World War I in the United States and Great Britain reflected how 
governments used art and media to appeal to nationalist feelings in the early 20th century.

50,000 Africans, mostly from West Africa and Algeria, as well as another 
110,000 Europeans from North Africa. Some ,000 Indochinese soldiers 
fought in the French army, with nearly 50,000 more working in support roles 
behind the lines. Some colonial troops fought in hopes that their efforts would  
gain them recognition from their colonizers, who often promised the colonies 
self-rule after the war ended.
Arabs, long under the rule of the Turkish-led Ottoman Empire, fought with 
the Allies because the British promised self-rule after the war if they were 
victorious. Arab troops attacked Ottoman forts in Arabia and present-day Israel 
and helped the British take over the cities of Baghdad, Damascus, and 
Jerusalem.

474 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONWomen and the War  In the early 20th century, most countries did not 
allow women to vote or to be soldiers. However, the sheer numbers of men 
enlisting meant that women’s lives changed significantly. They began replacing 
those men on farms and in factories. Thousands of women served on the front 
lines as nurses, ambulance drivers, and switchboard operators. 
Most countries forebade women from serving in combat, but Russia, 
Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria allowed it. In 11, the Russian government 
created an all-female battalion military unit as propaganda to shame men into 
continuing to fight. The commander Maria Bochkareva led the First Russian 
Women’s Battalion of Death.
The Paris Peace Conference
The war itself greatly damaged Europe. However, the peace conference held in 
its wake would have even more profound effects on the entire world. The leaders 
of the victorious countries at the Paris Peace Conference  became known as 
the Big Four:  Woodrow Wilson  United States, David Lloyd George  (Great 
Britain), Georges Clemenceau  (France), and Vittorio Orlando  (Italy). The 
Italians walked out of the peace conference in a rage because Italy would not 
get Dalmatia and other territories that they had been promised for joining the 
Allies, including the city of Fiume on the Adriatic Sea. Russia was not invited 
to the conference because it had undergone a communist revolution. Russia’s 
Bolshevik leaders refused to honor Russia’s financial debts to the Allies, who 
in return refused to recognize the Bolshevik government.
The Big Four had different visions of how to settle the peace. President 
Wilson’s pledge to establish “peace without victory” reflected his belief that 
no one country should be severely punished or greatly rewarded. France’s 
Clemenceau rejected this view. He believed that France, out of all the Allies 
represented at the conference, had suffered the most and thus deserved special 
considerations to be protected from Germany. He also argued that the victorious 
powers should seek some sort of revenge on the Central Powers for starting the 
war. Clemenceau complained that Wilson was an unrealistic idealist who was 
naive about European relations, even though Wilson had a Ph.D. in history. 
David Lloyd George tended to support Clemenceau’s ideas, but he often acted 
as an intermediary between the two differing points of view.
Fourteen Points  Despite Clemenceau’s protests, Wilson pushed for his 
principles, which he outlined in a document called the Fourteen Points . He 
particularly wanted to create a League of Nations , an organization in which 
all nations of the world would convene to discuss conflicts openly, as a way to 
avoid the simmering tensions that had caused World War I. Although the other 
nations agreed to establish the League, the U.S. Senate voted against joining 
it and against ratifying the Treaty of Versailles , the 1919 peace treaty with 
Germany.

Powers deserved the right to self-determination , to decide their own political 
futures. Instead of the colonies and territories of the Central Powers being 
snatched up by the Allies, conquered peoples should have the right to decide 
their own political fate. A number of new nations were created or resurrected 
in Europe as the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires were broken up: 
Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. 
The last three of these were home to Slavic peoples. 
The Treaty of Versailles  Because Wilson failed to convince France 
and Britain not to punish Germany, the Treaty of Versailles treated Germany 
harshly. Most notably, Germany had to pay billions of dollars in reparations  
for damage caused by the war, give up all of its colonies, and restrict the size 
of its armed forces. Germans took the entire blame for the war. Signing the 
treaty was humiliating for German leaders. Moreover, the terms of the treaty 
caused tremendous hardship to the nation during the decade following World  
War I. The German economy suffered from sky-high inflation, partly due 
to the reparations the country was forced to pay. The German people were 
bitter in the immediate aftermath of the Paris Peace Conference. Resentment 
toward the Weimar Republic , which had agreed to the terms of the Treaty of 
Versailles, set the stage for an extreme and militaristic political party known 
as the Nazis to take power barely 15 years later. Connect: Compare the forces

478WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:  IDENTI-@ SUPPORTING E=IDENCE
In 1914, on hearing of German atrocities toward Belgians, the British 
government undertook its own investigation headed up by 9iscount James 
Bryce, a widely respected  scholar, a former ambassador to the United States, 
and a friend of President Wilson. His committee reviewed the depositions of 
1200 witnesses, though they did not do the actual interviewing of the witnesses. 
Nor were the depositions given under oath. In order to make the report as 
credible as possible, the committee decided to leave out the most sensational 
accounts. The final report used 500 of the 1200 reports. It was translated 
into 30 languages and was reprinted in the 1ew <orN 7imes  Even though the 
most violent and lurid reports were eliminated, the report still detailed many 
gruesome acts and presented the following conclusions:
“It is proved:
i That there were in many parts of Belgium deliberate and 
systematically organized massacres of the civil population, 
accompanied by many isolated murders and other outrages.
ii That in the conduct of the war generally innocent civilians, both 
men and women, were murdered in large numbers, women violated, 
and children murdered.
iii That looting, house burning, and the wanton destruction of 
property were ordered and countenanced by the officers of the 
German Army, that elaborate provisions had been made for systematic 
incendiarism at the very outbreak of the war, and that the burnings 
and destruction were frequent where no military necessity could be 
alleged, being indeed part of a system of general terrorization.
iv That the rules and usages of war were frequently broken, 
particularly by the using of civilians, including women and children, 
as a shield for advancing forces exposed to fire, to a less degree by 
killing the wounded and prisoners, and in the frequent abuse of the 
Red Cross and the White Flag.
Sensible as they are of the gravity of these conclusions, the Committee 
conceive that they would be doing less than their duty if they failed 
to record them as fully established by the evidence. Murder, lust, and 
pillage prevailed over many parts of Belgium on a scale unparalleled 
in any war between civilised nations during the last three centuries.
Our function is ended when we have stated what the evidence 
establishes, but we may be permitted to express our belief that these 
disclosures will not have been made in vain if they touch and rouse 
the conscience of mankind, and we venture to hope that as soon as the 
present war is over, the nations of the world in council will consider 
what means can be provided and sanctions devised to prevent the 
recurrence of such horrors as our generation is now witnessing.”

Economy in the Interwar Period
>e had to struggle with the old enemies of peace·business and financial 
monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism,  
war profiteering 
—U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1936)
Essential Question:   How did different governments respond to economic 
crises after 1900?
Not long after the global trauma of World War I, a global economic crisis 
resulted in the Great Depression of the 1930s and eventually led to World War 
II. It undermined faith in the market-based economics that had delivered such 
wealth as imperialism spread. As unemployment, hunger, and homelessness 
increased, people turned to their governments for help. Governments had 
long been essential to capitalism²building roads, providing schools, and 
regulating trade²but across the world in the 10s, government intervention 
in the economy increased. The United States became more liberal as President 
Roosevelt identified inequities and activities that undermined the economy 
and could lead to war. Countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, however, 
turned radically to the right. In Russia, government economic control was 
instituted through the implementation of often repressive Five-Year Plans 
based on production quotas.
The Great Depression
From today’s perspective, the effects of World War I can look small compared 
to the even greater destruction caused by World War II. However, the effects  
were massive. Many Western Europeans felt bewildered. World War I brought 
anxiety to the people who suffered through it. The Allied nations, though 
victorious, had lost millions of citizens, both soldiers and civilians, and had 
spent tremendous amounts of money on the international conflict. The defeated 
Central Powers, particularly Germany and the countries that emerged from the 
breakup of Austria-Hungary, suffered even greater losses.
The Treaty of 9ersailles forced Germany to pay billions of dollars in 
reparations to the war’s victors. War-ravaged Germany could not make these 
payments, so its government printed more paper money in the 1920s.
481 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO DThis action caused inflation, a general rise in prices. Inflation meant that 
the value of German money decreased drastically. To add to the sluggish 
postwar economy, France and Britain had difficulty repaying wartime loans 
from the United States, partly because Germany was having trouble paying 
reparations to them. In addition, the Soviet government refused to pay Russia’s 
prerevolutionary debts.
Global Downturn  Although the 120s brought modest economic gains 
for most of Europe, the subsequent Great Depression  ended the tentative 
stability. Agricultural overproduction and the United States’ stock market crash 
in 12 were two major causes of the global economic downturn. American 
investors who had been putting money into German banks removed it when 
the American stock market crashed. In addition to its skyrocketing inflation, 
Germany then had to grapple with bank failures. Germany thus suffered more 
than any other Western nation during the Great Depression. The economies 
of Africa, Asia, and Latin America suffered because they depended on the 
imperial nations that were experiencing this enormous economic downturn. 
Japan also suffered during the Depression because its economy depended 
on foreign trade. With the economic decline in the rest of the world, Japan’s 
exports were cut in half between 12 and 11.

Keynesian Economics  The Great Depression inspired new insights into 
economics. British economist John Maynard Keynes  rejected the laissez-
faire ideal. He concluded that intentional government action could improve 
the economy. During a depression, he said, governments should use Geficit 
spending  (spending more than the government takes in) to stimulate economic 
activity. By cutting taxes and increasing spending, governments would spur 
economic growth. People would return to work, and the depression would end. 
New Deal  The administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  
used .eynes’s ideas to address the Great Depression in the United States. 
Roosevelt and his backers created a group of policies and programs known 
collectively as the New Deal . Its goal was to bring the country relief, recovery, 
and reform: relief  for citizens who were suffering, including the poor, the 
unemployed, farmers, minorities, and women recovery  to bring the nation out 
of the Depression, in part through government spending and reform  to change 
government policies in the hopes of avoiding such disasters in the future.
By 1937, unemployment was declining and production was rising. 
.eynesian economics seemed to be working. However, Roosevelt feared 
that government deficits were growing too large, so he reversed course. 
Unemployment began to grow again. The Great Depression finally ended after 
the United States entered World War II in 11 and ran up deficits for military 
spending that dwarfed those of the New Deal programs. 
Impact on Trade  The Great Depression was a global event. Though it 
started in the industrialized countries of the United States and Europe, it spread 
to Latin America, Africa, and Asia. By 12, more than 0 million people 
worldwide were out of work. People everywhere turned to their governments 
483 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO Dfor help. As unemployment increased, international trade declined, a decline 
made worse as nations then imposed strict tariffs, or taxes on imports, in an 
effort to protect the domestic jobs they still had. 
In contrast to most countries, Japan dug itself out of the Depression 
relatively rapidly. Japan devalued its currency that is, the government lowered 
the value of its money in relation to foreign currencies. Thus, Japanese-made 
products became less expensive than imports. Japan’s overseas expansionism 
also increased Japan’s need for military goods and stimulated the economy. 
Political Revolutions in Russia and Mexico
In the century’s first two decades, rebellions erupted against long-standing 
authoritarian governments in Mexico, China, and Russia. See Topic .1. 
Revolutionaries unseated the ruling governments in each country, instituting 
their own political philosophies and practices. The revolutions influenced 
subsequent events in the Soviet Union, Mexico, and China in the interwar 
years. Each country took a different approach to managing their national 
economy.
Continuing Revolution in Russia  Although Lenin and the Bolshevik 
Party had promised “peace, land, and bread” during World War I, they instead 
presided over a populace that faced starvation during the widespread Russian 
Civil War  118±121. Hundreds of thousands of Russians, Ukrainians, 
and others revolted against the Russian government’s actions. Urban factory 
workers and sailors went on strike, and peasants began to hoard their food 
stocks. Industrial and agricultural production dropped sharply.
By 1921, Lenin realized that the Russian economy was near complete 
collapse. In an attempt to remedy this, he instituted a temporary retreat 
from communist economic policies. Under his New Economic Plan  (NEP ), 
he reintroduced private trade, allowing farmers to sell their products on a 
small scale. Although the government permitted some economic liberties, it 
maintained strict political control. The NEP enjoyed modest successes, but it 
came to an end when Lenin died in 1924.
Joseph Stalin  Several years after Lenin’s death, Joseph Stalin took 
control of the Politburo , the Communist Party’s central organization, setting 
himself up as a dictator. He remained in power for almost 0 years. Once in 
power, Stalin abandoned Lenin’s NEP and instituted the first Five-Year Plan , 
which was meant to transform the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  (also 
called the USSR  or the Soviet Union  into an industrial power. He wanted his 
largely agricultural nation to “catch up” to the industrial nations of the West. 
At the same time, Stalin collectiYi]eG  agriculture, a process in which farmland 
was taken from private owners and given to collectives to manage. In theory, a 
collective, or NolNho], was a group of peasants who freely joined together to 
farm a certain portion of land. In practice, however, peasants were forced by 
the state to work on a specific collective and were expected to follow detailed 
plans and to reach specific goals set by the government. 
484WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThis elimination of private land ownership and the forced redistribution 
of land, livestock, and tools enraged farmers. Each year, the government 
seized food to send to the cities. The farmers retaliated against collectivization 
by burning crops and killing livestock. Many moved to the cities for a better 
life.
A series of five-year plans had mixed results. The collectivization of 
agriculture was a huge failure. Millions of peasants starved to death, especially 
in the Ukraine. However, heavy industry grew tremendously in the 10s. 
Although consumer goods were in short supply, there were plenty of factory 
jobs available, and the cost of living was low.
Stalin’s brutal regime is widely condemned today. He punished his political 
opponents by executing them or sentencing them to life terms in gulags , or 
labor camps, where many died. In addition, his agricultural policies led to the 
deaths of many millions of Soviet citizens. Because Stalin kept tight control 
of the press, details of his atrocities went largely unreported. Nonetheless, in 
the 10s, an economically depressed world viewed the U.S.S.R. with a mix

Topic 5.8.)
Party Rule in Mexico  The economy took a different direction in Mexico. 
The Mexican revolution saw the emergence of one strong political party, the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI. This party dominated Mexican 
politics for most of the 20th century. The Mexican political system has often 
been called corporatist since the ruling PRI party claimed favors, such as access 
to primary education and jobs created through improvements to infrastructure, 
for its constituents.
During PRI’s rule, there was a vast improvement in the economy, 
especially in the period from 1930 to the 1970s. In the 1930s, efforts at land 
reform were successful under /i]aro CirGenas . In 1938, for example, his 
regime nationalized the country’s mostly foreign-owned oil industry, angering 
foreign investors. This company, Petryleos Mexicanos or PEMEX , became 
the second largest state-owned company in the world. Despite these reforms, 
however, the interwar period did not see dramatic changes in Mexico’s social 
hierarchy.
Rise of Right-Wing Governments
In some countries, the turn to the right was radical. A new political system 
known as fascism  arose that appealed to extreme nationalism, glorified the 
military and armed struggle, and blamed problems on ethnic minorities. 
Fascist regimes suppressed other political parties, protests, and independent 
trade unions. They justified violence to achieve their goals and were strongly 
anticommunist. Germany turned to fascism (see Topic 7.6), and some other 
countries did as well.
485 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO DRise of Fascism in Italy  Benito Mussolini coined the term fascism,  
which comes from the term fasces , a bundle of sticks tied around an axe, which 
was an ancient Roman symbol for authority. This symbol helped characterize 
Italy’s Fascist government, which glorified militarism and brute force. 
The Italian fascist state was based on a concept known as corporatism , 
a theory based on the notion that the sectors of the economy²the employers, 
the trade unions, and state officials²are seen as separate organs of the same 
body. Each sector, or organ, was supposedly free to organize itself as it wished 
as long as it supported the whole. In practice, the fascist state imposed its will 
upon all sectors of society, creating a totalitarian state ²a state in which the 
government controls all aspects of society.
Mussolini Takes Control  Even though Italy had been considered 
one of the victors at the 11 Paris Peace Conference²along with Britain, 
France, and the United States²Italy received very little territory from the 
Treaty of Versailles. This failure to gain from the war caused discontent in 
Italy. Amid the general bitterness of the 120s, Mussolini and his allies in the 
Fascist Party managed to take control of the parliament. Mussolini became a 
dictator, repressing any possible opposition to his rule. Militaristic propaganda 
infiltrated every part of the Fascist government. For example, schoolchildren 
were taught constantly about the glory of their nation and their fearless leader, 
“Il Duce .” 
Part of Mussolini’s fascist philosophy was the need to conquer what he 
considered an inferior nation. During the imperialist “Scramble for Africa” in 
the 19th century, Italy seized Libya  and colonized Italian  Somaliland , now 
part of Somalia. However, the Italian army was pushed back by Abyssinia, 
modern-day Ethiopia, in the 180s. In 1, Mussolini called for the complete 
conquest of Abyssinia. In 15, 100,000 Italian troops crossed the border from 
Somaliland to Abyssinia, defying sanctions from the League of Nations. This 
time, the Italian army overpowered Abyssinia’s while the global community 
did little to stop the conquest. Many historians believe the Abyssinian crisis 
destroyed the League of Nations’ credibility. In 16, Mussolini and Germany’s 
Adolf Hitler formed an alliance they hoped would dominate Europe. 
Fascism and Civil War in Spain  After the economic decline in the early 
10s, two opposing ideologies, or systems of ideas, battled for control of 
Spain. The Spanish Civil War  that resulted soon took on global significance 
as a struggle between the forces of democracy and the forces of fascism.
The Spanish Republic formed in 11 after .ing Alfonso 9III abdicated. 
In 16, the Spanish people elected the Popular Front , a coalition of left-
wing parties, to lead the government. A key aspect of the Front’s platform 
was land reform, a prospect that energized the nation’s peasants and radicals. 
Conservative forces in Spain, such as the Catholic Church and high-ranking 
members of the military, were violently opposed to the changes that the Popular 
Front promised. In July of the same year, Spanish troops stationed in Morocco 
conducted a military uprising against the Popular Front. This action marked the 
beginning of the Spanish Civil War, which soon spread to Spain itself. General 
486WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONFrancisco Franco  led the insurgents, who called themselves Nationalists . On 
the other side were the Republicans  or Loyalists , the defenders of the newly 
elected Spanish Republic.
Foreign Involvement  Although the nations of Europe had signed a 
nonintervention agreement, Hitler of Germany, Mussolini of Italy, and Antonio 
Salazar of Portugal contributed armaments to the Nationalists. Civilian 
volunteers from the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France 
contributed their efforts to the Loyalists. Many historians believe that without 
the help of Germany, Italy, and Portugal, the Nationalist side probably would 
not have prevailed against the Republic of Spain.
Guernica  The foreign involvement in Spain’s struggle also escalated the 
violence of the war. One massacre in particular garnered international attention. 
The German and Italian bombing of the town of Guernica  in northern Spain’s 
Basque region  was one of the first times in history an aerial bombing targeted 
civilians. Many historians believe that the bombing of Guernica was a military 
exercise for Germany’s air force, the Luftwaffe .
The tragedy of Guernica was immortalized in Pablo Picasso’s painting of 
that name, commissioned by the Republic of Spain and completed in 18. 
Although abstract, the painting brilliantly depicts the horrific violence of 
modern warfare and is one of the most significant works of 20th-century art.

Franco’s Victory  The Spanish Civil War 16±1 ended when 
Franco’s forces defeated the Loyalist army. He ruled Spain as a dictator until 
his death in 15. Spain did not officially enter World War II 1±15, but 
the government offered some help to Germany, Italy, and Japan.
5ise oI a 5eSressiYe 5eJiPe in %ra]il  As in Europe, parts of Latin 
America also became more conservative. During the interwar years, Brazil 
was considered Latin America’s “sleeping giant” because of its slow shift 
487 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO Dfrom an agricultural to an industrial economy. Large landowners dominated 
the nation’s economy, which frustrated members of the urban middle class. 
Compounding their frustration was the workers’ suffering caused by the Great 
Depression. Discontent led to a bloodless 10 coup, or illegal seizure of 
power, which installed Getulio Vargas as president.
9argas’s pro-industrial policies won him support from Brazil’s urban 
middle class. They believed he would promote democracy. However, his actions 
paralleled those of Italy’s corporate state under Mussolini. While Brazil’s 
industrial sector grew rapidly, 9argas began to strip away individual political 
freedoms. His Estado Novo  “New State” program instituted government 
censorship of the press, abolition of political parties, imprisonment of political 
opponents, and hypernationalism , a belief in the superiority of one’s nation 
over all others and the single-minded promotion of national interests. While 
these policies were similar to those of European fascists, the Brazilian 
government did not praise or rely on violence to achieve and maintain control.
Moreover, even though Brazil had close economic ties with the United 
States and Germany in the late 10s, Brazil finally sided with the Allies in 
World War II. This political alignment against the Axis powers made Brazil 
look less like a dictatorship and more liberal than it actually was. World War II 
prompted the people of Brazil to push for a more democratic nation later. They 
came to see the contradiction between fighting fascism and repression abroad 
and maintaining a dictatorship at home.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS 
Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“It has been repeated ad nauseam >to a sickening degree@ that the oil industry 
has brought additional capital for the development and progress of the country. 
This assertion is an exaggeration. For many years throughout the major period 
of their existence, oil companies have enjoyed great privileges for development 
and expansion, including customs and tax exemptions and innumerable 
prerogatives. . . . Potential wealth of the Nation miserably underpaid native 
labor tax exemptions economic privileges governmental tolerance²these 
are the factors of the boom of the Mexican oil industry. .  . . These organizations, 
whether authorized by the Government or not, are charged with innumerable 
outrages, abuses, and murders, always on behalf of the companies that employ 
them. . . .
It was therefore necessary to adopt a definite and legal measure to end this 
permanent state of affairs in which the country sees its industrial progress held 
back by those who hold in their hands the power to erect obstacles. . . . It is 
necessary that all groups of the population be imbued with a full optimism and 
that each citizen, whether in agricultural, industrial, commercial, transportation, 
or other pursuits, develop a greater activity from this moment on, in order to 
create new resources which will reveal that the spirit of our people is capable 
of saving the nation’s economy by the efforts of its own citizens.”

491 ECONO MY IN T HE INTER WAR PERIO DTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:  SIGNIFICANCE  OF HISTORICAL  SITUATION
When Mexico nationalized the oil industry, some foreign countries whose oil 
companies were taken over boycotted Mexican oil and urged consumers to 
boycott other Mexican products. As a result, Nazi Germany became Mexico’s 
biggest customer for oil. The United States, however, had a “Good Neighbor” 
policy with Mexico and took a softer approach.

7hen answer the Tuestions that follow
“The Government of the United States . . . notes that the applicable 
precedents and recognized authorities on international law support its 
declaration that, under every rule of law and equity, no government is 
entitled to expropriate private property, for whatever purpose, without 
provision for prompt, adequate, and effective payment therefor. . . .
My Government considers that its own practice has amply 
demonstrated that it is the consistent friend of reform, that it has 
every sympathy with misfortune and need, and that it recognizes fully 
the necessities of the under-privileged. It cannot, however, accept 
the idea that these high objectives justify, or for that matter require, 
infringement on the law of nations or the upsetting of constitutionally 
recognized guarantees. . . .
Every sovereign nation is in possession of powers to regulate its 
internal affairs, to reorganize, when needful, its entire economic, 
financial, and industrial structure, and to achieve social ends by 
methods conforming with law.
Instead of using these recognized and orderly methods, the 
Government of Mexico in effect suggests that whenever special 
conditions or circumstances obtain in any one country, that country 
is entitled to expect all the other nations of the world to accept a 
change in the settled rules and principles of law, which are domestic 
quite as much as international, solely in order to assist the country 
in question to extricate itself from difficulties for which it is itself 
entirely responsible. Specifically, it is proposed to replace the rule of 
just compensation by rule of confiscation. Adoption by the nations of 
the world of any such theory as that would result in the immediate 
breakdown of confidence and trust between nations, and in such 
progressive deterioration of international economic and commercial 
relations as would imperil the very foundations of modern civilization. 
Human progress would be fatally set back. . . .
492 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe vital interest of all governments and of all peoples in this question 
and the imperative need of all countries to maintain unimpaired the 
structure of common justice embodied in international as well as in 
basic national law, lead me, particularly in view of the warm friendship 
existing between the two countries, to appeal most earnestly to the 
Mexican Government to refrain from persisting in a policy and 
example which, if generally pursued, will seriously jeopardize the 
interests of all peoples throughout the world.”

Unresolved Tensions After 
World  War I
The British Government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their 
freedom, but has debased it economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually.
—Indian National Congress, Declaration of Purna Swaraj  
(Independence +ay 9esolution, 1anuary 2, 1930)
Essential Question:   How did continuities and changes in territorial holdings 
create tensions after World War I?
As economic crises beset countries after World War I, unresolved disputes 
over the control of land continued to fester. The victors in the war, European 
powers and Japan, generally kept or expanded control over colonial territories. 
However, anti-imperial resistance was growing throughout Asia and Africa. 
In a larger context, the spread of nationalism in these regions was part of the 
same global trend that included the breakup of empires in Europe, the success 
of communism in Russia, and the spread of anti-immigrant sentiments in the 
United States. The example of Turkey’s push for self-determination was already 
discussed in Topic .1. Similarly, events such as the May th Movement in 
China and groups such as the Indian National Congress demonstrated how 
nationalism was spreading throughout the world.
(σecWsRfWKe:DU
The effects of World War I varied around the world. The United States 
prospered because of all the war materials and agricultural products it sold 
to Britain and the other Allies. By contrast, the European countries that 
suffered the greatest damage in the war were economically devastated.
Effects on Colonial Lands  While nationalist movements had been 
brewing for decades in colonies in South Asia and West Africa, the war 
renewed the hopes of people in these regions for independence. African and 
Asian colonial troops contributed thousands of soldiers to the Allied war 
effort. In addition, this disastrous war showed colonial peoples that imperial 
powers such as Britain and France were not invincible.
German propaganda during the war had predicted that colonial soldiers’ 
experience in the war would lead to a great uprising against colonial rule. 
494 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThis did not materialize, although there were several local rebellions. 
Between November 115 and September 116, a large group of villages in 
French West Africa, between the 9 olta and Bani rivers in what later became 
Burkina Faso, united in an effort to drive out the French. It was only with 
a great effort and loss of life on both sides that the French managed to put 
down the revolt. The rebellion forced the French to recognize that they had 
an obligation to the people they colonized. After World War I, many war 
veterans from the French colonies assisted in colonial administration after 
they returned home.
Colonized people’s war experiences raised their expectations. They 
thought that the principle of self-determination, as expressed in Wilson’s 
Fourteen Points, would get them closer to self-rule. Nationalists in Africa 
and Asia hoped that the blood they had shed for their “home countries” 
would earn them some respect from Western Europe and thus begin a 
Gecoloni]ation  process. 
However, the peace conference’s Big Three ²David Lloyd George, 
Woodrow Wilson, and Georges Clemenceau after Italy left²were not 
interested in freeing the colonies. After World War I, European powers 
granted self-determination only to white countries in Eastern Europe. Middle 
Eastern lands that had been a part of the  Ottoman Empire came under the 
control of France and Britain in the League of Nations mandate system. Former 
German colonies in Africa had the same fate. German territories and spheres 
of influence in East Asia and the Pacific were transferred to various victorious 
nations of World War I. India and nearly every nation in Africa²as well as 
most of the Middle East²continued to be controlled by European nations.
Wilson even refused to meet with a group of Vietnamese nationalists, 
including a young Ho Chi Minh, who asked to speak with him about 
self-determination for Vietnam. This rejection fueled stronger nationalist 
movements in colonies scattered across the southern rim of Asia and in 
parts of Africa. The seeds of African, Arab, and Asian nationalism were 
sown largely in the aftermath of World War  I, although they did not come to 
fruition until much later.
The Mandate System
Arab rebels of the former Ottoman Empire were especially insulted by the 
results of the peace conference. They had been promised self-rule if they fought 
with the Allies. Instead, the Allies forgot all of their promises and, through the 
League of Nations, established a mandate  system  to rule the colonies and 
territories of the Central Powers. Article 22 of the League of Nations charter 
stated that colonized people in Africa and Asia required “tutelage” from more 
“advanced” nations in order to survive. Thus, the Allied countries²including 
France, Great Britain, and Japan²were able to increase their imperial holdings 
through a new form of colonization. For example, Cameroon, which had been 
a German colony, was divided and transferred to France and Britain as separate 
mandates. Japan seized the German-held islands of the Western Pacific.
495 UNRESOL=ED  TENSIONS  A-TER WORLD WAR  I495The Middle East experienced enormous upheaval because of the fall of the 
Ottoman Empire. Palestine, Transjordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq all became 
League of Nations mandates. These Arab states were not yet sovereign lands 
but virtual colonies of Great Britain and France. This infuriated the Arabs who 
lived in these lands and set the stage for a nationalist movement known as  
Pan-Arabism —an ideology that called for the unification of all lands in North 
Africa and the Middle East.
Another source of conflict arose in 11, when the British government 
issued the Balfour Declaration , which stated that Palestine  should become a 
permanent home for the Jews of Europe. Those who supported a Jewish 
homeland were known as Zionists . After the Allied victory in the Great War, 
European Jews moved in droves to Palestine, which Britain controlled.
Anti-Colonialism in South Asia
The setback presented by the Paris Conference inspired anticolonial activists 
to redouble their efforts. In South Asia, the Indian National Congress  formed 
in the late 19th century to air grievances against the colonial government. By 
the end of World War I in 118, it had become a strong voice for independence.
Massacre at Amritsar  In the spring of 1919, a group of Indian 
nationalists gathered in a public garden in Amritsar, Punjab, to protest the

had recently made such public gatherings illegal. Armed colonial forces fired 
hundreds of shots into the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 379 people and 
wounding 1,200 more. 
The Amritsar massacre radicalized many Indians. It convinced moderate 
members of the Indian National Congress that independence from Britain was 
the only way forward.
Gandhi  By the 1920s, Mohandas Gandhi  had brought the congress’s 
cause to the Indian masses and caught the attention of the world. His 
satyagraha  “devotion-to-truth” movement  embarked on a campaign of civil 
disobedience  that encouraged Indians to break unjust laws and serve jail time. 
These actions, he believed, would stir the consciousness of the empire and the 
international community and expose the injustice of Britain’s imperial system.
Gandhi, who came to be known by Indians as Mahatma , or “the great 
soul,” led a boycott against British goods. After returning to India from South 
Africa, Gandhi wore the traditional cotton Hindu dhoti  rather than the Western-
style suits he had worn as a lawyer in Natal. Wearing homespun clothes was 
a form of protest against British fabrics made from Indian cotton and sold to 
Indians at inflated prices. 
One of Gandhi’s first campaigns became known as the Salt March . British 
authorities had made it illegal for Indians to produce their own sea salt. The 
commodity was easy to make in the tropical country, but Britain wanted a 
monopoly on salt. In 10, Gandhi led thousands of Indians to the Arabian Sea 
and simply picked up a few grains of salt, in defiance of Britain’s unjust edict.

497 UNRESOL=ED  TENSIONS  A-TER WORLD WAR  IThe Two-State Solution  While anticolonial sentiment was building, 
leaders of the independence movement disagreed about how India should 
define its national identity. Muslim leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah , a member 
of the Muslim minority in the largely Hindu Indian National Congress, 
originally favored Muslim-Hindu unity but later proposed a two-state plan for 
South Asian independence. He was concerned that Muslim interests would 
be overwhelmed by Hindu concerns in an independent India. He proposed  
creating a separate state, Pakistan , that would include the heavily Muslim 
western and eastern parts of South Asia. This proposal made several leaders, 
including Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru , who eventually became India’s first 
prime minister, anxious about the region’s future. Although independence did 
not come for India and Pakistan until after World War II, the interwar years 
were critical times for the anticolonial movement. Connect: Write a paragraph

Nationalism in East Asia
.orea, China, and Japan had not been formally colonized by Europe, but they 
did suffer from European domination. These countries also demonstrated the 
spread of the desire for self-determination.
The March First Movement in Korea  The small country of .orea had 
suffered under increasing Japanese influence since the 180s. In 110, Japan 
took control of .orea. After World War I, Japan expected to expand its role 
in East Asia, just as European states did in the Middle East. The prospect of 
European support for a stronger Japan, and the mysterious death of the .orean 
emperor, caused .orean resentment to explode. On March 1, 11, .oreans 
began a series of protests that involved as many as 2 million .oreans out 
of a population of 17 million. The occupying Japanese forces cracked down 
harshly, killing several thousand .oreans. But the March First Movement  
demonstrated the power of .orean nationalism.
The May Fourth Movement in China  During World War I, China 
supported the Allies. Britain and France hired nearly 150,000 Chinese 
to work in factories, dig trenches and do other support work. China hoped 
that the victorious Allies would support China’s desire to reclaim German-
controlled land on the Shandong Peninsula in northeast China. However, 
Japan wanted the same land. At the Paris Peace Conference in 11, Great 
Britain and France sided with Japan. Infuriated, Chinese intellectuals and 
workers staged anti-Japanese demonstrations beginning on May , 11. 
The May Fourth Movement  symbolized China’s growing nationalism and 
demand for democracy. Angered by Europe’s support for Japan, many Chinese 
rejected Western-style government. They turned toward the Marxist model of 
the Soviet Union. Several May Fourth leaders joined the Chinese Communist 
Party. In the years after the May Fourth protests, two main groups fought for 
power: the communists and the nationalists. 
498WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• The Chinese  Communist Party (CCP ) was founded in 1921. It 
was eventually led by Mao Zedong  or Mao Tse-tung, the son of a 
prosperous peasant, who was inspired by the communist revolution 
in Russia. Instead of energizing the working classes of Chinese cities, 
however, Mao believed that China’s communist revolution could be 
based on the revolt of peasants, who made up the vast majority of 
China’s population. 
• The Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang , was led by  Sun Yat-
sen. He was devoted to full independence and industrialization, and 
he allied with Mao’s forces to free China from foreign domination and 
overthrow the warlords. Following Sun’s death in 125, Chiang Kai-
shek  took control of the Nationalist Party. Chiang was a conservative 
and had a deep-seated distrust of communism. In 1927, Chiang’s forces 
attacked and nearly annihilated Mao’s forces, initiating the Chinese 
Civil War.
The Long March  Mao and remnants of the Chinese Communist Party 
retreated into China’s interior, where for several years they trained in hiding. In 
1, Chiang’s forces again attacked Mao’s army in the rural areas of Jiangxi. 
After the attack, Mao’s forces began the  /onJ March  a year-long, 6,000-mile 
long retreat. It traversed treacherous mountains, deep marshes, and extremely 
dry deserts. Of the 80,000 or more who began the Long March, only 10,000 
remained to assemble in 15 in northern China. 
The Chinese Communist Party was weak after the Long March. 
However, peasants admired Mao and his army’s tremendous stamina and 
their commitment to their ideals. This support among peasants would later be 
important for the success of the Communists in winning control of the country.
While the Communists were retreating on the Long March, the Nationalist 
.uomintang continued to rule much of China during the 10s. Chiang, 
however, had alienated many. Old traditions were losing support, but he 
advocated Confucianism. When opponents criticized him, he suppressed free 
speech. When people accused the Nationalists of corruption, he did not stop it. 
China -aSan anG ManchuNuo  In 15, the Nationalists and 
Communists in China suspended their civil war to unite against a more pressing 
danger: Japan. Seeking access to natural resources on the Asian mainland, 
Japan had invaded Manchuria in northern China in September 11. Tensions 
increased when someone, either Chinese dissidents or Japanese soldiers, 
attacked a railway owned by Japan near Mukden. When the League of Nations 
condemned Japan’s actions in Manchuria, Japan gave up its membership in 
the League and seized more land. In 1932, the Japanese set up a puppet state 
called Manchukuo.  To make Manchukuo seem like an independent Chinese 
state, it selected the last Chinese emperor to sit on its throne. Connect:

ended. It seized the Philippines under partial U.S. control at the time, the 
Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, Burma, and numerous Pacific islands. 
Japan termed these territories the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . 
Although Japan claimed to be liberating people from Western imperialism, 
people in the region experienced Japan as a conqueror.
Resistance to French Rule in West Africa
As in South Asia, people all over Africa were disappointed that their colonies 
did not achieve independence after World War I. Pro-independence movements 
in Africa began with European-educated intellectuals. For example, the future 
leader of .enya, -oPo .enyatta studied in London. /poSolG SenJhor the 
future leader of Senegal, studied in Paris. In Europe, African intellectuals 
learned to recognize the racial discrimination taking place in their homelands. 
Most members of the educated elite worked for the colonial government, if 
they were not self-employed attorneys or doctors. 
Africans under colonial rule resisted the colonizers. Black workers in 
French West Africa staged a series of strikes, including a strike of railway 
workers in 11 and a general strike in 16. Some of these actions spread 
throughout French West Africa Senegal, Benin, Ivory Coast, and Guinea. 
Strikers protested discriminatory wage and benefit policies and in some cases 
won a number of their demands through a compromise settlement.

Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“After >World War I@, the world was divided into two camps: one is the 
revolutionary camp which includes the oppressed colonial peoples and the 
exploited working class throughout the world. Its vanguard is the Soviet 
Union. The other is the counter-revolutionary camp of international capitalism 
and imperialism, whose general staff is the League of Nations.
That war resulted in untold loss of life and property. . . . French imperialism 
was the hardest hit. Therefore, in order to restore the forces of capitalism in 
France, the French imperialists have . . . built new factories to exploit the 
workers by paying them starvation wages. They have plundered the peasants’ 
land to establish plantations and drive them to destitution. They have levied 
new heavy taxes. They have forced our people to buy government bonds. 
In short, they have driven our people to utter misery. They have increased 
their military forces, firstly to strangle the 9ietnamese revolution secondly 
to prepare for a new imperialist war in the Pacific aimed at conquering new 
colonies thirdly to suppress the Chinese revolution and fourthly to attack 
the Soviet Union because she helps the oppressed nations and the exploited 
working class to wage revolution.
World War Two will break out. When it does the French imperialists will 
certainly drive our people to an even more horrible slaughter .”

CAUSES OF WORLD WAR II 503
7.6
Causes of World War II
It is blood which moves the wheels of history.
—Benito Mussolini (1914, before he became Il Duce , the Leader)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and consequences of  
World War II?
The causes of World War II lay in the unresolved issues in the aftermath of 
World War I. Economic instability in the postwar economies of Europe led to 
civil unrest in Italy and Germany. In Italy, the rise of fascism was directly related 
to the downturn of the Italian economy that occurred after World War I. Benito 
Mussolini and his National Fascist Party came to power in 122 because of 
their promises to renew the Italian economy and create another Italian empire 
in the Mediterranean and beyond. The peace settlement after World War I also 
placed unsustainable economic and political terms on Germany and instituted 
territorial distributions that took away resources and created resentment among 
the German population. Thus, the ideology associated with Italian fascism and 
militarism²as seen in the quotation above²spread to Germany, where Hitler 
and the Nazis adopted it.
The Path to War
Out of the context of the broad economic and political trends emerged Adolf 
Hitler . His extreme views on the superiority of the Aryan race and his vision 
of a great German civilization led him to persecute Jews and other minorities 
and to systematically seize land. 
5ise oI 1a]isP  Following Germany’s defeat in 1918, the democratically 
elected Weimar Republic  replaced the monarchical rule of the kaiser. Under 
the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the new German government not only had 
to pay billions in war reparations, but it also was not allowed to have an army. 
The Weimar Republic, appearing weak to the demoralized German people, 
became especially unpopular during the Great Depression.
The rolls of the unemployed swelled due to the weak German economy. 
Large numbers of young men, including many World War I veterans, found 
themselves with few job prospects. Such an environment fostered alienation 
and bitterness. Many Germans perceived the Weimar Republic to be too weak 
to solve the country’s problems, so they looked to right-wing political parties 
that promised strong action.
504 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONHitler had declared his extreme anti-Semitic views in his book Mein Kampf  
“My Struggle”, which he began writing in 12 while in a Bavarian prison 
after a failed coup attempt. The National Socialist German Worker’s Party, or the 
1a]is, came to power legally after the party did well in the 1932 parliamentary 
elections. In early 1, the president of Germany, Paul von Hindenburg, invited 
Adolf Hitler to form a government as chancellor, which he did. Hindenburg died 
in 1, giving Hitler the opening he needed to declare himself  president.
Through manipulation, the Nazi Party instilled fear and panic in the 
German people, making them believe that they were in a state of emergency. 
For example, the Nazis staged a burning of the Reichstag , the German 
parliament building, and blamed radical extremists for the act. Using domestic 
security as justification, Hitler outlawed all other political parties and all forms 
of resistance to his rule. 
Hitler openly promoted ultranationalism and scientific racisP , a 
pseudoscientific theory that claimed that certain races were genetically superior 
to others. He also advanced an extreme form of  anti-Semitism , or hostility 
toward Jews. He filled his speeches with accusations against German Jews, 
whom Hitler claimed were responsible for the nation’s domestic problems. 
Nazi propaganda emphasized a need for a “pure” German nation of “ Aryans ,” 
purged of “outsiders”²not only Jews, but also Slavs, communists, Roma also 
known as Gypsies, and gay men and women. Hitler suggested that the only 
way for Germany to live up to its potential was to eliminate the corrupting 
influence of these groups, particularly the Jews.
Nuremberg Laws  Hitler’s anti-Jewish campaign began with laws 
designed to disenfranchise and discriminate against them. The Nuremberg 
Laws , passed in 15, forbade marriage between Jews and gentiles people 
who are not Jewish), stripped Jews of their citizenship, and unleashed a series 
of subsequent decrees that effectively pushed Jews to the margins of German 
society. German Jews, many of whom were successful in their careers and felt 
assimilated into German society, were shocked by the way they were being 
treated. Some Eastern European nations, such as Romania and Bulgaria, also 
passed laws discriminating against their Jewish citizens. 
The Axis Powers  Hitler then sought new allies to help him acquire 
/eEensraum  living space for the new German empire. He did not try to hide 
his ambition to conquer the entire continent. Hitler’s lust for land eventually 
brought the international community to the brink of war. He first formed a 
military pact with Fascist Italy, the Rome-Berlin Axis , in October 16.  In 
addition to their need for military support, the two countries shared a political 
ideology and economic interests. Germany then created a military alliance with 
Japan based on mutual distrust of communism, known as the Anti-Comintern 
Pact  The alliances among these three nations created the Axis Powers 
Kristallnacht  Hitler’s campaign to rid Germany of Jews predated his 
aggressive land grabs in Europe. His propaganda and the Nuremberg Laws 
successfully created an atmosphere of hostility, hatred, and distrust within 
505 CAUSES OF WORLD WAR II 505Germany. This tension erupted one night in early November 18. 
Kristallnacht , the “Night of the Broken Glass,” produced anti-Jewish riots 
that ostensibly occurred in response to the assassination of a German diplomat 
by a Jewish teenager. Although it appeared to be a spontaneous burst of outrage 
on the part of the German citizenry, Nazi leaders had actually engineered the 
entire operation. The riots resulted in the deaths of more than 90 German Jews 
and the destruction of nearly every synagogue in Germany and some 7,000 
Jewish shops. More than 0,000 Jews were dragged from their homes, arrested, 
and sent to concentration camps. Most of these prisoners were eventually 
released on orders to leave Germany, an option not given to later concentration 
camp prisoners.
Nazi Germany’s Aggressive Militarism
The terms of the Treaty of Versailles severely limited the German military after 
World War I. Yet Hitler wanted a stronger military to acquire more land. In 
March 15, he broke the treaty when he announced the creation of a German 
air force and a policy of conscription to enlarge the size of the army.
The Treaty of Versailles   Under the treaty, a strip of land in the Rhineland 
1 miles wide was set up as a buffer zone between Germany and France. 
Germany was not allowed to station troops there. Hitler broke the agreement, 
sending German troops into the Rhineland on March , 16. Both France and 
Britain protested this move, but they took no other action.

506WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONSome British believed that Hitler was the strong anticommunist leader that 
central Europe needed to keep order. Others were simply reluctant to return 
to war. So Britain followed a policy of appeasement , giving in to Germany’s 
demands in hopes of keeping the peace. However, Germany’s military expansion 
and its support of the fascist Spanish Nationalist government during the Spanish 
Civil War 16±1 indicated that Hitler was increasing his power. Connect: 
Describe the connection between the militarism that led up to World War I and 
World War II. See Topic .2.  
*erPan$ustrian 8nification  With his military revived and alliances in 
hand, Hitler felt confident about taking his next step in the creation of a new 
German empire, the Third Reich . His plan was to bring Austria, where he 
was born, under German rule. Hitler used the threat of invasion to pressure 
the Austrian chancellor into giving more power to the Austrian Nazi Party. As 
Hitler had planned, the Austrian Nazis then opened the door for German troops 
to occupy Austria with no resistance. With the Anschluss  (political union), 
Austria officially became part of the Third Reich in March 18.
C]echosloYaNia  The annexation of Austria was only the first step for Hitler. 
He wanted more. In September 18, he issued a demand to Czechoslovakia for 
the border territory of the Sudetenland  Most of the people who lived in this 
region spoke German Hitler argued that the area was a natural extension of his 
Aryan empire. The German leader met with the leaders of Britain, France, and 
Italy in Munich to discuss his demands. Neville Chamberlain , the British prime 
minister, again argued that a policy of appeasement would keep the peace and 
put an end to Hitler’s demands for more land. The Munich Agreement  allowed 
Hitler to annex the Sudetenland in return for a promise that Germany would not 
take over any more Czech territory. This was a fateful miscalculation. Hitler saw 
that the British were not willing to stand up to his illegal land grabs, emboldening 
him to seize control of all of Czechoslovakia with an armed invasion in 1939. 
7he Conflict oYer 3olanG  Hitler next set his sights on the Polish port 
of 'an]iJ. Although Germany did have some historical claims to the port, in 
reality, Hitler was merely looking for an excuse to invade Poland. Britain, in 
the meantime, had reached the end of its policy of appeasement and agreed to 
protect Poland from a German attack. Britain and France also reached out to the 
Soviet Union to form a stronger alliance against Germany.
Germany, however, was already in negotiations with the Soviets. With the 
signing of the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact on August 2, 1, the 
two nations pledged not to attack one another. During the negotiations for the 
pact, Hitler secretly offered Stalin control of eastern Poland and the Baltic States 
if Stalin would stand by during a German invasion of western Poland. With this 
assurance in hand, Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1, claiming 
that Poland had attacked first. Britain and France honored their agreement to 
protect Poland and declared war on Germany. These actions marked the official 
start of World War II in Europe.

Japan’s Expansion in Asia
By the time Germany invaded Poland in 1, Japan had already been moving 
aggressively against .orea and China for almost 50 years. In 11, Japan had 
invaded Manchuria. After several months of fighting, it successfully created 
the state of Manchukuo under its control. Then, in 1, a small incident in 
this region between Japanese troops and Chinese troops quickly escalated. 
Soon, Japan had launched a full-scale invasion of China. This marked the start 
of World War II in Asia.

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:   IDENTIF Y ASSUMP TION S SH APING POINT  
O- =IEW
The point of view of a source is often shaped by underlying assumptions.   
For example, the .orean Declaration of Independence states: “We 
proclaim >our independence@ to the nations of the world in affirmation of 
the principle of the equality of all nations.” The underlying assumption 
that shapes the point of view in this statement is that all nations are equal, 
a position with which reasonable people agree. That sound assumption 
establishes a legitimacy to other aspects of the declaration. If it had 
instead said, “. . . in affirmation of the principle of the superiority of  
.oreans,” the point of view would be sufficiently narrowed that its 
legitimacy would be questioned, since enlightened opinion recognizes 
equality of people and nations.

We shall never surrender. 
—British Prime 4inister Winston Churchill (1une 4, 1940)
Essential Question:   What similarities and differences were there in the 
methods governments used to conduct war?
During World War II, governments rallied all their resources in the war effort. 
The call to intense nationalism, as illustrated in Winston Churchill’s speech 
in the British House of Commons, was part of concerted policies that used 
all forms of communication to mobilize the population. Appeal to ideological 
beliefs, including fascism and communism, dominated daily life during the 
conflict and minimized resistance to militarism.
Governments also used new military technology and tactics, including the 
atomic bomb and “total war,” disregarding previously accepted laws of war. 
These policies increased the level of wartime casualties.
Japan and Imperialist Policies
With the military in control of the government, Japan harbored imperialist 
ambitions that would lead to a world war in the Pacific. The Mukden Incident 
and the takeover of land in Manchuria in a state called Manchukuo see 
Topic  7.5) were early efforts in this drive. 
New Order in East Asia  The occupation of parts of China was but one step 
in Japan’s overall strategy, which was to create a “New Order in East Asia.” The 
Japanese had looked to expand into Soviet Siberia, but when Germany and the 
Soviets signed the Nonaggression Pact of 1939, Japan had to look elsewhere 
for new territory. Nearby Southeast Asia, which had been under the control 
of imperial powers in Western Europe and the United States, was the most 
obvious target. However, Japan faced obstacles. Its occupation of China led 
to economic sanctions by the United States. Because Japan’s economy relied 
on oil and scrap iron from the United States, sanctions threatened to strangle 
512 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONits economy and undercut its military expansion. Therefore, Japan began to 
plan to retaliate against the United States with military force in the hope that 
by doing so, the Western powers would submit to Japan’s imperial ambitions.
Germany’s Early Victories and Challenges
Once war broke out in Europe, Hitler moved swiftly to acquire territory. He 
embarked on a strategy called Elit]NrieJ , or lightning war, to quickly subdue 
Poland. Germany used rapidly moving tank divisions supported by the air 
force in its four-week campaign. At the end of September 1, Germany and 
the Soviets divided the country as they had planned when they signed the 
German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact.
Germany’s rapid success in Poland encouraged Hitler to attack and 
conquer Denmark and Norway in April 10 and the Netherlands, Belgium, 
and France in the following month. Germany then proceeded to bring the 
government and resources of the conquered nations under its control. As 
the Germans approached Paris, the French government fled to Bordeaux, in 
southern France. Germany took direct control of the northern two-thirds of 
the country. The French set up a new pro-Nazi regime based in Vichy under  
Marshal Henri-Philippe Pptain, an aged World War I hero. Connect: Create

British-American Relations  Fearing that it would be the next victim 
in Germany’s relentless and rapid campaign, Britain asked the United States 
for support. Despite a long history of isolationism from European troubles, 
President Roosevelt believed the United States should help the British. 
In 1940, the two powers signed the Destroyers-for-Bases Agreement , 
in which the United States promised delivery of 50 destroyers in exchange 
for eight British air and naval bases in the Western Hemisphere. In the 11 
513 CONDUCTING WORLD WAR II 513Lend-Lease Act , the United States gave up all pretensions of neutrality by 
lending war materials to Britain. Also in 11, Britain and the United States 
forged a policy statement known as the Atlantic Charter , which set down 
basic goals for the post-war world. The charter included such provisions as the 
restoration of self-government to those deprived of it, the abandonment of the 
use of force, and the disarmament of aggressor nations. 
The Battle of Britain  In Europe, Britain was the last major holdout 
against Nazi power. In July 10, Hitler ordered a large campaign against 
the small island nation by the Luftwaffe , the German air force. He believed 
that bombardment from the air would sufficiently weaken the country so 
that German sea and land forces could mount a successful invasion. Initially 
targeting military bases in this Battle of Britain , the Germans turned to 
bombing British cities after the British Royal Air Force conducted a raid on 
Berlin. Winston Churchill  termed this Britain’s “finest hour” as the civilian 
population in London and other cities withstood months of relentless bombing.  
The targeting of cities did provide one advantage for Britain: the British 
military was able to rebuild after the earlier raids on its bases. Ultimately, 
Britain’s superior planes and radar system allowed it to destroy German planes 
faster than they could be replaced. By May 11, Hitler was forced to postpone 
indefinitely any attempted invasion of Britain.
War on the Soviet Union  After failing to invade Britain, Hitler turned 
east. He attacked the Soviet Union to eliminate Bolshevism and to create 
/eEensraum— land for settlement and development²for the German people. 
Germany’s turning its focus to the east took pressure off Britain. Germany 
began its invasion of the Soviet Union in June 11. Initially the Nazis 
experienced rapid success as they had in Western Europe, capturing large 
amounts of territory and two million Soviet troops. However, the German 
forces soon found themselves at the mercy of the harsh Russian winter. The 
Soviets defended the city of Leningrad in the Siege of Leningrad , which lasted 
three years and led to the deaths of a million Soviet men, women, and children.
Japan Overreaches
Japan experienced rapid victories in the Pacific. It launched a surprise air attack 
on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor  in Hawaii on December  , 11, 
destroying much of the U.S. Pacific fleet. Japan then seized the Philippines, 
the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, Burma, and numerous Pacific islands. 
Japan believed that the surprise attack and the damage to the U.S. Pacific 
Fleet would prompt the United States to negotiate a settlement favorable to 
Japan immediately. Instead, U.S. isolationism disappeared overnight public 
opinion demanded retaliation against Japan. Great Britain and China joined 
the United States in the fight against Japanese aggression. The war truly 
became global when, within days, Hitler responded to the U.S. declaration of 
war against Japan with his own declaration of war against the United States.
514 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONColonial Armies  As the Axis powers expanded into new territory, 
Western colonies began to join the Allies in the war effort. For example, the 
Indian Army, which had started the war with only 200,000 men, ended the 
war as the largest volunteer army in history with more than 2.5 million men. 
Although the Indian Army sent troops to North Africa, the bulk of its troops 
fought against the Japanese in Southeast Asia. 
Home Fronts
Like World War I, World War II was a total war. Most countries mobilized 
all their resources, including the civilian population, to achieve victory. The 
United States started with the strongest industrial sector of any country in the 
world and it added stringent government planning to provide factories what 
they needed. In addition, unlike anywhere in Europe, U.S. industry operated 
without threat of military attack. The United States ramped up production of 
the resources required for war, including ships, tanks, planes, landing craft, 
radar equipment, guns, and ammunition. With the enlistment of large numbers 
of men in the armed forces, women found far more opportunities to work in 
factories and offices. The U.S. government promoted art of “Rosie the Riveter” 
to encourage women to succeed at jobs that were once thought to be for men.
Instead of mobilizing all available citizens in the war effort, German 
leaders relied on forced labor, some of it in concentration camps. At its peak, 
20 percent of the wartime workforce was forced labor, with 600,000 French 
citizens working in German war plants and 1.5 million French soldiers working 
in prisoner-of-war (POW) camps. The solution was counterproductive, 
however. The workers were treated so poorly that productivity was low. 
In Japan, efforts on the home front were confused. The government 
presented an optimistic view of the war instead of trying to mobilize resources. 
The government took pride in not using women in the war effort, claiming that 
the enemy is “drafting women but in Japan, out of consideration for the family 
system, we will not.” The government was able to systematically remove 
children from cities to the countryside when bombing of cities started late in 
the war. It was also successful in rationing food throughout the war. Connect:

The Tide Turns in the European Theater
With its entry into the war in December 11, the United States joined the 
other Allied powers, Great Britain and the Soviet Union. In spite of political 
differences, the three nations were united in their determination to achieve a 
military victory and agreed that Axis surrender must be unconditional.
In early 12, the Allies were struggling in Europe and North Africa. 
General Erwin Rommel , the “Desert Fox,” led German troops in Egypt and 
threatened to take the northern city of Alexandria. But in the second half 
of 1942, the tide turned. The British defeated Rommel at the Battle of El 
515 CONDUCTING WORLD WAR IIAlamein  And after months of fighting, a Soviet counteroffensive successfully 
defeated the pride of Hitler’s military, the German Sixth Army, in the Battle 
of Stalingrad . Although the Germans remained in control of most of Western 
Europe, the momentum of the war in Europe had turned against the Nazis.
7Ke7iGe7uUnsinWKe3Dciðc7KeDWeU
The year 12 was also crucial in the war against Japan. The first Allied 
victory occurred in May in the %attle oI the Coral Sea  when the U.S. Navy 
stopped a Japanese fleet set to invade New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, 
thus helping to prevent a future invasion of Australia. The following month, 
with the destruction of four Japanese aircraft carriers at the Battle of Midway 
Island , Allied naval forces demonstrated their superiority in the Pacific. These 
battles stopped the advance of the Japanese. The first major Allied offensive 
was on the island of Guadalcanal , which ended in early 1 with an Allied 
victory. 
The Allied forces in the Pacific under U.S. General Douglas MacArthur 
used a strategy called island-hopping  The Allies attacked islands where Japan 
was weak and skipped those where Japan was strong. The Allies slowly, and at 
great human cost, moved through the Philippines, getting closer to Japan itself.
Technology was critical to Allied success. The development of fleets of 
aircraft carriers , ships that allowed planes to take off from and land on their 
decks at sea, provided air support for battleships and increased the range and 
flexibility of naval forces. Aircraft were used for raids on enemy ships and 
bases and for intelligence gathering. Submarines sank about 55 percent of the 
Japanese merchant fleet, severely damaging Japan’s supply lines.
The Last Years of the War
The Allied successes of 12 put the Axis powers on the defensive in 1. 
The Allies identified Italy as the weakest point under Axis control in Europe. 
In spite of German forces sent to aid Italy, the Allies gained control of the 
island of Sicily in July 1, leading to the fall of Mussolini. After the Allies 
invaded southern Italy in September 1, Italy turned against its former ally. 
After months of slow and costly progress, the Allies finally recaptured Rome 
on June 4, 1944. 
June 6, 1, has become known as D-Day , when about 150,000 Allied 
forces under the command of U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower launched an 
amphibious invasion from England, landing on the beaches of Normandy in 
northern France. Allied casualties were high. Eventually, however, the Allies 
established a base to begin the march toward Paris, which was liberated in 
August. With control of Western Europe slipping away, Germany’s defeat was 
drawing closer.
The Germans made one final push against the Allies during the winter of 
1944. The Battle of the Bulge  was fought in the Ardennes Forest across parts 
of France, Belgium, and Luxembourg. An Allied victory left Germany with no 
516WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONrealistic expectation of winning the war, yet Hitler refused to give up. Allied 
air raids began to systematically destroy Germany’s infrastructure and Allied 
troops crossed the Rhine River into Germany in March 15. One month later 
they were approaching Germany’s capital city of Berlin.
On the Eastern Front, Soviet troops were also moving rapidly toward 
Germany. In July 1, the largest tank battle of the war, the Battle of Kursk , 
was fought about 00 miles south of Moscow. The Soviets challenged this 
instance of German Blitzkrieg by successfully holding their defensive position 
and then counterattacking. The Soviets then made rapid progress through the 
Ukraine and the Baltic States in 1. After taking control of Warsaw, Poland, 
in January 15, the Soviets moved on to Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. In 
April 15, they advanced on Berlin.
Victory in Europe  Hitler spent the war’s final days hiding in a bunker, 
a fortified underground shelter, in Berlin. Although the country was falling 
apart, he continued to live under the delusion that somehow Germany would 
triumph. The end came on April 0, 15, when Hitler committed suicide. 
His ally Mussolini had been killed by members of the Italian resistance two 
days before. After Hitler’s death, members of Germany’s High Command 
acknowledged that continuing the war would be futile. In the first days of May, 
Germany surrendered to the Allies. May 8, 15, marked the official end of 
the war in Europe and was designated as Victory in Europe Day or V-E Day 
Victory over Japan  In early 15, U.S. forces captured the islands of 
Okinawa and Iwo Jima and prepared to attack the Japanese mainland. In March 
15, U.S. troops fire-bombed Tokyo, killing about 100,000 people and leaving 
about a million others homeless. Although the island-hopping campaign had 
weakened Japan’s hold on the Pacific, the emperor was not ready to surrender. 
The United States was beginning to consider the costs of invading the Japanese 
homeland, which it feared might lead to enormous Allied casualties. Despite 
initial hesitations about using nuclear weapons, President Truman ordered 
the U.S. Army Air Force to drop the first atomic bomb on the Japanese city 
of Hiroshima  on August 6, 15. The nuclear age had begun. Three days 
later, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki , resulting in an estimated 
total of 10,000 Japanese civilian deaths. The months of Allied victories, 
combined with these devastating nuclear attacks, caused Japan to surrender 
unconditionally on August 1. Truman designated September 2, the day of the 
formal surrender ceremonies, as Victory over Japan Day or V-J Day .
Consequences of World War II
World War II was the bloodiest war in human history. It resulted in the deaths 
of around 5 million people, two-thirds of whom were civilians. As later topics 
explain, it changed how people thought about racism, colonial empires, and 
international relations. Further, it provided the context for a fierce ideological 
battle between the United States and the Soviet Union that would shape global 
affairs for the following five decades.

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“Nearly 50,000 American women served in uniform, both at home and abroad. 
. . . . General Eisenhower felt that he could not win the war without the aid of 
the women in uniform. µThe contribution of the women of America, whether 
on the farm or in the factory or in uniform, to D-Day was a sine qua non of the 
invasion effort.’
Women in uniform took office and clerical jobs in the armed forces in order 
to free men to fight. They also drove trucks, repaired airplanes, worked as 
laboratory technicians, rigged parachutes, served as radio operators, analyzed 
photographs, flew military aircraft across the country, test-flew newly repaired 
planes, and even trained anti-aircraft artillery gunners by acting as flying targets. 
Some women served near the front lines in the Army Nurse Corps, where 
16 were killed as a result of direct enemy fire. Sixty-eight American service 
women were captured as POWs in the Philippines. More than 1,600 nurses 
were decorated for bravery under fire and meritorious service, and 565 WACs 
in the Pacific Theater won combat decorations. Nurses were in Normandy on 
D-plus-four.”

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:   E=IDENCE TO SUPPORT, MODI-@, OR RE-UTE
In the years following the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, historians have considered, from almost every angle, the 
question of whether or not the bombs were needed to end the war. 
Each position has offered evidence to support it. That same evidence 
might modify  someone else’s argument²change it somewhat or add a 
complexity²or it might refute or disprove it entirely. 
The following excerpt is from an article that appeared in The Atlantic  
in December 16. It states a clear position on the question.
“The facts are these. On July 26, 15, the Potsdam Ultimatum 
>issued by the United States, Great Britain, and China@ called on 
Japan to surrender unconditionally. On July 2 Premier Suzuki issued 
a statement, purportedly at a cabinet press conference, scorning as 
unworthy of official notice the surrender ultimatum, and emphasizing 
the increasing rate of Japanese aircraft production. Eight days later, 
on August 6, the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima the 
second was dropped on August  on Nagasaki on the following day, 
August 10, Japan declared its intention to surrender, and on August 1 
accepted the Potsdam terms.
On the basis of these facts, I cannot believe that, without the atomic 
bomb, the surrender would have come without a great deal more of 
costly struggle and bloodshed.”
.arl T. Compton, “What If the Atomic Bomb Had 
Not Been Used"”
5ead the following statements and determine whether each suppor ts, 
modifies, or refutes &ompton¶s position
520 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION1. “A >2005@ Harvard University Press volume by Professor 
Tsuyoshi Hasegawa of the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, is the most comprehensive study yet undertaken 
of Japanese documentary sources. The highly praised study 
argues that the atomic bomb played only a secondary role in 
Japan’s decision to surrender. By far the most important factor, 
Hasegawa finds, was the entry of the Soviet Union into the war 
against Japan on Aug. 8, 15, two days after the Hiroshima 
bombing.”²Gar Aperovitz, “From the Archives: Atomic 
Bombing of Japan Was Unnecessary,” July, 2005
2. “My reading of the history of World War II has convinced me 
that Japan would not have surrendered if the bombs had not been 
dropped even after that some in the military tried to prevent 
the Emperor from surrendering. American military leaders 
predicted that an invasion of Japan would have produced 1 
million Americans killed or wounded. The Japanese had fought 
fiercely in Okinawa in the spring of 15 100,000 Americans 
and Japanese died in this one small island.”²Michael Barone, 
:ashington ([aminer , August 201
3. “The charge that Harry Truman was willing to condemn tens of 
thousands of people including Allied servicemen and prisoners 
of war to die by prolonging the war, and tens of thousands more 
Japanese by using the bombs merely to impress the Soviets, is 
one that ought not be made without substantial proof. Tweaking 
mangled documents, especially in a volume >Hasegawa’s book@ 
published by a prestigious academic press Harvard, utterly 
fails to meet this criterion and does a profound disservice to 
unsuspecting readers.”²Robert James Maddox, “Disputing 
Truman’s Use of Nuclear Weapons²Again,” American Thinker ,

REFLECT ON THE TOPIC ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. In one to three paragraphs, explain similarities and differences in how 
governments used a variety of methods to conduct war.
MASS ATROCITIE S521
7.8
Mass Atrocities
Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians? 
—German Führer Adolf Hitler (August 22, 1939)
Essential Question:   What were the causes and consequences of mass 
atrocities from 1900 to the present?
The deaths of fighting forces in the two world wars were only part of the 
total casualties. Genocide, ethnic violence, and other atrocities took place as 
extremist groups rose to power. During and after World War I, the Ottoman 
Empire, ruled by a clique of “Young Turks” who were disturbed by the 
continuing decline of Ottoman power, perpetrated the Armenian genocide in 
which some 1.5 million Armenians died. As Adolf Hitler implemented the 
Holocaust, he referred to the Armenian annihilation as a reminder of how little 
the Nazis need fear for the systematic murder of six million Jews.
Ethnic atrocities did not end after World War II. Dictator Pol Pot wanted  to 
“purify” Cambodian society along racial, social, and political lines, resulting in 
the deaths of 1.6 to 1.8 million Cambodians. See Topic 8.6. And in Rwanda, 
the majority Hutu government directed mass slaughter of the Tutsi minority.
Atrocities in Europe and the Middle East
After three years of a bloody stalemate, the United States entered World War 
I in 11, despite considerable popular protests in the United States against 
American involvement. By the summer of 118, when U.S. forces were 
in place in Europe, U.S. actions helped push the war in the Allies’ favor. 
Allied advances against the Central Powers forced Germany to surrender on 
November 11, 118, which became known as Armistice Day .
Between 8 million and 9 million soldiers died in the war, with more than 
21 million wounded. In France, Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary, fewer 
than half of all young men who fought for their countries returned physically 
unharmed. Soldiers who did return often bore emotional scars. 
Civilian casualties were harder to record, but estimates range anywhere 
from 6 million to 1 million. This was one of the first modern wars where 
civilians were considered legitimate targets. Although the Allies’ propaganda 
often exaggerated accounts of atrocities, reports of German soldiers raping 
women and killing families during their march through Belgium were common.

Armenian Genocide  The most shocking example of such atrocities were 
the deaths of between 600,000 and 1.5 million Armenians  in Turkey. This action 
has been called the 20th century’s first genocide , the attempted killing of a group 
of people based on their race, religion, or ethnicity. The Ottoman government 
alleged that the Christian Armenians, a minority within the Ottoman Empire, 
were cooperating with the Russian army, an Ottoman enemy during World  
War I. As punishment for this cooperation, the Ottoman government deported 
Armenians from their homes between 115 and 11 and into camps in Syria 
and what is today Iraq. Many Armenians died from starvation, disease, or 
exposure to the elements. Turkish troops executed others. Armenians have 
argued that the deaths were genocide. The Turkish government has said the 
deaths were the result of actions of war, ethnic conflicts, and disease, not 
genocide. Connect: Create a graphic organizer comparing the Armenian 
genocide with the Nazis’ extermination of millions of Jews. See Topic .6.
Pandemic Disease
War-related deaths continued past Armistice Day in the form of an influen]a 
epidemic . Under peacetime circumstances, a virulent disease might devastate 
a concentrated group of people in a particular region. However, in 118, 
millions of soldiers were returning home as the war ended. As they did, 
they had contact with loved ones and friends, thereby spreading the flu. In 
11, the epidemic became a pandemic , a disease prevalent over a large area  
or the entire world, killing 20 million people in Europe, the United States, and 
elsewhere. India alone may have lost 7 million people to the disease. 
The worldwide spread of the disease was another sign that while nationalism 
remained a powerful political force, improvements in transportation were 
creating a global culture that would create global challenges. Whether people 
could create effective international responses was unclear.
523 MASS ATROCITIE S5236uσeUinJDnG)DPine
A more intangible casualty of the war was the loss of a sense of security and 
hopefulness. The term Lost Generation , first used to describe American 
expatriate writers living in Paris after the war, came to be used more broadly 
to describe those suffering from the shock of the war. World War I was the 
bloodiest war thus far in history. It resulted in tremendous suffering and death 
for both military personnel and civilians.
Famine in the Ukraine  In the Soviet Union, peasants strongly resisted 
Stalin’s collectivization of agriculture. They hid or destroyed their crops and 
killed their livestock rather than turning them over to state control. This led 
to famines from human action rather than by weather or crop failures. The 
famines in 12 and 1 were especially devastating in the Ukraine, one of 
the Soviet Union’s most fertile farming regions. An estimated  million to 10 
million peasants died as a result of these famines. The government took much 
of the crops that were grown to feed industrial workers or to use for industry. 
Although peasants starved, industry grew.
Casualties of World War II
Because of the widespread fighting, advances in the technology of destruction, 
and its impact on the economies and civilian life of so many nations, the effects 
of World War II were unprecedented. Although exact casualty figures have 
been impossible to determine, total deaths probably numbered 0 million to 50 
million. Maybe half of those were citizens of the Soviet Union, and millions 
of others were from Germany, Poland, China, and Japan. Losses among U.S. 
troops were fewer, but still considerable: about 20,000 soldiers killed and 
more than 600,000 wounded. Civilian casualties from attacks on land, air, 
and sea from government executions based on political rationales, including 
genocide and from disease and starvation caused by the war likely exceeded 
military casualties.
7he 1a]is  During the war, the world gradually learned about Nazi 
brutality. In its pursuit of territory, Germany forcefully removed many Slavic 
peoples, including one million Poles, and Roma, also known as Gypsies, from 
their homes. Heinrich Himmler , the leader of the Nazi special police, the SS, 
oversaw these policies. In addition, more than  million residents of conquered 
territories were forced to work in labor camps or in jobs that supported the 
German war effort. The Nazis sent political opponents, people with disabilities, 
and gay people to the camps. But the largest single group the Nazis targeted 
were the Jews. When Hitler became chancellor, he instituted many policies 
that reflected these extreme anti-Semitic views, such as the Nuremberg Laws  
of 15 that banned Jews from certain professions and certain schools. Jews 
were forced to live in sections of cities called ghettos . 
524 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn 12, the Nazi persecution of Jews turned into mass murder. They 
began a campaign led by the SS to kill all Jews in Europe, a plan they called 
the “ Final Solution .” Initially, Nazi killing units moved from place to place, 
shooting Jews and burying them in mass graves. Later the SS began rounding 
up Jews and shipping them to death camps, where Nazis gassed them. 
Auschwitz and Treblinka in Poland and Dachau in Germany were some of the 
largest camps. By the end of the war, the Nazis had killed about six million 
Jews, an act of genocide known as the Holocaust  The Nazis killed another 
five million people who belonged to other persecuted groups or were Soviet 
prisoners of war. The Nazis worked many to death in labor camps and 
massacred others. 
The Japanese  During the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1, Japanese 
soldiers killed at least 100,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians in what was 
called the Rape of Nanking. During World War II, although the Japanese did 
not carry out a dedicated policy of genocide that paralleled the Holocaust, 
millions of people died as a result of their policies. Under the program “ Asia 
for Asiatics ,” Japan forced people they had conquered into labor programs. 
These included service in the military, on public works projects, and on farms 
to reduce the food shortage in Japan. The Japanese army forced women in 
.orea, China, and other occupied countries to become “comfort women,” 
prostitutes for Japanese soldiers. Because of these harsh programs, more than 
a million civilians died in 9ietnam alone. Perhaps an equal number of Allied 
prisoners of war and local workers perished while doing forced labor for Japan.One shocking aspect of the Holocaust was how the Nazis used technology  ²trains, poisonous gas, and 
ovens for cremation shown here²to make their attempt at genocide more ef ficient and more deadly.

525 MASS ATROCITIE SThe Allies  Air warfare carried out by the United States and the other Allies 
brought a new type of deadly combat to civilians. The Allies’ fireEoPEinJ  of 
German cities, particularly Hamburg  in 1943 and Dresden  in 1945, caused 
large casualties. The number of deaths in Hamburg was about 50,000. Dresden 
had fewer casualties, maybe 25,000 deaths, as 15 square miles of its historic 
city center were destroyed. The United States also used firebombing in Tokyo  
The final two air attacks in the war, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, produced not 
only high casualties, but tremendous fear about the destructiveness of a future 
war fought with nuclear weapons. These weapons had been developed by an 
international group of scientists working in the United States. The scientific 
achievement was impressive, but it also required developments in other areas 
to have military use. For example, to deliver the nuclear weapons required 
improvements in airplane design to allow long flights carrying heavy loads. 
There is a great difference between the planes used in World War II and those 
used in World War I. In addition, the widespread use of the aircraft carrier by 
several powers extended the airplanes’ reach. Using these developments in 
planes and ships, countries could carry out air attacks anywhere in the world.
Genocide and Human Rights
The global community said “never again” to genocide after the horrors of the 
Holocaust. However, genocides continued to occur.
Bosnia  Ethnic conflict drove the genocide in Bosnia . The end of World 
War I brought with it the creation of several new nations in Eastern Europe, 
including Yugoslavia. That country was home to Serbians, who were Eastern 
Orthodox Christians Croats and Slovenes, who were Catholic and Muslims 
in the regions of Bosnia and .osovo. Marshal Josip Broz Tito led communist 
Yugoslavia from the end of World War II until his death in 180. As dictator, 
Tito tried to suppress separatist tendencies among the peoples of Yugoslavia 
by keeping Serbia and Croatia, the two largest republics, from dominating the 
smaller ones.
After the Soviet Union collapsed, so did Yugoslavia. When Slovenia, 
Croatia, and Montenegro declared independence, they each defined citizenship 
in terms of ethnic background and religion. Serbian nationalists led by the 
demagogue Slobodan Miloševicc ´  were particularly emphatic about ethnic 
purity. Serb forces, in attempts to dominate states such as Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and .osovo, committed horrific acts of ethnic cleansing  against Muslims 
from Bosnia and .osovo, killing or driving people who were not part of the 
main ethnic group from their homes. Bosniaks, .osovars, and Croats fought 
back, causing more casualties. Serb soldiers raped untold numbers of Muslim 
women. In total, more than 300,000 people in the region perished over the 
course of Yugoslavia’s EalNani]ation , or disintegration into separate states. 
Rwanda  One of the smallest countries in Africa, Rwanda  was the site of 
one of the worst genocides in modern history. Ethnic and tribal hatred going 
526WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONback to the colonial era was behind the slaughter. Belgian colonizers had treated 
the minority Tutsis better than the majority Hutus . The latter group resented 
all the power that the Tutsis enjoyed. When Rwanda won independence from 
Belgium in 162, the Hutu majority easily won control of the government and 
took revenge on the Tutsis by discriminating against them. In response, tens of 
thousands of Tutsis fled the country and formed a rebel army.
In 1, Tutsi and Hutu forces in Rwanda began negotiations for a coalition 
government in which both ethnic groups would share power. The negotiations 
were cut short in 1 when Rwanda’s president, a Hutu, was killed in an 
airplane crash, supposedly shot down by rebel forces. This incident lit the 
flames of genocide. Over the next three months or so, between 500,000 and 
1 million civilians²mostly Tutsis and some moderate Hutus²were killed. 
Some sources estimate that casualties were even higher.
International responses ranged from insufficient to callous. United Nations 
peacekeepers were instructed not to use force to restore order. There were also 
too few peacekeepers to protect all Rwandans. Individual countries, including 
the United States, evacuated their personnel from the country after Belgian 
peacekeepers were killed. UN peacekeepers and individual nations  failed to 
evacuate any Rwandans. The Rwandan genocide focused attention on the lack 
of leadership in the international community. It became clear that the United 
Nations needed to think seriously about its role in violent conflicts if it wanted 
to effectively protect human lives and human rights.

western Sudan. Most of the people involved were Muslim, but some were 
nomadic pastoralists of Arab descent, while others were non-Arab farmers. 
The government of Sudan was controlled by Arab Muslims. Two Darfur rebel 
groups composed of non-Arabs took up arms against the Sudanese government 
in response to attacks from nomads. In response, the government unleashed 
Arab militants known as the Janjaweed  translation: “evil men on horseback” 
on the region. Together with Sudanese forces, the Janjaweed attacked and 
destroyed hundreds of villages throughout Darfur, slaughtering more than 
200,000 people, mostly non-Arab Muslim Africans. More than one million 
people were displaced, creating a refugee crisis that spilled into neighboring 
Chad. Despite negotiations, appeals, and the  International Criminal Court 
charging Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir with war crimes, the genocide 
continued.

Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“The Holocaust was the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution 
and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators.  
. . . The Nazis, who came to power in Germany in January 1, believed that 
Germans were ‘racially superior’ and that the Jews, deemed ‘inferior,’ were an 
alien threat to the so-called German racial community. . . .
To concentrate and monitor the Jewish population as well as to facilitate 
later deportation of the Jews, the Germans and their collaborators created 
ghettos, transit camps, and forced-labor camps for Jews during the war  
years. . . .
Between 11 and 1, Nazi German authorities deported millions of 
Jews from Germany, from occupied territories, and from the countries of many 
of its Axis allies to ghettos and to killing centers, often called extermination 
camps, where they were murdered in specially developed gassing facilities.”

What does it take to make people “capable of committing such

question by relating genocide to other historical developments, such as 
the following:
• War²has an influence on people’s psyche that makes them more 
likely to kill members of an “outgroup” which is perceived to be a 
threat
• Economic crisis²fosters a need to scapegoat others as being 
responsible for the economic problems, softening a resistance to 
killing them
• Enlightenment thinking²  focuses on the perceived perfectibility 
of society, sometimes in terms of removing biological threats.

CAUSATION IN GLOBAL CONFLICT 531
7.9
&DusDWiRnin*lREDl&RnñicW
As long as there are sovereign nations possessing great power,  
war is inevitable. 
—.erman-American Physicist Albert Einstein (1945)
Essential Question:   What was the relative signiÄcance of the causes of 
global conflict from 1900 to the present?
The 20th century saw significant changes to the global order. At the beginning 
of the century, the West dominated the global political order. However, the 
First and Second World Wars resulted in a power shift within the Western 
political sphere from Western Europe to the United States. These global 
conflicts also resulted in the emergence of new states around the world as 
independence movements ended the colonial relationships that existed in the 
previous century. 
The Ottoman, Russian, and Qing empires that had existed at the beginning 
of the century all collapsed due to internal decay and political revolutions. 
Other areas of the world also saw political upheaval as nations struggled with 
both economic depression and calls for greater democracy. Often, though, 
totalitarian governments emerged out of these political and economic crises. 
3RliWicDl&DusesRf*lREDl&RnñicW  
in the 20th  Century
Many historians refer to World War I as the first “total war.” The war was 
fought on an industrial scale by soldiers from around the world, including 
soldiers from colonial areas. The combatants discovered more, and deadlier, 
methods of killing each other. Long-range artillery, poison gas, flamethrowers, 
and machine guns led to the deaths of millions of soldiers on both sides. The 
roots of this conflict lie in several main causes. A balance of power in Europe 
had been established during the 1th century through a constantly shifting 
system of alliances. However, these alliances proved instrumental in escalating 
the scope of the war as European nations jumped into the conflict to honor 
their commitments. 
Nationalism was a growing force for political change in Europe. As such, 
Serbian nationalism was the main spark that created conflict in the Balkans, 
known as the “powder keg of Europe,” which led to the expansion of the war 
532WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONthroughout Europe. An arms race among the great powers of Europe helped 
to increase the possibility of war as well. Lastly, the imperial rivalry among 
Western nations, as well as Japan and Russia, helped to increase tensions over 
commerce and access to resources.

Some of the same issues that brought about World War I also led to World 
War II. Fascism was nationalism in an extreme form. The fascist governments 
of Germany and Italy defied international pressure and treaties when they 
invaded neighboring territories. The alliance of Germany, Italy, and, eventually, 
Japan was opposed by the Western democracies of Great Britain and France. 
However, it was the inability of the Western democracies to offer a strong 
response to Germany’s aggressive militarism that launched Europe and the 
rest of the world into war. Additionally, Japan’s imperial ambitions in Asia 
were the main cause for war to break out in the Pacific between Japan and the 
United States. Connect: Compare the motivating factors for wars fought in 
the 20th century with wars fought in the 1th century. See Topic 6..
(cRnRPic&DusesRf*lREDl&RnñicW  
in the 20th  Century
The primary economic cause of global conflict in the early 20th century was the 
acquisition and control of markets and resources. In the 1th century, Western 
European governments, followed by the United States, Russia, and Japan, 
began policies to take control of trade, territory, or both in Asia and Africa. In 
previous centuries, armed conflict would often erupt over the rivalry to control 
the natural resources of these areas. However, as the Industrial Revolution 
spread from Great Britain to the rest of Western Europe, and then to the United 
States, Russia, and Japan, control over markets to sell consumer goods was a 
primary motive of imperialistic policies. Attempts were made, particularly in 
the late 1th century, to prevent wars over trade but these attempts had mixed 
success.
533 CAUSATION IN GLOBAL CONFLICT 533The Opium Wars, the First and Second Sino-Japanese War, the Crimean 
War, and eventually the First and Second World Wars had these economic 
factors as some of their root causes. For example, the desire of Imperial Japan 
to take over territory in Asia to obtain sources of oil, rice, rubber, and other 
raw materials led to the decision of the United States and other countries to 
place an embargo on Japan that cut off oil and steel exports from the United 
States to Japan. The result was the Japanese decision to attack the U.S. Pacific 
Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, causing the United States to enter World War 
II. Economic crisis also helped lead to global conflict. The severe economic 
effects of the Great Depression (1929–1939), including high unemployment 
and low wages, led to the rise of populist leaders like Adolf Hitler who 
promised to rebuild the economies of their states. 
(σecWsRf*lREDl&RnñicWinWKeWK&enWuUy
Rapid advances in science and technology led to a better understanding 
of the natural world and brought about advances in many areas, including 
communication, transportation, industry, agriculture, and medicine. States also 
improved their war-making capabilities. As a result, one of the most significant 
effects of the global conflicts of the 20th century was the immense loss of life 
as warfare became deadlier to both combatants and civilians alike. Large-scale 
aerial bombing that targeted populated areas, deadly policies that targeted 
specific minority groups such as European Jews, and the use of new military 
technology such as the atomic bomb all meant that global conflict would 
cause unprecedented deaths among the civilian population. In addition, mass 
starvation and crimes against humanity were also responsible for millions of 
civilian deaths during the 20th century.

534WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONGlobal conflict in the 20th century also brought about notable political 
changes in the world. In the beginning of the century, the Mexican Revolution 
took place because many Mexicans wanted political and economic reforms. 
Populist movements formed and, eventually, Mexico created a new constitution 
with more political and economic rights for the majority of Mexicans. 
However, true democratic institutions in Mexico emerged and evolved slowly. 
As a result of World War I, regime change occurred in both the Ottoman 
Empire and the Russian Empire. In addition to the effect of the First World 
War, ineffective or corrupt leadership was also instrumental in bringing about 
the political revolutions that toppled the monarchies of these states. While the 
Ottoman government was replaced by a Western-style democracy, the Russian 
Revolution instituted a totalitarian government headed by the Communist 
Party. 
Resentment of the Treaty of Versailles, the peace agreement that ended  
World War I, also helped to bring about totalitarian regimes in Germany and 
Italy. These fascist governments appealed to people’s nationalism and desire 
to restore the country’s glory and standing in the world, leading their nations 
toward war. 
World War I weakened the colonial powers, and after the war, U.S. 
President Woodrow Wilson advocated for the self-determination of people to 
choose their government or nation-state. This was seen as a sign that colonies 
had the right to demand independence. Many people in the colonies also felt 
that their support of or active participation in the war meant that they were 
owed some form of self-government. When those in power did not meet these 
demands, organized independence movements formed or grew. 
The desire for independence continued to grow after World War II, as 
the colonial powers were further weakened by the war and unable to afford 
the cost and labor power to rebuild and maintain their empires. Many new Civilian Deaths in the Second World War

535 CAUSATION IN GLOBAL CONFLICTstates formed during this time. Former colonies that had a small foreign settler 
population gained their independence relatively peacefully, while colonies 
that had a sizeable foreign settler population often experienced a more violent 
process towards independence. 
Perhaps the largest independence movement, in terms of the number of 
people involved, took place in India. Relying on passive resistance and civil 
disobedience, the people of the British colony of India achieved independence 
in 1. However, due to religious and ideological differences, the Indian 
subcontinent was partitioned into a Muslim-dominated Pakistan which 
originally included East Pakistan, now Bangladesh and a Hindu-dominated 
India. See Topic 8.6. The tensions between Muslims and Hindus living in 
British India did not disappear with independence. These tensions have led to 
several military conflicts between the two countries since partition.
Another significant effect of the global conflicts of the 20th century 
was a repositioning of power in the Western countries²away from Western 
Europe and to the United States. Because of the participation of the United 
States in both the First and Second World Wars, as well as the smaller scale 
of destruction the U.S. experienced compared to Western European countries, 
the United States became a world power, playing the dominant role in the 
transatlantic relationship. However, the Soviet Union soon emerged as a 
second superpower in opposition to the United States.

UNIT 7 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WHAT CAUSED TOTALITARIANI SM?
Scholars disagree about why so many totalitarian states, states with 
complete control over every aspect of public and private life, emerged 
in the 20th century. While many countries moved toward democracy, 
Russia, Germany, Italy, and Spain became dictatorships between the 
two world wars. Scholars often explain the rise of totalitarianism from 
their own discipline’s viewpoint. 
An Economist’s View  An Austrian economist, Friedrich Hayek, argued 
that totalitarianism had developed gradually and was based on decisions about 
economic policy. In his 1 book The Road to Serfdom, Hayek concluded that 
totalitarianism grew in Western democracies because they had “progressively 
abandoned that freedom in economic affairs without which personal and 
political freedom has never existed in the past.” He viewed socialism and 
fascism as two sides of the same coin, since centralized government planning 
and state power characterized both. 
Political Scientists’ View  In contrast, the American political scientists 
Carl Friedrich and =bigniew Brzezinski focused on political and ethnic issues, 
not economic ones. They contended that the totalitarian regimes in Germany, 
Italy, and the Soviet Union had their origins in the upheaval brought about by 
World War I. The forces of nationalism unleashed by the war, combined with 
the need to respond politically to the global depression that followed World 
War I, created fertile ground for strong nationalistic rulers who could rise to 
political power and address ethnic conflict.
A Historian’s View  American historian and journalist William Shirer 
identified the origins of Nazism in Germany’s distant and distinctive past. He 
concluded that Germanic nationalism, authoritarianism, and militarism dated 
back to the Middle Ages. “The course of German history . . . ,” he wrote, 
“made blind obedience to temporal rulers the highest virtue of Germanic man, 
and put a premium on servility.” No other country developed the same sort of 
Nazism because no country had Germany’s past.
A Sociologist’s View  American sociologist Barrington Moore looked to 
the past to explain totalitarianism. However, rather than focus on what made 
each country unique, he searched for patterns in the social structures of groups 
of countries. In his book 6ocial 2rigins of 'ictatorship and 'emocracy  
166, Moore looked at why Great Britain, France, and the United States 
evolved into democracies, while Japan, China, Russia, and Germany evolved 
into dictatorships. For Moore, two vital steps in creating a democracy were 
developing a middle class and breaking the power of the landed aristocracy. 
Countries that failed to do these things were more likely to become dictatorships.
Develop an Argument :  Evaluate the extent to which historical evidence 
supports one of the perspectives on totalitarianism. 
 537
WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  WRITE  THE SUPP ORTING  PARAGRA PHS
The supporting paragraphs in your long essay will demonstrate your skill in 
using evidence. They will also demonstrate your ability to follow a reasoning 
process and develop a complex interpretation of the prompt.
Use of Evidence  Suppose your thesis is that imperialism and militarism 
are the two most significant causes of global conflict in the period 100 to the 
present. To earn any points, you need to provide two examples of evidence 
relevant to your thesis²that is, directly connected to your topic. For example, 
you might point out that imperialism caused conflict not only between 
competing empires but also between the imperialists and the native peoples 
whose land they colonized. You might also note that militarism fed nationalist 
competition and reduced the gravity of warfare in the eyes of the public. For 
both points of evidence, you would include specific examples.
However, to earn the maximum number of points, you need to show 
how your evidence supports your argument. For example, you would need 
to point out that because imperialism touched nearly every part of the globe 
and disrupted so many native peoples, it was a far more significant cause of 
global conflict than other causes, such as European alliances. You would use 
examples to show the breadth of imperialist reach and the smaller sphere of 
European alliances. You might explain in a second paragraph that militarism 
was such a significant cause of global conflict because it was the force that 
made imperialism possible. You might also provide examples of the increasing 
power of military technology to inflict harm. Using such terms as Eecause and 
for this reason  will help you link your evidence to your argument.
Historical Reasoning and Complexity Your supporting paragraphs also 
need to show that you have framed your argument with historical reasoning²
causation, continuity and change, or comparison. You can show this framing in 
your choice of key words as well as in the organization you use. For example, 
if you are comparing imperialism in Africa with imperialism in South America, 
you could organize your material so that you cover imperialism in Africa in one 
or more paragraphs and then move on to cover imperialism in South America, 
noting similarities and differences as you go. Or you might subdivide the topic 
of imperialism into such categories as its effect on social structures and its 
effect on economic matters and discuss both regions in each category. 
To earn the most points, however, your supporting paragraphs must 
demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development that is 
the focus of the prompt. You can show your complex understanding in many 
ways. You can explain both similarities and differences or address multiple 
causes and effects. You could make insightful connections across geographic 
areas and time periods. You could also use evidence from other sources to 
corroborate verify, qualify set limitations, or modify revise an argument 
that addresses the question. See Write as a Historian in Topic 8. for more on 
these uses of evidence.)

Kaiser to Tsar , July 28, 11 >this and the previous telegram crossed@: It 
is with the gravest concern that I hear of the impression which the action 
of Austria against Serbia is creating in your country. The unscrupulous 
agitation that has been going on in Serbia for years has resulted in the 
outrageous crime, to which Archduke Francis Ferdinand fell a victim. 
The spirit that led Serbians to murder their own king and his wife still 
dominates the country. You will doubtless agree with me that we both, you 
and me, have a common interest as well as all Sovereigns to insist that all 
the persons morally responsible for the dastardly murder should receive 
their deserved punishment. In this case politics plays no part at all.
On the other hand, I fully understand how difficult it is for you and your 
Government to face the drift of your public opinion. Therefore, with regard 
to the hearty and tender friendship which binds us both from long ago with 
firm ties, I am exerting my utmost influence to induce the Austrians to deal 
straightly to arrive to a satisfactory understanding with you. I confidently 
hope that you will help me in my efforts to smooth over difficulties that 
may still arise.
Kaiser to Tsar, July 2, 11: I received your telegram and share your 
wish that peace should be maintained. But as I told you in my first 
telegram, I cannot consider Austria’s action against Serbia an “ignoble” 
war. Austria knows by experience that Serbian promises on paper are 
wholly unreliable. . . . I therefore suggest that it would be quite possible 
for Russia to remain a spectator of the Austro-Serbian conflict without 
involving Europe in the most horrible war she ever witnessed.

Am sending Tatischev this evening with instructions. The military 
measures which have now come into force were decided five days ago for 
reasons of defence on account of Austria’s preparations. I hope from all 
my heart that these measures won’t in any way interfere with your part as 
mediator which I greatly value. We need your strong pressure on Austria 
to come to an understanding with us.

Kaiser to Tsar, July 0, 11: Best thanks for telegram. It is quite out of the 
question that my ambassadors language could have been in contradiction 
with the tenor of my telegram. Count Pourtalès was instructed to draw 
the attention of your government to the danger 	 grave consequences 
involved by a mobilisation I said the same in my telegram to you. Austria 
has only mobilized against Serbia 	 only a part of her army. If, as it is now 
the case, according to the communication by you 	 your Government, 
Russia mobilizes against Austria, my role as mediator you kindly intrusted 
me with, 	 which I accepted at you>r@ express prayer, will be endangered 
if not ruined. The whole weight of the decision lies solely on you>r@ 
shoulders now, who have to bear the responsibility for Peace or War.
Kaiser to Tsar, July 1, 11: On your appeal to my friendship and 
your call for assistance began to mediate between your and the Austro-
Hungarian Government. While this action was proceeding your troops 
were mobilized against Austro-Hungary, my ally. Thereby, as I have 
already pointed out to you, my mediation has been made almost illusory .
I have nevertheless continued my action. I now receive authentic news 
of serious preparations for war on my Eastern frontier. Responsibility 
for the safety of my empire forces preventive measures of defence upon 
me. In my endeavours to maintain the peace of the world I have gone 
to the utmost limit possible. The responsibility for the disaster which is 
now threatening the whole civilized world will not be laid at my door. In 
this moment it still lies in your power to avert it. Nobody is threatening 
the honour or power of Russia who can well afford to await the result of 
my mediation. My friendship for you and your empire, transmitted to me 
by my grandfather on his deathbed has always been sacred to me and I 
have honestly often backed up Russia when she was in serious trouble 
especially in her last war.
The peace of Europe may still be maintained by you, if Russia will 
agree to stop the military measures which must threaten Germany and 
Austro-Hungary.

UNIT 8: COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION 545
UNIT 8:   Cold War and 
Decolonization
Understand the Context
The aftermath of the world wars provided the context for two developments 
in the late 20th century: the decline of colonial empires and the rise of a tense 
conflict between capitalist and communist states known as the Cold War. These 
conflicts became intertwined, resulting in numerous wars.
Decolonization  Against the backdrop of the world wars, nationalist 
movements in African and Asian colonies intensified. In the decades following 
World War II, colonies achieved independence through negotiation, and in 
some cases, armed struggle. The creation of independent states often resulted 
in population resettlements and challenges to inherited colonial boundaries. 
In newly independent states, as in more established states, governments 
actively promoted economic development. Movements to redistribute land 
and wealth gained support in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Some of these 
movements, such as the one in China, embraced a form of communism. Even 
after independence, connections between postcolonial states and former 
colonial empires continued through migration and economic relationships.
The Cold War  After World War II, with Europe weakened, the United 
States and the Soviet Union USSR emerged as competing superpowers. The 
resulting Cold War was a power struggle between capitalism and communism, 
expressed through competing military alliances, a nuclear arms race, and 
proxy wars in postcolonial states in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. 
While the Cold War heightened global tensions, movements advocating 
nonviolence and alternatives to the established order, such as the Non-Aligned 
Movement, also became influential. By the late 100s, Soviet economic 
and military stagnation and public discontent contributed to the collapse of 
communist governments in Eastern Europe and the end of the Cold War. 19002000 1950The Soviet Union refuses

SETTING T HE STAGE FOR T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION 547
5478.1
Setting the Stage for the Cold 
War and Decolonization
We would consider it our moral duty to lend all support to the ending of 
colonialism and imperialism so that people everywhere are free to mould 
their own destiny. 
—Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indian independence movement leader in the 1920s 
Essential Question:   What was the historical context for the Cold War  
after World War II?
After the global conflict of World War II, the largely unfulfilled hopes for 
greater colonial self-government after World War I were revived. Shastri’s 
anti-imperialist sentiments helped explain how global affairs changed after 
the war ended in 15. Colonies’ desire for independence became intertwined 
with a global ideological conflict between capitalist countries led by the 
United States and communist countries led by the Soviet Union.
Bringing the War to an End
During World War II, the leaders of Great Britain, the United States, and the 
Soviet Union, known as the Big Three , held several meetings to plan for the 
post-war world. Three of these were particularly important. 
The Tehran Conference  During the Tehran Conference  in Iran in 
November 1, the Allies agreed that the Soviet Union would focus on 
freeing Eastern Europe, while Britain and the United States would concentrate 
on Western Europe. In addition, Britain and the United States agreed to a 
Soviet demand to shift some Polish territory to the Soviet Union, which would 
be offset by Poland gaining territory elsewhere, mostly from Germany.
The Yalta Conference  By February 15, the Allies knew that Germany 
was near defeat, but they disagreed about what should happen after Germany’s 
surrender. At the Yalta Conference,  at a resort on the Black Sea, the leaders 
focused on plans for reconstructing Eastern Europe and for defeating Japan. 
• Franklin Roosevelt wanted free, democratic elections in Eastern 
Europe. He also wanted the Soviets to join the war against Japan. 
548 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• Stalin demanded influence over Eastern Europe. Fearful that another 
Napoleon or Hitler would invade Russia from the West, he wanted 
Eastern Europe as a buffer zone. In return for Soviet help against 
Japan, he wanted control of islands claimed by Japan, ports ruled by 
China, and part ownership of a Manchurian railroad.
Roosevelt thought that after years of overseas war, the American public 
was unlikely to support a war against the Soviets over the fate of democracy in 
Eastern Europe. The conference ended with a Soviet pledge to fight Japan, but 
the Soviets offered only vague assurances on free elections in Eastern Europe. 
The Potsdam Conference  The final meeting among leaders of the Big 
Three, the Potsdam Conference, began in July 15 in Germany. Harry 
Truman , who had become president after Roosevelt died on April 12, 
represented the United States. Churchill started the conference but lost his 
position as prime minister in mid-July and was replaced by Clement Atlee. 
Truman insisted on free elections in Eastern Europe. However, by then  
Soviet troops had occupied the region. Stalin refused Truman’s demand. With 
the backing of Soviet power, communists eventually gained control of East 
Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. 
By 15, the United States and the Soviet Union lacked trust in one 
another and had begun the aggressive rhetoric that would become standard 
for four decades following World War II. Potsdam and the earlier conferences 
failed to settle important issues between the world’s major powers. As a result, 
the stage was set for a cold war between countries still devastated by a hot war. 
Shifting Balance of Power
When the war ended in 15, parts of Europe and Asia had been devastated. 
The war resulted in 0 million to 60 million deaths. It destroyed factories, 
roads, bridges, and other structures needed for industrial production. It forced 
millions of people to move. Many were fleeing communism or searching for 
safety and opportunity. 
Massive Destruction in Europe  Wartime losses were not evenly 
distributed throughout Europe. In general, East and Central Europe suffered 
greater losses than did Western Europe. Worst hit were the Soviet Union, 
Poland, and Germany. Each lost between 10 and 20 percent of its population. 
Countries such as Great Britain and France, despite their losses, maintained 
strong traditions of democracy and the rule of law. They still had strong 
educational systems, including outstanding universities. They remained home 
to large, innovative corporations. These advantages provided the foundation 
for Western Europe to become a global leader after the war. However, because 
of the massive physical destruction and population loss in victorious and 
defeated nations, Europe became less influential and powerful in the rest of the 
world, while the United States and the Soviet Union became more powerful. 
Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the destruction caused by World  
War I and World War II. See Topic .8.  
549 SETTING T HE STAGE FOR T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATIONThe U.S.-Soviet Rivalry  In 15, then, the United States was poised to 
become the most powerful country in the world. Of all the major countries 
involved in the war, the United States suffered the least. Heavy fighting 
occurred on U.S. soil, in the Philippines, but the U.S. mainland was 
untouched by attacks. Its industrial base and infrastructure not only remained 
intact but also grew stronger through government-funded military contracts. 
Further, the loss of life in the United States was far lower than in Europe. The  
relative prosperity of the United States allowed it to provide financial aid to 
European countries after the war. This aid program, called the Marshall Plan, 
is described in Topic 8.2.
The United States also had developed atomic weapons and used them 
during the war, making the country even more formidable. The Soviets 
successfully tested an atomic bomb of their own in 1. By the end of the 
10s, only the Soviet Union could challenge the United States in military 
might and political influence. 
Advances During the War  Military research at universities and in private 
companies, often funded by government, resulted in tremendous technological 
developments during World War II. Among the items that were developed 
for, improved, or used more widely by the military were air pressure systems 
for airplane cabins, refrigeration for food, stronger plywood for construction, 
and a variety of plastics for many uses. One of the most important advances 
was the spread of the use of penicillin, which saved the lives of thousands of 
wounded soldiers. Each of these advances would be adapted for civilian use, 
thereby improving the lives of millions of people. 
The Start of the Cold War
The U.S.-Soviet tensions evident at Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam made conflict   
likely. However, the high costs of the war meant that neither superpower 
wanted a full-scale war with the other. Rather, they settled into a cold war,  a 
conflict does not involve direct military confrontation between two or more 
rival states. The Cold War between the superpowers played out in propaganda 
campaigns, secret operations, and an arms race. 
The deadliest results of the Cold War occurred outside the lands of the 
two superpowers. The U.S.-Soviet rivalry led both countries to arm opposing 
sides in conflicts around the world, thereby transforming small civil wars and 
regional conflicts into much larger events. This increased the death tolls and 
level of destruction in these wars.
In the early 150s, the United States and Soviet Union each developed a 
hydrogen bomb  that was much more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped 
on Japan at the end of World War II. The arms race fostered close ties between 
the military and the industries that developed weapons. Before he left office in 
161, President Dwight Eisenhower  expressed his concerns about the U.S.-
Soviet competition for supremacy in nuclear armaments. He warned against 
allowing the military-industrial complex,  the informal alliance between the 
550 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONgovernment and the large defense contractors, to gain too much power. In later 
decades, citizens in many countries expressed similar worries. They began to 
protest the stockpiling of nuclear weapons.
Breakdown of Empires
After World War II, efforts resumed to undermine colonialism. The start of 
World War I had marked the high point of colonial empires. The British, the 
French, and other Europeans had colonized almost all of Africa, India, and 
Southeast Asia, and they dominated China. Empires based in Austria, Turkey, 
and Russia were multiethnic states, but each was dominated by one group, 
leaving others feeling discriminated against. After World War I, the demand for 
self-determination , the idea that each country should choose its own form of 
government and leaders, was spreading. The Austro-Hungary Empire and the 
Ottoman Empire crumbled, restructured into multiple new countries. However, 
in China, India, and throughout Africa, Europeans generally maintained their 
power, even expanding it over territories that had been part of the Ottoman 
Empire. 
During World War II, the leading colonial powers focused on stopping 
Hitler. As a result, the anti-colonial movements probably grew stronger, but 
actual independence made little progress. However, after World War II, the 
foundation was set for the dismantling of colonial empires: 
• In the colonized world, movements for self-determination grew. Often, 
they included both advocates of greater self-rule and proponents of full 
independence.
• World War II had so weakened Great Britain, France, and the other 
colonial powers that they had fewer resources to resist independence. 
• The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union gave 
anti-colonial activists two superpowers to recruit as supporters. 
The successful efforts of people to undermine colonial empires are described 
in Topics 8.5 and 8.6.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“On November 1, 152, the United States successfully detonated “Mike,” the 
world’s first hydrogen bomb, on the Elugelab Atoll in the Pacific Marshall 
Islands. The 10.-megaton thermonuclear device, built upon the Teller-Ulam 
principles of staged radiation implosion, instantly vaporized an entire island 
and left behind a crater more than a mile wide. The incredible explosive 
force of Mike was also apparent from the sheer magnitude of its mushroom  
cloud. . . . Half an hour after the test, the mushroom stretched 60 miles across, 
with the base of the head joining the stem at 5,000 feet.
Three years later, on November 22, 155, the Soviet Union detonated its 
first hydrogen bomb on the same principle of radiation implosion. Both 
superpowers were now in possession of the µhell bomb,’ as it was known by 
many Americans, and the world lived under the threat of thermonuclear war 
for the first time in history.”

8.2
The Cold War
Let us not be deceived—we are today in the midst of a cold war.
—Bernard Baruch, banker and presidential advisor, 1947
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of the ideological  
struggle of the Cold War?
After World War II, the democratic United States and the authoritarian Soviet 
Union emerged as the strongest countries in the world. Both countries had 
expanded their territorial control and influence after the war. After the Potsdam 
Conference in Germany in 15, Truman and Stalin soon recognized their 
rivalry for dominance over Europe and Asia. The ideological conflict noted by 
Baruch, the power struggle between capitalism led by the United States and 
communism led by the Soviet Union, was the central global conflict over the 
next 0 years.
&RRSeUDWiRn'esSiWe&RnñicW7Ke8niWeG1DWiRns
Despite ideological differences, the Allies shared a commitment to building 
a new organization to promote peace and prosperity to replace the League of 
Nations. The League had failed for two significant reasons:
• It lacked the support of all the world’s powerful countries, particularly 
the United States.
• It lacked a mechanism to act quickly to stop small conflicts from 
escalating into large ones.
In 1, leaders of the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and 
China discussed the idea of the  United Nations (UN) . The UN was established 
in 15. Connect: Write a paragraph comparing the United Nations with the 
League of Nations. See Topics . and .5.
Rivalry in Economics and Politics
The existence of the United Nations did not prevent tensions from growing 
worse between the Soviet Union and the West. Winston Churchill’s March 
16 speech symbolized the Cold War. Churchill said that “an iron curtain has 
descended across the continent” of Europe. The metaphor of the Iron Curtain 
described the split between Eastern and Western Europe. 
555 THE COLD WARCapitalism and Communism  One difference between the United 
States and the Soviet Union was how they organized their economies. 
• In the United States, Western Europe, and other capitalist countries, 
economic assets, such as farms and factories, were mostly owned 
privately. Hence, private interests determined economic decisions. 
People had the freedom to act in their self-interest. 
• In the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and other communist 
countries, economic assets were owned by the government. The 
system emphasized equality and fairness. 
Democracy and Authoritarianism  A second difference was how 
the rivals organized their political systems. In the United States, people 
chose their elected leaders through free elections. Further, they relied on an 
independent press to provide accurate information about the government 
and political parties to compete for votes. In the Soviet Union, elections 
were not significant, the press was operated by the government, and a single 
party dominated politics.
Criticisms and Similarities  Each side pointed to what it saw as 
flaws in the other. In the United States, people attacked the Soviet system 
for restricting the rights of people to speak and worship freely, to elect 
their own representatives, and to allow businesses to operate efficiently. 
Soviets accused the United States of giving poor people the “freedom 
to starve” and for discriminating against African Americans and other 
minorities. The Soviet Union also stressed its emphasis on women’s 
equality as a difference between its system and that of the United States.
Despite the difference in the U.S. and Soviet models, some analysts 
emphasized their similarities. For example, in both, control of big economic 
decisions was in the hands of groups, either the government or millions of 
corporate shareholders. Further, both countries often acted out of fear of the 
other, which made the military a powerful force in each. 
&RnñicWsin,nWeUnDWiRnDl$σDiUs
Each side wanted to expand its system of thought throughout the world. 
This competition resulted in a long-running battle for influence over the 
opinions of people and alliance with governments. 
The USSR and Its Satellite Countries  The Soviets were determined 
to make the governments of Eastern Europe as much like the Soviet 
government as possible. They therefore directed the countries of Bulgaria, 
East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania to develop five-year 
economic plans focused on developing industry and collective agriculture 
at the expense of consumer products. All political parties other than the 
Communists were outlawed.
These actions allowed the USSR Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
to exploit the Eastern European nations to benefit the Soviets rather than 
556 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONto help those countries grow. The satellite countries —small states that 
are economically or politically dependent on a larger, more powerful 
state²were forced to import only Soviet goods and to export only to the 
Soviet Union. Moreover, the governments of these countries were just as 
dictatorial as the Soviet government. Connect: Create a graphic comparing 
Communist and earlier Western imperialism. See Topic 6.2.
World Revolution  Beginning with the October Revolution of 11, 
the Soviet Union viewed capitalism as a threat to its power. This view was 
enhanced with the concept of world revolution, a belief that organized 
workers would overthrow capitalism in all countries. The Soviets supported 
revolutions and uprisings between 11 and 12 in Germany, Bavaria, 
Hungary, northern Italy, and Bulgaria. Soviet interference elevated 
Western suspicions about Soviet intentions. After World War II, growing 
revolutionary feelings became a serious threat to Western powers and to 
governments in Central and Southern Europe. 
Containment  U.S. diplomat George .ennan worked in the U.S. 
Embassy in Moscow during the 10s and in 16. .ennan believed that the 
Soviet Union would continue to expand its borders and its influence abroad 
if it could. He advocated a policy of containment ²not letting communism 
spread farther. Some politicians criticized .ennan for accepting the status 
quo. They argued for a more aggressive policy of overthrowing existing 
regimes in order to “roll back” the spread of communism.
Truman Doctrine  .ennan’s reports influenced President Harry 
Truman. A speech in 1 outlined the Truman Doctrine , a strong statement 
that the United States would do what it had to do to stop the spread of 
communist influence, specifically in Greece and Turkey. The Soviet Union 
wanted to put military bases in Turkey so it could control the Dardanelles, 
the strait between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. In Greece, left-
wing groups controlled by Communists were close to gaining control of the 
government. Truman pledged U.S. economic and military support to help 
the two countries resist this communist domination.
The Marshall Plan  After World War II, the United States was deeply 
concerned about rebuilding Europe. The United States provided assistance to 
those countries soon after the war ended. However, many U.S. leaders thought 
more was needed to get European allies back on their feet economically. 
Based on the belief that a communist revolution could happen in economically 
unstable nations, the new goal was to rebuild Europe into a prosperous and 
stable region. The Marshall Plan,  enacted in June 1, was designed to 
offer 12 billion in aid to all nations of Europe, including Germany. This 
money would be used to modernize industry, reduce trade barriers, and 
rebuild Europe’s damaged infrastructure. The plan worked. Economic output 
in the countries aided was 5 percent higher in 151 than it had been in 18.
The Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites refused to 
participate in the plan. Instead, in 1, the Soviets developed their own 
557 THE COLD WARplan to help rebuild Eastern Europe²the Council for Mutual Economic 
Assistance (COMECON) . The scope of the organization was narrower 
than that of the Marshall Plan. It was limited primarily to trade and credit 
agreements among the six members. Its impact was modest compared to the 
Marshall Plan.
The Space Race and the Arms Race 
Space Race  In 15, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, 
called Sputnik , into orbit around Earth, inaugurating what become known as 
the Space Race . The United States launched its first satellite in January 158. 
The two nations competed to become the first with a manned satellite orbiting 
Earth and, later, the first to land a human on the moon.

and Space Museum. Source:  Wikimedia Commons
Launch of first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, on 
January 1, 158. 
Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD)  Early in 15, the Soviets tested 
the first intercontinental ballistic missile  ICBM capable of delivering a 
nuclear warhead into U.S. territory. The United States tested a similar missile 
later that same year. Both countries realized that they had become so powerful 
that they had reached a point of mutual assured destruction . That is, regardless 
of who started a war, both would be obliterated by the end of it. Since neither 
side could win a nuclear war, neither side had an incentive to start one. As long 
as both sides kept improving their technology, the balance of terror between 
them would keep the peace²everyone hoped.
The Non-Aligned Movement
Many new African and Asian countries wanted to stay out of the U.S.-Soviet 
Cold War. They wanted an alternative framework for international economic, 
political, and social order²one not dominated by the two superpowers. In 
558 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION155, Indonesia hosted a conference, known as the Bandung Conference after 
the city where it was held, for representatives of these countries. Delegates from 
China, India, and 2 other countries²representing more than half the world’s 
population²passed resolutions condemning colonialism. The impulse that 
prompted the Bandung Conference led countries to formally organize the Non-
Aligned Movement in 161. However, non-aligned countries faced challenges:
• Member states tried to combine support for stronger international 
institutions with efforts to advance their own interests. For example, 
Indian leader Jawaharlal Nehru supported a stronger UN, but he 
opposed its efforts to intervene in the conflict between India and 
Pakistan over control of the region of .ashmir. 
• Member states often became more closely allied with one superpower 
or the other. When war broke out between Somalia and Ethiopia in 
1, the Soviet Union supplied aid to Ethiopia, prompting the United 
States to supply aid to Somalia.

561 THE COLD WARTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   EXPLAIN  THE HISTORICAL  SITUATION  OF 
THE “RED SCARE ”
Communists are sometimes called “reds.” A “red scare” is a period 
during which non-Communists are especially fearful and suspicious 
that Communists are plotting a takeover, often through infiltrating 
government institutions. A red scare happened in the United States in 
the years after World War II. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin 
became the leading voice for hunting down Communist spies and 
infiltrators. He made unfounded allegations against politicians and 
hundreds of civilians, suspecting them of being Communists and 
Soviet spies. In Wheeling, West 9irginia, on February , 150, 
Senator McCarthy gave an infamous speech proclaiming that he had 
a list of members of the Communist Party who were in the U.S. State 
Department.
“The reason why we find ourselves in a position of impotency is not 
because our only powerful potential enemy has sent men to invade 
our shores . . . . but rather because of the traitorous actions of those 
who have been treated so well by this Nation. It has not been the less 
fortunate, or members of minority groups who have been traitorous 
to this Nation, but rather those who have had all the benefits that the 
wealthiest Nation on earth has had to offer . . . . the finest homes, 
the finest college education and the finest jobs in government we can 
give. 
This is glaringly true in the State Department. There the bright young 
men who are born with silver spoons in their mouths are the ones 
who have been most traitorous . . . I have here in my hand a list of 
205 . . . names that were made known to the Secretary of State as 
being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still 
working and shaping policy in the State Department . . .”

;he only thing that kept the *old >ar cold was the mutual deterrence aќorded 
by nuclear weapons.
—Chung  4ong-joon,  South 2orean politician  and business  leader, 2013
Essential Question:  In what ways did both the Soviet Union and the United 
States seeR to maintain influence  during the Cold War?
With the start of the Cold War, new military alliances for mutual protection 
formed in different parts of the world. The threat of nuclear war, as noted 
above by Chung Mong-joon, kept the United States and the Soviet Union from 
starting a war that could end in unprecedented global destruction. But proxy 
wars , such as the ones in .orea and 9ietnam, resulted in millions of deaths. In 
a proxy war, a major power helps bring about a conflict between other nations 
but does not always fight directly. These conflicts underlined the political and 
philosophical divide between the superpowers.
The superpowers faced off in Cuba and several other Central American 
countries as well as in the African country of Angola. The combination of 
military, economic, and nuclear influence across the globe made the world a 
tense place for decades after World War II²the war the two superpowers had 
worked together to end.
Allied Occupation of Germany
The conflict among the Allies after World War II was exemplified by the debate 
over how to occupy the defeated country of Germany. The Allies agreed to 
partition the country among France, Great Britain, the United States, and the 
Soviet Union. The three Western Allies wanted to combine their zones into one 
state under democratic principles.  
Berlin Blockade  The Allies also decided to divide Germany’s capital, 
Berlin, into four zones. The three Western zones would become a free city that 
was located within the Soviet zone of Germany. The Soviets wanted to stop 
these Western plans and control all of Berlin. They set up a blockade of the 
Western zones in Berlin to prevent the West from moving supplies into the area 
by land. The Western Allies did not want to risk a military confrontation with 
the Soviets and ultimately began the Berlin Airlift . Through this operation, 
563 EFFECT S OF T HE COLD WARthe Allies flew supplies into Western zones between February 18 and May 
1, when the Soviets lifted the blockade. 
Two Germanys  After the blockade ended, Germany split into two states. 
West Germany became the Federal Republic of Germany. East Germany 
became the German Democratic Republic. The division of Europe into East 
and West was complete. 
Berlin Wall  As citizens of East Germany saw the prosperity and 
democratic lifestyle of West Germany, many wanted to move to the West. 
Between 1 and 161, about 2.5 million East Germans fled.
However, the East German and Soviet governments were determined to 
keep people in East Germany. They knew that the exodus to the West reflected 
poorly on the communist system, and it was hard on their economy. They 
first set up barbed-wire fences patrolled by guards along the perimeter of East 
Germany and between East and West Berlin. In August 161, they began 
replacing the fences in Berlin with a wall, which became known as the Berlin 
Wall . Between 161 and 18, when the Berlin Wall fell, soldiers killed about 
150 people as they tried to escape over it.
NATO, the Warsaw Pact, and Other Alliances
Only a few years after World War II ended, the Soviet Union dominated the 
Eastern European countries they had occupied during the war. Communist 
governments in those countries²buoyed by support and the direct influence 
of Stalin²subjected their people to the same suppression and economic 
system as the Soviet Union. Many Western European countries feared such a 
dominant communist presence on their doorstep. 
Out of a desire to coordinate their defenses in case of a conflict with 
the Soviets, several Western nations created the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO)  in April 1. The treaty pledged mutual support 
and cooperation within the alliance against conflicts and wars. Its original 
members were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Iceland, 
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United States. 
Membership in this Brussels-based organization expanded considerably in the 
decades after its founding.
The Soviet Union’s response to NATO was the Warsaw Pact , created 
in 155. Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, 
Romania, and the Soviet Union were the original members. Warsaw Pact 
nations combined their armed forces and based their army leaders in Moscow, 
the capital of the Soviet Union. These nations were known as the communist 
bloc.
Two countries with communist political systems successfully resisted 
Soviet control. Albania, located next to Greece, joined the Warsaw Pact but 
withdrew in 168. It became more closely tied to China. Yugoslavia, under the 
authoritarian leadership of Marshall Josip Broz Tito, never joined the Warsaw 
564 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONPact. In the 10s, ethnic divisions caused Yugoslavia to break apart into 
several countries, including Slovenia, Serbia, and Croatia.
Other treaty organizations formed in an attempt to halt the spread of 
communism in other regions:
• In 15, Australia, France, Great Britain, New =ealand, Pakistan, the 
Philippines, Thailand, and the United States formed the Southeast 
Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) . 
• The Central Treaty Organization (CENTO)  was an anti-Soviet 
treaty organization formed by Great Britain, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and 
Turkey to prevent the spread of Communism in the Middle East. The 
United States was not a full member, but it joined CENTO’S military 
committee. 
During the Cold War, the United States formed alliances with more than 0 
states. It was sometimes easier for the United States to influence and negotiate 
through these smaller alliances than through the United Nations.
Proxy Wars
The ideological Cold War was accompanied by hot wars in Asia, Africa, Latin 
America, and the Caribbean. They were called proxy  wars  because the armies 
of smaller countries were proxies, or stand-ins, for the two superpowers. These 
wars often combined specific local issues, such as a battle against colonialism 
or for land reform see Topic 8., with the international conflict over the 
spread of communism. Though proxy wars occurred in small countries, some 
resulted in millions of deaths. 
Two of the biggest confrontations were the .orean War and 9ietnam War 
in Asia. In both instances, the countries were split into northern and southern 
sections. In both countries, a communist government ruled the northern section. 
Korean War  Just as the victorious powers divided Germany after World 
War II, they also divided the .orean Peninsula. The Soviets occupied the north 
while the United States and its allies occupied the south. The Korean War  
150±15 began when North .orea invaded South .orea in an attempt to 
reunite the country under its leadership. In response, the UN voted to defend 
South .orea militarily. The Soviet Union could have vetoed the resolution, 
but its representative was absent during the vote because the Soviet Union was 
boycotting all Security Council meetings in protest over a disagreement about 
China’s seat on the Security Council.
UN military forces supporting the South .oreans came from 16 member 
countries, but the United States provided the largest number and the overall 
commander, General  Douglas MacArthur . The Soviet Union did not send 
troops, but it sent money and weapons to North .orea. The UN forces pushed 
back the North .oreans across the inter-.orean border and drove toward 
North .orea’s border with China. The Chinese, allies of North .orea and 
concerned that the UN forces would try to invade China as well, sent Chinese 
565 EFFECT S OF T HE COLD WARtroops across the border and entered the war against the United States and its 
allies. After three years of fighting and some four million civilian and military 
casualties, the war ended in a stalemate. The two parts of .orea remained 
divided, with a demilitarized zone in between. 
Vietnam War  U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, following the 
Truman policy of containment, sent military advisers to South 9ietnam to 
train the South 9ietnamese army and to prevent a communist takeover by 
North 9ietnam. Eisenhower’s successor, President John F. .ennedy, increased 
the number of advisers from 1,000 to 16,000. Some U.S. citizens believed 
America could not afford to lose a confrontation in 9ietnam. They thought a 
communist victory would weaken U.S. prestige around the world. 
However, the United States was supporting an undemocratic and 
unpopular South 9ietnamese ruler, Ngo Dinh Diem. In 16, Buddhist monk 
Thich Quang Duc publicly set himself on fire in Saigon to protest the South 
9ietnamese government’s favoring of Catholics over Buddhists. His protests 
inspired others. A military coup, with U.S. support, soon overthrew Diem. 
In 16, President Lyndon Johnson  sent more U.S. troops to South 
9ietnam. Johnson believed in the domino theory  —the idea that if one 
country in the region became communist, other countries would soon follow. 
Johnson feared that China and the Soviet Union would bring all of Southeast 
Asia under communist rule. Connect: Trace foreign intervention in Southeast 
Asian affairs through the 9ietnam War. See Topic 6.2.
The Bay of Pigs Crisis  Fidel Castro and other communist revolutionaries 
overthrew the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista in 15. Castro soon set up 
a dictatorship in Cuba. On August 6, 160, the new government started to 
nationalize foreign-owned industries, which was a common communist 
strategy. Cuba nationalized businesses and properties of the national telephone 
and electricity companies Texaco, Esso, and Sinclair oil companies and 6 
sugar mills owned by U.S. firms. As a result of these economic losses for its 
citizens, the United States broke off trade with Cuba and cut diplomatic ties. 
Castro in turn accepted Soviet aid and aligned Cuba’s foreign policy with that 
of the Soviet Union. 
In 161, newly elected U.S. President John F. Kennedy  had grave 
concerns about the presence of a communist country located only 0 miles 
from the coast of Florida. Before .ennedy took office, a group of Cuban exiles 
who opposed Castro had asked for U.S. government backing to invade Cuba 
and overthrow Castro. .ennedy gave his support. The resulting Bay of Pigs  
invasion was a total failure. Even worse for the United States, it cemented the 
Cuba-Soviet alliance.
The Cuban Missile Crisis  In response to the Bay of Pigs, the Soviets 
began to support Cuba with arms and military advisors. Soviet Premier Nikita 
Khrushchev , who came to power after Stalin, saw an opportunity in Cuba. 
In 162 he shipped nuclear missiles to Cuba. .hrushchev felt justified in his 
actions because in the summer of 161 the United States had placed nuclear 
missiles in Turkey, a U.S. ally that shared a border with the Soviet Union. 
566 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn October 162, U.S. intelligence learned that more missiles were on their 
way to Cuba. .ennedy ordered the U.S. Navy to prevent the missiles from 
reaching Cuba. He called his action a “quarantine” because a blockade was 
technically an act of war. Regardless of the term, the two superpowers were on 
a collision course that threatened nuclear war. 
Ultimately, the two leaders pulled back from the brink. .hrushchev 
called back the Soviet ships and removed the missiles that had been delivered 
to Cuba. In return, the United States pledged to quietly remove its missiles 
from Turkey. After this incident, leaders of both countries realized that better 
communication between their countries was needed. In 16, the two countries 
set up a Hot Line , a direct telegraphteleprinter link between the U.S. and 
Soviet leaders’ offices.
Test-Ban Treaty  People worldwide worried about deaths and 
environmental harm from nuclear war or nuclear testing. In 16, the Soviet 
Union, the United States, and more than 100 other states signed the Nuclear 
Test-Ban Treaty . France and China did not sign it. This agreement outlawed 
testing nuclear weapons above ground, underwater, and in space. The goal was 
to cut down the amount of radiation that people would be exposed to as a result 
of weapons testing. Underground testing remained legal. In 168, the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty called on nuclear powers to prevent the spread of 
military nuclear technology and materials to non-nuclear countries.
Angola  The Portuguese colony of Angola in southwest Africa won its 
independence in 15, after 1 years of armed struggle. Like the 9ietnamese, 
the Angolans had to fight a war to end their colonial status. 
However, Angola faced greater ethnic conflict than did 9ietnam. The 
borders of Angola, like those of many newly independent African countries, 
had been set by European colonial powers with little regard for traditional Source:  CIA 162

567 EFFECT S OF T HE COLD WARregions. Rival ethnic groups were thrown together under one government. 
Angola was more a multiethnic empire consisting of three distinct cultural 
groups than a nation-state in which everyone shared a common culture. Each 
group had fought for independence. Each wanted to control the country’s 
lucrative diamond mines. And each was supported by other countries:
• The USSR and Cuba backed the Mbundu tribe.
• South Africa backed the Ovimbundu tribe.
• The United States backed the Bankongo tribe.
Upon independence, civil war broke out. In 2002, after 2 years of fighting, 
the rivals agreed on a cease-fire. However, threats of violence from militant 
separatist groups remained.
Contra War  In Nicaragua in 1, the -year dictatorship by the Somoza 
family was ended by the rebel Sandinistas, who called themselves socialists. 
Two years later, conservative opponents of the Sandinistas, known as Contras, 
tried to overthrow them. From 181 to 188, the Contra War gripped the 
country. Wanting to isolate the Sandinistas, the United States heavily backed 
the Contras with covert support. The Contra War took the lives of tens of 
thousands of Nicaraguans. The war ended after the signing of the Tela Accord 
in 18 and the demobilization of the Contra and Sandinista armies. 
Antinuclear Weapon Movement  
The nuclear arms race spawned a reaction known as the antinuclear weapons 
movement . One of the first such movements developed in Japan in 15 in 
opposition to U.S. testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific Ocean. In 155, 
more than one-third of Japan’s population signed a petition against nuclear 
weapons. In the late 10s and early 180s, the antinuclear weapons movement 
expanded to other countries, particularly to the United States and Western 
Europe. On June 6, 182, some one million people demonstrated in New York 
City against the creation, buildup, and possible use of nuclear weapons.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“The epitaph for the disastrous April 1±1, 161, attempt to overthrow 
communist dictator Fidel Castro by invading Cuba with 1,500 amateur 
soldiers and a handful of piston-engined B-26 ground-attack bombers was 
spoken soon afterward by President John F. .ennedy. µHow could I have 
been so stupid"’ he asked an aide.
A better question might have been, How could the Central Intelligence Agency 
have bungled things so badly" The answer is that the CIA²which planned the 
operation, trained its participants and helped execute its amphibious landings 
and air strikes²performed more amateurishly than the Cuban invaders. But 
the agency’s senior leaders were so enamored of the plan they ignored its 
obvious flaws. Worse, two presidential administrations, numerous legislators, 
and plenty of smart generals and admirals also signed off on the scheme.
Rebel troops and tanks began landing early on April 1. By the evening of 
April 1 the invasion brigade had been crushed by Castro’s armor, heavy

Spread of Communism  
after 1900
The road after the revolution will be longer, the work greater and more arduous. 
—4ao Aedong, 1949 
Essential Question:   How did communism  and land reform affect China and 
other countries?  
The Cold War provided the context in which many countries wrestled with 
the legacies of their past. The combined heritage of feudalism, capitalism, 
and colonialism often resulted in societies with a small class of powerful 
landowners and a large class of peasants who owned little or no land. When 
socialists or communists sought to make more people into landowners, they 
got caught up in the U.S.-Soviet ideological battle. Land reform  was a vital 
issue in China, Iran, 9ietnam, Ethiopia, India, and a number of Latin American 
countries, including Mexico, Bolivia, and 9enezuela. 
Communism in China
In China, the Communists and the Nationalists began fighting for control of 
the country in 12. However, after the Japanese invaded, the two sides agreed 
to focus on fighting them instead of each other. See Topic .5. 
Victory by the Communists  After the defeat of the Japanese in 15, 
the Chinese Civil War resumed. The Communists, led by Mao Zedong , won 
popular support because they redistributed land to peasants, opened schools 
and hospitals, and punished soldiers who mistreated civilians. Peasants saw 
the Communists as more nationalist and less corrupt than the Nationalists. 
In 1, the Communists defeated the Nationalists and set up the People’s 
Republic of China. Mao ordered the nationalization of Chinese industries 
and created five-year plans based on the Soviet model. Like the Soviets, the 
Chinese plans emphasized heavy industry instead of consumer goods. 
Great Leap Forward  In 158, China went through more land reform 
as part of the policy called the Great Leap Forward . Peasant lands were 
organized into communes , large agricultural communities where the state held 
the land, not private owners. Those who protested this policy could be sent to 
“reeducation camps” or killed.
572 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONEven though failing harvests caused severe food shortages, China 
continued to export grain to Africa and Cuba. Mao sought to convince the 
outside world of the success of his economic plans. Some 20 million Chinese 
died from starvation. By 160, the Great Leap Forward was abandoned.
Source:  Wikimedia Commons.
During the Great Leap Forward, 
China set up small-scale backyard 
steel furnaces. However, they 
produced steel of very poor quality, 
and the effort was dropped.
Cultural Revolution  In 166, Mao attempted to reinvigorate China’s 
commitment to communism, an effort called the Cultural Revolution . In 
practice, the Cultural Revolution silenced critics of Mao and solidified his hold 
on power. Its impact on China was similar to the impact of Stalin’s purges 
in the Soviet Union. Mao ordered the Red Guards , groups of revolutionary 
students, to seize government officials, teachers, and others and send them 
to the countryside for reeducation. Reeducation involved performing hard 
physical labor and attending group meetings where Red Guards pressured 
them to admit they had not been revolutionary enough.
Relations with the Soviets  Although China and the Soviet Union were 
both communist states, they were often hostile to each other. From 161 
onward, the two countries skirmished over their border. They also competed 
for influence around the world. For example, Albania, a Soviet satellite, took 
advantage of the split by allying with China against the Soviet Union, thereby 
receiving more autonomy and additional financial aid from China.
Turmoil in Iran
The modern country of Iran  fell under foreign domination in the late 1th 
century. Britain and Russia fought to control the area. The competition grew 
even keener when oil was discovered in Iran in the early 20th century .
)oreiJn ,nfluence  Early in World War II, the leader of Iran considered 
supporting Hitler’s Nazi regime. Determined not to let that happen, Russia and 
Britain invaded Iran. They forced the leader to abdicate power to his young 
573 SPREAD OF CO MMU NISM AFTER 1900 573son, Shah Muhammad  Reza Pahlavi . They kept their forces in Iran until the 
end of the war.
Iranian nationalists objected to the new shah as a puppet of Western powers. 
In 151, they forced him to flee the country. Two years later, Iran selected 
Mohammad Mosaddegh  as prime minister. He vowed to nationalize the oil 
companies. The United States and Great Britain engineered an overthrow of 
the democratically chosen Mosaddegh and returned the shah to power. The 
shah ran an authoritarian regime that relied on a ruthless secret police force.
Land Reform in the White Revolution  Despite his harsh rule, the 
shah instituted several progressive reforms, known as the White Revolution 
because they came without bloodshed. They included recognizing women’s 
right to vote, creating a social welfare system, and funding literacy programs 
in villages.
The most important reform dealt with land ownership. The shah wanted 
to undercut the power of traditional landowners and increase his popularity 
among peasants. Under his plan, the government bought land from landlords 
and resold it at a lower price to peasants. The program helped many peasants 
become first-time landowners, but it failed to reach a majority of peasants. 
Many Iranians²both landowners who had been forced to sell their land 
and frustrated peasants who received nothing²opposed the land reforms. 
Religious conservatives opposed modernizing the country, particularly 
changing the relationship between men and women. Advocates for greater 
democracy opposed the shah’s harsh rule. 
The Iranian Revolution  In 1, a revolution toppled the shah. Many 
Iranians supported the revolution because they vividly remembered the 
overthrow of the Mosaddegh government in 15. The leaders to emerge from 
the revolution, though, were ones who rejected the shah’s secular worldview 
for one that viewed Islam as a key part of the individual-state relationship. The 
new government was a  theocracy , a form of government in which religion 
is the supreme authority. The new government was headed by a cleric and 
a Guardian Council, a body of civil and religious legal experts who were 
responsible for interpreting the constitution and making sure all laws complied 
with shariah Islamic law. The clergy had the right to approve or disapprove 
anyone who ran for office. Iran opposed Western policies in the Middle East 
and the state of Israel. 
Land Reform in Latin America
Throughout Latin America, leaders saw the concentration of land ownership as 
a barrier to progress. Hence, as countries freed themselves from colonialism, 
they considered land reform. Mexico’s effort dates back to the 10s, but much 
of the land reform in Latin America took place in the 160s or later. 
Venezuela  In 9enezuela, for example, the government redistributed 
some five million acres of land. Some of the land was state-owned and not 
previously under cultivation, while other pieces of land were seized from large 
574 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONlandowners. The land reform, begun with a 2001 law, was not popular with the 
landowners who claimed that the state seized their property while it was under 
cultivation. Additional problems arose from illegal squatters who moved in to 
settle on lands that were not scheduled for land reform. Land reform efforts had 
political repercussions as well those who benefitted were more willing to vote 
for the government instituting the reforms, while those from whom land was 
confiscated tended not to support the states that seized it. Land reform in Latin 
America varied in its details in each country, shaped partly by environmental 
factors, partly by a legacy from colonialism, and partly by the ideology of the 
rulers instituting the reforms. 
Guatemala  A democratically elected government under Jacob Arbenz 
in the Central American country of Guatemala began efforts at land reform. 
Feeling threatened, the United Fruit Company lobbied the U.S. government to 
remove the Arbenz. In 15, he was overthrown. 
Source:  Diego Rivera, Glorious Victory,  15. Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow, Russia. Wikimedia Commons
The U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles called the overthrow of Guatemala’ s government a 
“glorious victory for democracy.” Diego Rivera used this phrase ironically for the title of his mural 
condemning the action. Rivera portrayed Dulles holding a bomb that featured the face of U.S. President 
Dwight Eisenhower.
Land Reform in Asia and Africa
Vietnam  During World War II, Japan occupied 9ietnam, which France 
still claimed as a colony. At the end of the war in 15, 9ietnam declared 
independence from Japanese and French control. 9ietnam was an agricultural 
society. A few people controlled most of the land. Communists vowed to seize 
land from the large landowners and redistribute it among the peasants. This 
pledge won them great support among peasants. When Communists took 
power in the north, they carried out their policies²sometimes violently. In 
South 9ietnam, the government was slow to implement land reform, which 
was one reason it remained unpopular.
575 SPREAD OF CO MMU NISM AFTER 1900 Ethiopia  Other than a short period from 16 to 11 when it was 
under Italian occupation, Ethiopia had remained an independent country, but 
it suffered problems similar to those of many colonies. During World War 
II, exiled Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie  returned to power. He aligned the 
country with the western powers after the war, and Ethiopia enjoyed economic 
success based largely on its coffee trade. This led to western-style political and 
cultural reforms. Selassie was unable to effectively implement land reforms 
in Ethiopia. By the 160s, the country was souring on his leadership. Many 
people saw him as a pawn of U.S. imperialism. 
In 1, a group of military and civilian leaders deposed Selassie. One 
of the primary figures was Mengistu Haile Mariam , an Ethiopian native 
and major in the military. He ordered the assassination of 60 former regime 
officials. The new government declared itself socialist and received aid and 
weapons from the Soviet Union and other communist countries. Famine, failed 
economic policies, and rebellion marred Mengistu’s leadership. By 11, he 
had resigned and fled to =imbabwe.
India  Southern Asia had been under British rule since 1858. That changed 
in 1. Mahatma Gandhi had led the independence movement against England 
since the 120s, but it wasn’t until after World War II that India became 
independent. India was partitioned in 1, creating two countries: Pakistan 
and India. Pakistan was overwhelmingly Muslim, and India was largely Hindu. 
Both countries struggled to establish their new relationship and economies. 
India undertook economic reforms. It instituted land reforms and tried to 
redistribute some land to the landless, abolish the overwhelming power of rent 
collectors, protect land renters, and promote cooperative farming. The results 
were mixed. However, in .erala, a series of policies had some success: 
• 160: The state passed land reform, but they were overturned by courts.
• 16: Tenant won the right to purchase land from landowners.
• 16: New laws allow tenants to become full owners of land.
• 1: Laws provide for fixed hours of work and minimum wages.
Despite the popularity of the land reform program, the Indian central government 
took direct rule of .erala in order to slow down or reverse the program.

Decolonization after 1900
From its inception, South Vietnam was only considered to  
be an outpost in the war against communism. 
—Nguyen  Cao 2y (1930–2011)
Essential Question:  How did people pursue independence after 1900?
In the 20th century, nationalist groups and leaders challenged colonial rule 
not only through land reform but also through political negotiation, as in India,  
and armed struggle, as in Angola See Topic 8.. Struggles for independence 
after World War I and the failure of many independence movements added 
to anticolonial sentiments during World War  II. Empires became politically 
unacceptable. European powers struggled to hold onto their colonies. Notions 
of freedom born of World War II rhetoric helped speed up decolonization. 
That process coincided with the Cold War and the development of the United 
Nations. Nguyen Cao .y, a South 9ietnamese military and political leader, 
noted above that his country’s war was part of the Cold War.
Movements for Autonomy: India and Pakistan
The drive for Indian self-rule began in the 1th century with the foundation of 
the Indian National Congress. Its leader in 120 was Mohandas Gandhi. Hindu 
and Muslim groups, united by their desire to get rid of the British, supported 
the independence movement in South Asia. The National Congress’s tactics 
included mass civil disobedience, and it remained a powerful governmental 
force after Indian independence. The Muslim League , founded in 106, 
advocated a separate nation for Indian Muslims.
Not all Indian leaders agreed with Gandhi’s nonviolent, noncooperation 
movement or his call for unity between Muslims and Hindus. However, 
they put aside their differences until after World War II. Then leaders again 
demanded independence. 
After the war, Britain grew weaker as India’s fighting abilities grew 
stronger. When Britain failed to follow through on promises for more rights 
for Indians, Indian people increased their protests for full independence from 
British rule. The Royal Indian Navy Revolt in 16 was instrumental in 
bringing Britain to the realization it could no longer rule India. As a result of 
580 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONeconomic pressures from India and from its own sluggish postwar recovery, 
Britain was ready to negotiate independence in South Asia. 
'iYision anG Conflict  Muslims feared living in an independent India 
dominated by Hindus. Distrust between Muslims and Hindus dated back 
centuries to the 8th century, when Muslims invaded Hindu kingdoms in 
northern India. Muslims campaigned for an independent Muslim country²
Pakistan. India and Pakistan both gained independence in 1 . 
Decolonization in Ghana and Algeria
Britain agreed to negotiate independence for its West African colony of the Gold 
Coast, just as it had for its colonies in South Asia. The Gold Coast combined 
with the former British Togoland to form Ghana, the first sub-Saharan African 
country to gain independence in the 20th century. The new country of Ghana 
was smaller in area than the historic kingdom of the same name. Negotiations 
led by the United Nations helped bring about Ghana’s independence in 15. 
Its first president, Kwame Nkrumah , took office in 160. 
Ideas from modern nation-states influenced Ghanaian nationalism. 
Nkrumah emulated nationalistic traditions he learned during his time in the 
United States and Britain. For example, Nkrumah constructed a national 
narrative that centered on having a historical past of glory and rich tradition, 
founding fathers, a currency, a flag, an anthem, museums, and monuments. He 
was responsible for numerous public works and development projects, such

581 DECOLONIZATION AFTER 1900 581as hydroelectric plants. However, some critics accused him of running the 
country into debt and allowing widespread corruption²an economic pattern 
that often happened in later African dictatorships. In 16, Nkrumah claimed 
dictatorial powers when the voters agreed to a one-party state , with him as 
party leader.
Nkrumah strongly advocated Pan-Africanism, a term with multiple 
meanings. In the 1th century, American and British abolitionists called their 
plans to return freed men and women to their homes in Africa Pan-Africanism 
or Africa for Africans. The country of Liberia was founded on this vision. In 
the second half of the 20th century, for some Africans, the term Pan-Africanism 
meant a celebration of unity of culture and ideas throughout the continent. 
These Pan-Africanists rejected intervention by former colonial powers. 
In keeping with his vision of Pan-Africanism, Nkrumah founded the 
Organization of African Unity (OAU)  in 16. However, three years later, a 
military coup overthrew Nkrumah’s government and expelled many foreigners 
from the country. Not until 2000 would Ghana witness a peaceful transfer of 
civilian power from one elected president to another.
Algeria  In northern Africa, the French colony of Algeria endured far 
more violence than Ghana before becoming independent. Mounting social, 
political, and economic crises in Algeria resulted in political protests. The 
French government responded with restrictive laws and violence.
Many Algerians, driven by feelings of nationalism, campaigned for 
independence after World War II. The Algerian War for Independence  began 
in 15, and it involved many groups. Because so many French people lived 
in Algeria as settlers, the French government considered Algeria a part of 
France and was adamant that it could not become a separate country. The FLN 
National Liberation Front led the Algerian movement for independence. 
The FLN sought self-determination through guerrilla techniques against half 
a million French forces sent to Algeria. While French military casualties were 
relatively low, hundreds of thousands of Algerians died in the war, often in 
violent street-by-street battles. French historian Pierre 9idal-Naquet confessed 
that there were “hundreds of thousands of instances of torture” by the French 
military in Algeria. 
The Algerian conflict caused sharp divisions in France. The French 
Communist Party, powerful at the time, favored Algerian independence. 
9iolence broke out in cities throughout France. In 158, French President 
Charles de Gaulle  had a new mandate for expanded presidential power under 
the constitution of the new Fifth Republic. De Gaulle planned the steps through 
which Algeria would gain independence. He then went straight to the people 
of France and Algeria to gain approval of his plan in a referendum, thereby 
bypassing the French National Assembly. 
However, with the coming of independence in 162, war broke out again 
in Algeria. Thousands of pro-French Algerians and settlers fled the country. 
The influx of these refugees into France created housing and employment 
582 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONproblems as well as increased anti-immigration sentiment. 9iolence in Algeria 
left between 50,000 and 150,000 dead at the hands of FLN and lynch mobs. 
The first president of the new Algerian Republic was overthrown in 
165 in a military coup led by his former ally. The National Liberation Front 
continued in power under different leadership, making Algeria a single-party 
state for a number of years. The FLN maintained a socialist authoritarian 
government that did not tolerate dissent. Meanwhile, the government led a 
drive for modernization of industry and collectivization of agriculture.
Algerian Civil War  In 11, violence again surfaced in Algeria, this time 
in reaction to one-party rule. The Islamic Salvation Front won the first round 
in an election that was then canceled. A bloody Algerian Civil War  followed 
11±2002, during which the FLN continued in control. The army chose 
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in 1. In his second term, he attempted to 
be more inclusive of insurgents, although suicide bombings continued. In 
2011, the military state of emergency, in place since 12, was finally lifted in 
response to protests in the wake of major uprisings in nearby states, including 
Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.
Comparing Ghana and Algeria  Both Ghana and Algeria experienced 
growing pains under military rule. The main struggles were between those 
who favored multiparty states and those who favored single-party socialism. 
Ghana created a new constitution in 12, easing the transfer of power 
between elected governments. One point of national pride was that a Ghanaian 
leader, .ofi Annan, became UN Secretary General in 1. In Algeria, by 
contrast, religious tensions grew worse. As in other countries in North Africa 
and the Middle East, a growing right-wing Islamist movement that was willing 
to use violence challenged the power of mainstream Muslims. In 12, an 
Islamist assassinated Algeria’s president. As in Egypt and Turkey, the military 
responded by repressing Islamic fundamentalists. In 1, Algeria banned 
political parties that were based on religion.
Negotiated Independence in French West Africa
As Britain negotiated independence with its African colonies, France did the 
same with its colonies in French West Africa. These included Senegal, the 
Ivory Coast, Niger, Upper 9 olta, and other territories. France had controlled 
them since the late 1800s with small military forces. France used indirect rule, 
which relied on local chiefs, existing governments, and other African leaders 
to maintain stability. 
Over the years, France invested in West Africa, building railroads, 
advancing agricultural development, and benefitting in trade revenue that 
grew substantially. But by the mid-150s, various African political parties 
democratic, socialist, and communist and leaders arose in French West 
Africa. By 15, many of the French West African countries had negotiated 
their independence from France.
583 DECOLONIZATION AFTER 1900Nationalism and Division in Vietnam
World War II interrupted France’s long colonial rule in Indochina, but France 
reoccupied the southern portion of 9ietnam when the war ended. A bloody 
struggle began against the forces of Ho Chi Minh , the communist leader of 
North 9ietnam. He appealed to nationalist feelings to unite the country under 
a single communist government. 
France responded by attempting to reestablish its colonial rule, sparking 
a 9ietnamese war of independence that lasted until 15. The peace treaty 
split the country into North and South 9ietnam, with elections planned for 
156 that would reunite the country. However, many in South 9ietnam, along 
with the United States, opposed the Communists and feared Ho would win the 
election. No election took place. 
War broke out between the communist North and the South. U.S. military 
troops supported the South. South 9ietnamese who supported the Communists, 
known as Viet Cong , fought a guerrilla war against U.S. troops.
As the 9ietnam War worsened, American military involvement and 
casualties grew. In response, the antiwar movement became more vocal. 
President Richard Nixon began to withdraw U.S. troops in 11 the last 
troops left in 15. North 9ietnam quickly gained control of South 9ietnam. 
It is estimated that the 9ietnam War resulted in between one million and 
two million deaths, including about 58,000 Americans. It also destabilized 
Southeast Asia. Communists soon won control of Laos and Cambodia, but the 
spread of communism stopped there. 
Beginning in the 180s, 9ietnam introduced some market-based economic 
reforms. In following years, 9ietnam and the United States reestablished trade 
and diplomatic relations. Connect: Write an outline connecting 9ietnam’s

Struggles and Compromise in Egypt
Having long been under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt became 
a nominally independent kingdom in 122. However, the British retained some 
of the same treaty rights there that they had held under their mandate following 
World War I. A 16 Anglo-Egyptian treaty allowed more Egyptian autonomy. 
Still, it also allowed the British to keep soldiers in Egypt to protect the Suez 
Canal. The British army continued to influence Egyptian internal affairs. 
Nasser  Following World War II, Egypt became one of six founding 
members of the Arab League, which grew to 22 member states. In 152, 
General Gamal Abdel Nasser , along with Muhammad Naguib, overthrew 
the king and established the Republic of Egypt. Naguib became its first 
president Nasser its second. Nasser was a great proponent of Pan-Arabism, a 
movement promoting the cultural and political unity of Arab nations. Similar 
transnational movements would attempt to unite all Africans Pan-Africanism 
and all working people communism.
584 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONNasser’s domestic policies blended Islam and socialism. He instituted 
land reform, transforming private farms into socialist cooperatives that would 
maintain the existing irrigation and drainage systems and share profits from 
crops. He nationalized some industries and businesses, including foreign-
owned banks, taking them over and running them as state enterprises. However, 
Nasser touched off an international crisis when he nationalized the Suez Canal.
The Suez Crisis  Built by Egyptian laborers²thousands of whom died 
while working on the project²with money from French investment between 
185 and 186, the Suez Canal had been under lease to the French for 
 years. To the Egyptians, this lease symbolized colonial exploitation, which 
Nasser pledged to fight. In addition, the British owned interests in the canal, 
which they administered jointly with the French. In 156, Nasser seized the 
canal, and Israel invaded Egypt at the behest of Britain and France. The two 
European countries then occupied the area around the canal, claiming they 
were enforcing a UN cease-fire. However, the United States and the Soviet 
Union opposed British and French actions and used the United Nations to 
broker a resolution to the Suez Crisis .
The removal of foreign troops was followed by an agreement for the canal 
to become an international waterway open to traffic of all nations under the 
sovereignty of Egypt. The UN deployed peacekeepers to the Sinai Peninsula 
in Egypt. Britain, France, and Israel were not happy with the interference 
of the United States in the Suez Crisis, but U.S. efforts led to a peaceful 
compromise. The incident also was an example of a nation maintaining a non-
aligned position between the United States and the Soviet Union²the two 
superpowers in the Cold War. 
Independence and Civil War in Nigeria
The western African country of Nigeria, the most populous state on the 
continent, gained independence from Britain in 160. The Biafran Civil War  
began in 16 when the Igbos, a Westernized, predominantly Christian tribe 
in the southeastern oil-rich Niger River Delta area, tried to secede from the 
northern -dominated government. The Igbos sought autonomy because of 
targeted attacks against them by the Hausa-Fulani Islamic group in the north. 
They declared themselves an independent nation called Biafra. 
The Igbos’ secession movement failed, and Biafra ceased to exist when the 
war ended, in 10. Nigeria granted amnesty to a majority of Igbo generals, 
but civilian government did not return. A series of military coups with generals 
in command of the government continued until the 1 election of Olusegun 
Obasanjo, who presided over a democratic civilian government called the 
Fourth Republic of Nigeria.
In an effort to prevent tribalism from destroying the country, the 
government established a federation of 6 states with borders that cut across 
ethnic and religious lines. However, friction continued between Christian 
Yoruba, Igbo groups in the south, and Islamic groups in the northern states. 
585 DECOLONIZATION AFTER 1900The constitution of Nigeria permitted states to vote for a dual legal system of 
secular law and shariah. Eleven states voted for this option. In an additional 
effort to discourage ethnic strife, the constitution encouraged intermarriage 
among the ethnic groups.
Problems remained in the Niger River Delta, which had rich oil deposits. 
Citizens complained that the national government exploited oil resources 
without returning wealth to the region. Also, they contended that the oil 
companies had polluted their lands and rivers. Militants set fire to oil wells and 
pipelines in protest.
Canada and the “Silent Revolution” in Quebec 
Quebec is the largest of Canada’s provinces, and its history is deeply rooted in 
French culture. France’s North American colonial territory in the early 100s 
spanned from Quebec to the Gulf of Mexico. By the late 100s, England 
controlled what was called New France, beginning a cultural and political 
divide in Quebec. People in New France were mainly Catholic, while the 
English-speaking parts of Britain’s Canadian colony were mainly Protestant.
The Quebecois historically aligned themselves with France rather than 
England. Over the centuries, efforts to create a separate independent state have 
flared up²sometimes with violent results. The Quiet Revolution  of the 160s 
involved much political and social change in Quebec, with the Liberal Party 
gaining power and reforming economic policies that led to further desires 
for separation from the rest of British-controlled Canada. French Canadian 
nationalism expanded, and splinter groups adopted extreme tactics, including 
terrorist bombings that began in 16. Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, 
a native of Quebec, was able to preserve the country’s unity. Later, in 15, a 
referendum to make Quebec an independent nation failed by a narrow margin.

NEWLY INDE PENDENT STATE S589

Newly Independent States
0ndia is free but she has not achie]ed unity, only a fissured and broken freedom 
—Sri Aurobindo  (1872–1950)
Essential Question:  What political changes led to territorial,  demographic,  
and nationalist developments and the economic shifts that resulted?
As imperialistic powers handed over governmental control to their former 
colonies, they often created new states. Between 15 and 2000, the number of 
independent states in the world more than doubled, from approximately 5 to 
around 10. The boundaries of the new states often led to conflicts, population 
displacement, and resettlement. In India, as lamented by Sri Aurobindo, an 
Indian nationalist and philosopher, the country was partitioned into Hindu India 
and Muslim Pakistan. Later, Pakistan divided again, creating Bangladesh. In 
the Middle East, the newly created Israel displaced Palestinian residents. 
Newly independent countries often instituted strong policies to promote 
economic development. At the same time, migrants from the newly 
independent countries kept alive cultural and economic ties as they migrated 
to the colonizing countries, usually to the large cities.
Israel’s Founding and Its  
Relationships with  Neighbors
The Zionist movement originated in the 180s from reaction to the Dreyfus 
Affair. See Topic 5.1. Theodore Herzl, a Hungarian Jewish intellectual and 
journalist, used the affair as evidence that assimilation of Jews into European 
society was failing to provide safety and equal opportunity. At the First =ionist 
Congress in 18, he urged the creation of a separate Jewish state. 
Birth of Israel  =ionists hoped that the new state could be established in 
Palestine because that was where their ancestors had lived. In modern times, 
Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, and most of its inhabitants were 
Arabs who practiced Islam. In a new state, =ionists argued, Jews could be free 
of persecution. In 11, during World War I, the British government issued 
the Balfour Declaration, which favored the establishment in Palestine of a 
“national home” for the Jewish people. However, British Foreign Secretary 
Arthur James Balfour wrote that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice 
the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.”
590 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe situation was complicated because British officer T. E. Lawrence, 
known as “Lawrence of Arabia,” promised certain Arabs an independent state 
as well. The British Foreign Office hoped that Arabs would rise up against the 
Ottoman Empire, which would make it easier to defeat during World War  I. 
The Balfour Declaration promised civil and religious rights to non-Jews in 
Palestine, but the supporters of the Arabs did not trust the British. 
In 118, after World War I, Britain was given a mandate over former 
Ottoman lands in the Middle East. Soon =ionists began to immigrate to 
Palestine from Europe and from other Middle Eastern areas. As immigration 
increased, the Arabs in the area protested their loss of land and traditional 
Islamic way of life. 
World War II and the deaths of six million Jews in the Holocaust provided 
another impetus for Jewish immigration. The fate of the European Jews 
brought worldwide sympathy for the survivors. Britain, trying to hold the line 
on Jewish immigration in the face of Arab opposition, turned the matter over 
to the United Nations. As in India, leaders hoped that partition would bring 
peace and stability. In 18, after the UN divided Palestine into Jewish and 
Arab sections, the Jewish section declared itself to be a new country: Israel.
Multiple Wars  War broke out immediately between Israel, which had 
support from the United States, and the Palestinians, who had support from 
neighboring Arab countries. Arab forces from Syria, Jordan then called 
Transjordan, Lebanon, and Iraq invaded Israel. After several cease-fires, the 
Israeli army won, and an armed truce was declared. Immediately after the 
truce, about 00,000 Palestinians became refugees, living in camps near the 
Israeli border. Three other Israeli-Palestinian wars followed:
• In 156, Israel, with support from France and Great Britain, invaded 
Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, in part to liberate the Suez Canal, which the 
Egyptian government had nationalized under Gamal Abdel Nasser’s 
economic programs See Topic 8.5. Following international protests, 
Israel and its allied forces were ordered to withdraw from Egypt. 
• In the Six-Day War  of 16, Israel fought on three fronts at once. 
Israel gained the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank and East 
Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. 
• In the Yom Kippur War of 1, Israel repelled a surprise invasion by 
Egypt and Syria. 
Israeli-Egyptian Peace  After 0 years of conflict between Israel and 
its Arab neighbors, U.S. President Jimmy Carter mediated the Camp David 
Accords , a peace agreement between Prime Minister Menachem Begin of 
Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt. However, the Palestinians and 
several Arab states rejected the 1 peace treaty. The Palestinian Liberation 
Organization (PLO) and its longtime leader Yasser Arafat wanted the return 
of occupied lands and the creation of an independent nation of Palestine. 
591 NEWLY INDE PENDENT STATE S591Ongoing Violence  In the 21st century, the peace process became more 
complicated when the Palestinians split into two factions. The Fatah faction 
controlled the West Bank. The Hamas faction controlled Gaza. Security 
concerns led the Israeli government to implement tighter border controls on 
the West Bank and on Gaza. These controls, amounting to economic sanctions, 
severely restricted normal activity for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians 
and fomented anger. Israel further angered Palestinians by approving new 
settlements on lands it had occupied during previous wars, lands Palestinians 
considered theirs. 
Without a peace process, violence continued. Between 2000 and 201,  
over ,000 Palestinian and over 1,000 Israelis were killed. Many countries in 
the Middle East remained hostile to United States over its support of Israel.  1947UN Plan of Division for Palestine

After World War II, 9ietnam’s neighbor Cambodia pressured France to grant 
it independence in 15. Cambodia’s royal family continued to head the 
government and tried to maintain its status as a non-aligned nation during the 
first two decades of the Cold War. However, Cambodia was eventually drawn 
into the 9ietnam War.
Following the 9ietnam War, a communist guerrilla organization called 
the Khmer Rouge , under the leadership of Pol Pot, overthrew the right-wing 
government of Cambodia. Once in power, Pol Pot and the .hmer Rouge 
imposed a ruthless form of communism, following the Chinese model of 
“cultural revolution” that targeted intellectuals and dissenters. The slaughter 
592 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONand famine that followed took more than two million lives²about one-quarter 
of the country’s population. Mass graves of victims from the “killing fields” 
of Cambodia continued to be discovered in the countryside and jungles for 
decades afterward. Connect: Create a graphic organizer comparing the tactics 
of the .hmer Rouge under Pol Pot with that of Joseph Stalin. See Topic ..
In 1, 9ietnamese troops invaded Cambodia to support opponents of 
Pol Pot and the .hmer Rouge. At the end of the ensuing war, the 9ietnamese 
took control of the government in Cambodia and helped the country to regain 
some stability, even as some fighting continued and hundreds of thousands 
of refugees fled the country. In 18, 9ietnamese forces completed their 
withdrawal from Cambodia. A peace agreement reached in 11 allowed free 
elections, monitored by the United Nations. Prince Norodom Sihanouk became 
a constitutional monarch, and the country developed a democratic government 
with multiple political parties and aspects of a market economy.
India and Pakistan Become Separate Countries
In 1, the British divided colonial India into two independent countries: a 
mostly Hindu India and a mostly Muslim Pakistan. India’s population was 
about 10 times larger than Pakistan’s. In both countries, women had the right 
to vote. 
The partition of the colony was chaotic, and violence broke out along 
religious lines. At least 10 million people moved: Hindus and Sikhs fled their 
homes in Pakistan to resettle in India, and Muslims fled India for Pakistan. In 
the political turmoil, between 500,000 and one million people died.

593 NEWLY INDE PENDENT STATE SAfter partition, Pakistani-India distrust grew. While India became the 
world’s largest democracy, Pakistan had both elected leaders and authoritarian 
military rulers. Moderates in both countries confronted powerful conservative 
religious movements that opposed compromise with the other country . 
.ashPir Conflict  One persistent tension between India and Pakistan 
was over Kashmir , a border region in the mountainous north. At the time of 
partition, most people in .ashmir were Muslims, but its leader was a Hindu. 
Therefore, both Pakistan and India claimed .ashmir. At times the rivalry there 
broke out into armed conflict. The tension between the two countries became 
more significant after each began developing nuclear weapons. Eventually, 
India controlled about 5 percent of the .ashmir region, Pakistan controlled 
about 5 percent, and China controlled about 20 percent. 
Women Gain Power in South Asia
In some newly emerging countries, women became heads of state. Often, they 
replaced their fathers or husbands. In India and Pakistan, women won the right 
to vote in 1.
Sri Lanka  The world’s first female prime minister was Sirimavo 
Bandaranaike . She won that position in 160 in Ceylon later Sri Lanka. Her 
husband was assassinated in office in 15, and Bandaranaike ran for office to 
fill his seat. She continued her husband’s socialist economic policies. But in 
165, with a sagging economy, she was voted out of office. Five years later, 
she returned to power and instituted much more radical policies, including land 
reforms, restrictions on free enterprise, and a new constitution that changed 
the country’s name to Sri Lanka. While some of her reforms succeeded, the 
economy stalled again, and in 1, she was again voted out of office. 
Bandaranaike remained active in Sri Lankan politics. Her children became 
leaders as well. When her daughter Chandrika became the country’s first female 
president in 1, she appointed her mother again to the role of prime minister.  
India  In 166, two years after the death of India’s first prime minister, 
Jawaharlal Nehru, his only child, Indira Gandhi,  became India’s leader. She 
was not related to Mohandas Gandhi. She was underestimated at first but 
proved to be effective, distancing herself in some ways from her father’s old-
guard advisors and making political and economic moves to strengthen India’s 
economy. War with Pakistan took a toll on the economy, though India won the 
conflict with the help of military support from the Soviet Union. 
Indira Gandhi became a revered leader in India, though further economic 
strife would undermine her popularity in the ensuing years. High inflation and 
growing poverty threatened her rule. She declared a national emergency in 15 
and jailed many opposition leaders. Her 20-point economic program proved 
successful, alleviating inflation, reforming corrupt laws, and increasing national 
production. But some of her policies were unpopular with the people of India 
despite the economic gains. In 1, Gandhi lost in the elections. She returned 
to power as prime minister in 180 but was assassinated in 18.
594 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONPakistan  Pakistan elected Benazir Bhutto  prime minister in 188. Her 
father had also served as prime minister. She was the first elected female leader 
of a majority Muslim country. Bhutto struggled to improve Pakistan’s economy 
and reduce its poverty. Corruption charges dogged her and her husband. Bhutto 
won election to two nonconsecutive terms  and then went into exile from 1 
until 200. Shortly after she returned to Pakistan, an assassin killed her .
Tanzania Modernizes
Tanganyika gained its independence from Britain in 161, later becoming the 
United Republic of Tanzania. Its first president, Julius Nyerere , instituted 
African socialist political and economic ideas—summarized in the Arusha 
Declaration of 16. It was an egalitarian approach based on cooperative 
agriculture. Literacy campaigns, free education, and collective farming were 
key components of what Nyerere called ujamaa  Swahili for “familyhood”. 
He also advanced the country’s economic independence away from foreign 
aid. Economic hardships challenged Nyerere’s leadership for years, as did 
conflicts with Uganda and its leader Idi Amin. Though personally popular, 
Nyerere could not pull Tanzania out of poverty. He resigned the presidency in 
185 but remained an important social leader until his death in 1.
Emigration from Newer Countries to Older Ones
People from these newly independent countries sometimes moved to the former 
colonial powers. For example, large numbers of refugees and immigrants from 
Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh moved to London after the chaos of World 
War II and other conflicts. London was a metropole ²a large city of a former 
colonial ruler. Similarly, 9ietnamese, Algerians, and West Africans migrated 
to Paris and other cities in France, and Filipinos migrated to the United States. 
Many migrants found jobs in the medical field. Others worked on railroads, in 
foundries, and in airports. In this way, economic and cultural ties between the 
colonial power and newly independent countries remained strong.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“At the turn of the 160s . . . a state-sponsored agency that recruited workers 
from the French Antilles, and the lack of economic opportunities throughout 
sub-Saharan African nations spurred a large-scale working class labor 
migration to Paris. However, this postwar labor migration occurred in the 
midst of changing mentalité  attitudes. The attributes of colonialism had 
recently been challenged . . . .
However, when Antilleans >people from an archipelago in the Caribbean@ and 
sub-Saharan Africans migrated to France in the 160s, their former colonial 
status still determined their social conditions, especially in the labor and 
housing markets. As the Antillean writer Franooise Ega who lived in France 
during the period observes, µthe French government and society perceive all 
Polish people as agricultural workers, all Algerians as unskilled construction 
workers, and all Antillean women as maids.’ Although race, gender, and 
ethnicity structure the labor landscape, only offering people of African 
descent menial worker, household employee, or lower rank tertiary worker 
positions, Antilleans and sub-Saharan Africans had migrated to France 
with clear-cut professional goals they desired decent wages, congenial and 
respectful treatment, and the possibility of receiving a job promotion related 
to their hard work.”

Global Resistance to Established 
Power Structures
>hat diќerence does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless, 
whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism 
or the holy name of liberty and democracy? 
—4ohandas  .andhi (189–1948)
Essential Question:   What were differing reactions  to e_isting power 
structures after 1900?
The conflicts of the 20th century affected newly independent states and long-
established ones. Some of the most successful challenges to existing order, 
such as the one led by Mohandas Gandhi, used nonviolence. Other movements, 
such as Shining Path in Peru, used violence against civilians to achieve political 
results. Some leaders, such as Francisco Franco in Spain, used the military to 
crush resistance. The military-industrial complex that President Eisenhower 
warned about took hold in other countries, as governments increased arms 
supplies and traded weapons with one another.
Nonviolent Resistance as a Path to Change
Despite the frequent wars and violent protests of the 20th century, movements 
around the world also used nonviolence to bring about political change. Three 
of these movements were particularly large and effective, in part because of 
their visionary leaders.
Mohandas Gandhi  Topic .5 described how Mohandas Gandhi led 
nonviolent marches, boycotts, and fasts to oppose British colonial rule in 
India. In 1, India became independent.
Martin Luther King Jr.   The most prominent of African American 
civil rights leaders in the United States in the 150s and 160s was a Baptist 
minister, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr . The civil rights movement 
used various tactics to achieve its goals:
• Court decisions, such as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 
Kansas , that banned forced racial segregation of schools in the  
United States  
600 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• A year-long boycott of public buses in Montgomery, Alabama  
155±156, which ended segregation in public transit 
• Massive marches, such as the 250,000-person March on Washington 
for Jobs and Freedom in 16 
These efforts provided the foundation for the movement’s biggest 
successes, such as the Civil Rights Act of 165, which is covered in Topic  .5.
Nelson Mandela  In South Africa, the white-minority government codified 
a system of racial segregation, called apartheid, into law in the 20th century. 
Leading the black resistance to apartheid was a socialist lawyer, Nelson 
Mandela  118±201. Though early in his life he sometimes supported 
sabotage and other forms of violence, he was known for leading nonviolent 
protests. The victory over apartheid is described in Topic .5.
Challenges to Soviet Power in Eastern Europe
In the 150s and 160s, reformers in Eastern European satellites of the Soviet 
Union sought to become less dominated by the Soviets. In most cases, the 
Soviets clamped down hard against dissent. 
Poland  In 156, Polish workers demonstrated against Soviet domination 
and demanded better living conditions. As a result, a new secretary of the 
Polish Communist Party, Wladyslaw Gomulka , came to power. He decided to 
pursue an independent domestic policy in Poland but continued to be loyal to 
the Soviet Union, allowing the continued presence of Soviet troops in Poland. 
The Soviet-established forced collectivization of farms ended at this time.
Hungary  In that same year, Hungarian protesters convinced the 
country’s political leader Imre Nagy to declare Hungary’s freedom from 
Soviet control and demand the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country. 
Nagy vowed to support free elections in which non-Communist parties 
would participate. He announced Hungary’s neutrality in the Cold War and 
the withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. Soviet leaders responded by invading 
Hungary, gaining control of Budapest in 156. The Soviets captured Nagy 
and executed him. Many Hungarians fled to the West as refugees.
Czechoslovakia  The reform movement in Czechoslovakia reached a 
peak in the Prague Spring  of 168. Alexander Dubcek , first secretary of the 
Communist Party, acceded to the demands of the Czech people by increasing 
freedom of speech and the press and allowing greater freedom to travel. He 
also agreed to make the political system more democratic.
As with Hungary, Soviet leaders feared the Prague Spring’s independence. 
Soon the armies of four Warsaw Pact nations crushed it. In 168, the Soviet 
Union used the Brezhnev Doctrine , named for then-Soviet leader Leonid 
Brezhnev, to justify its actions. This doctrine stated that the Soviet Union and 
its allies would intervene if an action by one member threatened other socialist 
countries. Connect: Explain the continuity or change between the Eastern 
European resistance movements in the 1th and 20th centuries. See Topic 6..
601 GLOBAL RE SISTANCE TO E STABLISHED POWER STRUCTURES6011968: The Year of Revolt  
Events in Czechoslovakia were just one of many upheavals in 168:
• In Yugoslavia. students marched against authoritarian government. 
• In Poland and Northern Ireland, people protested over religious issues.
• In Brazil, marchers demanded improvements in public education and 
fairer treatment of workers. 
• In Japan, students protested both university financial policies and 
government support for the United States in the war in 9ietnam. 
In many countries, protests took place on university campuses. Tensions 
started building up after World War II, when higher education had opened up 
for more people in Western society and facilities were crowded. As a result, 
discontent was high among the student population by the 160s, resulting 
in a call for university reforms. Student grievances mounted as civil rights, 
women’s rights, workers’ rights, and the war in 9ietnam commanded attention .  
Source:  Wikimedia Commons 
The student movement in Mexico was met by military resistance. Two months before the 
168 Olympics began in Mexico City, armored vehicles entered the city to suppress the social 
movement. 
France  In 168, the student movement reached epic proportions in Paris, 
France. Hundreds of thousands of students took to the streets, resulting in 
violence when police forces moved in. In sympathy, some 10 million French 
workers went on strike. It was the largest general strike in French history. 
President Charles de Gaulle called new elections in France and was able to 
remain in office when his party won. 
602 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe United States  In the United States, students and others demonstrated 
for rights for women and African Americans. However, the largest and most 
heated protests were against the country’s involvement in the war in 9ietnam. 
After members of the Ohio National Guard killed four unarmed students during 
an antiwar demonstration at Kent State University  on May , 10, students 
and faculty at hundreds of U.S. colleges and universities went on strike.
An Age of Terrorism 
In the post-Cold War period, large-scale open conflict between sovereign states 
was rare. Instead, individuals unaffiliated with any government committed 
terrorist acts in Western Europe, South America, the Islamic world, and the 
United States that intimidated and murdered civilians. 
Conflict in 1orthern ,relanG  Most of Ireland, the portion dominated by 
Roman Catholics, gained independence from the United .ingdom in 122. 
However, Northern Ireland, which was dominated by Protestants, remained part 
of the United .ingdom. Northern Ireland Catholics suffered discrimination, 
and many wanted their region to join the rest of the Irish Republic. Northern 
Ireland Protestants fiercely refused. 
The Catholic-Protestant conflict in Northern Ireland became more violent 
in the 160s, with Catholics fighting as part of the Irish Republican Army 
(IRA)  and Protestants with the Ulster Defence Association . Between 16 
and 1, some ,500 people died in the conflict. Some members of the IRA 
took their independence campaign to England by engaging in acts of terrorism, 
the use of violence to achieve political ends. These acts included setting off 
bombs in London and other cities. In 1, the two sides reached a cease-fire. 
Later the IRA renounced violence and turned to politics to achieve its goals.
Separatists in Spain  Another group that used terrorist tactics to 
advance a political agenda was the Basque Homeland and Freedom (ETA) 
organization, founded in 15, which wanted independence for the Basque 
region in northern Spain. ETA actions killed more than 800 people and injured 
many others. In 1, members of ETA killed the hand-picked successor to 
longtime dictator Francisco Franco. See Topic .. Over the years, ETA 
announced several cease-fires. In 2011 it declared an end to violent actions and 
promised to work within the political system to achieve Basque independence. 
Peru’s Shining Path  During the 10s, former philosophy professor 
Abimael Guzmán  built a revolutionary organization called Shining Path  
based on the ideas of Mao =edong and Cambodia’s .hmer Rouge. In 180, 
the Shining Path began decades of bombings and assassinations in Peru in 
order to overthrow the existing government and replace it with a communist 
one. Shining Path’s 20 years of terrorism caused an estimated ,000 deaths. 
Guzmin was arrested and sentenced to life in prison in 12, though the 
Shining Path continued its attacks through the late 10s. In 2011 one of the 
group’s top leaders admitted defeat and began negotiations with the Peruvian 
government. 
603 GLOBAL RE SISTANCE TO E STABLISHED POWER STRUCTURESIslamic Terrorism  Several small groups used a fundamentalist 
interpretation of Islam, one widely condemned by mainstream Muslims, to 
justify terrorism. Among these groups were the Boko Haram in West Africa, 
al-Shabaab in East Africa, the Islamic State of Iraq, the Levant ISIL in the 
Middle East, and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Most victims were Muslims. 
Some high-profile attacks occurred in European cities such as Madrid, London, 
and Paris.
One of the deadliest groups was al-Qaeda . Financed by Saudi billionaire 
Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda carried out attacks in many countries, including 
one in the United States on September 11, 2001. In this attack, terrorists killed 
themselves and more than ,000 people when they hijacked and crashed planes 
in New York City, near Washington, D.C., and in rural Pennsylvania. Most of 
the world, even bitter foes of the United States such as Iran, rallied to support 
the United States. Focused efforts by the United States and its allies severely 
weakened al-Qaeda. Bin Laden was killed in a raid on his home in 201 1.
Terrorism in the United States  While the September 11 attack was the 
deadliest act of terrorism in the United States, it was not the only one. Acts 
of terrorism in the United States come from different sources and groups, 
including domestic groups, some of which are associated with white-nationalist 
or extreme right-wing views. One of the largest of these occurred when two 
anti-government extremists bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City in 
15, killing 168 people. Other attacks targeted Muslims, Jews, and blacks.
Response of Militarized States
States in which military dictators ran the government tended to respond to 
internal conflicts in ways that made the conflicts even worse. Spain under 
Franco and Uganda under Idi Amin are two prominent examples. 
The Franco Dictatorship in Spain  The dictator Francisco Franco 
ruled Spain from 1 to 15. See Topic .. He had come to power by 
overthrowing a popularly elected government that included many leftists. 
Franco’s fervent anti-communism made him an ally of the United States. It also 
led his government to execute, imprison, or send to labor camps hundreds of 
thousands of political dissenters. However, opposition to his authoritarianism 
remained. When Franco died, Spain took the opportunity to move toward 
democracy.
,ntensifieG Conflict in 8JanGa unGer ,Gi $Pin  Few countries in the 
10s suffered as much as Uganda, a small country in eastern Africa ruled 
from 11 to 1 by Idi Amin, a military dictator so brutal he was known as 
the “Butcher of Uganda.” Although he was aligned with Western democracies 
early on, he was later backed by the Soviet Union and East Germany. He 
declared himself president for life and set policies that worsened ethnic 
tensions, denied people basic human rights, and undermined economic 
stability. Amin was unpredictable. He was for a time the chairman of the 
604 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONOrganization of African Unity and even a member of the United Nations 
Commission on Human Rights. But in 12 he forcefully expelled 60,000 
Asians from Uganda, most of whom were of Indian descent, and turned 
over their businesses to his supporters. He is believed to be responsible for 
up to 500,000 deaths among targeted ethnic groups during his reign. When 
he threatened neighboring Tanzania with attack, Ugandan nationalists joined 
forces with Tanzanian troops and forced Amin into exile. 
The Military-Industrial Complex
Conflicts around the world intensified because of fear and economic pressure. 
Countries that felt threatened, including the United States and the Soviet Union, 
built strong militaries to defend themselves. These military forces required 
large factories to build planes, tanks, and other goods. Since many countries 
lacked facilities to make their own weapons, the international weapons trade 
expanded greatly. 
As the defense industries expanded, so did the number of people who 
relied on them for jobs. Cutting back on defense spending, then, became very 
difficult. In 161, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, a highly decorated 
general in World War II, called this combination of government defense 
departments and private businesses supplying their demands the military-
industrial complex. He warned that it could grow powerful enough to threaten 
the country’s democracy.

OF SOURCES
The year 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the year²168²that 
stands out most in the decade of the 160s. At their annual meeting that 
year, members of the American Historical Association considered what 
made that year so remarkable and how historians answer questions like 
that. Dr. Alan Shane Dillingham spoke about using first-hand primary 
sources: “I think the limitations of historical narratives dominated by 
participants tell a kind of romantic story²obstacles overcome, that 
kind of stuff. That’s important, but it can also simplify these moments 
and prevent you from seeing important connections.”

8.8
End of the Cold War
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!
—9onald  9eagan, speech in West Berlin, .ermany,  1une 12, 1987
Essential Question:  What caused the end of the Cold War?
Power structures continued to change in the 180s and 10s. President 
Ronald Reagan’s  appeal to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev  came two 
years before the Berlin Wall fell in 18. Two years after the fall, a coup ousted 
Gorbachev from power. The Soviet Union collapsed and the Cold War was 
over. The U.S.-Soviet Union rivalry that had dominated the world stage for 
nearly five decades ended. Governments in only a few countries, such as China, 
North .orea, Cuba, and 9ietnam, still called themselves communists, Political 
alliances changed, and economic interactions among nations expanded.
The Final Decades of the Cold War Era
Despite the persistent mistrust between the two countries, diplomatic relations 
between the United States and the Soviet Union were maintained²albeit 
inconsistently at times²during the last decades of the conflict. Proxy wars and 
support of opposing sides in international conflicts remained standard for both 
nations. These conflicts reinforced the fundamental disagreement between the 
capitalist United States and the communist Soviet Union. Agreements between 
the superpowers to limit nuclear weapons played a key role in ending the Cold 
War. However, the path to a thaw was not always steady. Connect: Describe 
the similarities in the competition between world powers in the Cold War and 
during the imperial era. See Topics . and .5.
Détente and a Colder War  After resolving the crises of the 160s, which 
included the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis, the relationship between 
the superpowers improved in the following decade. This period of time was 
called détente , a relaxation of strained relations between nations. 
One symbol of dptente was the visit of President Richard Nixon to the 
Soviet Union in 12. Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed the 
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) , designed to freeze the number 
of intercontinental ballistic missiles that each power could keep. To play one 
power against the other, Nixon also visited China that year. It was the first visit 
by an American president in the existence of communist China. 
609 END OF T HE COLD WARDptente served both the U.S. and Soviet needs at the time. The Soviet 
Union faced challenges during the late 160s and the 10s. 
• Economically, the USSR was in a crisis. It was no longer growing. 
Central governmental controls prevented farmers and manufacturers 
from deciding what to grow or make and what to charge for it. Foreign 
trade was extremely limited.
• Eastern European Soviet bloc countries were bucking for reforms and 
freedom from Moscow’s direct control. The Soviet military violently 
put down the Prague Spring, a liberation movement in Czechoslovakia. 
• Russia faced skirmishes with China along their shared border²a 
reflection of the troubled relationship between the two communist 
countries. 
The United States also faced difficulties. President Nixon was mired in 
the 9ietnam War, a costly and unpopular conflict. The American economy 
was suffering as well. The possibility of establishing relations with China 
would, Nixon knew, open potential new markets to the United States and 
at the same time press a bit on the strained Soviet-Chinese relationship. 
Dptente could help the United States maintain its containment policy and 
might ease tensions between the superpowers. 
As a result of dptente, the United States started to sell excess stores of 
American grain to the Soviet Union, where drought had created a shortage. 
This benefitted American farmers, who now had access to a new, large market 
for goods, and the struggling people of the Soviet Union. However, after the 
Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1, U.S. President Jimmy Carter halted the 
grain shipments. This action marked the end of dptente. 
Soviet-Afghan War  The Soviets invaded Afghanistan to prop up that 
country’s communist government against Muslim fighters. Estimates of  
Afghan civilian deaths vary from 562,000 to two million. Millions of Afghans 
fled to Pakistan and Iran, and many within the country became homeless. 
Ultimately, the Soviet army could not conquer the guerrilla groups in the rough  
terrain of Afghanistan. Soviet legitimacy was undermined and new forms of 
political participation in Afghanistan developed. As the Soviet Army withdrew 
in 18, a civil war continued in Afghanistan. While the collapse of the Soviet 
Union would not occur until 12 years after the Afghan War began, the war put 
immense stress on the Soviet Union’s centralized economic system and left 
Soviet leadership vulnerable to reform. 
Reagan and Gorbachev  During the presidency of Ronald Reagan 
181±18, tensions between the Americans and the Soviets increased even 
further. Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as the “evil empire” and sent 
military aid, including weapons, to support the Afghans. The Soviet Union 
resented this overtly militaristic move. 
In addition, by the early 180s, the United States and the Soviet Union 
had more than 12,000 nuclear missiles, each one pointed at the other side. Not 
610 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONonly would the superpowers destroy each other with a nuclear exchange, but 
the rest of the world would also be destroyed²seven times over. 
In light of this growing tension, Reagan declared that the United States 
would create a missile defense program he called the Strategic Defense 
Initiative , or SDI. Dubbed “Star Wars” after the internationally popular 
1 film by critics, the system would supposedly destroy any Soviet nuclear 
missiles that targeted the United States or its allies. Lacking such a system, the 
Soviets would be unable to keep U.S. missiles from hitting targets in the Soviet 
Union. The Soviets saw this move as the beginning of an arms race in space. 
While it was not an immediate threat that required a quick response, it worried 
liberal and moderate Soviets who wanted reforms. They saw it as a long-term 
economic concern and one that strengthened the hand of Soviet conservatives. 
The Soviets objected loudly to Reagan’s plan.
The Thaw  The increase in tensions during the 180s led to other nations 
believing that they must choose sides between the superpowers. Non-aligned 
nations hoped they would not experience a nuclear holocaust that the two 
nations caused. 
In this tense atmosphere, Mikhail Gorbachev, a more progressive Communist 
than previous Soviet leaders, came to power in 185. He favored perestroika , 
attempts to restructure the Soviet economy to allow elements of free enterprise, 
and glasnost , the policy of opening up Soviet society and the political process 
by granting greater freedom. Reagan and Gorbachev met three times in two 
years. The two men liked each other and, despite tough negotiations, created a 
working relationship that ultimately delivered results. 
In 18, the Soviet Union and the United States agreed on a new nuclear 
arms treaty. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces  Treaty (INF)  restricted 
intermediate-range nuclear weapons. Around the world, people could breathe 
a cautious sigh of relief as the world’s two superpowers reduced the risk of 
nuclear war. The INF and other U.S.-Soviet agreements quieted some of the 
more bellicose Cold War supporters in both countries. With less pressure from 
Soviet conservatives, Gorbachev could more easily implement political and 
economic reforms in the Soviet Union.

who looks on sadly at a symbol of 
the Soviet Union, the hammer and 
sickle, broken into pieces.
611 END OF T HE COLD WARThe End of the Soviet Union  
One aspect of Gorbachev’s reform program was an end to economic support for 
the Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe. He also implied that the Soviet Army 
would no longer come to the rescue of communist regimes in Eastern Europe. 
In effect, economic reform in the Soviet Union provided greater freedom to 
other communist countries. Once people in these countries got a small taste of 
freedom, they wanted more. As a result, democratic reform movements swept 
through Eastern European nations in 18. The Berlin Wall was torn down. In 
October 10, East and West Germany reunited as one country.
The Spread of Reforms  With most of the Eastern European nations 
caught up in democratic reforms, it was not long before the Soviet Union was 
also swept into the movement. Lithuania, Georgia, and other Soviet republics 
began to overthrow their rulers and declare independence. The Warsaw Pact 
dissolved. Gorbachev’s reforms ultimately led to his political downfall and 
the end of the Soviet Union in December 11. Among the former Soviet 
republics that became independent countries, Russia emerged as the strongest. 
The Cold War had ended.
New Challenges  The decline of a superpower presented opportunities 
and several challenges. Political alliances changed, and economic interactions 
among nations expanded. With this new openness, particularly with regard 
to trade, the world became more interconnected than ever before. This 
interconnectedness produced greater wealth for some but hardships for others. 
The post-Cold War world had to grapple with new democracies, vast economic 
inequality, ethnic conflict and genocide, terrorism, environmental degradation, 
and global epidemics.

Read the following summary of the beginnings of a process set in 
motion by the introduction of perestroika. Then, in a paragraph, 
explain how the process continued, leading to the breakup of the 
Soviet Union.  
“From modest beginnings at the Twenty-Seventh Party Congress 
in 186, perestroika, Mikhail Gorbachev’s program of economic, 
political, and social restructuring, became the unintended catalyst for 
dismantling what had taken nearly three-quarters of a century to erect: 
the Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist totalitarian state.
The world watched in disbelief but with growing admiration as 
Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan, democratic governments 
overturned Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Germany was 
reunited, the Warsaw Pact withered away, and the Cold War came to 
an abrupt end.
In the Soviet Union itself, however, reactions to the new policies 
were mixed. Reform policies rocked the foundation of entrenched 
traditional power bases in the party, economy, and society but did not 
replace them entirely. Newfound freedoms of assembly, speech, and 
religion, the right to strike, and multicandidate elections undermined 
not only the Soviet Union’s authoritarian structures, but also the 
familiar sense of order and predictability. Long-suppressed, bitter 
inter-ethnic, economic, and social grievances led to clashes, strikes, 
and growing crime rates.
Gorbachev introduced policies designed to begin establishing a 
market economy by encouraging limited private ownership and 
profitability in Soviet industry and agriculture. But the Communist 
control system and over-centralization of power and privilege were 
maintained and new policies produced no economic miracles. Instead, 
lines got longer for scarce goods in the stores, civic unrest mounted, 
and bloody crackdowns claimed lives, particularly in the restive 
nationalist populations of the outlying Caucasus and Baltic states.
. . . Boris Yeltsin, who had become Russia’s first popularly elected 
president in June 11, . . . embarked on even more far-reaching 
reforms as the Soviet Union broke up into its constituent republics 
and formed the Commonwealth of Independent States.”

REFLECT ON THE TOPIC ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. In one to three paragraphs, explain what caused the end of the Cold War.
CAUSATION IN T HE AGE OF T HE  COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION 615
8.9
Causation in the Age of the  
Cold War and Decolonization
Walls in the mind often stand longer than those built of concrete blocks.
—Willy Brandt, December 1991
Essential Question:   Why and to what e_tent were the effects of the Cold 
War similar in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres? 
The end of World War II marked the beginning of a new world order as the 
nations of Western Europe no longer dominated the world stage. The United 
States and the Soviet Union took over as the superpowers. In Western Europe, 
however, countries were free from domination by a superpower and retained 
their political independence and democratic governments. The Marshall Plan 
had helped them rebuild and achieve a level of economic prosperity that was 
unknown among the countries of Eastern Europe. 
However, during this time, Western European colonial empires began 
to crumble as anti-imperialist sentiment fueled independence movements in 
Africa and Asia. Resentment of European and American economic imperialism 
also rose in Latin American countries, leading to revolutionary movements 
that aimed to overturn the political and social status quo in these countries. The 
United States and the Soviet Union regularly supported opposing sides in these 
clashes, projecting their own differences onto regional conflicts. 
The Cold War also influenced economic, social, and cultural aspects of 
global events, providing further evidence that this conflict had far-reaching 
effects that affected the latter half of the 20th century.
Challenges to Existing Social Orders 
The years following World War II were a time of unprecedented conflict as 
people and states challenged the established order. How they carried out their 
challenges, how the existing powers responded, and how the challenges were 
or were not resolved depended in part on the position of the challenging 
people or states in the geopolitical balance of power. 
Toward the end of World War II, a serious ideological and economic 
rift  emerged among the “Big Three” Allied powers²the Soviet Union, the 
United States, and Great Britain. The United States and Great Britain, along 
with France which had recently been liberated from German occupation, 
616 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONoccupied the western half of Germany. The Soviets occupied the eastern half. 
Agreements made at Yalta and Potsdam were supposed to have settled the 
future status of Western and Eastern European countries affected by the war. 
However, after the war officially ended, it became apparent that the Soviet 
Union was not going to relinquish control over the Eastern European territories 
it occupied during the war. The Soviets viewed these states as a buffer against 
future aggression from the West. Even though the countries of Eastern Europe 
were officially independent, the Soviet Union had immense influence over 
their governments and internal affairs. The so-called Soviet bloc was made up 
of East Germany and these satellite nations of the USSR. The United States 
distrusted the motives of the Soviet Union and believed the Soviets were intent 
on bringing about a global communist revolution. 
After China became a communist state in 1 and the United States 
recognized it could not free Eastern Europe from Soviet influence, the United 
States established a policy of containment. The policy used military, economic, 
and political means to stop the spread of communism outside of the areas 
where it was currently practiced. Containment drove the direction of U.S. 
foreign policy throughout the Cold War.
Three Alignments  The Cold War thus caused a division of the world into 
three alignments. The “First World” was the United States and its allies. The 
“Second World” was the Soviet Union, the Soviet bloc countries of Eastern 
Europe, and other communist nations around the world. The third alignment 
was often called the “Third World” but was more accurately described as the 
non-aligned countries that did not have close military or ideological ties with 
any of the First or Second World countries .SOVIET UNION

617 CAUSATION IN T HE AGE OF T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION 617As the map on the previous page shows, the United States was the 
First World superpower situated in the Western Hemisphere. The dominant 
superpower in the Second World, the Soviet Union, was in the Eastern 
Hemisphere. These superpowers represented a geopolitical balance of power. 
Third World countries were mainly those with colonial pasts they were in 
Asia, Africa, and Oceania in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America in the 
Western Hemisphere.
Superpower Rivalries
One result of the superpower rivalry was the division of Europe. The western 
portion had, for the most part, democratic and free-market societies, while 
the eastern portion was autocratic and communist. The dividing line ran 
through Germany, which was divided into the two independent countries of 
West and East Germany. The capital city of Berlin was similarly divided. The 
Iron Curtain, as it was termed, reflected the Western democratic view that 
the Soviet-bloc countries were a threat to the individual freedoms and liberty 
of the people living on both sides of the border. The Soviets believed, based 
on their historical perspective, that the Western democracies were intent on 
invading the Soviet Union. Mistrust on both sides led to a nuclear arms race 
that was an existential threat to Europe and the world. 
The Arms Race  The United States developed an atomic bomb at the end 
of World War II. It used the bomb to end the conflict with Japan by dropping 
two of them²one on the city of Hiroshima and the other on Nagasaki. The 
devastation to the two cities shocked the world. The Soviet Union soon 
developed its own nuclear weapon, and the nuclear arms race was on. The 
number of nuclear weapons and the means to use them increased for both states. 
Relations between the superpowers grew tense, and the fear in Europe, and 
elsewhere, was that any provocation could lead to nuclear annihilation. Both 
the United States and the Soviet Union took defensive actions that resulted in 
Europe becoming what was effectively an armed camp with millions of troops 
and weapons, both conventional and nuclear, facing off against each other. 
During this time, two international military alliances formed. The United 
States and its allies formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO.
The Soviet Union and its allies created the Warsaw Pact. Both groups sought 
to ensure collective security through military cooperation. Part of the “cold” 
factor in the Cold War is that there never was direct, “hot” military conflict 
between the two superpowers. But the brinkmanship and proxy battles that 
characterized this war put most people on Earth on edge whenever the United 
States and the Soviets appeared poised to launch a nuclear atta ck.
Hopes for Greater Self-Government
The high point of empires and colonization was World War I. The British, 
the French, and other Europeans had colonized almost all of Africa, India, 
and Southeast Asia, and they dominated China. The Turkish Ottoman Empire 
618 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONcontrolled the Middle East. But the desire for self-government that had fueled 
colonial rebellions throughout the Americas in the 18th and 1th centuries as 
well as national independence movements in Europe in the 1th century spread 
throughout the world in the 20th century. The two world wars crystallized the 
opposition to the empires. Although most hopes for independence remained 
unfulfilled after World War I, the war did result in the breakup of two large 
multiethnic empires, Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey. 
World War II, however, accelerated the dismantling of global colonial 
empires. Between the end of World War II in 15 and the year 2000, the 
number of independent states more than doubled, going from around 5 to 
around 10. 
As the Cold War established new alignments among both newer and 
established states, it extended far beyond its ideological roots and exerted 
political, economic, social, and cultural influence on nearly all parts of the 
globe.

The Cold War affected the Eastern and Western Hemispheres in similar ways, 
since each was dominated by a superpower and also had former colonies and 
emerging new nations. However, most countries in the Western Hemisphere 
had become independent long before the Cold War. The Eastern Hemisphere 
paid an especially heavy price as a result of the Cold War, since several key 
proxy conflicts were located in Asia and Africa. Nonetheless, rivalries between 
the superpowers played out in both hemispheres. 
Many transitions to independence were largely peaceful and nonviolent 
others involved open armed rebellions. In some cases, these insurgent 
movements were led by communist groups and supported by the Soviet Union, 
such as in 9ietnam and Angola. As a result, the United States would either 
support the colonial power against the communist insurgency or would support 
opposition groups that would establish a non-communist government. Often 
these Western-backed governments proved to be unpopular with the majority 
of the people, which only heightened anti-imperialist feelings.
Political Effects in Asia  The Cold War brought armed conflict and played 
a part in internal revolts and crises in some countries of Asia. The U.S. policy 
of containment led to wars in .orea and 9ietnam. Communist revolutions 
overtook Cambodia and Laos. The Soviets invaded Afghanistan to prop up the 
communist government in that country. Anti-communist crackdowns occurred 
in Indonesia and the Philippines. Communist China had a falling-out with the 
Soviet Union and began to seek better relations with the United States.
Political Effects in Africa  As with Asia, the Cold War brought conflict 
and turmoil to Africa. Communist insurrections supported by the Soviet Union 
were often met by government resistance supported with arms supplied by 
the United States. Communist governments came to power in Ethiopia and 
Angola. In the case of Angola’s war for independence from Portugal, the Soviet 
Union and the United States fought a proxy war. The Soviets supported the use 
619 CAUSATION IN T HE AGE OF T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION of Cuban soldiers and provided arms and military training to help establish a 
communist-style government in the country. The United States provided arms 
and supported anti-communist groups. 
Political Effects in the Western Hemisphere Latin America also 
experienced the results of the Cold War conflict between the superpowers. 
Communist revolutions were successful in Cuba and Nicaragua. Communist 
insurrections, sometimes backed by the Soviet Union or Cuba, occurred in El 
Salvador, Columbia, Peru, and Guatemala. The United States would support 
the government in power²often a dictatorship made up of military officers or 
right-wing politicians²to try to stop the spread of communism. 
&RPSDUinJ(cRnRPic(σecWsRfWKe&RlG:DU
The Cold War divided Europe in economics as well as politics. The Western 
countries, aided by the United States’ Marshall Plan, rebuilt their economies 
after the destruction of World War II with a mixture of free-market principles 
and state-sponsored economic development. The Eastern bloc nations struggled 
in a transition away from communism to free-market economies. Developing 
countries²those in the “Third World”²faced unique challenges.
State Response to Economic Challenges in the West  To promote 
economic security, many Western European governments created public 
health systems, built public housing, provided unemployment insurance, and 
developed state-backed pension plans. The creation of the welfare state, as it 
became known, was to counteract the attraction of the communist system that 
promised to provide many of these benefits. As a result, the Western European 
nations’ economies boomed while the Eastern European economies, under a 
communist system, struggled to recover from the costs and effects of the war.

620 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONState Response to Economic Challenges in the Eastern Bloc  The 
Soviet government quickly transitioned its economy after the war to peacetime 
endeavors. Yet the military-industrial complex was so large in the Soviet Union 
that it employed about 20 percent of the workers, many of whom became 
unemployed during the transition. The Soviet-bloc countries faced a serious 
economic crisis as the government instituted economic reforms to encourage 
free-market practices and move away from a state-controlled economy . 
However, moving from a state-controlled to a free-market economy proved  
to be an extremely complex endeavor. Debates swirled about whether to 
institute reforms gradually or all at once, and party officials resisted the loss 
of their control over the economy. In the end, reformers have succeeded in 
removing state controls over prices, and formerly state-owned businesses have 
been privatized. After a period of decline, the Russian economy is improving. 
China made a more gradual transition to a free-market economy and has 
become a global economic powerhouse. 
State Response to Economic Challenges in Developing Countries  Many 
former colonies still had close economic ties to the countries that had colonized 
them and remained dependent on the extraction and exporting of natural 
resources. The perspective of many people in the former colonies was that the 
industrial countries were using this relationship to exploit and undermine the 
economies of these developing countries. Getting control of their resources 
was a top priority of developing nations. Oil-rich Angola, for example, left in 
disarray after years of civil war, has a government-controlled oil conglomerate 
that accounts for about 0 percent of government revenue and has helped the 
nation rebuild and update infrastructure.
&RPSDUinJ6RciDlDnG&ulWuUDl(σecWs
The tension and turmoil of the Cold War era created social effects for all sides 
involved. For example, the proxy wars cost millions of people their lives, 
especially in Southeast Asia. In the 9ietnam war alone, two million soldiers 
and two million civilians died over 20 years of conflict. Bombs destroyed 
villages, and chemical defoliants killed anything growing on farmlands. 
Families were separated and displaced. Many rural villagers left for the city, 
where they thought they could find safety. Saigon, the capital city, tripled in 
size as refugees from the countryside flooded in. Most of the fighting took 
place in South 9ietnam, so it sustained the most damage, but North 9ietnam 
was also bombed²especially such infrastructure as railroads and highways.
Social Tensions  The Cold War created suspicions as well. Americans 
were afraid of communist infiltration, and some people’s careers were ruined 
when they were unjustly accused of being communists. In the Soviet Union, 
people were afraid to express their beliefs openly if they disagreed with the 
government. They knew they could be sent away to a political prison camp. 
People everywhere lived under the threat of a nuclear attack. Some people built 
bomb shelters where they hoped they could safely weather an atomic attack.
621 CAUSATION IN T HE AGE OF T HE COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION Cultural Effects  With greater personal freedom, and with help from the 
United States, Western Europeans experienced a cultural rebirth after World 
War II. Scientific research, music, art, and architecture flourished. Eastern 
Europe, in contrast, lacked freedom of expression. Because of the Cold War, 
governments actively blocked the spread of Western culture. The people of 
Eastern Europe did not see much in the way of cultural achievements beyond 
those that were government-sponsored or approved.
During the Cold War, many people from former colonies moved to the 
metropole see Topic 8.6, furthering the blending of cultures. At the same 
time, the imperial powers left a legacy of culture in their former colonies, 
including the languages spoken, as the chart below shows.

French 120 million • Senegal
• Democratic Republic of the Congo
Portuguese 14 million • Angola
• Mozambique
Dutch (Afrikaans) 7 million • South Africa
English 7 million • South Africa
Spanish 1 million • Equatorial Guinea
In places where a Cold War superpower had maintained order, such as 
Afghanistan and Yugoslavia, violent culture clashes occurred when the 
superpower retreated. In Yugoslavia, for example, which had been stitched 
together and annexed to Serbia after World War I, ethnic tensions flared as 
Serbia’s ultra-nationalist president, Slobodan Milosevic, pitted one group 
against another to strengthen his own position after the fall of the Soviet Union 
left a power vacuum. Wars in the region took tens of thousands of lives and 
created hundreds of thousands of refugees. Connect: Analyze the changing 
goals for both superpowers during the Cold War. See Topics 8.1, 8., and 8.8. 
Development of Global Institutions
The end of the Cold War and the growth of globalization has reset the 
geopolitical framework. The idea of a balance of power has yielded to a more 
cooperative approach as countries recognize global interdependence. To further 
cooperation, global organizations such as the United Nations and the World 
Trade Association have been established. Others address such transnational 
issues as environmental degradation and global warming, human rights, and 
epidemic diseases.

UNIT 8 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WHY ARE SOME COUNTRIE S WEALT HY?
In 16, Adam Smith published the first modern, in-depth look at why 
some countries are wealthier than others, The Wealth of Nations . Smith 
recognized a need for government, but emphasized the benefits of trade.
Modernization  After World War II, Western Europe and the 
United States grew wealthier rapidly. Scholars in these regions, such 
as American political scientist David Apter, developed modernization 
theory.  The problems of poor, newly emerging countries were seen as 
the natural by-products of the transition from a traditional, agrarian 
society to a modern, developed society. Developed countries could 
provide economic and technological assistance to help in this transition.
Self-Reliance  In the 10s, a new generation of scholars saw 
developed countries as the problem, not the solution. They rejected 
modernization theory, arguing that it placed the blame for poverty 
on poor countries, not on the former colonial powers. According to 
dependency theory , former colonies were victims of the international 
marketplace. In this theory, the way out of poverty was self-reliance. 
Globalization  Recent writers, such as journalist Thomas 
Friedman, focused not on self-reliance but on globalization.  Friedman 
saw the increasing interconnectedness of economies around the world 
as an opportunity for countries to prosper. His “flat world” referred to 
relatively inexpensive technologies that allowed developing nations to 
compete with developed ones for jobs and the creation of innovative 
products. In response, Canadian journalist Linda McQuaig attacked 
Friedman as an “apologist of globalization.” Friedman’s critics charged 
that he looked at the benefits of increased trade and investments without 
seeing the costs incurred in poor countries through these actions.
Trade  Ha-Joon Chang, a British economist who was born and raised 
in South .orea, took a historical view. In Kicking Away the Ladder: 
Development Strategies in Historical Perspective  2002, he evaluated 
the path to prosperity for today’s wealthy countries in Western Europe 
and the United States. All once had high tariffs and other trade barriers 
to protect their growing industries from foreign competition. Only after 
they became wealthy did they advocate for free trade. However, today 
wealthy countries press poor ones to open their borders economically. 
The lesson of history, he argued, was to let poor countries use the same 
protectionist methods that led to prosperity for other countrie s.

evidence supports one of the perspectives on nations’ wealth after 100.
624 WORLD  HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION
WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  WRITE  THE CONCL USION
A strong conclusion helps create unity by circling back to the ideas in 
your introduction and thesis statement. The conclusion is also a good 
opportunity to extend and refine the complex understanding you have 
developed and woven throughout your essay.
Providing Unity  While wrapping up your essay with a return to the 
ideas in your introduction helps provide unity, simply restating your thesis 
is not a strong way to end the essay. Suppose your thesis is that the main 
causes of the end of the Cold War were the decline in communist ideology 
and the weakness of the Soviet economy. Avoid simply restating it “Thus 
we can see that the decline of communist ideology and the weakness of 
the Soviet economy were the main causes of the end of the Cold War”. 
Instead, you might say, “Although many factors led to the end of the Cold 
War, including Gorbachev’s efforts at reform and the development of 
communication technologies that allowed for the rapid spread of liberal 
ideas, most served to feed the two main causes²declining support for 
communism and a faltering Soviet economy.” This change extends the 
thesis statement rather than simply repeating it.
Demonstrating Complexity  An extension of your thesis statement 
such as the one above also helps demonstrate a complex understanding of 
the topic by referring to multiple causes. The College Board identifies the 
following ways to demonstrate a complex understanding: “Corroborate, 
qualify, or modify an argument using diverse and alternative evidence 
in order to develop a complex argument.” You might, for example, 
analyze multiple variables to arrive at a nuanced conclusion: “Economic, 
ideological, political, social, and religious factors all played a role in the 
fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.” You might make 
a connection within or across regions: “A democracy movement was 
building in China as well, but China used military force to put it down, 
while Gorbachev decided not to use military force.”
Other ways you can demonstrate a complex understanding are to 
consider the significance of a source’s credibility and limitations and 
explain why a historical argument is or is not effective. Most of the 
development of your complex understanding must be done within the 
body of your essay for you to earn the point for complexity, but you can 
use the conclusion to summarize or extend that understanding. 
Application:  Review the sample scored essays on the College 
Board website. Evaluate the conclusion of each sample. For any that 
lack a conclusion, draft one that would provide unity to the essay and 
summarize a complex understanding of the historical development that 
is the focus of the prompt.

Perhaps now more than at any other moment in the history of the world, 
society, government, and statesmanship need to be based upon the highest 
code of morality and ethics. And in political terms, what is the highest code 
of morality" It is the subordination >placing in a lower rank@ of everything 
to the well-being of mankind. But today we are faced with a situation 
where the well-being of mankind is not always the primary consideration. 
Many who are in places of high power think, rather, of controlling the 
world. Yes, we are living in a world of fear. The life of man today is 
corroded >destroyed or weakened gradually@ and made bitter by fear. Fear 
of the future, fear of the hydrogen bomb, fear of ideologies. Perhaps this 
fear is a greater danger than the danger itself, because it is fear which 
drives men to act foolishly, to act thoughtlessly, to act dangerously . . . 
All of us, I am certain, are united by more important things than those 
which superficially divide us. We are united, for instance, by a common 
detestation of colonialism in whatever form it appears. We are united 
by a common detestation of racialism. And we are united by a common 
determination to preserve and stabilize peace in the world.

The Middle East has abruptly reached a new and critical stage in its long 
and important history. In past decades, many of the countries in that 
area were not fully self-governing. Other nations exercised considerable 
authority in the area and the security of the region was largely built 
around their power. But since the First World War there has been a steady 
evolution toward self-government and independence. This development 
the United States has welcomed and has encouraged. Our country supports 
without reservation the full sovereignty >supreme power or authority@ and 
independence of each and every nation of the Middle East. The evolution 
to independence has in the main been a peaceful process. But the area 
has been often troubled . . . All this instability has been heightened and, 
at times, manipulated by International Communism. Russia’s rulers have 
long sought to dominate the Middle East . . . The Soviet Union has nothing 
whatsoever to fear from the United States in the Middle East, or anywhere 
else in the world, so long as its rulers do not themselves first resort to 
aggression. That statement I make solemnly and emphatically.

As the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union came to dominate 
U.S. foreign policy concerns in the late 10s and 150s, the Truman 
and Eisenhower Administrations grew increasingly concerned that as 
the European powers lost their colonies or granted them independence, 
Soviet-supported communist parties might achieve power in the new 
states. This might serve to shift the international balance of power in favor 
of the Soviet Union and remove access to economic resources from U.S. 
allies. Events such as the Indonesian struggle for independence from the 
Netherlands 15±50, the 9ietnamese war against France 15±5, 
and the nationalist and professed socialist takeovers of Egypt 152 and 
Iran 151 served to reinforce such fears, even if new governments did 
not directly link themselves to the Soviet Union. Thus, the United States 
used aid packages, technical assistance, and sometimes even military 
intervention to encourage newly independent nations in the Third World to 
adopt governments that aligned with the West. The Soviet Union deployed 
similar tactics in an effort to encourage new nations to join the communist 
bloc. . . . Many of the new nations resisted the pressure to be drawn into 
the Cold War, joined in the “non-aligned movement.”

UNIT 9:   Globalization after 1900
Understand the Context
Unprecedented advancements in science and technology, from airplanes 
to the internet, increased globalization in the 20th century. These changes 
provided the setting for vast political and social change, including the spread 
of democracy and increased international trade. 
Innovation by Necessity  Science and technology exploration changed 
the way people in the 20th century viewed the universe and the natural world. 
Advancements were often a reaction to some sort of large, global problem. 
An increase in diseases that threatened human populations throughout the 
world necessitated medical advancements such as vaccines. Deforestation 
and a decline in the fresh water supply meant that humans had to compete 
over natural resources and develop environmentally friendly practices. Other 
conditions necessitated advancements in communication, transportation, and 
other global industries. 
Reaction to Globalization  Many states employed free-market economic 
policies that paved the way for emerging multinational organizations. 
Access to education and the political process improved as disseminating 
knowledge and information became easy with technology. Classrooms and 
political movements came to include more diverse participants, including 
those from various races, classes, and religions. Communication innovations 
also led to discussions about human rights that challenged previous forms of 
discrimination. 
The globalization of the 20th century also led to changes in the arts and 
humanities, especially in the second half of the century. Arts and entertainment 
increasingly reflected a new, globalized world and consumer culture began to 
transcend borders. Countries also had to learn to work together as they never 
had before. The United Nations formed with stated goals not only to maintain 
world peace but also to facilitate international cooperation.19002000 195020501945

Advances in Technology 
and Exchange
Technology made large populations possible; large populations  
now make technology indispensable.
—Joseph Krutch, writer and naturalist (1893–1970)
Essential Question:   How has the development of new technology changed 
the world since 1900?
While the population of the world grew, globalization made the world feel 
smaller, as did advances in telecommunications technology. Starting in the 
early 1900s, radio  brought news, music, and cultural events to a wide range of 
people. Later in the century, air travel and shipping containers, large standard-
sized units that could be carried on a truck or train or stacked on ship, promoted 
the widespread movement of people and goods. Energy technologies, such as 
the use of oil and nuclear power, made it possible to transport goods faster 
and more cheaply than ever. The internet, first developed for the U.S. Defense 
Department during the Cold War, emerged as a regular tool of communication 
for much of the public by the late 1990s. Knowledge economies, based on 
developing or sharing information, took root in cities around the world.
Communication and Transportation
Decades before the introduction of the internet, communication technologies 
were connecting people around the world. Television and radio ads encouraged 
people to “reach out and touch someone” by making a long-distance phone 
call. By the 1990s, mobile technologies such as cellphones put the tools of 
information creation and dissemination into the hands of individuals around 
the world. Twitter, Facebook, and other social networking sites made the media 
accessible to anyone anywhere. 
The impact of this revolution became apparent quickly. Videos taken 
on phones of police actions in the United States and other countries led to 
inquiries into racial profiling and sparked outrage. Social media also played a 
role in the “Arab Spring,” a series of antigovernment protests that spread from 
country to country in North Africa and the Middle East in the 2010s as people 
shared their protest experiences on social media.
634 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONWhile communication technologies put people in virtual touch, 
transportation advancements move people and goods into actual proximity. 
Every day, about 2 million people fly on an airplane. Cargo planes transport 
commercial shipments around the clock. Giant tankers—up to one-quarter 
mile in length—loaded with thousands of shipping containers ply the seas in 
increasing numbers, some of them too big to fit through the Panama Canal.
The Green Revolution  
In the mid-20th century, the Green Revolution  emerged as a possible long-
term response to hunger. Scientists developed new varieties of wheat, rice, and 
other grains that had higher yields and greater resistance to pests, diseases, 
and drought. The new varieties were first developed by crossbreeding —
breeding two varieties of a plant to create a hybrid. More recently, scientists 
have used genetic engineering —manipulating a cell or organism to change 
its basic characteristics. Farmers also used more irrigation, fertilizers, and 
pesticides. In Brazil and elsewhere, people burned down forests and plowed 
the land for agriculture. Acreage devoted to crops, especially grains, increased 
dramatically worldwide. 
The Green Revolution solutions were not free of problems. Many small 
farmers could not afford the new fertilizers or pesticides. For this reason, they 
were often unable to compete with large landowners. Many small farmers 
were forced to sell their land, increasing the holdings of large landowners even 
more. Also, since some of the techniques developed in the Green Revolution 
involved the use of mechanized equipment, fewer jobs were available for farm 
laborers. Finally, the heavy applications of chemicals damaged the soil and the 
environment. Total Grain Production in China 1945–2010

635 ADVANCE S IN TEC HNOLOG Y AND EXCHANGEGenetic engineering created its own set of concerns as well. Some argued 
that a genetic modification designed to give a plant resistance to insects might 
inadvertently cause a decline in the population of pollinating insects, such as 
bees. Another problem was the loss of old seed varieties as new genetically 
engineered plants were adopted.
Energy Technologies
In 1900, coal accounted for about half of the global energy consumed. As 
extraction, refinement, and transportation technologies allowed for widespread 
use, petroleum, also known as crude oil, and natural gas joined coal in fueling 
industrial output and helped increase productivity. Research in the 1930s and 
10s that led to the atomic bomb also led to the first use of nuclear power 
plants to generate electricity for factories and homes. 
Fossil fuels—coal, petroleum, and natural gas—are nonrenewable 
resources. Once they have been used up, the supply is permanently depleted. 
Fossil fuels have contributed to air pollution and to the cloak of greenhouse 
gases, especially carbon dioxide, that allow sunlight through the Earth’s 
atmosphere but block the escape of Earth’s heat. Nuclear power, while 
considered a clean energy, has its own dangers. Accidents at nuclear plants 
have caused serious problems with leaked radiation, and storing nuclear waste 
has hazardous consequences. 
Technologies continue to be developed to combat the emission of carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases as well as minimize harm from nuclear 
power. The building of nuclear power plants declined starting in the 1980s, and 
nuclear power accounts for only about 5 percent of global energy consumption. 
Renewable resources, such as wind and solar power, are beginning to supply 
energy to both industries and homes, but they too represent only 5 percent 
of global energy output. (Connect: Analyze the role of various energy 
sources in the first and second industrial revolutions and in the 21st century.  
See Topic 5.5.)
Medical Innovations
A number of advances in medicine have had a dramatic effect on the survival 
and longevity of humans. Medical research and advancement benefit from, 
and also inspire, new technologies. 
Antibiotics   In 1928, Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming was working 
in his lab in London when he accidentally discovered that a particular fungus 
produced a substance that killed bacteria. He had discovered penicillin. 
Penicillin became the first antibiotic,  a useful agent in curing bacterial 
infections. During World War II, antibiotics saved the lives of soldiers who 
would have died in any previous war from a minor wound that became 
infected. After the war, antibiotics spread to civilian use, where they fought a 
range of illnesses.
636 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION“I would like to sound one warning,” Fleming said in a speech as he 
accepted the Nobel Prize. He pointed out that the extensive use of antibiotics 
carried a risk. By killing off certain strains of a disease, antibiotics allowed the 
evolution of strains of the disease unaffected by them. These antibiotic-resistant 
strains could be untreatable. This prospect raised fears of renewed epidemics 
of diseases once under control.
Reliable Birth Control  Another groundbreaking medical advance was 
in birth control . In the early 150s, scientist Gregory Pincus developed a 
birth control pill, a more reliable method than the barrier methods then in use. 
Scientists tested the pill on women in the 1950s, and the U.S. government 
approved it for widespread use in 1960. 
As a result of the pill and other forms of birth control, fertility rates  
declined in much of the world. In other words, the average woman began 
having fewer babies than her mother or grandmother had. Birth control 
transformed sexual practices and played a part in reshaping gender roles. By 
2018, more than 300 million women worldwide were using modern forms of 
contraception, including the pill. 
Vaccines  Vaccines have existed since 1796, but governments and 
nonprofit organizations did not begin developing and widely distributing 
vaccines  to prevent deadly diseases until after 1900. Thanks to vaccines, 
polio and measles became rare, and smallpox was eradicated by the 1980s. 
Vaccines are also available to prevent mumps, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, 
and whooping cough, all potentially serious diseases. As of 2019, a malaria 
vaccine is in the trial stage.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccines were 
preventing as many as 3 million deaths each year in the 21st century. However, 
the WHO also said that better vaccination coverage would save another 1.5 
million people annually. Some people were unable to get vaccinated because 
they lived in hard-to-reach areas.

Penicillium fungi are the source of penicillin, which people can take orally 
or by injection. Penicillin works by interfering with bacteria cell walls. 
Scientists began to treat humans with the drug in 1941.

Questions 1 to 3 refer to the passage below.
“For the underprivileged billions in the forgotten world, hunger has been 
a constant companion, and starvation has all too often lurked in the nearby 
shadows. To millions of these unfortunates, who have long lived in despair, 
the Green Revolution seems like a miracle that has generated new hope for 
the future. . . . 
The Green Revolution has won a temporary success in man’s war 
against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully 
implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during 
the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction 
must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the Green Revolution will be 
ephemeral [temporary] only.”

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“Gender equity is defined by the World Health Organization as, µthe fairness 
and justice in the distribution of benefits and responsibilities between women 
and men,’ (Euro.who.int., 2002). When women can have control over their 
fertility, they have control of their lives which creates a society where 
gender equity can occur with all genders benefiting from the same resources. 
Contraceptive use promotes gender equality by improving the accessibility 
of education, employment and health care to women. If women are using 
contraception to postpone or prevent a pregnancy from occurring, they are 
able to stay in school and seek gainful employment upon completion.
Family planning is deeply influenced by inequality because the caliber of 
medical care between men and women is just not the same across the board. 
These gender differences are greater where women have relatively lower 
socioeconomic status than that of men (WHO, 2011; Nelson, 2011). It stands 
to reason that gender inequality intersects with other social determinants of 
health, such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, to produce health 
disparities between men and women that are similar to social divisions within 
society (WHO, 2008).”

Technological Advancements 
and Limitations—Disease
We live in a world fraught with risk from new pandemics. Fortunately,  
we also now live in an era with the tools to build a global immune system. 
—Nathan Wolfe, virologist (born 1970)
Essential Question:   How have environmental  factors affected human 
populations since 1900?
As virus specialist Nathan Wolfe pointed out, progress in science and 
medicine, combined with government-run public health measures, drastically 
reduced illnesses and deaths from many diseases after 1900. These included 
pandemics , epidemic diseases that spread across national borders.  The disease 
smallpox , for example,  had plagued the ancient Egyptians and devastated the 
native population of the Americas and Australia. As recently as the 1960s, it 
killed millions of people each year. However, the World Health Organization 
(WHO) conducted a global vaccination campaign to wipe out the disease. 
In 1979, scientists declared success. Smallpox had been eliminated from the 
planet, except for the culture kept alive at the Centers for Disease Control in 
the United States. 
Other diseases persisted, especially those related to poverty, including 
malaria, tuberculosis, and cholera. New epidemics also emerged, such as 
deadly strains of flu, HI9AIDS, and Ebola. Other conditions, such as heart 
disease and Alzheimers, became more common as people began living longer. 
Each medical problem spurred even more technological and medical advances 
to try to combat it.
Disease and Poverty
Even when cures exist, some diseases persist because the conditions of poverty 
are contributing factors. Poor housing or working conditions, contaminated 
water, and lack of access to health care are commonplace among populations 
with low incomes, and they all contribute to the spread of disease.
Malaria  A parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes in tropical areas, 
malaria  killed more than 600,000 people each year in the early 21st century. 
Most of these were young African children. The international non-governmental 
642 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONorganization (NGO) Doctors Without Borders  treated about 1.7 million 
people annually. Experts developed preventive approaches, such as distributing 
mosquito nets treated with insecticide as cover during sleep. However, people 
can still become infected during waking hours. A vaccine for malaria has been 
in development for many years, but one that is effective in most cases is still 
in trials. Nonetheless, progress has been made. In 2019, the World Health 
Organization certified Algeria and Argentina as malaria-free. The organization 
cautioned, however, that some types of mosquitoes were becoming resistant 
to insecticides.
Tuberculosis  Another disease associated with poverty is tuberculosis 
(TB), an airborne infection that spreads through coughs and sneezes and 
affects the lungs. Before 1946, no effective drug treatment was available for 
this deadly disease. Then a cure was developed involving antibiotics and a long 
period of rest. In countries where TB is common, vaccines are administered to 
children. In the early 21st century, a strain of tuberculosis resistant to the usual 
antibiotics appeared. The number of infected patients increased, especially in 
prisons, where people live in close quarters. The WHO began a worldwide 
campaign against tuberculosis in the 2010s.
Cholera  A bacterial disease that spreads through contaminated water, 
cholera causes about 95,000 deaths per year. Like tuberculosis and malaria, 
cholera affects mainly poor people in developing countries. Methods to counter 
cholera include boiling or chlorinating drinking water and washing hands. 
Although cholera vaccines are available, they do not reduce the need to follow 
these preventive measures. A severe cholera infection can kill within a few 
hours, but quickly rehydrating an exposed person can effectively eliminate the 
risk of death.

643 TECHNOLOGICAL A DVANCE MENTS AND LIMITATION S—DISEASE643Polio  Another disease caused by water contaminated by a virus 
transmitted in fecal matter, polio  once infected 100,000 new people per year. 
It could result in paralysis and sometimes death. The world cheered when 
an American researcher, Jonas Salk , announced on April 12, 1955, that an 
injectable vaccine against polio had proven effective. Six years later, an oral 
vaccine, developed by Albert Sabin , became available.  
Vaccines became the centerpiece of a global public health campaign to 
eliminate polio. A joint effort by governments, private organizations, and United 
Nations agencies began in 1988. In less than 30 years, polio was eliminated 
in all but a few countries. In places where it still exists, such as Pakistan and 
Afghanistan, war makes administering the vaccine difficult. Political unrest 
and religious fundamentalism make people fearful of programs advocated by 
outsiders. Still, the success of the campaign showed that coordinated global 
efforts could help solve global problems. (Connect: Compare the effects

Emerging Epidemics
Some diseases have emerged that caused major social disruption. In the fall of 
118, as World War I was drawing to a close, a new fight erupted. The issue 
of the Journal of the American Medical Association  published on December 
12, 1918, described the battle this way: “Medical science for four and one-
half years devoted itself to putting men on the firing line and keeping them 
there. Now it must turn with its whole might to combating the greatest enemy 
of all²infectious disease.” In fact, more soldiers died from the flu than from 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160

644 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONbattle. One quarter of all Americans and one-fifth of the world’s population 
became infected with this particularly virulent strain of the flu, which killed 20 
million people worldwide. Its victims tended to be between the ages of 20 and 
0. The effects of the flu were so disastrous that longevity in the United States 
fell by 10 years. More people died from the flu in 118±11 than had died in 
four years of the Bubonic Plague 1±151. Like the plague, the flu spread 
along trade routes and with military troops.
HIV/AIDS  Another disease outbreak causing social disruption occurred 
between 1981 and 2014. $cTuireG iPPunoGeficiency synGroPe $,'S , 
which is caused by the  huPan iPPunoGeficiency Yirus +,9 , killed more 
than 25 million people around the world. HIV weakens the immune system, 
so people more easily succumb to other illnesses. The virus is contracted 
through the exchange of bodily fluids, usually through unprotected sex, blood 
transfusions, or sharing intravenous needles. Funding for the research on the 
disease, which was associated in its early days with homosexual men and drug 
addicts, was difficult to come by, and a high percentage of its first victims died.
By the mid-1990s, however, medical researchers had developed ways to 
treat the disease but not to cure it. Antiretroviral drugs  could stop HIV from 
weakening the immune system, thus allowing a patient to live with the virus for 
many years. However, the drugs were very expensive, so access to treatment 
was difficult, particularly for patients in poor countries. Brazil is a notable 
exception. In 1996 it established a policy of providing free antiretroviral drugs 
to any person who needed them. Deaths have declined dramatically, and the 
program has actually saved the government money by lowering the number of 
hospitalizations, medical leaves, and early retirements.
After 2000, the WHO, the United States government, and private groups 
increased funding for AIDS prevention and treatment, but the disease remains 
a serious problem. In 2018, about 40 million people globally were living 
with HIV , the majority in developing countries or low-income neighborhoods 
of developed countries. Each week, more than 600 young women between 
the ages of 15 and 24 become infected with HIV , and many lack access to 
healthcare. 
Ebola  Another recent and frightening epidemic is Ebola. Discovered in 
the Congo in 1976, Ebola is a deadly disease caused by a virus that infects 
the African fruit bat, humans, and other primates. Humans get the virus from 
exposure to fluids of infected people or animals. The disease causes extensive 
bleeding, organ failure, and, for the majority of infected people, death. 
In 2014, a massive outbreak in West Africa caused fear around the world. 
However, a coordinated, intensive public health effort contained and then 
ended the outbreak. As with polio, countries demonstrated their ability to work 
together to confront a danger. The WHO took a leading role in this public 
health response, issuing emergency warnings and implementing a “road map” 
for handling the outbreaks. 
645 TECHNOLOGICAL A DVANCE MENTS AND LIMITATION S—DISEASEDiseases Associated with Longevity
Heart Disease  As longevity increases, diseases that typically do not 
develop until later in life began to assert themselves. Heart disease,  for 
example, is associated with lifestyle, genetics, and increased longevity. One of 
the major discoveries in fighting heart disease was the  heart transplant , first 
performed by the South African Christiaan Barnard  in 1967. Robert Jarvik  
led a team that designed an artificial heart , used as a temporary device while 
the patient waited for a compatible human heart. Other researchers developed 
less invasive procedures: replacing valves, installing stents in arteries, replacing 
the vessels leading to the heart, and developing medications to reduce blood 
conditions that led to heart disease. In the 2000s, people with heart disease 
lived longer than similarly affected people did in the 1970s.
Alzheimer’s Disease  As people lived longer, a form of dementia known 
as Alzheimer’s disease  that affects elderly and some middle-aged people also 
became an increasing concern. Alzheimer’s patients progressively lose their 
memory, eventually leading to a stage in which they do not recognize their 
loved ones. Since the disease undermines bodily functions, it leads to death. 
Researchers continue to search for a cure.

1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows.
“The health problems faced by the world’s poorest populations are not caused 
by a lack of drugs specifically related to their problems and diseases. The real 
problem is ensuring that these populations can actually access vital medicines. 
Many governments fail their populations in this respect by imposing punitive 
tariffs and taxes on medicines, and by skewing their spending priorities in 
favour of defense over health. The governments of poor countries hinder the 
creation of wealth, imposing obstacles in the way of owning and transferring 
property, imposing unnecessary regulatory barriers on entrepreneurs and 
businesses, and restricting trade through extortionate tariffs . . . [leaving] 
poor populations without the necessary resources to access the medicines 
that could so easily transform their quality of life.
Emerging health threats, ranging from drug-resistant strains of AIDS and 
tuberculosis to avian flu, remind us of the importance of ensuring that the 
pharmaceutical industry continues to discover and develop new drugs. 
Innovation is a fragile process, and it can be weakened or thwarted by poor 
public policies.”

affected human populations since 1900.
TECHNOLOG Y AND THE ENVIRON MENT 649
9.3
Technology and the Environment
Climate change does not respect border; it does not respect who you  
are—rich and poor, small and big. Therefore this is what we call global 
challenges which require global solidarity. 
—Ban Ki-moon, UN Secretary General, 2007–2016
Essential Question:   What were the causes and effects of environmental  
changes from 1900 to the present?
During the 20th and 21st centuries, human agricultural, industrial, and other 
commercial activity contributed to many environmental changes that led to 
increased competition for increasingly scarce resources. These problems 
include: 
• Deforestation —the loss of Earth’s trees as a result of cutting down 
trees so the land could be used for agriculture
• Desertification —the removal of the natural vegetation cover through 
expansion and intensive use of agricultural lands in arid and semi-arid 
lands
• A decline in air quality  as a result of increased pollutants in the air
• Increased consumption of the world’s supply of fresh water
Scientists observed that, along with these changes, Earth was getting 
warmer. Ban Ki-moon, a South Korean politician and diplomat, and many 
other world leaders concluded that climate change was a global problem and 
debated the best ways to approach it through global action.
Causes of Environmental Changes
A number of interconnected factors contributed to the environmental changes 
that have taken place since 1900. 
Population Growth  In 1900, the world population was 1.6 billion. By 
1950 it had risen to 2.55 billion, and by 2000 the population was 6.12 billion. 
All of the billions more people that lived on the planet since 1900 needed to be 
fed. Growing populations led to a demand for more croplands. This increase in 
land used for agricultural purposes resulted in deforestation, soil erosion, and 
smaller habitats for many species of plants and animals. 
650 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONGrowing populations affected not only land resources but also water 
resources. Overfishing in the oceans has led to the near disappearance of cod. 
Although fresh water is a renewable resource, growing populations consume 
increasing amounts of it. 
Urbanization  Another cause of environmental change is the increasing 
size and number of cities. By some estimates, by 2025, 5.1 billion people 
will live in cities, which will pressure those who grow food to use intensive 
farming methods that deplete the soil and cause erosion or to clear more forests 
for agricultural use. City dwellers also produce vast amounts of waste, some of 
which pollutes the water they depend on. 
Globalization and Industrialization  The global reach of industrialization 
has also affected the environment. As industry spread to developing countries, 
energy and other natural resources used in manufacturing were in demand, 
drawing further on the reserves of resources. Workers in industry in these 
developing countries are creating a new middle class that increases the market 
for such products as cars that require metals and other resources and that also 
contribute to pollution. 
(σecWsRf(nYiURnPenWDl&KDnJes
While humans have always competed for raw materials and natural resources, 
this competition became more intense as industrialization spread. With an ever-
growing population, humans grappled with hunger, environmental damage, 
and global epidemics.
Resource Depletion  Since the mid-1800s, when petroleum extraction 
began in earnest and oil pumped energy into the Industrial Revolution, about 
half of the earth’s finite resources of this vital resource have been used up. With 
the rapidly growing urban and industrial population, some experts predict the 
remaining half could be used up at a much faster rate, within the next 30 to 40 
years. While supplies of coal will last longer, if coal is used to make up for the 
loss of petroleum, coal reserves could also be depleted in 60 years. (Connect: 
Evaluate the claim that the Industrial Revolutions have created dependency on 
natural resources that will soon lead to their depletion. See Topic 5.5.)
Inequality and Scarce Resources  According to the United Nations, 
31 countries are facing water scarcity and more than 1 billion people lack 
clean, accessible drinking water. As water consumption continues to increase, 
some corporate interests are depleting, polluting, and exploiting water sources. 
The World Health Organization predicts that by 2025, half of the world’s 
population will lack clean and safe drinking water. 
Water scarcity is also linked to other inequalities. Surveys from 45 
developing countries show that women and children bear the primary 
responsibility for water collection in most households. This is time not spent 
working at an income-generating job or attending school. A study in Ghana 
found that a 15-minute reduction in water collection time increases the 
proportion of girls attending school by 8 percent to 12 percent.
651 TECHNOLOG Y AND THE ENVIRON MENT 651In 2015, world leaders agreed to 17 goals for a better world by 2030. Many of 
these global goals address the environmental problems the world faced after 1900 
that relate to extreme poverty, inequalities and injustice, and climate change. 
Changes in the Atmosphere  Factories, automobiles, airplanes, and many 
other products and processes of industrialization have emitted huge amounts 
of pollutants, including carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases —those 
that build up in the atmosphere and let the heat of the sun reach Earth but 
trap it from escaping Earth. At the same time, some of Earth’s natural carbon 
trapping resources, including forests and ground cover for unused farmlands, 
are shrinking. 
Development of Renewable Energy Sources  Concerned about 
unsustainable demands for energy through  fossil fuels (coal, oil, petroleum, 
and natural gas), companies and nations began to invest in renewable energy,  
energy derived from resources that are continuously replenished, such as wind, 
solar, tidal, and geothermal power. At first, high costs slowed development 
of such sources. However, as new techniques and technologies reduced costs, 
these sources became increasingly attractive options. Renewable energy 
provides only about 7 percent of the world’s energy needs. However, a 2018 
study predicted that by 2050, half the world’s electricity will come from wind 
power and solar power.
Increasing Environmental Awareness  In 1968, the “Club of Rome”—
an organization of scientists, industrialists, diplomats, and others—formed in 
Europe to promote solutions to global challenges facing humanity. It called 
attention to concerns that resource depletion would limit economic growth. In 
many countries, people joined a Green Party  that focused on environmental 
issues. Some supported th e Green Belt Movement  to protect wilderness 
areas from urban growth. (See Topic 9.5.) By the 21st century, the Green Belt

Debates About Global Warming
Air pollutants and greenhouse gases prompted debates about rising temperatures. 
Scientists, including those on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change, cited data showing that the emissions of carbon dioxide 
and other greenhouse gases caused by the burning of fossil fuels were causing 
global warming . This is an increase in the average temperature of the world. 
Experts advised governments to reduce their countries’ carbon footprint —the 
amount of carbon dioxide that each person produces. Without a reduced carbon 
footprint, global warming would contribute to catastrophes: more powerful 
hurricanes, more severe droughts, and rising sea levels that could flood islands 
and coastal areas. Some activists argued that the term “global warming” was too 
mild to express the urgency of action. They said that humanity faced a “climate 
emergency” or “climate crisis.” 
Climate-change skeptics, in contrast, questioned whether global warming 
was happening and whether human activities had any influence on the climate. 
In addition, some people in the energy industries resisted the interference of 
government, arguing that market forces would cause consumers to reduce their 
carbon footprint if that became necessary. In contrast, other leaders of energy 
companies began planning for a shift to renewable fuel sources.
Most government leaders, however, agree that global warming requires a 
global response, but countries disagree on how to reduce carbon emissions .

United States as the world’s 
biggest emitter of carbon

carbon dioxide per person  than 
developed countries do. Therefore, 
developed countries must take the lead 
in restricting their use of fossil fuels.
Kyoto  The first major international agreement to reduce carbon emissions 
was the Kyoto Protocol , signed in 1997. Developed nations in Western Europe, 
along with the United States, argued that developing countries, such as China, 
India, Russia, and Brazil, needed to curb their rapidly increasing output of carbon 
dioxide. However, the United States refused to ratify it, and China and India 
were not required to agree to the strictest terms of the protocol. 
653 TECHNOLOG Y AND THE ENVIRON MENTGlobal Action at Paris  In 2015, 195 countries signed a deal, the Paris 
Agreement , that gave new hope for progress against global warming. Leaders 
of both the United States and China supported this new deal. However, in 2017, 
President Donald Trump announced that the United States would withdraw 
from the Paris Agreement.
Climate Activism  Increasing global temperatures led to calls to action. 
“You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their 
future in front of their very eyes,” 15-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg 
raged in a speech at a United Nations climate conference in 2018. Beginning 
with a solo protest in her native Sweden, Thunberg eventually led a global 
climate strike with more than 1.6 million participants in more than 125  countries. 
Extinction Rebellion, a climate activist group formed in 2018, engaged in 
civil disobedience in London, blocking a main bridge and key intersections for 
more than a week, chaining themselves to the headquarters of big companies, 
and interrupting “business as usual” in other ways. About a thousand people 
were arrested, but the group succeeded in having Members of Parliament call 
a citizens’ assembly to discuss ideas for addressing the climate emergency. 
Many other citizen groups are pressuring lawmakers in many countries to 
take necessary steps to avert the worst consequences of continued warming 
predicted in reports from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change.
A New Age?
What should people call the time period we live in? Traditionally, geologists 
have called the current period the Holocene epoch. Holocene  means “entirely 
recent.” This time period started about 11,700 years ago, at the end of the last 
significant ice age. 
However, some scientists believed humans have left the Holocene. They 
wanted to call the present time the Anthropocene . This term means “new 
man.” These scientists wanted to change the name because humans now affect 
almost the entire planet. In 2019, a panel of scientists voted to approve the 
name. Anthropocene  reflects the idea that humans are the strongest influence 
on Earth’s climate and environment—for better and for worse.

656 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   E N V I R O N MENTAL  CHANGE S IN DIFFERENT  
CONTEXT S
The geopolitical context of environmental change provides one lens 
through which to see complex interrelationships. Economic context 
provides another useful lens, as Sean Mcelwee explains below:
“Marx’s ideas about overproduction led him to predict what is now 
called globalization—the spread of capitalism across the planet in 
search of new markets. µThe need of a constantly expanding market 
for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of 
the globe,’ he wrote. µIt must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, 
establish connections everywhere.’ While this may seem like 
an obvious point now, Marx wrote those words in 1848, when 
globalization was over a century away. And he wasn’t just right about 
what ended up happening in the late 20th century—he was right about 
why it happened: The relentless search for new markets and cheap

Economics in the Global Age
A market economy is to economics what democracy is to government: 
a decent,  if flawed, choice among many bad alternati]es
 —Charles Wheelan, Naked Economics:  Undressing the Dismal Science  (2002)
Essential Question:   How did the global economy change and remain the 
same from 1900 to the present?
Global trade exploded with the end of the Cold War. The new global economy 
was part of a renewed emphasis on market-oriented policy advocated by leaders 
such as Ronald Reagan  in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in Great 
Britain. They advocated cutting taxes, regulations, and government assistance 
to the poor as a way to promote economic growth. As Wheeler pointed out, 
this was a flawed choice producing greater wealth for many but hardships 
for others. At the same time, revolutions in information and communications 
technology led to the growth of knowledge economies in some regions, while 
industrial production and manufacturing were increasingly situated in Asia 
and Latin America. 
Acceleration of Free-Market Economies
Globalization is interaction among peoples, governments, and companies 
around the world. The Indian Ocean trade and European imperialism are both 
examples of globalization. However, the term usually refers to the increased 
integration of the global economy since the 1970s. The Eastern Bloc nations 
that had been under Soviet control suddenly could trade freely with capitalist 
democracies. India and other countries that had been nonaligned during the 
Cold War relaxed restrictions on trade in the 1990s. This opening up of a 
country’s economy is called economic liberalization .
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher wanted free markets , which are 
economic systems based on supply and demand, with as little government 
control as possible. While Reagan and Thatcher were strongly nationalistic, 
corporations used the shift in emphasis to move jobs to countries with lower 
wages, lower taxes, and fewer regulations. Critics charged that globalization 
led to labor exploitation and environmental damage.
658 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONEconomic Liberalization in Chile  In Chile in 1973, Augusto Pinochet  
took power in a U.S.-backed coup against a democratically elected socialist 
government led by Salvador Allende. Pinochet ruled from 1 to 10. Then 
a coalition of citizens ousted him because of his violent tactics. Indicted for 
kidnapping, torture, money laundering, and murder, Pinochet died in 2006 
before he could be convicted. “We buried our democracy, and we buried 
freedom,” the Chilean author Isabel Allende said about his rule.
However, during his rule, the Chilean economy took a turn away from 
state control toward a free-market approach. Among the goals of this approach 
were privatizing formerly state-run businesses and taming the serious inflation 
Chile was experiencing. Economists known as the Chicago Boys because they 
studied under free-market economist Milton Friedman at the University of 
Chicago helped design Chile’s economic reforms. The reforms were unpopular 
because they did not address poverty and other social concerns,  and Pinochet 
used repression to enact them. Subsequent administrations, however, guided 
the economy with a balanced approach, using a combination of economic 
growth as a result of free trade and government programs to significantly 
reduce poverty. (Connect : Evaluate the success of the free-market economic 
approach of both Chile and the Soviet Bloc. See Topic 8.9.)
Chinese Economic Reforms  Economic liberalization reached China as 
well. In 1981, Deng Xiaoping  became the Chinese leader. Under him, the 
Communist Party backed away from its commitment to economic equality, 
and more actively promoted economic growth. Deng called his policy “Let 
some people get rich first.” The government took several steps to open up the 
economy, even as it kept overall control:
• It replaced communes with peasant-leased plots of land where the 
peasants could grow their own crops and sell part of them in markets. 
This reform led to agricultural surpluses instead of the famines of the 
past.
• It allowed factories to produce more products for consumers.
• It encouraged foreign companies to set up factories in special 
economic zones. Foreign firms were attracted to China because of low 
wages and lax environmental laws.
• It  reopened the Shanghai stock market and allowed private ownership 
of some businesses.
Some Chinese thought that these economic reforms should be accompanied 
by political reforms, such as freedom of speech and the press and the end 
of the Communist Party’s monopoly on political power. Political discourse 
did become somewhat freer than in the past. In 1989, however, a large but 
peaceful student-led demonstration in Tiananmen Square  in Beijing was met 
by force from the government. Soldiers using guns and tanks broke up the 
demonstrations, killing hundreds of people. (See Topic 9.5.)
659 ECONO MICS IN T HE GLOBAL AGE 659Economic Change: New Knowledge Economies
In the late 1900s, revolutions in information and communications technology 
led some countries to undertake a new kind of economy—the knowledge 
economy . A knowledge economy creates, distributes, and uses knowledge and 
information. Designers, engineers, teachers, and many others have jobs in the 
knowledge economy. In the United States, the knowledge economy is evident 
in the vast stretch of technology companies in Silicon Valley in California, 
where workers use their knowledge to create ways for other people to use 
theirs through technology, communication, innovation, and collaboration. 
Knowledge Economy in Finland  In many cases, knowledge economies 
have evolved with the explosion of information and communication technology. 
In knowledge economies, governments and investors put resources into 
research, education, innovation, and technological infrastructure. 
Finland, for example, had been an agrarian economy in the 1950s but 
followed other European countries in industrializing after World War II. 
When the Soviet Union collapsed, Finland lost one of its main customers 
of manufactured goods and faced an economic crisis. In the 1990s, Finland 
turned a corner by entering the global marketplace, encouraging competition, 
and establishing the Science and Technology Policy Council to set a direction 
of economic growth through technology and innovation. Finland experienced 
great economic growth in this endeavor and led the way in the development 
of mobile phones. By investing in education and communications technology, 
Finland was able to build on its success with mobile phones and establish 
software companies. These industries required highly educated workers, while 
outsourcing hardware production to countries with lower labor costs. 
Japanese Economic Growth  Japan followed a somewhat different 
path. After World War II, Japan implemented economic policies similar to 
18th-century mercantilist policies that were designed to increase exports and 
decrease imports, as well as policies to boost competitiveness: 
• To encourage exports, the government coordinated its finance and 
labor policies with large corporations and gave them subsidies to help 
them keep their costs low. 
• To discourage imports, the government used high tariffs and other trade 
restrictions on goods made abroad. 
• To prepare its citizens to be productive workers, Japan emphasized 
rigorous education. 
These policies, aided by large investments from the United States and other 
countries, turned Japan into a manufacturing powerhouse. 
However, Japan’s impressive growth came at a high cost for its consumers. 
Low-wage workers producing items for foreign markets often could not afford 
to buy what they made. For example, Japanese-made cars were more expensive 
660 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONin Japan than they were in the United States. Over time, Japanese unions 
became strong enough to negotiate higher wages, and international pressure 
forced Japan to relax its trade restrictions. Japan’s economy diversified, and it 
became a knowledge economy and an international center of banking, finance, 
and information technology. Although Japan’s growth slowed after the 1980s, 
Japan remained the third-largest economy in the world in 2014, behind only 
the United States and China.
Closely following Japan’s economic model were four states known as 
the Asian Tigers —Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Like 
Japan, these states prospered through government-business partnerships, high 
exports, intense education, and a low-wage workforce. The success of the 
Asian Tigers and China raised hundreds of millions of people from poverty.
Economic Continuities: Shifting Manufacturing
As the knowledge economy develops in some regions, industrial production 
and manufacturing in those regions, including in the United States, have 
declined. Manufacturing plants are increasingly located in Asia and Latin 
America rather than the United States and Europe. Countries in both Asia and 
Latin America have become known for their contributions to the textile and 
apparel industries, though they manufacture many other products. So while it 
has moved to different regions, manufacturing continues to play a key role in 
the global economy. 
Vietnam and Bangladesh  Importers who once purchased their 
manufactured goods from China have been finding other options in such Asian 
countries as 9ietnam and Bangladesh, where labor costs tend to be significantly 
lower than in China where they are already significantly lower than in the 
United States and Europe). Both Vietnam and Bangladesh have become 
known for their exports of clothing. In compounds the size of small villages 
in some places, garment manufacturers—often funded by foreign investors— 
churn out the clothes that end up on hangers in stores in developed countries. 
Clothing accounts for 80 percent of exports from Bangladesh. Phones are the 
largest export from Vietnam, worth about $45 billion in 2017, with apparel and 
electronic goods each bringing in $25.9 billion. 
Workers in both Vietnam and Bangladesh have mounted strikes in recent 
years, protesting both low wages and poor working conditions. Their pay has 
increased slightly as a result, but not enough to keep up with rising costs of 
living.
Manufacturing in Mexico and Honduras  In 1994, the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico negotiated NAFTA , the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. This agreement encouraged U.S. and Canadian industries to 
build maquiladoras  (factories) in Mexico that used low-wage Mexican labor 
to produce tariff-free goods for foreign export. Many factories hired large 
numbers of young women and exposed them to harsh working conditions. 
661 ECONO MICS IN T HE GLOBAL AGELabor unions in the United States complained that NAFTA led to the export of 
thousands of U.S. jobs to Mexico, where wages and benefits were lower and 
safety and environmental standards were weaker.
Honduras in Central America, the second largest exporter of textiles in the 
Americas, has sought to upgrade its manufacturing using principles of 
sustainability—recycling or treating its waste materials—and fair labor 
practices, including housing and education plans for workers, through business-
government partnerships. As in Vietnam and Bangladesh, considerable 
business investment comes from enterprises in South Korea and Taiwan.
Transnational Free-Trade Organizations
Several organizations contributed to the growth of the global economy in the 
decades following World War II. Some countries joined regional organizations 
such as the European Economic Community, Mercosur  (in South America), 
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) . Many countries 
signed an international accord, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) , which lifted restrictive barriers to trade. Protective tariffs , which are 
taxes on foreign imports, had been at a world average rate of 40 percent before 
GATT. By lowering and eliminating many tariffs, the agreement promoted 
more international trade and helped restore economic prosperity to war-
ravaged Europe. By the 1990s, average tariff rates had sunk below 5  percent, 
easing the movement of goods across national borders and lowering prices for 
consumers.

662 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONIn 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO)  took over GATT’s 
operations. The WTO made rules that governed more than 90 percent of all 
international trade. In part because of its power, the organization became 
controversial. Its meetings were closed to the public, and its board members 
represented mostly corporate interests. Also, the organization’s rules favored 
trade over consideration of issues of moral concern. For example, through 
strict application of WTO rules, a member nation that refused to buy clothing 
made by sweatshop labor could suffer trade sanctions from the organization.
Multinational Corporations
A multinational corporation  is one that is legally incorporated in one country 
but that makes or sells goods or services in one or more other countries. The 
joint-stock companies of the Commercial Revolution, such as the British 
East India Company and Dutch East India Company (see Topic 4.5) were the 
earliest examples of multinational corporations. Multinational corporations 
were also the business means through which imperialist nations made their 
wealth during the age of imperialism, exploiting the resources and labor of the 
colonized regions for profit in home countries.
Today’s multinational corporations take advantage of both knowledge 
economies and more traditional manufacturing and industrial economies. 
They employ leading edge workers in the knowledge economy—software 
designers, communications specialists, and engineers—and at the same time 
hire low-wage workers abroad to make their products. They also have a global 
market in which to sell their goods and services. 
To free-market supporters, multinational corporations produce the greatest 
gains for both developed and developing countries. For example, in the 
early 1990s, India opened its markets and allowed in more imports. With its 
highly educated, English-speaking workforce, India became a software and 
information technology powerhouse, drawing investments from American 
and European companies that wanted to outsource jobs and lower labor costs. 
Multinational corporations, such as Microsoft  a n d  Google , also invested in 
the Indian economy. The influx of corporate wealth and foreign goods created 
a thriving consumer culture among India’s middle class, the ranks of which 
swelled tremendously after 2000. In 2014, the Indian middle class was estimated 
to be the largest of any country in the world, with more than 350 million people.
The India-based multinational corporation Mahindra & Mahindra , 
which produces cars, farm equipment, military vehicles, and electrical energy, 
is headquartered in Mumbai, India, but has operations not only throughout 
India but also in South Korea, China, Australia, the United States, South 
Africa, and other Africa nations. Some multinational corporations are 
criticized because they lack a strong national identity and therefore do not 
necessarily adhere to the ethical standards of their home country. They are 
also criticized for exploiting workers and establishing their operations in such 
663 ECONO MICS IN T HE GLOBAL AGEa way that they avoid as many taxes as possible. Mahindra & Mahindra, in 
contrast, has received awards for its socially responsible corporate practices 
and is considered one of the most trusted businesses in India.
In contrast, Swiss-based multinational Nestlé  corporation, the largest food 
company in the world, has been the subject of many controversies and 
criticisms, including purchasing cocoa for its chocolate products from suppliers 
who use child labor and engage in cocoa production on protected lands. It has 
also faced criticism for its bottled water business for its attitude toward drinking 
water as a product rather than a human right. At the same time, Nestlé invests 
in a number of research programs aimed at sustainable agriculture and training 
for farmers.

664 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONMULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Questions 1–3 refer to the passage below. 
“[Google] has become famous in India for its program of Saathis—the Hindi 
word for friend—which it launched in 2015 to help draw more women online. 
Women make up a small percentage of internet users in the country. Google 
partnered with Tata Trusts, the philanthropic arm of India’s manufacturing and 
retail conglomerate, and recruited about 60,000 so-called Saathis, all women, 
in more than 200,000 villages across India, to teach other women how to get 
online. Google trained the Saathis and gave them each a smartphone, while 
Tata pays them a stipend of about $40 a month. . . . 
Google claims the Saathis have so far trained about 22 million people, 
mostly women, in basic skills like how to make WhatsApp calls and pay bills 
online. It aims to reach about 300,000 villages by the end of this year. Several 
Saathis and their trainees have seized the chance to start cottage industries 
with their new Internet skills, downloading instructional videos on YouTube 
on how to make homemade honey or embroider shirts, for example. . . .  
µI learned how to decorate bangles with thread and stones on YouTube,’ says 
Parveen Begum, 2, whose husband, a devout Muslim, did not permit her to

“To take advantage of opportunities provided by globalization, 
firms have become multinational, establishing worldwide supply, 
production, and distribution networks. Many workers at firms that 
have successfully adapted to globalization have benefited, but large 
numbers of U.S. jobs have disappeared due to foreign competition 
or to offshoring by domestic firms. In effect, globalization means a

Calls for Reform and Responses
We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage  
of po]erty, depri]ation,  suќering,  gender and other discrimination  
—Nelson Mandela (1918–2013)
Essential Question:   How have social categories, roles, and practices 
changed and stayed the same since 1900?
In the age of global economics, global transportation and communication, and 
global devastation from war, human rights were, for the first time, also elevated 
to the level of global discourse, which challenged long-held assumptions 
about race, class, gender, and religion. Efforts to establish and safeguard 
human rights opened doors of educational and professional opportunity and 
political participation for some who had previously been excluded. People 
sought liberation from the “continuing bondage,” in Nelson Mandela’s terms, 
that had kept them in poverty. People around the globe also began to protest 
the inequalities and environmental damage that globalization had created or 
reinforced. 
An Era of Rights
In December of 1948, the United Nations laid the groundwork for an era of 
rights when it adopted a foundational document, the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights , asserting basic rights and fundamental freedoms for 
all human beings. It stated that everyone is entitled to these rights without 
distinctions based on “race, colour [color], sex, language, religion, political or 
other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.” 
The UN and Human Rights  Since its creation, the United Nations has 
promoted human rights , basic protections that are common to all people. 
As part of its humanitarian work, the UN created the United Nations 
International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF)  in 1946 to provide 
food for children in Europe who were still suffering more than a year after the 
end of World War II. In 1948, the UN formalized its position on human rights 
in the Universal Declaration. Since that time, the UN has investigated abuses 
of human rights, such as genocide, war crimes, government oppression, and 
crimes against women. 
668 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe International Court of Justice is a judicial body set up by the original 
UN charter. It settles disputes over international law that countries bring to it. 
Also called the World Court, it has 15 judges, and each must be a citizen of a 
different country. It often deals with border disputes and treaty violations.
Another main aim of the UN is to protect refugees , people who have fled 
their home countries. In times of war, famine, and natural disasters, people 
often leave their country and seek refuge in a safe location. Working through 
sub-agencies such as NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and the agency 
UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), the UN provides 
food, medicine, and temporary shelter. Among the earliest refugees the UN 
helped were Palestinians who fled the disorder when the UN partitioned 
Palestine to create the state of Israel in 18.
Global Feminism  On January 21, 2017, the day after Donald Trump’s 
inauguration as president, the Women’s March on Washington drew about 
500,000 demonstrators standing up for women’s rights and other concerns. 
However, the march drew even more power from the millions more 
demonstrators who took part in locations on every continent around the 
globe, from Antarctica to  Zagreb, Croatia and from Buenos Aires, Argentina 
to Mumbai, India. As many as five million people stood together that day 
representing a global solidarity for women’s rights. That march was the most 
dramatic sign of global feminism, but other landmark events since 1900 had 
done their part to solidify the movement.

669 CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSES669The 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women outlined many rights and protections that are cornerstones of 
global feminism:
• The right to vote and to hold office
• The right to freely choose a spouse
• The right to access the same education as men
• The right to access family planning resources and birth control. 
Cultural and Religious Movements  Discourse on rights also became 
part of cultural and religious movements. For example, the Negritude 
Movement , which took root primarily in French West Africa, emphasized 
pride in “blackness,” the rejection of French colonial authority, and the right 
to self-determination. Léopold Sédar Senghor  of Senegal wrote poems about 
the beauty and uniqueness of African culture and is now regarded as one of 
the 20th century’s most distinguished French writers. (Senghor later served as 
first president of independent Senegal. During the 120s and 10s, American 
intellectuals such as W.  E. B. Du  Bois, Richard Wright, and Langston Hughes 
wrote movingly about the multiple meanings of “blackness” in the world. What 
many now refer to as “black pride”of the 1960s had its roots in the Negritude 
Movement
Inherent rights became a focus of a religious ideology as well. Liberation 
theology , which combined socialism with Catholicism, spread through Latin 
America in the 1950s and 1960s. It interpreted the teachings of Jesus to include 
freeing people from the abuses of economic, political, and social conditions. 
Part of this liberation included redistributing some wealth from the rich to 
the poor. In many countries, military dictators persecuted and killed religious 
workers who embraced liberation theology.
However, advocates of liberation theology had a few notable successes. 
In Nicaragua, they helped a rebel movement topple a dictator and institute 
a socialist government. In 9enezuela, President Hugo Chivez was deeply 
influenced by the movement. Then, in 201, the Roman Catholic Church 
selected a cardinal from Argentina as pope, the first one from Latin America. 
The new leader, who took the name Pope Francis , reversed the Vatican’s 
opposition to liberation theology.
Steps toward Gender Equality
During the 20th century, men and women made great strides toward securing 
some of their rights and participating more fully in professional and political 
life. In the first part of the century the percentage of women who could read 
and who attended college increased, and in country after country, women won 
the right to vote. However, not all the women in a country won the right to 
vote at the same time. In the United States, for example, white women won 
the right to vote in national elections in 1920. Native American and African 
670 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONAmerican women did not have full voting rights throughout the country until 
the V oting Rights Act of 1965. Britain granted women the right to vote in 
118, but at first only women over 0 who met a property qualification could 
do so. British women did not achieve the same right to vote as men until 1928. 
In Australia, white women gained some voting rights in 1894, but aboriginal 
men and women did not gain the right to vote until 1962.

As of 2018, only the tiny country of Vatican City did not allow women 
to vote. Whether women are able to exercise their vote is another issue. In 
Pakistan, women gained the right to vote in 1. However, in 201, women 
cast only 10 percent of votes there.
Steps toward Racial Equality
In the United States, African Americans won major victories against 
discrimination and segregation. Through the 1965 Civil Rights Act,  which 
outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, 
and the 1965 Voting Rights Act , which banned discrimination in voting, the 
federal government stepped in to protect the rights of all citizens. African 
Americans also sought equality of education through desegregation of schools.
South Africa’s Colonial Legacy  South Africa’s system of apartheid , 
instituted in 1948, enforced the segregation of people based on race. Although 
white South Africans made up only 15 percent of South Africa’s population, 
apartheid reserved good jobs and other privileges for them. So-called pass 
laws  required black South Africans to carry identity documents when entering 
areas set aside for whites, which they often had to do when traveling to their 
jobs. They were banned from living in certain areas of the country. Mixed 
marriages were prohibited. Although South Africa had 11 major languages, 
671 CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSESclasses for blacks were taught only in Afrikaans, the language of many of 
the white South Africans who ruled the nation. These dehumanizing decrees 
marginalized the 85 percent of South Africans who were black, South Asian, 
or mixed race. 
The white-dominated South African government had its basis in European 
colonization of Africa in general and the Dutch and British colonization of 
South Africa in particular. The colonizers pushed the native people off the fertile 
lands and gave them no say in government. South Africans began to demand 
equal treatment. “I am not interested in picking up crumbs of compassion,” 
said Desmond Tutu , Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa, and 
human rights activist. “I want the full menu of rights.”
Challenges to Apartheid  In 1964, Nelson Mandela , a leader of the 
African National Congress (ANC) , was imprisoned for life for agitating 
against apartheid. The ANC’s primary goals were to end white domination 
and create a multiracial South Africa. Mandela’s imprisonment throughout the 
1960s, 1970s, and 1980s inspired a global movement to end apartheid. Black 
protests in South Africa, which were often peaceful, were crushed violently by 
the government’s forces. South Africa’s reputation grew worse in the eyes of 
the global community. Musicians staged concerts calling for Mandela’s release 
from prison, college students urged universities and corporations to divest 
from South Africa, and many countries voted for strict economic sanctions 
against the country. The United Nation expelled South Africa in 1974 because 
of its apartheid,
As South Africa became a pariah state  (undesirable state) in the 1980s, 
its leadership began to take notice. Mandela himself began negotiations with 
the government in 1986 while still in prison. In 1989, F. W. de Klerk  became 
the nation’s acting president. He recognized the need for change. Within six 
months, de Klerk announced Nelson Mandela’s release from prison.
Although euphoria was high in the weeks following Mandela’s release, 
apartheid remained the law of the land. Police violence against protesters 
persisted, which stalled negotiations between Mandela and de Klerk. However, 
a series of reforms in the 1990s ended apartheid. In 1994, South Africa held 
its first free elections and rejoined the United Nations. The African National 
Congress won the majority of the seats in the Parliament. The Government 
of National Unity was established with ANC members in the majority. On 
May 10, 1, Nelson Mandela was sworn in as president, South Africa’s first 
black leader.
Uniting South Africa  Immediately the Government of National Unity set 
up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) . Unlike the Nuremberg 
Trials that sought retribution for crimes against humanity committed by Nazis 
during World War II, the TRC sought to restore and establish an atmosphere 
of trust in the new multiracial South Africa. The TRC organized a series of 
19 public hearings designed to expose the truth of human rights violations that 
had occurred during apartheid, while at the same time granting amnesty to 
members of the apartheid regime who agreed to testify. 
672 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONCaste Reservation in India  The fight for civil rights was also a global 
effort as people from different races and social classes began to demand 
equality. In India, the 1949 Constitution outlawed discrimination against the 
Dalits , also known as untouchables. Pakistan outlawed discrimination against 
Dalits in 1953. Before then, many people believed that being touched by a 
Dalit required the person who was touched to undergo a cleansing ritual. 
People in India and Pakistan continued to discriminate against Dalits until 
well into the 21st century.
To open doors of opportunity to social groups or castes that had faced 
historical discrimination, the government of India established the caste 
reservation system . Through this system, the government guaranteed that a 
certain percentage of government and public sector jobs and enrollment in 
higher education would be set aside for people whose caste had conferred an 
underprivileged life.

Nelson Mandela voted for the first time in 1994, at age 76. In that 
year, he was selected as president of South Africa. 
673 CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSESHuman Rights Repression in China  
After the economic reforms of the late 1980s and 1990s, China quickly 
became an economic powerhouse. The economic liberalization, however, was 
not matched by democratic reforms. The Chinese Communist Party CCP 
ruled the People’s Republic with an iron fist. It censored the news industry 
and controlled what students were taught in primary and secondary schools. 
Such practices limited freedom of speech and thought. The CCP also required 
all nonstate organizations and groups to register with the government. 
International nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were not free to operate 
in China unless they were willing to undergo strict regulation. Opposition 
political parties did not stand a chance in China’s governing system, although 
some debate was allowed in the legislative process. Overall, however, the 
governing system was designed to thwart all challenges to the CCP’s authority. 
How could the CCP have such power" The Communists had controlled 
China since 1949. The government owned and controlled all industries. 
Government officials had killed or imprisoned those who had spoken out 
against previous government actions, such as the Great Leap Forward.
Tiananmen Square  Chinese intellectuals and students had a history of 
protesting against their government based on the May Fourth Movement in 
1919. In the spring of 1989, pro-democracy activists organized a public event 
mourning the death of a sympathetic high official. The protesters demanded 
a chance to speak with Chinese leaders about freedom of the press and other 
reforms. After the Chinese government refused to meet with the activists, 
citizens in more than 400 Chinese cities staged sit-ins, refused to attend classes, 
and began hunger strikes. Hundreds of thousands of students, professors, and 
urban workers staged a massive protest in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. After 
seven weeks of protests, the government declared martial law. It sent troops 
armed with tanks and assault weapons into Beijing. Citizens responded by 
setting up barricades to block the troops.
On June 4, 1989, the army arrived in Tiananmen Square and attacked the 
unarmed protesters. The Chinese government claimed that nobody died in 
Tiananmen Square that day. No mention of the event was included in school 
texts, and the government blocked all Web sites that discussed the Tiananmen 
Square incident and human rights abuses in China. However, estimates by 
Amnesty International, the International Red Cross , and the New York Times 
indicated that anywhere from several hundred to a few thousand civilians were 
killed. As Chinese officials continue to describe the Tiananmen event as a 
western conspiracy, Tiananmen mothers are prohibited from openly mourning 
family members who died in June 1989. The government still imprisons 
those who commemorate June 4. (Connect: Analyze the methods of protest at 
Tiananmen Square and the May 4th Movement. See Topic 7.5.)
Minority Rights in China  The communist government in China 
has struggled with the demands of the nation’s 55 ethnic minorities. Some 
prominent examples were calls by Tibetans for more autonomy or independence 
674 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONand the complaints of the Uighur people concerning religious and political 
discrimination in the northwest province of Xinjiang. 
In 2011, some of the Mongolian people in China protested against the high 
number of Han Chinese who had moved into Inner Mongolia, an autonomous 
region of northern China, and disrupted their pastoral way of life. The Han are 
the largest ethnic group in China and worldwide. The Mongolians protested 
the environmental damage that came with settled agriculture, strip-mining of 
coal, building of highways, damming of rivers, and overgrazing of land.
Steps toward Environmental Repair
People realized that part of securing their rights in a globalized world is to 
claim their environmental rights to clean water and air and a sustainable planet 
with biodiversity. A number of organizations try to identify and achieve goals 
toward guaranteeing those rights.  
Earth Day  Starting in 1970, citizens in the United States designated 
April  22 each year as Earth Day , a day for people to focus on environmental 
awareness. Organizers hoped to highlight recycling, developing alternative 
energy, eating locally grown and organic foods, and passing antipollution 
legislation. Today, about 174 countries observe and participate in Earth Day 
activities with the Earth Day Network, an environmental advocacy group. 
Greenpeace  Founded in 1971 as an organization to advocate for the 
environment, Greenpeace  grew into a multinational agency with offices in more 
than 55 countries. It battles deforestation, 
desertification, global warming, the killing 
of whales, and overfishing. Greenpeace has 
engaged in lobbying and education, but it 
became famous for its direct actions, such 
as confronting whaling boats in the ocean.
Green Belt Movement  In 1977, 
Kenyan activist Wangari Maathai  founded 
the Green Belt Movement , a direct response 
to the environmental degradation resulting 
from the colonial experience. Women in 
rural Kenya were reporting that streams 
were drying up and their food supply was 
unpredictable. The Green Belt Movement 
helped women work together to plant trees 
to improve the soil and collect rainwater. 
More than that, however, Dr. Maathai and 
the Green Belt Movement helped women 
see their capacity for making changes 
through participation in public life rather 
than leaving decisions to others. 
Source:  Wikimedia Commons
In 200, Maathai won the Nobel Prize for 
Peace, becoming the first African woman 
to do so. “We are called to assist the Earth 
to heal her wounds and in the process heal 
our own,” she said. 
675 CALLS FOR REFOR M AND RESPONSESSteps toward Economic Fairness
To counterbalance the strictly commercial interests of the powerful World 
Trade Organization (see Topic 9.4), organizations from around the world 
combined resources to create the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) in 
1989. Member organizations subscribe to the following 10 principles of fair 
trade, and the WFTO monitors its members to make sure they follow these 
principles.
World Fair Trade Organization Principles of Fair Trade

Questions 1–3 refer to the following passage. 
“To you and all the Commissioners and staff of the TRC [Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission] we say, on behalf of the nation: Thank you for 
the work you have done so far! If the pain has often been unbearable and 
the revelations shocking to all of us, it is because they indeed bring us the 
beginnings of a common understanding of what happened and a steady 
restoration of the nation’s humanity. The TRC . . . was established by an Act of  
Parliament with overwhelming support. It is composed of individuals from 
all backgrounds and persuasions. It has put the spotlight on all of us. . . .  
>W@e are confident that it has contributed to the work in progress of laying the 
foundation of the edifice of reconciliation. . . .  Reconciliation requires that we 
work together to defend our democracy and the humanity proclaimed by our 
Constitution . . . . The wounds of the period of repression and resistance are too 
deep to have been healed by the TRC alone, however well it has encouraged us 
along that path. Consequently, the Report that today becomes the property of 
our nation should be a call to all of us to celebrate and to strengthen what we 
have done as a nation as we leave our terrible past behind us forever.
Let us celebrate our rich diversity as a people, the knowledge that when 
the TRC in its wisdom apportions blame, it points at previous state structures; 
political organisations [organizations]; at institutions and individuals, but never 
at any community. Nor can any individual so identified claim that their brutal 
deeds were the result of some character inherent in any community or language 
group… Above all, we should remember that it was when South Africans of 
all backgrounds came together for the good of all that we confounded the 
prophets of doom by bringing an end to this terrible period of our history.”
Nelson Mandela, statement on receiving the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission report, October, 1998

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“I think these may be my last words. My name is Chai Ling. I am twenty-
three years old. My home is in Shandong Province. . . . The situation has 
become so dangerous. . . . If we withdraw from the square, the government 
will kill us anyway and purge those who supported us. If we let them win, 
thousands would perish, and seventy years of achievement would be wasted. 
Who knows how long it would be before the movement could rise again? The 
government has so many means of repression—execution, isolation. 
. . . I believe that democracy is a natural desire. It should guarantee human 
rights and independence, and foster self-respect—all of which people are 
entitled to.
Unfortunately, the basic human instinct for independence has been greatly 
inhibited and degraded among the Chinese. . . . The square is our last stand. If 
we lose it, China will retreat into another dark age, the people will once again 
turn against one other, with no real feelings or communication between them. 
If a nation’s own people don’t stay and help it to grow and develop, who will? 
But I will not be there to protect the square because I’m different from the 
others: my name is on the blacklist. I don’t want to die.”
Chai Ling, Interview at Tiananmen Square, 1989
(A) Identify ONE historical event that affected Ling’s argument in  
the passage. 
(B) Explain how ONE historical situation that supports Ling’s 
argument. 
(C) Explain ONE way in which struggles for democracy in China are 
similar to the struggles for democracy in South Africa.
2. Answer all parts of the question that follows. 
(A) Identify ONE way in which access to education affected social 
structures after 1900. 
(B) Explain ONE way in which people challenged old assumptions 
about race, class, gender, or religion after 1900. 
(C) Explain ONE way in which the development of the United Nations 
affected global integration after 1900.
678 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   HUM AN RIGHTS IN A DIGITAL  AGE
This topic has explored an era of human rights in the context of a 
shifting world after World War II and decolonization. The Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights assigns responsibility to each member 
nation to protect and promote the human rights of its people. 
In November 2018, the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, 
Michelle Bachelet, addressed students at the University of Geneva 
in Switzerland, situating human rights in a new context, the digital 
landscape:
“. . . [W]e are seeing increasing reports of the use of bots and 
disinformation campaigns on social media to influence the opinions 
and choices of individual voters. 
Maybe you think this doesn’t apply to us: we are too clever to be 
affected by a bunch of bots. But I am not so sure. It appears the internet 
is increasingly becoming an arena for sometimes very sophisticated 
forces for propaganda—whether by movements of violent extremism, 
or by private actors or even State authorities for political purposes. 
In such a context, can there be any doubt that our freedom to think, 
to believe, to express ideas, to make our own choices and live as we 
wish, is under threat? 
If our thoughts, our ideas and our relationships can be predicted by 
digital tools, and even altered by the action of digital programmes, 
then this poses some very challenging and fundamental questions 
about our future.”
Situate human rights in the broader context of the digital landscape. 
Identify three challenges to promoting and protecting human rights 
in this context.

Globalized Culture
What is interesting is the power and the impact of social media. . . .  
So we must try to use social media in a good way. 
—Malala Yousafzai, Pakistani human rights activist (born 1997)
Essential Question:  How has globalization changed culture since 1900?
At the start of the 20th century, political and social developments led to new 
directions in the arts. Writers, painters, and musicians developed modernism, 
a rejection of tradition in favor of experimentation and uncertainty. World  
War I, a global depression, and World War II had focused attention on survival. 
After World War II, however, citizens of wealthier nations began to develop a 
consumer culture —one in which people tended to focus more on what they 
bought and owned than on where they lived, what they did for a living, or what 
they believed. As trade restrictions loosened and new technology became more 
widely available, people worldwide began sampling arts, popular culture, 
and ideas from faraway countries. However, few could predict the global 
connectedness made possible by social media, nor its power to do both good 
and ill.
Political, Social, and Artistic Changes
Change was everywhere at the start of the 20th century. In just about every main 
field of human endeavor, new perspectives and discoveries were redefining 
the way people thought about their social and physical environments. Key 
political changes also helped shape society.
Political Changes  At the beginning of the 20th century, imperialism 
was creating sometimes fierce competition among nations. Two world wars 
raised the conflict to the level of deadly force, although allies standing together 
developed a good working relationship and understanding of one another. 
The Cold War divided much of the world into camps, stressing differences 
rather than commonalities. After the Cold War, however, both economic and 
cultural barriers fell, bringing countries closer together. In some key ways, 
collaboration gradually replaced competition as nations formed cooperative 
regional organizations such as the European Union and NAFTA as well as 
global associations such as the United Nations for conflict resolution and the 
World Trade Organization to regulate international trade.
680 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONSocial Changes  Along with these changes came social changes. 
International organizations and collaboration brought people of different 
cultures into closer contact with one another, just as international exchanges 
had done in the past. Rights movements—civil rights and women’s rights 
especially—helped bring formerly marginalized voices into the mainstream 
conversation. 
People were also questioning long-held beliefs about humans and their 
environments. Albert Einstein 18±155 and other scientists upended 
people’s understanding of physical reality. Sigmund Freud 1856±1 probed 
the invisible inner workings of the human psyche. Jean-Paul Sartre 105±
1980) philosophized that nothing had meaning. Technological developments 
in communication, transportation, and medical and other scientific knowledge 
brought change after change—from horses to cars, from telegraph to radio, 
from antibiotics to vaccines.
Artistic Changes   These changes were reflected in the visual arts, 
literature, and music of the time. Cubism, a style Picasso used in his famous 
painting “Guernica,” challenged traditional perspective in the visual arts 
(See Topic 7.4.) Stream-of-consciousness writing by such authors as Marcel 
Proust 11±122 and James Joyce 1882±11 rebelled against traditional 
narrative forms, and atonal music such as that composed by Arnold Schoenberg 
18±151 explored musical expression outside of familiar tonalities, to 
name just a few examples. Many scholars suggest these expressions were a 
response to the mechanized, urbanized society widespread in the early 1900s.
An especially vibrant expression of 20th century perspectives was the 
Harlem Renaissance, a “rebirth” of African American culture as it sought to 
distance itself from the stereotyped portrayal of African Americans in literature 
and onstage. During the Harlem Renaissance, writers, poets, musicians, and 
social activists made Harlem a thriving center of energy for black artistic 
expression. Jazz emerged and became an international language.
Global Consumer and Popular Culture 
In the 1920s, popular culture  —the culture of everyday people rather than 
the educated elite—expressed itself through new media: radio and motion 
pictures. Radio, movies, and later television created a culture shared 
throughout a nation, and eventually throughout the world. Radio provided a 
variety of programs, from easy-going comedies to music hours featuring the 
latest in big band entertainment, and during World War II it played a vital 
role in national defense in most industrialized nations. Movies provided relief 
from the anxieties and pressures of the Great Depression while reflecting it 
in its themes. Charlie Chaplin’s “Little Tramp” character of silent movies 
epitomized the down and out. 
Radio and television also ushered in the consumer culture that characterized 
much of the developed world after World War II. The “free” programming 
reaching into the homes of millions of people carried with it commercials 
681 GLOBALIZE D CULTURE681for the products of sponsors. Industry turned from wartime production to the 
manufacture of consumer products, and people around the world were eager to 
buy. In the 1990s, the internet connected people around the globe.

In the early 21st century, the United States remained the world’s most influential 
culture. Through Americanization , people the world over learned more about 
the United States than Americans learned about the rest of the world. This 
dominance of the United States created resentment among those who felt that 
American popular culture diluted their unique cultural identity. In the early 
21st century, many people around the world considered American consumer 
culture to be throwaway culture . They objected to the waste and pollution 
that was part of the focus on newer, cheaper, more disposable products.
English Spreads and Changes  Through the influence of the British 
Empire and through American movies, corporations, and scientific research, 
English became a second language in much of the world. In the early 21st 
century, about 300 million people in China were learning English—which was 
about the same as the population of the United States. 
Many English-speaking corporations moved their call centers to India and 
the Philippines, where there were large numbers of fluent English speakers 
who would work for relatively low wages. As more people from other 
countries learned English, they spoke it in new ways. For example, Indian 
English included the word prepone , which meant the opposite of postpone .
682 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONGlobal Brands and Commerce  As multinational corporations advertised 
and distributed their products, global brands  such as Apple, Nike, and Rolex 
emerged. A company called Interbrand names the top global companies each 
year based on financial performance, ability to influence consumer choice, and 
ability to command a premium price. The 2018 winners included Toyota, which 
sells more cars than any other brand; tech giants Apple, Google, Amazon, 
Microsoft, and Facebook; and the company that famously announced its desire 
to “buy the world a Coke” in its 1971 multicultural commercial, Coca-Cola.
Online commerce  makes shopping a global affair as well. Sites such as 
Amazon (in more than 17 countries) and Alibaba (mostly in Asia) make a 
massive selection of items available. The online auction site eBay operates in 
30 different countries. Although their platform is international, these online 
retailers must pay a variety of sales taxes according to the laws of each country 
or state in which they sell products. (Connect: Write a paragraph comparing 
Americanization in the 21st century with assimilation in the 19th century.  
See Topic 6.3.)
*loEal ,nfluences on 3oSular Culture  Although the United States is still 
the dominant culture internationally, influences from other cultures have been 
welcomed in the United States and elsewhere. For example, Indian musicals 
made in Bollywood , the popular name given to the film industry in Bombay 
Mumbai, enjoy popularity worldwide. Bollywood itself is a blend of film 
styles. India makes more films than any other country. 
A style of Japanese hand-drawn animation known as anime  became hugely 
influential. In 2016, 60 percent of the world’s animated T9 shows were based 
on anime. Anime was introduced to American culture in the 1980s through the 
movie Akira. Television shows in the late 1990s, such as  Pokeman and Dragon 
Ball,  brought anime into the American mainstream.
Reggae music  from Jamaica  is global in both its origins and its popularity. 
It emerged in the 1960s, blending New Orleans jazz and rhythm and blues 
styles with mento, itself a fusion of African rhythms and European elements. 
It is associated with the Rastafari religion which promotes Pan-Africanism, the 
connectedness of all Africans whether they live in Africa or in the diaspora. 
It often blended with musical traditions of other countries as its popularity 
became global in the 1970s through the music of Bob Marley.
Another style of music that fused a variety of traditions and became a 
global hit was the Korean music nicknamed K-pop . Its artists, who sang in a 
mixture of Korean and English, became global stars in the early 21st century. 
Their popularity has also boosted the popularity of other South Korean exports. 
In fact they are considered so valuable that the government has invested 
in .-Pop concerts and tours. Internet-based streaming video  sites such as 
YouTube and 9imeo helped popularize .-Pop and other musical styles with a 
global audience.
Social Media and Censorship  Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and other 
forms of social media  changed communication. They can inspire but also 
manipulate, as attested to by Malala Yousafzai , the Pakistani activist and the 
youngest Nobel Prize laureate. People debated their power for good or ill.
683 GLOBALIZE D CULTUREIn some countries, such as China, the government banned social media 
from outside the country. However, China allowed its own forms of social 
media, including WeChat, Weibo, and YuKu. The government censored any 
criticism of the Communist Party that appeared on these platforms.
Global Culture in Sports  The globalization of popular culture included 
sports as well. The establishment of the modern Olympic Games  in 1896 
reflected an early sense of internationalism. In 2016, the Olympics in Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil, attracted about 3.6 billion viewers worldwide. 
Soccer emerged as the most popular sport in the world, in part because 
it required so little equipment that it could be played almost anywhere. The 
World Cup  soccer competition rivaled the Olympics as a global event. 
Basketball also became a global game, and players such as Michael Jordan and 
LeBron James became internationally known. In 2014, the National Basketball 
Association (NBA) included players from 30 countries or territories. In 2017, 
reporters from 35 countries covered the NBA Finals. In 2018, 27 percent of 
major league baseball players were foreign-born, from 21 different countries.
As sports became more popular globally, they also became more available 
to women. Some Muslim female athletes  —including fencers, weightlifters, 
beach volleyball players, hockey players, and figure skaters²competed while 
wearing hijab, known in English as a headscarf. They adapted athletic wear 
so they could compete while following traditional Muslim practices regarding 
female modesty in clothing. Hajar Abulfazi, a soccer player from Afghanistan, 
explained that she wore the hijab to “show the next generation and their parents 
how Afghan women and girls can maintain respect for religion and culture 
while pursuing sports achievements.”
Source:  Thinkstock
Since Olympic athletes represent their home nations, the games demonstrate the strength of 
nationalism. However, since the Olympics draws people together from nearly every country 
in the world, it is also an example of internationalism. 
684 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONGlobal Culture and Religion
Globalization promoted new religious developments. In the 1970s, former 
Beatles band member George Harrison released a song containing the words 
of a Hindu mantra, or sacred utterance. This launched the popularity of the 
Hari Krishna  movement, which was based on traditional Hindu scriptures. 
It quickly gained popularity in the United States and Europe. In what some 
called New Age  religions, forms of Buddhism, shamanism, Sufism, and other 
religious traditions were revived and adapted for a largely Western audience. 
In China in the 1990s, Falun Gong,  a movement based on Buddhist and 
Daoist traditions, gained popularity. Although the communist government 
allowed the movement at first, Chinese authorities began to restrict it in 1. 
The suppression prompted international protests against the Chinese regime 
for human rights abuses.
In the early 21st century, most people around the world identified with 
some form of religion. However, an increasing number of younger people in 
many countries identified as nonbelievers . They were not necessarily atheists 
(people who do not believe in any god) or agnostics (people who believe that 
it may not be possible to know if God exists. Most were simply not affiliated 
with any religious institution.

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that 
follows.
“Western leaders exploited the lure of their popular culture during the Cold 
War. They created radio and television stations such as Radio Free Europe 
Radio Liberty to broadcast as much popular culture material into the Soviet 
bloc as could be programmed. This programming was done to achieve the 
very purpose the Soviets accused it of: to westernize the values of those who 
watched or listened to it. . . . 
In using American pop culture as a tool of the Cold War, Western policymakers 
were exploiting what political scientist Joseph Nye has referred to as µsoft 
power.’ The notion of soft power refers to cultural, social, intellectual, and 
ideological ideas, values, attitudes, and behaviors that influence human life. 
Nye distinguishes these soft forms of power from µhard power,’ which is 
typically associated with the use of violent, coercive tools of social action like 
armies and economic sanctions. Soft power is a significant factor in global 
politics, Nye argues. . . . As such, it provides a way for one people—in the 
case of the Cold War, people in the political West—to change the attitudes 
and behaviors of other cultures without resorting to war or other forms of 
coercion.”

The globalization that began in about 1960 was actually the second 
wave of globalization. The first occurred between the years 180 and 
1914, engendered by the Industrial Revolution and the search for new 
markets and brought to a halt by the beginning of World War I.

Resistance to Globalization
The whole of the global economy is based on supplying the cravings of two 
percent of the world’s population. 
—Bill Bryson, nonÄction  writer (born 1951)
Essential Question:   What were the various responses to globalization from 
1900 to the present? 
While globalization of culture has in many ways raised awareness and 
appreciation of cultural diversity, the economics of globalization have led to 
serious concerns. Resistance to globalization has come from non-governmental 
and governmental sources. A network of opponents to economic globalization 
promotes equal distribution of economic resources, challenging the lopsided 
economy described above by author Bill Bryson. Participants contend that 
corporations and global financial institutions, such as the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF)  and the World Trade Organization (WTO) work to 
maximize profit and sacrifice safety and labor conditions, environmental 
conservation needs, and national independence. 
Some countries, such as North Korea, have resisted economic and cultural 
globalization. Others, such as Saudi Arabia and China, have resisted cultural 
globalization, particularly through controlling the internet. These countries want 
goods and money to flow freely among nations, but they are more restrictive of 
how people and ideas cross borders.
The Roots of Globalization and Anti-Globalization
Globalization affected the relationships among and within nations. After  
World War II, several organizations contributed to the growth of a global 
economy. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the European 
Economic Union, Mercosur (in South America), and the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) all formed between 1947 and the early 1990s. These 
organizations were meant to help economies and expand prosperity. Falling 
tariff rates eased the movement of goods across national borders. 
In 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO) took over GATT’s operations. 
The WTO makes rules for more than 90 percent of international trade. The 
rules and its closed board meetings led people to believe that the WTO did not 
care for their welfare. (Connect: Compare the economic practices of the 17th 
century to globalization in the 20th and 21st centuries. See Topic 4.5.)
689 RESISTANCE TO GLOBALIZATIONThe “Battle of Seattle”  In 1999, protests erupted at a WTO conference 
in Seattle. The WTO had planned a round of trade negotiations for the new 
millennium. Then more than 40,000 protesters arrived. Special interest groups, 
including labor unions, family farmers, student groups, and environmentalists 
shut down the WTO’s meeting and drew global attention to the issues of the 
new global economy. Anti-WTO demonstrations took place in dozens of other 
countries as well.
Many people consider the Seattle protests to be the beginning of the anti-
globalization movement. They were also one of the first social movements to 
be coordinated through the internet. However, the WTO itself remained 
powerful. China joined in 2001, increasing the group’s territorial and economic 
reach.

Seattle, Washington.  
Why Resist Globalization? 
Why did people protest globalization when it made goods and services more 
freely available? Opponents had different reasons. Many of them centered on 
the idea that consumers who buy products and services with a few clicks often 
have no idea who creates those products and services and what the short-term 
and long-term costs really are. A series of scandals in different parts of the 
world showed some of the hazards of globalization. Working conditions are 
especially problematic
• Much of the chocolate that consumers bought in the early 21st century 
had its origins in child labor  in West Africa. The largest chocolate 
companies missed deadlines in 2005, 2008, and 2010 to make sure 
their suppliers did not use child laborers. In 2015, the U.S. Department 
of Labor estimated that more than 2 million children took part in 
dangerous labor in the cocoa-growing regions of the world.
690 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• Working conditions in Western nations could also be harsh. In 2019, 
employees of Amazon ’s warehouses described such intense pressure 
to fulfill orders that workers risked being fired if they took a bathroom 
break. At the time, Amazon employed more than 600,000 people and 
another 100,000 at holiday time, though not all of them worked in 
warehouses. 
• In 2013, the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory , an eight-story 
building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, shocked the world. More than 1,000 
people died and another 2,500 suffered injuries. Most of the dead and 
injured were female garment workers who made clothing for Western 
companies. Muhammad Yunus , a Bangladeshi who won the Nobel 
Prize for Peace, called the disaster “a symbol of our failure as a 
nation.” He suggested that companies worldwide set an international 
minimum wage.
Source:  Wikimedia Commons
The Rana Plaza collapse is considered the deadliest structural failure accident in modern 
human history, and therefore also the deadliest garment-factory disaster in history.
Environmental Damage  Critics of globalization pointed out that the 
fuel involved in shipping products vast distances increased the amount of 
greenhouse gases in the environment, thus worsening the climate emergency. 
Also, in the early 21st century, Brazil cut down thousands of square miles of 
rainforest each year to make way for cattle farms. The meat was one of the 
country’s most valuable exports.
691 RESISTANCE TO GLOBALIZATIONProponents of globalization argue that it can help the environment. They 
point out that Costa Rica and other nations have developed ecotourism  
industries that make profits while showing off the country’s natural wonders.
Threats to National Sovereignty  Many liberal groups believe that 
globalization often harms children, workers, and the environment. However, 
many conservative groups also distrust globalization.
In 2016, 52 percent of British voters agreed to leave the European Union, 
an international political and economic organization of 28 countries. This 
British exit was nicknamed Brexit . Britain was a founding member of the EU 
in 1993, but conservative British politicians argued that the EU interfered with 
Britain’s right to govern itself. Many Brexit proponents contended that the EU 
required Britain to accept too many immigrants. 
Negotiations to leave the EU broke down when British prime minister 
Theresa May  was unable to craft a deal that was acceptable to her own political 
party, let alone to the other 27 nations in the EU. May resigned in 2019. Brexit 
critics believed that leaving the EU would be economically disastrous for 
Britain, an island nation that depended on imports.
Economic Resistance
Critics of globalization believe that international agreements and institutions 
can destroy small local businesses. Large corporations could use the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the WTO to achieve their goals, 
but local individuals and businesses could not. For example, many small 
businesses and individuals could not cross state lines or national borders. They 
could not extract the natural resources they needed or use the wide variety of 
labor sources that big corporations and transnational businesses used. In an 
attempt to combat globalization, some businesses, especially restaurants, have 
insisted on providing their customers locally grown or made products. 
Globalization critics also distrusted the World Bank, an international 
organization affiliated with the United Nations. The bank’s mission is to 
improve the economic development of member states. In 1988, about 20,000 
people protested meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in West Berlin. 
Protesters insisted that these agencies favored richer nations over poorer ones. 
In 2001 and 2002, anti-IMF and anti-World Bank protests took place in 23 
countries, including many of the world’s poorest nations. In 2014, the World 
Bank made reforms to its structure and governance, but critics maintained that 
the world’s richest nations controlled the bank.
What Measures Do Anti-Globalists Favor?  The anti-globalization 
movement has grown into a social movement as well. Its followers tend to 
focus on these issues:
• Human rights , which are basic freedoms that every person has, such 
as freedom from slavery and freedom to express opinions
692 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION• Fair trade , which is a system that ensures the person who provided the 
good or service receives a reasonable payment for it
• Sustainable development , which means business ventures that allow 
people and companies to make a profit without preventing future 
generations from meeting their own needs
• Debt relief  or debt restructuring  so that countries that owe huge sums 
to the IMF do not have to risk economic breakdown
Anti-Globalization and Social Media 
Anti-globalization activists have used the internet to perpetuate and spread 
their ideas in nearly every country on Earth. However, access to global 
communication through social media outlets has met resistance in some 
countries. In 2009, more than 1,000 rioters clashed with police in the city of 
Urumqi, China. The unrest resulted from tensions between members of the Han 
ethnicity and members of the Uighur  ethnicity, most of whom are Muslim. 
Chinese authorities blamed the riots on the growth of social unrest based on 
Twitter and Facebook and banned both platforms. The government introduced 
a new platform called Weibo  as a substitute. It could stream incoming posts 
while tracking and blocking “sensitive” content. Weibo has become a vehicle 
of negotiation between the Chinese government and its citizens.
In some other countries, governments allow social media platforms but 
influence or control their content. For example, critics contend that Saudi 
Arabian officials use Twitter and Facebook to harass and intimidate citizens. 
“If the same tools we joined for our liberation are being used to oppress us 
and undermine us, and used to spread fake news and hate, I’m out of these 
platforms,” explained Manal al-Sharif , a women’s rights activist. 
In some parts of the world, resistance to participating in an interconnected 
society persists. The coming together of economies and cultures threatens 
some people’s and governments’ sense of autonomy and identity.

694 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONSHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that 
follows.
“Critique of, and resistance to, the spread of consumer culture is as old as the 
emergence of consumer culture in the 18th century. Systematic critique of the 
institutional bases of consumer culture have been offered by social theorists 
that highlight the alienating dehumanizing effects of materialism, while 
others have commented on the envy, possessiveness, and non-generosity . . . 
consumer culture sometimes entails. . . .
Religious, environmentalist, nationalist, and anti-corporate critiques have 
emerged with considerable vigor. Many of these forms of resistance appear to 
be motivated by a global sense of anxiety about the risk to life and happiness 
provoked by the globalization of consumer culture itself. In one global 
study of global brands, the authors found µThirteen percent of consumers 
are skeptical that transnational companies deliver higher quality goods. They 
dislike brands that preach American values and don’t trust global companies 
to behave responsibly. Their brand preferences indicate that they try to avoid 
doing business with transnational firms.’”
Jagdish Sheth and Naresh Maholtra, “Global Consumer 
Culture” in Encyclopedia of International Marketing
(A) Identify ONE thinker from the 18th and 19th centuries who might 
have views consumer culture as described in the passage.
(B) Explain ONE reason some consumers avoid transnational firms, 
according to the authors.
(C) Explain ONE way in which globalization increased despite growing 
resistance in the late 20th century. 
2. Answer all parts of the question that follows. 
(A) Identify ONE example of a state government that resisted 
globalization after 1900. 
(B) Explain ONE social reason for resistance to globalization after 
1990.
(C) Explain ONE reason for resistance to global financial institutions 
after 1990.

Institutions Developing in a 
Globalized World
We have actively sought and are actively seeking to make the United Nations 
an eќecti]e instrument  of international  cooperation  
—Dean Acheson, U.S. diplomat, (1893–1971)
Essential Question:   How did globalization change international interactions 
between states after 1900?
In an era of increasing globalization, people formed international organizations 
to promote useful working relationships among nations. Dean Acheson, 
a U.S. secretary of state, described how the mission of the United Nations 
UN fit with this goal of maintaining world peace and making international 
cooperation easier. Working through agencies such as the IMF (International 
Monetary Fund) and the World Bank, the UN provides technical advice and 
loans to developing nations. Other international organizations and treaties, 
such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), promote free trade worldwide. However, the United 
Nations was born of the devastation of world wars and preventing conflict was 
its primary goal.
The United Nations: A Structure for Peace
Despite ideological differences, the Allies shared a commitment to preventing 
conflicts from escalating into war. In 1, representatives of the United 
States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China discussed the idea of the 
United Nations. The UN was born on October 24, 1945, a day still honored as 
United Nations Day. At its founding, there were 51 member states. By 2019, 
that number had grown to 193.
League of Nations vs. United Nations  Countries had tried to create a 
similar international organization previously. In 1920, at the end of World War  I, 
the Allied powers created the League of Nations. (See Topic 7.3.) Its purpose 
was to resolve international disputes and prevent another world war. However, 
the United States never joined the League. Some Americans believed that doing 
so would undercut U.S. authority. The League disbanded after it failed to prevent 
World War II. Countries hoped that a new, more powerful organization would 
697 INSTITUTION S DEVELO PING IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLDhelp keep the peace. This time around, all the major powers realized they would 
need to belong for the organization to have any chance of success. 
Assemblies of the United Nations
Within the UN, six main bodies implement its work.
• The General Assembly  is the only UN body in which all members 
have representation. It decides important questions on peace and 
security, admission of new members, and budget. To make a decision, 
a two-thirds majority of those present and voting must agree. Each 
member nation has one vote. 
• The Security Council acts on issues the General Assembly debates. 
It may even use military force against a country accused of violating 
UN principles. The Security Council has five permanent members, the 
leading Allies of World War II: the United States, France, Great Britain, 
Russia, and China. It elects 10 other members on a rotating basis. Each 
permanent members has veto power in the Security Council. Granting 
veto power to these five nations was controversial in 1945. Other 
nations resented giving them so much power. Conflicts among these 
five often prevented the UN from taking action to confront problems.
• The Secretariat  is the UN’s administrative arm.  The secretary 
general leads and influences the entire organization. He or she usually 
comes from a small, neutral nation so one of the more powerful 
countries cannot have an outsize influence on what the UN does. All 
five permanent members of the Security Council must approve the 
secretary general’s selection. Staffers of the Secretariat must take an 
oath of loyalty to the UN and are not allowed to receive instructions 
from their home countries.
• The International Court of Justice settles disputes countries bring 
to it about international law. The court has no power to enforce its 
decisions, but the Security Council may make recommendations or 
take action in response to a judgment. Most countries obey the court’s 
decisions. 
• The Economic and Social Council is the largest and most complex 
part of the UN. It directs economic, social, humanitarian, and cultural 
activities. In the early 21st century, the council promoted green energy 
and looked for ways to raise people’s wages in poorer countries.
• The Trusteeship Council supervised the governments of trust 
territories, including land that is now Israel, Papua New Guinea, 
and Nauru. The council’s mission was to help those areas become 
self-governing and independent. The last trust territory, Palau, 
became independent in 1994. Since then, the council has suspended 
its operations. Some people have suggested that the council should 
become trustees of the seafloor or of outer space. 
698 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONThe UN and Human Rights
One of the goals of the United Nations was the promotion of human rights. 
The UN adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  in 1948. It 
included several basic rights and freedoms:
• freedom from slavery, torture, and degrading punishment
• equality before the law
• the right to a nationality
• the right to own property, either individually or with others
• freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion, and expression
• equal pay for equal work
• the right to rest and to enjoy paid holidays
• equal rights for children born within and outside of marriage
• the right to adequate food, clothing, shelter, health care, and education
The declaration was a milestone achievement. Individuals from different 
countries, cultures, and legal traditions came together to draft a document that 
set standards for all governments and all people. People have translated the 
declaration into more than 500 languages. Since 1948, the UN has investigated 
abuses of human rights, such as genocide, war crimes, government oppression, 
and crimes against women.
Keeping the Peace
Since the end of World War II, the United Nations has been well known 
for its peacekeeping  actions. Of primary importance is prevention through 
diplomacy. The UN sends special envoys to help resolve problems peacefully, 
mindful that it was formed to prevent “the scourge of war.”
The organization has also frequently sent peacekeeping forces, consisting 
of civilians, police, and troops from member countries, to try to ease tensions 
in trouble spots. The first peacekeeping mission was related to the 18 Arab-
Israeli conflict in Palestine. After that, UN peacekeepers served in the Congo, 
Lebanon, East Timor, and the Balkans. 
Expansion in the 1990s  In 188, the UN had only five active peacekeeping 
operations. By 1993, it had 28. Individual countries supplied soldiers to form 
UN peacekeeping forces. They came from dozens of countries—including 
Canada, Venezuela, Ukraine, Egypt, and Bangladesh. The soldiers were 
usually lightly armed and instructed to return fire only if attacked.
In the 1990s, the United Nations sent peacekeeping missions to hotspots 
in Africa, Central America, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. In Africa, UN 
troops kept peace while Namibia changed from a South African colony to an 
independent state. Peacekeeping troops helped end devastating civil wars in 
699 INSTITUTION S DEVELO PING IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLDMozambique, El Salvador, and Cambodia. In Haiti, they maintained peace 
while a democratic government replaced a military dictatorship.
Some efforts failed. In 1994, UN peacekeepers could not prevent massacres 
in Rwanda. In 1995, UN forces withdrew from Somalia while a civil war raged 
there. The struggle to bring order to Bosnia in the former Yugoslavia took 
years and had mixed results. As a UN officer in Bosnia observed, “It’s much 
easier to come in and keep peace when there’s some peace around.”
Challenges for Peacekeeping Missions  One problem faced by UN 
peacekeepers has been their slow response. By the time countries agree on 
the UN mission and send forces, the war might have grown and become hard 
to control. A second problem happens when people expect the peacekeeping 
troops to stop the fighting instead of simply monitoring a truce, running 
free elections, and providing supplies to civilian populations. By 2019, the 
United Nations was involved in fewer but larger peacekeeping missions. The 
number of missions had dropped to 15, but the number of troops involved had 
increased .

700 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONOther UN Priorities
In addition to assemblies and peacekeeping, the UN has other missions.
Protecting Refugees  The UN also protects refugees. In times of war, 
famine, and natural disasters, people often flee their country and seek 
refuge in a safer location. Working through partners such as NGOs (non-
governmental organizations) and the agency of UNHCR (United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees), the UN provides food, medicine, and temporary 
shelter. Among the earliest refugees the UN helped were Palestinians who fled 
the disorder following the UN partition of Palestine to create the state of Israel 
in 18. In 201, the UN helped refugees who fled 9enezuela and Myanmar.
Feeding the Hungry  In 1961, the UN established its World Food 
Program (WFP)  to provide food aid. Its first missions were in Iran, Thailand, 
and Algeria in 162. Since its founding, the WFP has fed more than 1. billion 
people, many of whom were affected by natural disasters or political unrest.
Supporting Education, Science, and Culture  Fighting in World War  II 
destroyed schools, libraries, and museums in many European countries. In 
1945, the UN created the 8niteG 1ations (Gucational Scientific anG 
Cultural  Organization (UNESCO) . After repairing war damage, UNESCO 
began to focus on developing literacy, extending free education, and protecting 
cultural and environmental sites by designating them World Heritage Sites. 
The United Kingdom, Singapore, Israel, and the United States have all left 
UNESCO in disputes over politics and priorities. Although the UK and 
Singapore rejoined the organization, as of 2019 the United States had not. 
Other UN Missions  The UN also created the World Health Organization, 
which improves human health by controlling epidemics and providing 
vaccines. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) was created to help 
children after World War II. After that, the fund provided aid to children in 
the developing world and at disaster sites. The UN program Human Rights 
Watch (HRW)  has monitored human rights abuses in 100 countries. HRW 
uses the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as its guide and advocates 
for policies that prevent abuses.
The Global Goals  In 2015, the UN General Assembly set 17 goals to 
accomplish by 2030. These included wiping out hunger and poverty, achieving 
gender equality, ensuring clean water and sanitation for all, and fighting 
climate change. On this project, the UN worked with NGOs, including the 
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (Connect: Evaluate the success of the 
United Nations in handling political crises compared to its success in dealing 
with other priorities. See Topic 8.5.)
International Financial NGOs
Several NGOs have worked closely with the United Nations on economic 
issues. Each NGO was independent and caused controversy. 
701 INSTITUTION S DEVELO PING IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLDThe World Bank  Created in 1944, the World Bank fought poverty by 
providing loans to countries. It first focused on dams and roads. Later it expanded 
its mission to social projects, such as education and disease prevention. Critics 
charged that the World Bank often ignored how its projects damaged the 
environment and local culture. For example, a dam might permanently flood 
many farms. A highway might promote growth, but the resulting profits might 
all go to investors overseas rather than people living in the region.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF)  Created in 1945, the IMF  
was designed to help a country’s economy by promoting stable currency 
exchange rates. It focused on making short-term loans and providing economic 
advice to countries. Some economists argued that conditions on IMF loans 
failed to take into account each country’s individual needs. Large, wealthy 
nations influenced the IMF. It acted on their behalf, critics insisted, even while 
it claimed to help developing nations. 
The IMF and the World Bank worked together to create Pathways for 
Peace in 2018. This report described how countries could work together to 
prevent violent conflicts.
NGOs Separate from the UN
Although the UN is well funded and powerful, other NGOs also help maintain 
world peace and improve communication among countries during a time of 
globalization. For example, the International Peace Bureau  was founded in 
181 and won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 110. It began working for nuclear 
disarmament in the 1980s. It also lobbied governments to reduce military 
spending. By 2019, it had 300 member organizations in 70 countries. The chart 
on the next page lists other international organizations committed to peace and 
cooperation.

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question  
that follows. 
“Whatever the international tensions and the UN shortcomings, the existence 
of the United Nations as an institution for all countries created a sense of being 
part of a world-wide community and helped develop a global consciousness. 
For developing countries, the United Nations provided a political arena and 
spearheaded their struggle for decolonization and political emancipation, 
engendering a feeling of empowerment and importance, and providing a 
means of participating on the world stage as equals. . . . 
The norms and standards set by the United Nations specialized agencies 
have enriched life, both nationally and internationally. The smaller and more 
technical specialized agencies like the International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the International 
Civil Aviation Organization ICAO, the Universal Postal Union UPU, etc. 
have, through their standards and regulatory regimes, helped in maintaining 
international order in such diverse areas as meteorology, communications, 
aviation, etc. Successive global conferences convened by United Nations 
organizations have helped to identify and focus global attention on new 
problems relating to such issues as environment, population, energy, science 
and technology, food and nutrition and women’s place and role in society and 
social development in general.”

705 INSTITUTION S DEVELO PING IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLDTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:   C OMPARE TWO ARG UMENTS ON THE 
UNITE D NATION S
Is the United Nations still relevant? That was the question posed in 2006 
by the University of Pennsylvania Law Review as part of its Debate 
series. Two law professors participated in the written debate. Excerpts 
from their conflicting answers to that question appear below.
Read the following two statements on the United Nations. Explain in 
your own words the gist of each one. Then compare the arguments 
and write a few sentences summari]ing the differences Eetween them
“The UN offers . . . the possibility for wide, and sometimes even 
universal, participation in the creation of the legal rules that regulate 
international affairs. Every state is represented at the UN and can 
be included in the processes of international lawmaking. While 
it is true that bilateral or regional agreements may result in deeper 
levels of commitment—greater synergies of interests are likely to 
be found amongst smaller numbers of states—the challenges and 
dangers the global community faces today demand the near universal 
participation in legal regimes made most possible through the UN. 
Whether international law seeks to regulate the Internet, respond to 
global warming, combat international terrorism, or address pandemic 
diseases, the exclusion or defection of only a small number of states 
may well render the broader enterprise of legalization worthless. 
A handful of serious polluters, a few safe havens for terrorists, or 
even one epicenter of disease outbreak may well undermine an 
otherwise global legal regime. The UN, with its broad reach, its all-
encompassing membership, and its agenda-setting potential may well 
be the best (and perhaps the only) hope for developing universal legal 
regimes that can effectively respond to these new challenges.”
William Burke-White, University of Pennsylvania 
Law School2. Answer all parts of the question that follows. 
(A) Identify ONE way in which international interactions affected 
human rights issues in the late 20th century.
(B) Identify ONE way in which globalization changed international 
interactions in the late 20th century. 
(C) Explain ONE way in which an international organization, other 
than the UN, furthered international cooperation in maintaining 
world peace in the late 20th century. 
706 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITION“Professor Burke-White points to various global problems²WMD 
[weapons of mass destruction] proliferation, terrorism, infectious 
disease, and the like. He does not claim that perfect solutions may 
be found for these problems . . . He argues only that no international 
institution can take certain kinds of lawmaking steps regarding these 
issues better than the UN. He shows that the UN has taken many 
such lawmaking steps and that proponents hope that such steps will 
lead to reducing the net harm produced by these problems. He thus 
concludes that the UN is “urgently needed.” Nowhere does he actually 
demonstrate that these lawmaking steps actually reduce the net harm 
produced by the problems. Indeed, if one looks at the actual examples 
cited by Professor Burke-White, it seems clear that the UN has not 
had a positive effect at all.
“Despite an impressive outpouring of words, the UN has done little 
effectively to address the problems mentioned by Professor Burke-
White—like terrorism prevention, global climate change, and 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction—and in some ways has 
even exacerbated them. The UN has done nothing to prevent North 
Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons, and it seems highly unlikely 
that the UN will do anything effective to prevent Iran from completing 
its plans to obtain such weapons. The UN has played a useful role in 
collecting some kinds of information about Al Qaeda, but has actually 
undermined other antiterror efforts.”

CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE  IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLD707

Continuity and Change  
in a Globalized World
;oday, no country can e]er truly cut itself oќ from the global media or from 
external sources of information; trends that start in one corner of the world  
are rapidly replicated thousands of miles away . . .
—-rancis  -uRuyama,  political scientist (born 1952)
Essential Question:   How did science, technology, politics, justice, 
transportation, communication, and the environment 
change and stay the same after 1900?
One perspective shared by many scholars is that the 20th and 21st centuries 
were periods of unprecedented change. One factor in bringing about this 
transformation was the pace of discovery in science and the number of 
technological achievements made since the turn of the 20th century. These 
scientific and technological advancements led to changes in society, politics, 
economics, culture, and the environment. While many outcomes of these 
advancements were positive, they also included some unintended consequences 
that had negative impacts. Responses to these outcomes were varied.
Advances in Science and Technology
People made significant advances in understanding the universe and the natural 
world. These included:
The Origin of the Universe  Several scientific theories tried to determine 
how the universe began. One of the best-known and best-supported theories 
was the Big Bang . This theory, that the universe started with one single cosmic 
event, led to a better understanding of the universe as well as atomic and 
subatomic science.
Wave Science  Discoveries extended human knowledge and use of radio, 
light, sound, and microwaves. These breakthroughs led to improvements in 
radio and cellular communications as well as faster internet service. 
Medical Science  Experts made discoveries about germs, viruses, 
diseases, and the human body. These discoveries led to cures or vaccines for 
common diseases such as polio, tuberculosis, and tetanus. Experts pioneered 
708 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONnew treatments for chronic diseases such as cancer and arthritis. The discovery 
of antibiotics, such as penicillin, helped people recover from or prevent 
infections. Reliable methods of birth control allowed women to control the 
size of their families. These and other medical advancements meant that 
people could live longer and better lives.
Energy Technologies  Inventors and entrepreneurs made advancements 
in extracting and producing oil. Nuclear power  became a significant source of 
energy. Renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, and thermal energy, 
became much cheaper to produce. In 2018, the International Renewable Energy 
Agency predicted that renewable energy sources would be consistently cheaper 
than fossil fuels by 2020. The increase in sources of power led to increased 
productivity, greater production of material goods, and faster transportation.
Communication Technologies  In the 20th century, radio and television 
technology was further developed and telephone coverage increased so that 
most people eventually had a telephone in their homes. Internet communication 
and cell phones then replaced the older systems of communication. As a result, 
the amount and extent of mass communications increased, as did the global 
transfer of information.
Source:  Wikimedia Commons (Left), Getty Images (Right). 
Technology advanced from voice communication over wires to massive amounts of data 
available almost anywhere.
709 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLD Transportation Technologies  Airplanes were invented in the first years 
of the 20th century. Later, jet airplanes closed the distance between regions of 
the world. Shipping technology improved, with faster and larger ships carrying 
prefabricated shipping containers. These ships and planes could transport more 
goods farther and faster than ever before. Improved transportation technology 
resulted in the expansion of the global trade network and interactions among 
cultures.
Agricultural Technologies  Scientists produced genetically modified 
crops that were more resistant to drought and disease and had higher yields. 
The most significant effect of these advances, known as the Green Revolution, 
was higher population growth rates, especially within developing countries. 
Another effect was the decline in biodiversity, as these genetically modified 
crops began to be cultivated at the expense of local crop types.
Changes in a Globalized World
Partly as a result of the advances in science and technology, the world 
experienced a number of significant changes to societies, economies, politics, 
cultures, and the environment. 
Social Changes  During this period, the world’s population grew faster 
than at any previous time in history. The increase in population meant increasing 
challenges to existing social orders. The greatest growth rate in population 
occurred in developing countries, while developed countries saw a slowing of 
their population growth. In the developing countries, the population growth 
rate was largest in the lower socioeconomic classes. Improvements in 
communication and transportation made it easier for people to migrate from 
less developed countries to more developed ones. That led to a “brain drain” 
in some countries as more highly educated and skilled people left their home 
countries to find jobs elsewhere. 
Girls and women in this era began to experience an increase in 
socioeconomic status, especially in the more developed countries. Women 
in these societies began to enter careers traditionally reserved for men. 
Their right to vote in elections was finally legalized, and in some cases w 
omen held the highest political offices in their nations. Because birth 
control allowed women to make choices, fertility declined in developed 
countries. Some women chose to put off having children until later in life  
or decided to not have children at all. In some countries, though, women 
saw little improvement in their status as societies resisted the change that 
was happening elsewhere. (Connect: Analyze changes in the practice 
of birth control from the mid-20th century to the early 21st century.  
 See Topic 9.5.)
Economic Changes  The trend toward economic globalization that 
started in the 1th century intensified during the 20th and 21st centuries. More 
developed nations continued to exploit less developed areas of the world, 
harvesting their raw materials and using the less developed areas as markets 
for finished goods. However, significant changes to the world economic 
710 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONorder took place. While the West, and especially the United States, was still 
a dominant economic force in the world economy, its superiority was being 
challenged by new sources of economic strength. Governments in Japan, Hong 
Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore began policies that led to economic 
growth. These policies started the trend of Asian economies, which relied on 
inexpensive labor and high-quality manufacturing, competing against the 
Western economies to make consumer goods and high-tech products. Because 
of the modernization policies established after the death of Mao Zedong, which 
relaxed government control, China eventually became the second-largest 
economy in the world after the United States and a major exporter of goods to 
the rest of the world. India became an economic powerhouse by developing a 
labor force that specialized in software development and engineering.

711 CONTIN UITY AND CHANGE IN A GLOBALIZE D WORLD Political Changes  Mass protest movements helped bring about political 
and social change. Demonstrations in India showed how to effectively use 
nonviolent resistance and win social and political change.  Activists championed 
civil rights in the United States, Northern Ireland, Canada, and other countries. 
Anti-war protests erupted in the United States and Western Europe. Women’s 
rights movements emerged in the Western democracies and spread across the 
globe. Protests against the system of apartheid brought an end to racial 
segregation in South Africa. Democracy movements led to political protests 
and revolutions in North Africa and the Middle East called the “Arab Spring.” 
Source:  Wikimedia Commons
Tahrir Square was the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution against former president Hosni 
Mubarak and his policies of police brutality. Over 1 million gathered in Tahrir Square on February 9, 2011, 
demanding the removal of the regime and for Mubarak to resign. 
Governments were sometimes slow to respond to these calls for change. In 
some cases, they persecuted, imprisoned, or attacked the protesters. 
During this time period, governments also began to play a larger role in 
managing or regulating their nations’ economies. This increased government 
intervention in the economy was a change from the free-market, or laissez-
faire, economics practiced in the previous era. 
Cultural Changes  Once information (and people) could quickly spread 
across the globe, the pace of cultural interactions and exchanges intensified. 
People all over the world consumed Western culture, particularly aspects that 
originated in the United States, in the form of movies, television shows, and 
music. Fashion styles that appeared in one area of the world quickly were 
imitated and adopted in other regions. A consumer culture spread.
712 WORLD HISTORY MODERN : AP® EDITIONOne significant change in the process of cultural exchanges from the 
previous era was that these exchanges were often a two-way street. For 
instance, while global audiences watched Hollywood movies, cuisine from 
China, Japan, India, and Latin America often found its way to the plates of 
Americans and Europeans. Music and art from East Asia found a loyal fan 
base in the United States. The Internet helped increase the rate and scope 
of these transfers, and advances in cellular technology made even the most 
remote areas on Earth accessible to these cultural exchanges.
Environmental Changes  In the 20th and 21st centuries, humans 
attempted to overcome the challenges of their environment in many new ways. 
With jet airplanes, travel between points on the globe was measured in hours 
rather than in days, months, or years. New technologies in petroleum extraction 
meant that sources of energy were cheaper and more abundant than previously 
imagined. The Space Age broke the terrestrial limits placed on humans by 
their environment, and space exploration became possible. 
However, although humans overcame some challenges, they also harmed 
the environment. Airborne pollution increased as factories, automobiles, 
and homes got their power from carbon-based fuels. Water pollution also 
increased as people and companies dumped waste in rivers, lakes, and oceans. 
Debates about the sources and causes of climate change developed as average 
temperatures around the globe increased, polar ice caps began to melt, and 
more intense and catastrophic weather events occurred. 
REFLECT ON THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION
1. Continuity and Change  In 1919, economist John Maynard Keynes 
wrote: 
“What an extraordinary episode in the progress of man that age was 
which came to an end in August 1914! . . . The inhabitant of London 
could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various 
products of the whole earth . . . he could at the same time and by the same 
means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprise 
of any quarter of the world . . . he could secure forthwith, if he wished it, 
cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate . . . .” 
 This review topic emphasizes changes. Use Keynes’s description of life 
in 1914 as a starting point for noting continuities since 1900 as well. 
Consider such areas as technology, globalization, relation of developed 
to developing nations, status of women, and cultural exchange. 
2. In one to three paragraphs, explain how science, technology, politics, 
justice, transportation, communication, and the environment changed 
and stayed the same after 1900.

UNIT 9 REVIEW
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:   WHAT HAPPENS TOMORRO W?
One reason people study the past is to provide insight into the future. 
And even though predictions are risky, people continue to make them. 
Optimism After Communism  Inspired by the fall of the Soviet 
Union, some intellectuals felt hopeful. In his provocatively titled 1992 
book, The End of History and the Last Man , Francis Fukuyama posited 
that history as people knew it was over. He argued that democracy was 
the ideal form of government and capitalism was the best economic 
system, and they were spreading throughout the world. Eventually, all 
countries would adopt them, and the political and economic conflicts 
that had driven wars in the past would vanish. Critics of Fukuyama 
argued he was wrong, just as Karl Marx had been in the 19th century 
when he also argued that people were entering the final phase of history. 
Cultural Conflict  One of Fukuyama’s former teachers, Samuel 
Huntington, rejected the entire end-of-history argument. In response, 
he wrote 7he &lash of &ivili]ations and the 5emaNing of :orld 2rder  
16. While Fukuyama was influenced by the end of the rivalry 
between the United States and the Soviet Union, Huntington was struck 
by the increasing tensions around religion and culture. He contended that 
people’s beliefs and affiliations would draw the fault lines for conflicts in 
the post-Cold War world. Huntington cited several examples of cultural 
conflict, including Hindu and Muslim tensions in India and the rise of 
Islamic fundamentalism and its hostility toward Western culture. 
Cultural Understanding  Critics asserted that Huntington’s 
generalizations were oversimplified and reflected a pro-Western 
prejudice. One of these critics is Nobel prize-winning economist 
Amartya Sen. In his 2006 work, Identities and Violence: The Illusion of 
Destiny,  Sen rejected Huntington’s suggestion that people of different 
beliefs and ethnic groups could not get along, pointing to the existence 
of peaceful diverse societies around the world. Further, as globalization 
spread through all parts of life, people found many ways to identify 
themselves in the 21st century besides by religion and ethnicity.
Hope in Technology  Debates over the post-Cold War world 
began before the Internet and smartphones were common. By 2011, 
technology was connecting people around the globe. When physicist 
Michio Kaku published Physics of the Future (2011), he was optimistic 
that technology and trade could break down the cultural barriers. He 
held out hope for material abundance and greater peace.

Historical Background
Developing nations are generally described as countries with a less 
developed industrial base; low levels of safe drinking water, sanitation, 
and hygiene; high levels of pollution; and widespread poverty. Developed 
nations are generally described as countries with advanced technological 
infrastructure and developed economies; better educational opportunities; 
greater wealth of the people; and higher living standards.

Two hundred years after the discovery of vaccine by the English physician 
Edward Jenner, immunization can be credited with saving approximately 
9 million lives a year worldwide.  . . So far only one disease, smallpox, 
has been eradicated by vaccines, saving approximately 5 million lives 
annually.  . . Polio could be next.  . . If the year 2000 goal of eradicating 
polio is achieved, the United States will be able to save the $270 million a 
year that is currently spent on polio vaccination. The savings for Western 
European countries will amount to about $200 million a year.  . .In all, 
vaccines have brought seven major human diseases under some degree 
of control - smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever, whooping cough, 
polio, and measles. Most of the vaccines now in use have been available for 
several decades, but only in the last 15 years has protection been extended 
to the majority of children in the developing world. Only about a quarter 
were being immunized when, in the mid-1980s, UNICEF and WHO called 
for a new commitment to regularly reaching 80% of infants by 1990. In 
most nations, that goal was reached and has since been sustained - saving 
over 3 million young lives each year. As frequent disease is also a major 
cause of malnutrition, immunization is also helping to protect the normal 
growth of millions of children.

the Rich and Poor,” Scientific American, 2016.
Life expectancy worldwide has risen for decades. But more people are 
living more years with debilitating [weakening] ailments, according 
to a new study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in 
Seattle. In developed countries, the trouble comes almost entirely from 
noncommunicable [not transmitted directly from one person to another] 
conditions such as heart and lung disease and back pain—ills typically 
associated with lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise. In developing 
nations, however, the prevalence of these ailments is increasing rapidly, 
even as those countries continue to try to stamp out communicable diseases 
such as diarrhea and malaria that have plagued them for a long time. If 
developing nations are clever, though, they can create health policies that 
impede the new threats and keep reducing the old ones.

on Aging, in the article “We are living longer than ever. But are we living 
better?” 2017.
For the first time in history, residents of high-, middle-, and low-income 
countries are likely to live to 60 years of age and beyond. Longevity [long 
life] is one of the greatest achievements of our modern era—the United 
Nations calls it one of the most significant social transformations of the 
21st century.  . . According to the World Health Organization’s World 
Report on Aging and Health, we still have a way to go. While we may be 
living longer, older individuals are not necessarily living healthier, more 
active lives. The report shines a light on the need for governments around 
the world to develop policies and programs to better meet the health and 
social care needs of citizens throughout their lives.  . . Population aging is a 
major concern for many governments around the world, but perhaps even 
more so for those whose populations are projected to be among the oldest 
in 2050, such as Japan, South Korea, and Germany. According to a global 
study conducted by the Pew Research Center, achieving an adequate 
standard of living in old age is directly influenced by the extent to which 
a country’s population is expected to age healthfully. Improving quality 
of life and functional ability among older people must be geared toward 
helping them effectively manage chronic diseases and complex coexisting 
conditions. By their very nature, these conditions—heart disease, diabetes, 
and chronic obstructive pulmonary [relating to the lungs] disease, to name 
a few—place a burden on individuals, their families, and health systems.

The Conversation , a magazine based on academic research, 2017.
Each year, 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of the illness occurs around the 
world, leading to between 21,000 to 143,000 deaths. About two-thirds 
of these are in developing countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Cholera is.  . . transmitted through contaminated water or food in areas 
with poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water. Cholera is referred 
to as a disease of poverty because of the lack of social development in 
the areas in which it occurs. The constant threat of natural catastrophes 
such as flooding and man-made ones including civil unrest, make the 
management and prevention of cholera a huge challenge in most of 
Africa. Several conditions on the continent make it fertile ground for the 
emergence and rapid spread of cholera. These include: Inadequate access 
to clean water and sanitation facilities, especially in peri-urban slums, 
where basic infrastructure isn’t available. Camps for internally displaced 
persons or refugees, where minimum requirements of clean water and 
sanitation have not been met.  . . Other humanitarian crises including 
flooding and earthquakes, civil unrest or war that causes disruption of 
water and sanitation systems.  . . But generally the lack of comprehensive 
programs for improvement of general public health especially for 
vulnerable populations like refugees and informal settlement residents is a 
challenge.  . . The increase in population, especially in urban.  . . settlements, 
has been exponential over the last two decades posing a major challenge 
for public health as more people flock to the cities in search of jobs.  . . On 
top of this a lack of political maturity in many African countries as well 
as greed for political power has led to civil unrest and chaos which in turn 
has resulted in internal displacements of huge populations.  . . There are 
recommended vaccines that can minimize the spread of cholera. But they 
are rarely used as for most governments this not a priority. Vaccines can 
prevent up to 65% of vulnerable populations from getting cholera.

news and opinion website and blog, 2018.
More than 1 billion people worldwide are infected with diseases of 
poverty. These conditions disproportionately afflict the world’s poorest, 
either in the developing world, or in developed countries with extreme 
inequality. Though well-known conditions such as HI9AIDS and 
malaria are considered diseases of poverty, many of the other illnesses 
that primarily strike the world’s poorest are lesser-known and frequently 
misunderstood. The World Health Organization has designated about 20 
of these conditions as “neglected tropical diseases.” This diverse array 
of conditions—such as leprosy, dengue, Chagas, and elephantiasis, to 
name a few—don’t attract the global media attention or funding that 
certain wide-ranging tropical diseases, such as malaria, have garnered 
in recent years. Neglected diseases cost developing economies billions of 
dollars annually and lock sufferers into a cycle of poverty that is nearly 
impossible to escape.High Income Moderate Income Low IncomeIncome Group

PART A: MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Directions:  Each of the questions or incomplete statements below is  
followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is 
best in each case.
Questions 1 and 2 refer to the passage below.
“I will give you my father’s words just as I received them; royal griots 
[storytellers] do not know what lying is. . . . Fear enters the heart of him 
who does not know his destiny, whereas Sundiata knew that he was striding 
towards a great destiny. . . . There is one that will make a great king. He forgets 
nobody. . . . In the same way as light preceded the sun, so the glory of Sundiata, 
overleaping the mountains, shed itself on all the Niger plain. . . . The arms 
of Sundiata had subdued all the countries of the savanna. . . . With Sundiata 
peace and happiness entered Niani. . . . Every king wants to have a singer to 
perpetuate his memory, for it is the griot who rescues the memories of kings 
from oblivion, as men have short memories. . . . The prophets did not write and 
their words have been all the more vivid as a result. . . . But whoever knows the 
history of a country can read its future. . . . Kings are only men, and whatever 
iron cannot achieve against them, words can.”
Epic of Sundiata, the story of the founding of the Mali Empire
1. Which of the following best describes the most likely purpose of telling

justified
(B) To prove that words matter more than deeds
(C) To compare him to the current ruler of the Mali Empire
(D) To assess his positive qualities and his flaws
2. The best evidence to support the claim in the excerpt that Sundiata 
“was striving towards a great destiny” is that Mali became

(C) a kingdom of prosperous Muslim farmers
(D) wealthy from trans-Saharan trade conducted by Muslims
AP® World History Practice Exam
723 AP® WORLD HISTORY PRACTICE EXAMQuestions 3 and 4 refer to the passage below.
“South-eastern China was also the chief centre [center] of porcelain production, 
although china [Chinese] clay is found also in North China. The use of porcelain 
spread more and more widely. The first translucent porcelain made its appearance, 
and porcelain became an important article of commerce both within the country and 
for export. Already the Muslim rulers of Baghdad around 800 used imported Chinese 
porcelain, and by the end of the fourteenth century porcelain was known in Eastern 
Africa. Exports to South-East Asia and Indonesia, and also to Japan gained more and 
more importance in later centuries. Manufacture of high-quality porcelain calls for 
considerable amounts of capital investment and working capital; small manufacturers 
produce too many second-rate pieces thus we have here the first beginnings of an 
industry that developed industrial towns such as Ching-te, in which the majority of the 
population were workers and merchants, with some 10,000 families alone producing 
porcelain. Yet, for many centuries to come, the state controlled the production and 
even the design of porcelain and appropriated most of the production for use at court 
or as gifts.”
Wolfram Eberhard, A History of China , 1969
3. Which of the following conclusions about porcelain is best supported 
by the passage?
(A) People in the Middle East preferred luxury items made in Persia.
(B) Proto-industrialization in the manufacture of luxury goods led to 
urbanization in China.
(C) Much of the porcelain manufacturing industry in China was 
controlled by foreign merchants.
(D) Japan was a leading consumer of Chinese porcelain in the 1300s.
4. What development most aided the growth in the labor supply needed 
for the increasing production of porcelain and other manufactured 
goods?
(A) The use of the magnetic compass and other transportation 
improvements enabled peasants to travel to Chinese cities more 
easily.
(B) The invention of inexpensive paper created an easier way to 
communicate and to advertise for job openings in the porcelain 
factories.
(C) The spread of gunpowder weapons allowed landlords to force 
rebellious peasants to end their revolts and move into the cities to 
work in porcelain factories.
(D) The changes in agriculture, including the introduction of a 
fast-growing variety of rice known as champa, increased food 
production.

“Apart from his navigational skills, what most set Columbus apart from other 
Europeans of his day were not the things that he believed, but the intensity 
with which he believed in them and the determination with which he acted 
upon those beliefs. . . . Columbus was, in most respects, merely an especially 
active and dramatic embodiment of the European—and especially the Medi -
terranean—mind and soul of his time: a religious fanatic obsessed with the 
conversion, conquest, or liquidation of all non-Christians; a latter-day crusader 
in search of personal wealth and fame, who expected the enormous and mys -

forests, and with golden people living in Eden.”

“Montezuma, who with one of his sons and many other chiefs who had been 
captured at the beginning, was still a prisoner, asked to be carried to the roof of 
the fort where he could speak to the captains and the [Aztec] people, and cause 
the war to cease. I had him taken there, and when he reached the parapet on the 
top of the fort, intending to speak to the people who were fighting there, one 
of his own subjects struck him on the head with a stone with such force that 
within three days he died. I then had him taken out, dead as he was, by two of 
the Indian prisoners, who bore him away to his people; but I do not know what 
they did with him.”

right do they then use the poisonous drug to injure the Chinese people? Even 
though the barbarians may not necessarily intend to do us harm, yet in coveting 
profit to an extreme, they have no regard for injuring others. Let us ask, where 
is your conscience? I have heard that the smoking of opium is very strictly 
forbidden by your country; that is because the harm caused by opium is clearly 
understood. Since it is not permitted to do harm to your own country, then even 
less should you let it be passed on to the harm of other countries—how much

“Even in interpreting the psychology of the worker of the transitional period, 
Marx exhibited a rationalistic bias. The worker’s opposition to the capital -
ist order is a total opposition to its laws, its factories, and its government. 
But this revolutionary consciousness of the worker is to take him next to  
Marxist socialism, where he will accept the factory system and the state, the only 
difference being the abolition of capitalism. Why shouldn’t the revolutionary 
protest of the worker flow into other channels: into rejection of industrialism as

“It is widely stated that . . . if only the [government would] permit trade there

“The absolute equality of races, physical, political and social, is the founding stone 
of World Peace and human advancement. . . . The beginning of Wisdom in interracial 
contact is the establishment of political institutions among suppressed Peoples. The 
habit of democracy must be made to encircle the earth. . . . Surely . . . there can be found 
in the civilized world enough of altruism, learning and benevolence to develop native 
institutions for the native’s good rather than continuing to allow the majority of mankind 
to be brutalized and enslaved. . . .
It is to the shame of the world that today the relations between the main groups of 
mankind and their mutual estimate and respect is determined chiefly by the degree in 
which one can subject the other to its service,—enslaving labor, making ignorance 
compulsory, uprooting ruthlessly religion and custom and destroying government so 
that the favored few may luxuriate in the toil of the tortured many. . . . It is shameful, 
irreligious, unscientific and undemocratic that the estimate that half the peoples of the 
earth put on the other half, depends mainly on their ability to squeeze money out of 
them.”

739 AP® WORLD HISTORY PRACTICE EXAMQuestions 41 to 43 refer to the passage below.
“We are making out a full and detailed report but it takes time to collate the enormous 
amount of information which we have collected. The trouble started early on the 
morning of the 16th and both sides were equally responsible. The Hindus started 
putting up barricades at Tala Bridge and Belgachia Bridge and other places to prevent 
Muslims processions coming into the town and Muslims goondas [gang members] 
went round forcing Hindus to close their shops. As previously mentioned in my D.O. 
[daily orders]  of the 15th the air was electric and this caused crowds to gather, lathis 
[heavy stick used as a weapon by Indian police] were produced and in no time North 
Calcutta was a scene of mob riot. By 1100 hours there were brick bat fights all over 
North Calcutta. . . .
Soon after midnight on the 16/17th these gangs fought out the most desperate battles, 
murder and butchery of a worst type were carried on in the side lanes and byways of 
North Calcutta. Round Vivekananda Road/ Central Ave., crossing, about 50 Hindu 
Behari rickshaw pullers were caught in a cul-de-sac and butchered. Further up Central 
Ave., round the temple which stands in the middle, a party of some 30 Mohamedans 
[Muslims] were killed. It was during the period midnight 16/17th and 0700 hours on 
the 17th that most of the casualties occurred. All the roads in the affected areas were 
red with bricks. . . . The result of this riot has been complete mistrust between the two 
communities.”

“The ruling circles of the U.S.A., striving for world supremacy, openly 
declared that they could achieve their aims only from ‘positions of strength.’ 
The American imperialists unleashed the so-called cold war, and sought to 
kindle the flames of a third world war. In 1, the U.S.A. set up an aggressive 
military bloc known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). As 
early as 1946, the Western States began to pursue a policy of splitting Germany, 
which was essentially completed in 1949 with the creation of a West German 
State. Subsequently they set out to militarize West Germany. This further 
deepened the division of Germany and made her reunification exceptionally 
difficult. A dangerous hotbed of war began to form in Europe. In the Far East 
the United States strove to create a hotbed of war in Japan, stationing its armed 
forces and building military bases on her territory.”

743 AP® WORLD HISTORY PRACTICE EXAMQuestions 53 to 55 refer to the passage below.
“The beauty of globalization is that it can free people from the tyranny of 
geography. Just because someone was born in France does not mean they can 
only aspire to speak French, eat French food, read French books, visit museums 
in France, and so on. . . . Globalization not only increases individual freedom, 
but also revitalizes cultures. . . . Thriving cultures are not set in stone. . . . 
It is a myth that globalization involves the imposition of Americanized 
uniformity, rather than an explosion of cultural exchange. For a start, many 
archetypal ‘American’ products are not as all-American as they seem. Levi 
Strauss, a German immigrant, invented jeans by combining denim cloth . . . 
with Genes, a style of trousers worn by Genoese sailors. So Levi’s jeans are in 
fact an American twist on a European hybrid. Even quintessentially American 
exports are often tailored to local tastes. MTV in Asia promotes Thai pop 
stars and plays rock music sung in Mandarin. CNN en Español offers a Latin 
American take on world news. . . . Britain’s favorite takeaway is a curry, not a 
burger: Indian restaurants there outnumber McDonald’s six to one. . . . Trendy 
Americans wear Gucci, Armani, Versace, Chanel. . . . Nike shoes are given a 
run for their money by Germany’s Adidas, Britain’s Reebok, and Italy’s Fila.”
Philippe Legrain, “Cultural Globalization is Not Americanization,” 
Chronicle of Higher Education, 2003
53. The author’s most likely purpose is to show that the spread of 
American culture is 
(A) a form of imperialism spreading under the label of globalization

(D) one influence among many leading to globalized syncretic cultures
54. Which of the following statements provides the strongest evidence to

Historical Background:  In the late 18th century, Europeans who wanted to 
trade with China were limited to the city of Canton (Guangzhou). In 1792, 
Lord Macartney, a British statesman and foreign diplomat, became the first 
British envoy to China and met briefly with Chinese Emperor Qianlong. At 
the time, opium was grown in great quantities in British India and the Ottoman 
Empire. The British East India Company, a joint-stock company chartered in 
1600, represented the interests of the British government in Asia.

We find that your country is sixty or seventy thousand li from China. Yet there

a great profit. The wealth of China is used to profit the barbarians . . . .  By what 
right do they use this poisonous drug to injure the Chinese people?
I have heard that the smoking of opium is very strictly forbidden by your 
country; that is because the harm caused by opium is very clearly understood. 
Since it is not permitted to do harm in your country, then even less should you 
allow it to be passed on to do harm in other countries. Of all that China exports 
to other countries, there is not a single thing that is not beneficial to people:  
they are of benefit when eaten, or of benefit when used, or of benefit when 
resold:  all are beneficial. This is for no other reason than to share the benefits

It appeared that the Laws of the Chinese Empire forbid the importation of Opium 
into China, and declare that all Opium which may be brought into the Country 
is liable to confiscation. The Queen of England desires that Her Subjects who 
may go into Foreign Countries should obey the Laws of those Countries; and 
Her Majesty does not wish to protect them from the just consequences of any 
offenses which they may commit in foreign parts. But, on the other hand, Her 
Majesty cannot permit that Her Subjects residing abroad should be treated with 
violence, and be exposed to insult and injustice; and when wrong is done to 
them,  Her Majesty will see that they obtain redress.

The course which I hope and believe Her Majesty’s Government 
are about to take, is to make rational proposals to China—such 
proposals as China may accept without national dishonour [dishonor]
or disgrace. But, considering the character of its Government, and 
all the events that have already taken place, no man can doubt the 
necessity of accompanying and supporting such propositions with 
a competent physical force (hear). The armament destined for this 
service has been condemned on account of its being supposed to 
be intended to support the trade in opium. On the contrary, I call 
on all those who would wish to see that detestable traffic really 
and effectually put down, to support a measure by which, alone, 
I am convinced, such a wished-for consummation can ever be 
accomplished. Without a national treaty between the Governments 
of England and China, such as this armament may be hoped to lead 
to, and which it would be hopeless to expect otherwise, providing 
a plan of cordial co-operation between them for this end, it is but 
too certain that this detestable opium traffic must, in spite of every 
effort, not only flourish, but become every day more and more 
piratical and buccaneering in its character.

2 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONCrops originally from America such as corn (maize), potatoes, and tomatoes 
revolutionized the diet of Europeans. However, germs that had developed in Europe caused epidemics in the Americas. Typically, the native population of a region declined by 90 percent within a century after the arrival of Europeans. 
Addition of Enslaved Africans Adding to the diversity of people in the 
Americas were enslaved Africans. They were brought to the Americas by Europeans who desired low-cost labor to work in mines and on plantations. Africans, like Native Americans, resisted European domination by maintaining elements of their cultures. The three groups influenced the others’ ideas and ways of life.
European Colonies Within a century of the arrival of Columbus, Spanish 
and Portuguese explorers and settlers developed colonies that depended on natives and enslaved Africans for labor in agriculture and mining precious metals. In particular, mines in Mexico and South America produced vast amounts of silver that made Spain the wealthiest European empire in the 16th and 17th centuries. 
ANALYZE THE CONTEXT
1. Describe a historical context for understanding the diverse Native American cultures that had developed in the Americas by the 1490s.
2. Explain a historical context for the European exploration in the Americas from the 1490s to early 1600s.
3. Explain a historical context for the interactions between Europeans and Native Americans in the period from 1491 to 1607.

Topic 1.2
Native American Societies  
Before European Contact
The American Indian is of the soil, whether it be the region of forests, 
plains, pueblos, or mesas. He fits into the landscape, for the hand that 
fashioned the continent also fashioned the man for his surroundings.
Luther Standing Bear, Oglala Lakota Chief, 1933
Learning Objective : Explain how various native populations interacted 
with the natural environment in North America in the period before 
European contact. 
The original discovery and settlement of North and South America began 
at least 10,000 and maybe up to 40,000 years ago. Migrants from Asia might 
have crossed a land bridge that once connected Siberia and Alaska (land now submerged under the Bering Sea). Over time, people migrated southward from near the Arctic Circle to the southern tip of South America. As they adapted to the varied environments they encountered, they evolved into hundreds of tribes speaking hundreds of languages. By 1491, the population in the Americas was probably between 50 million and 100 million people.
Cultures of Central and South America
The native population was concentrated in three highly developed civilizations. 
• Between the years 300 and 800, the Mayas built remarkable cities in the rain forests of the Yucatán Peninsula (present-day Guatemala, Belize, and southern Mexico). 
• Several centuries after the decline of the Mayas, the Aztecs from central Mexico developed a powerful empire. The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlán, had a population of about 200,000, equivalent in population to the largest cities of Europe. 
• While the Aztecs were dominating Mexico and Central America, the Incas based in Peru developed a vast empire in western South America. 
All three civilizations developed highly organized societies, carried on an 
extensive trade, and created calendars that were based on accurate scientific observations. All three cultivated crops that provided a stable food supply, particularly corn (maize) for the Mayas and Aztecs and potatoes for the Incas.
4 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONCultures of North America
The population in the region north of Mexico (present-day United States and 
Canada) in the 1490s may have been anywhere from under 1 million to more than 10 million. 
General Patterns Native societies in this region included fewer people and 
had less complex social structures than those in Mexico and South America. One reason for these differences was how slowly the cultivation of corn (maize) spread northward from Mexico. The nutrition provided by corn allowed for larger and more densely settled populations. In turn, this led to more socially diversified societies in which people specialized in their work.
Some of the most populous societies in North America had disappeared 
by the 15th century for reasons not well understood. By the time of Columbus, most people in the Americas in what is now the United States and Canada lived in semipermanent settlements in groups seldom exceeding 300 people. In most of these groups, the men made tools and hunted for game, while the women gathered plants and nuts or grew crops such as corn (maize), beans, and tobacco.
Language Differences Beyond these broad similarities, the cultures of 
American Indians were very diverse. For example, while English, Spanish, and almost all other European languages were part of just one language family (Indo-European), American Indian languages constituted more than 20 language families. Among the largest of these were Algonquian in the northeast, Siouan 
on the Great Plains, and Athabaskan in the southwest. Together, these 20 families included more than 400 distinct languages.
Southwest Settlements In the dry region that now includes New Mexico 
and Arizona, groups such as the Hohokam, Anasazi, and Pueblos  evolved 
multifaceted societies. Many people lived in caves, under cliffs, and in multistoried buildings. The spread of maize cultivation into this region from Mexico prompted economic growth and the development of irrigation systems. The additional wealth allowed for a more complex society to develop, one with greater variations between social and economic classes. 
By the time Europeans arrived, extreme drought and other hostile natives 
had taken their toll on these groups. However, their descendants continue to live in the region, and the arid climate helped preserve some of the older stone and masonry dwellings.
Northwest Settlements Along the Pacific coast from what is today Alaska 
to northern California, people lived in permanent longhouses or plank houses. They had a rich diet based on hunting, fishing, and gathering nuts, berries, and roots. To help people remember stories, legends, and myths, they carved large totem poles. However, the high mountain ranges in this region isolated tribes from one another, creating barriers to development.
Great Basin and Great Plains People adapted to the dry climate of the 
Great Basin region and the grasslands of the Great Plains by developing mobile 
5  TOPIC 1.2   NATIVE AMERICAN SOCIETIES BEFORE EUROPEAN CONTACT  ways of living. Nomadic tribes survived on hunting, principally the buffalo, 
which supplied their food as well as decorations, crafting tools, knives, and clothing. People lived in tepees, frames of poles covered in animal skins, which were easily disassembled and transported. Some tribes, though they also hunted buffalo, lived permanently in earthen lodges often along rivers. They raised corn (maize), beans, and squash while actively trading with other tribes. 
Not until the 17th century did American Indians acquire horses by trading 
or stealing them from Spanish settlers. With horses, tribes such as the Lakota Sioux could more easily follow buffalo herds. The plains tribes would at times merge or split apart as conditions changed. Migration also was common. For example, the Apaches gradually migrated southward from Canada to Texas.

6 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONMississippi River Valley East of the Mississippi River, the Woodland 
American Indians prospered with a rich food supply. Supported by hunting, 
ﬁshing, and agriculture, people established permanent settlements in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys and elsewhere. The Adena-Hopewell culture, centered in what is now Ohio, is famous for its large earthen mounds, some 300 feet long. One of the largest settlements in the Midwest was Cahokia (near present-day East St. Louis, Illinois), with as many as 30,000 inhabitants. 
Northeast Settlements Some descendants of the Adena-Hopewell culture 
spread from the Ohio Valley into New Y ork. Their culture combined hunting and farming. However, their farming techniques exhausted the soil quickly, so people had to move to fresh land frequently. Multiple families related through the mother’s lineage lived together in longhouses that were up to 200 feet long. 
Several tribes living near the Great Lakes and in New Y ork—the 
Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and later the Tuscaroras—formed a powerful political union called the Iroquois Confederation , or 
Haudenosauanee. From the 16th century through the American Revolution, this powerful union battled rival American Indians as well as Europeans.
Atlantic Seaboard Settlements In the area from New Jersey south to 
Florida lived the people of the Coastal Plains such as the Cherokee and the Lumbee. Many were descendants of the Woodland mound builders and built timber and bark lodgings along rivers. The rivers and the Atlantic Ocean provided a rich source of food
Overall Diversity  The tremendous variety of landforms and climate 
prompted people in North America prior to 1492 to develop widely different cultures. While Europeans often grouped these varied cultures together, each tribe was very conscious of its own distinctive systems and traditions. Not until much later in history did they develop a shared identity as Native Americans.

European Exploration  
in the Americas
Thirty-three days after my departure . . . I reached the Indian Sea, where 
I discovered many islands, thickly peopled, of which I took possession 
without resistance in the name of our illustrious monarch, by public 
proclamation and with unfurled banners.
Christopher Columbus, Select Letters, 1493
Learning Objective : Explain the causes of exploration and conquest of 
the New World by various European nations.
Until the late 1400s, the people of the Americas carried on extensive trade 
with each other but had no connection to the people of Europe, Africa, and 
Asia. Similarly, Europeans, Africans, and Asians traded among themselves without knowing of the Americas. However, starting in the 1400s, religious and economic motives prompted Europeans to explore more widely than before. As a result, they brought the two parts of the world into contact with each other.
The European Context for Exploration
While Vikings from Scandinavia had visited Greenland and North America around the year 1000, these voyages had no lasting impact. Columbus’s voyages of exploration finally brought people into ongoing contact across the Atlantic. Several factors made sailing across the ocean and exploring distant regions possible and desirable in the late 15th century.
Changes in Thought and Technology
In Europe, a rebirth of classical learning prompted an outburst of artistic and scientific activity in the 15th and 16th centuries known as the Renaissance. Several of the technological advances during the Renaissance resulted from Europeans making improvements in the inventions of others. For example, Europeans began to use gunpowder  (invented by the Chinese) and the 
sailing compass (adopted from Arab merchants who learned about it from the Chinese). Europeans also made major improvements in shipbuilding and mapmaking. In addition, the invention of the printing press in the 1450s aided 
the spread of knowledge across Europe.
9  TOPIC 1.3   EUROPEAN E xPLORATION IN THE AMERICAS  Religious Conflict
The later years of the Renaissance were a time of intense religious zeal and 
conflict. The Roman Catholic Church and its leader, known as the pope, had dominated most of Western Europe for centuries. However, in the 15th and 16th centuries, their power was threatened by both Ottoman Turks, who were Muslims, and rebellious Christians who challenged the pope’s authority.
Catholic Victory in Spain In the 8th century, Islamic invaders from North 
Africa, known as Moors, rapidly conquered most of what is now Spain. Over the next several centuries, Spanish Christians reconquered much of the land and set up several independent kingdoms. Two of the largest of these kingdoms united when Isabella , queen of Castile, and Ferdinand, king of Aragon, 
married in 1469. In 1492, under the leadership of Isabella and Ferdinand, the Spanish conquered the last Moorish stronghold in Spain, the city of Granada. In that year, the monarchs also funded Christopher Columbus on his historic first voyage. The uniting of Spain under Isabella and Ferdinand, the conquest of Granada, and the launching of Columbus’s voyage signaled new leadership, hope, and power for Europeans who followed the Roman Catholic faith.
Protestant Revolt in Northern Europe In the early 1500s, certain 
Christians in Germany, England, France, Holland, and other northern European countries revolted against the authority of the pope in Rome. Their revolt was known as the Protestant Reformation. Conflict between Catholics and Protestants led to a series of religious wars that resulted in many millions of deaths in the 16th and 17th centuries. The conflict also caused the Roman Catholics of Spain and Portugal and the Protestants of England and Holland to want to spread their own versions of Christianity to people in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Thus, a religious motive for exploration and colonization was added to political and economic motives.
Expanding Trade
Economic motives for exploration grew out of a fierce competition among European kingdoms for increased trade with Africa, India, and China. In the past, merchants had traveled from the Italian city-state of Venice and the Byzantine city of Constantinople on a long, slow, expensive overland route all the way to eastern China. This land route to Asia had become blocked in 1453 when the Ottoman Turks seized control of Constantinople.
New Routes So the challenge to finding a new way to the rich Asian 
trade appeared to be by sailing either south along the West African coast and then east to China, or sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean. The Portuguese realized the route south and east was the shortest path. Voyages of exploration sponsored by Portugal’s Prince Henry the Navigator eventually succeeded in opening up a long sea route around South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope. In 1498, the Portuguese sea captain Vasco da Gama was the first European to reach India via this route. By this time, Columbus had attempted what he mistakenly believed would be a shorter route to Asia. 
10 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONSlave Trading Since ancient times people in Europe, Africa, and Asia had 
enslaved people captured in wars. In the 15th century, the Portuguese began 
trading for enslaved people from West Africa. They used the enslaved workers on newly established sugar plantations on the Madeira and Azores islands off  the African coast. Producing sugar with enslaved labor was so profitable that when Europeans later established colonies in the Americas, they used a similar system there. 
Developing Nation-States
Europe was also changing politically in the 15th century. 
• Small kingdoms were uniting into larger ones. For example, Castile and Aragon united to form the core of the modern country of Spain.
• Enormous multiethnic empires, such as the sprawling Holy Roman Empire in central Europe, were beginning to break up. For example, most of the small states that united to form the modern country of Germany in 1871 were once part of the Holy Roman Empire.
Replacing the small kingdoms and the multiethnic empires were nation-states, countries in which the majority of people shared both a common culture and common loyalty toward a central government. The monarchs of the emerging nation-states, such as Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain; Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal; and similar monarchs of France, England, and the Netherlands depended on trade to bring in needed revenues and on the church to justify their right to rule. 
Dividing the Americas
The Western European monarchs used their power to search for riches abroad and to spread the influence of their version of Christianity to new overseas dominions. This led to competition for control of land in the Americas.
Spanish and Portuguese Claims Spain and Portugal were the first 
European kingdoms to claim territories in the Americas. Their claims overlapped, leading to disputes. The Catholic monarchs of the two countries turned to the pope to resolve their differences. In 1493, the pope drew a vertical, north-south line on a world map, called the line of demarcation. The pope granted Spain all lands to the west of the line and Portugal all lands to the east. 
In 1494, Spain and Portugal moved the pope’s line a few degrees to the 
west and signed an agreement called the Treaty of Tordesillas. The line passed through what is now the country of Brazil. This treaty, together with Portuguese explorations, established Portugal’s claim to Brazil. Spain claimed the rest of the Americas. However, other European countries soon challenged these claims.
English Claims England’s earliest claims to territory in the Americas rested 
on the voyages of John Cabot, an Italian sea captain who sailed under contract to England’s King Henry VII. Cabot explored the coast of Newfoundland in 1497.

England, however, did not immediately follow up Cabot’s discoveries with 
other expeditions of exploration and settlement. Other issues preoccupied 
England’s monarchy in the 1500s, most importantly the religious conflict that followed Henry VIII’s break with the Roman Catholic Church. 
Later in the 16th century, England took more interest in distant affairs. In 
the 1570s and 1580s, under Queen Elizabeth I, England challenged Spanish shipping in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Sir Francis Drake, for example, attacked Spanish ships, seized the gold and silver that they carried, and even attacked Spanish settlements on the coast of Peru. Another English adventurer, Sir Walter Raleigh, attempted to establish a colonial settlement at Roanoke Island off the North Carolina coast in 1587, but the venture failed.
French Claims The French monarchy first showed interest in exploration 
in 1524 when it sponsored a voyage by an Italian navigator, Giovanni da Verrazzano. Hoping to find a northwest passage leading through the Americas to Asia, Verrazzano explored part of North America’s eastern coast, including the New Y ork harbor. French claims to American territory were also based on the voyages of Jacques Cartier (1534–1542), who explored the St. Lawrence River extensively.
12 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONLike the English, the French were slow to develop colonies across the  
Atlantic. During the 1500s, the French monarchy was preoccupied with 
European wars as well as with internal religious conflict between Roman Catholics and French Protestants known as Huguenots. Only in the next century did France develop a strong interest in following up its claims to North American land.

Columbian Exchange, Spanish 
Exploration, and Conquest 
In 1491, the world was in many of its aspects and characteristics a 
minimum of two worlds—the New World, of the Americas, and the 
Old World, consisting of Eurasia and Africa. Columbus brought them 
together, and almost immediately and continually ever since, we 
have had an exchange.
Alfred W. Crosby, historian and geographer, 2011
Learning Objective : Explain causes of the Columbian Exchange and its 
effect on Europe and the Americas during the period after 1492.
Columbus’s purpose in sailing westward in the 1490s was to find a sea route to 
the lucrative trade with Asia, which had been limited by a long and dangerous 
land route. The eventual impact of what Columbus found was of far greater importance. 
Christopher Columbus
As mentioned in the previous topic, 1.3, changing economic, political, and social conditions in Europe combined to support new efforts to expand. Exploration across the seas was specifically supported by the improvements in shipbuilding and in navigation with better compasses and mapmaking. These factors all helped shape the ambitions of many to explore.
Plans to Reach Asia One of these explorers was from the Italian city of 
Genoa, Christopher Columbus. He spent eight years seeking financial support for his plan to sail west from Europe to the “Indies. ” Finally, in 1492, he succeeded in winning the backing of Isabella and Ferdinand. The two Spanish monarchs were then at the height of their power, having just defeated the Moors in Granada. They agreed to outfit three ships and to make Columbus governor, admiral, and viceroy of all the lands that he would claim for Spain.
After sailing from the Canary Islands on September 6, Columbus landed 
on an island in the Bahamas on October 12. His success in reaching lands on the other side of the ocean brought him a burst of glory in Spain. But three subsequent voyages across the Atlantic were disappointing—he found little gold, few spices, and no simple path to China and India. 
15  TOPIC 1.4   C OLUMBIAN E xCHANGE , SPANISH E xPLORATION, AND CONQUEST  The Columbian Exchange
Europeans and the original inhabitants of the Americas had developed vastly 
different cultures over the millennia. The contact between them resulted in the Columbian Exchange, a transfer of plants, animals, and germs from one side of the Atlantic to the other for the first time. These exchanges, biological and cultural, permanently changed the entire world. Never again would people live in isolation from the other hemisphere. 
Europeans learned about many new plants and foods, including beans, 
corn, sweet and white potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. These food items transformed the diet of people throughout Eurasia and touched off rapid population growth in regions from Ireland to West Africa to eastern China. Europeans also contracted a new disease, syphilis. 
People in the Americas learned about sugar cane, bluegrasses, pigs, and 
horses, as well as new technology, such as the wheel, iron implements, and guns. But while the Columbian Exchange led to population growth in Europe, Africa, and Asia, it had the opposite effect in the Americas. Native Americans had no immunity to the germs and the diseases brought by Europeans, such 
as smallpox  and measles. As a result the native population declined rapidly in 
the first century after contact. In Mexico, the native population declined from around 22 million in 1492 to around 4 million by the mid-16th century. 
The Rise of Capitalism
In Europe, population growth and access to new resources encouraged trade, which led to economic, political, and social changes. The medieval system of feudalism, a system in which monarchs granted land to nobles in exchange for military service, declined. In its place rose capitalism, an economic system in which control of capital (money and machinery) became more important than control of land. As trade increased, commerce became increasingly important, and political power shifted from large landowners to wealthy merchants. 
One reason trade increased was that Europeans were eager to gain access 
to the riches of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. A single successful trade expedition could make the individual who financed the voyage very wealthy. However, ocean voyages were expensive and dangerous. One bad storm could destroy all the ships in an expedition. To finance trade voyages more safely, Europeans developed a new type of enterprise, the joint-stock company, a 
business owned by a large number of investors. If a voyage failed, investors lost only what they had invested. By reducing individual risk, joint-stock companies encouraged investment, thereby promoting economic growth.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WAS COLUMBUS A GREAT HERO?
When Columbus died in 1506, he still believed that he had found a western route to Asia. However, many Spaniards realized he had not. Nor had he found gold and spices. They viewed him as a failure. Even the land that he had explored was named for someone else, Amerigo Vespucci. 

16 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONColumbus then became more honored. Scholars praised his skills as a 
navigator and his daring. He traveled where nobody else had ever dared to 
venture. As early as 1828, Washington Irving wrote a popular biography extolling the explorer’s virtues. The apex of Columbus’s heroic reputation was reached in 1934 when President Franklin Roosevelt declared October 12 a national holiday.
Since the 1990s, however, historians have become more aware of the 
strength and diversity of indigenous cultures and the devastating impact of contact with Europeans. As a result, several biographies have revised their view of Columbus, taking a more critical look at him. 
A Fortunate Navigator Some have argued that Columbus was simply at 
the right place at the right time. Europeans at the end of the 15th century were eager to find a water route to Asia. If Columbus had not run into the Americas in 1492, some other explorer—perhaps Vespucci or Cabot—would have done so a few years later. 
A Conqueror  Some revisionists take a harsh view of Columbus, regarding 
him not as a discoverer but as a conqueror. They portray him as a religious fanatic who sought to convert the American natives to Christianity and kill those who resisted.
Response to the Critics Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. argued that Columbus’s 
chief motivation was neither greed nor ambition—it was the challenge of the unknown. Others pointed out that, while Columbus brought deadly diseases to the Americas, the costs of contact were partially offset by positive results such as the development of democracy.Historians will continue to debate the nature of Columbus’s achievement. As with other historical questions, distinguishing between fact and fiction and separating a writer’s personal biases from objective reality are difficult. One conclusion is inescapable: As a result of Columbus’s voyages, world history took a sharp turn in a new direction. People are still living with the consequences of this interaction.
Support an Argument Explain two perspectives on Columbus’s role in the European 
expansion in the Americas.

Columbus was, in most respects, merely an especially active and dramatic

1. “The New World provided soils that were very suitable for the cultivation 
of a variety of Old World products, like sugar and coffee. The increased supply lowered the prices of these products significantly, making them affordable to the general population for the first time in history. The production of these products also resulted in large inflows of profits back to Europe, which some have argued fueled the Industrial Revolution and the rise of Europe. . . . 
The exchange also had some extremely negative impacts. Native American 
populations were decimated by Old World diseases. This depopulation along with the production of valuable Old World crops . . . fueled the demand for labor that gave rise to the transatlantic slave trade. The result was the forced movement of over twelve million slaves from Africa to the Americas and devastating political, social, and economic consequences for the African continent. ”

Spanish Colonial System
Know ye that I have given permission . . . to take to the Indies, the 
islands and the mainland of the ocean sea already discovered or to 
be discovered, four thousand negro slaves both male and female, 
provided that they be Christians.
Emperor Charles V of Spain, colonial charter, August 18, 1518
Learning Objective : Explain how the growth of the Spanish Empire 
in North America shaped the development of social and economic 
structures over time.
Spanish dominance in the Americas was based on more than a papal ruling 
and a treaty. The new empire began with ambitious and skilled leaders in 
Ferdinand and Isabella. With its adventurous explorers and conquerors (called conquistadores) and the labor provided by Indians and enslaved Africans, Spain rapidly expanded its wealth and power.
Spanish Exploration and Conquest
Feats such as the journey across the Isthmus of Panama to the Pacific Ocean by Vasco Núñez de Balboa, the circumnavigation of the world by one of Ferdinand Magellan’s ships (Magellan died before completing the trip), the conquests of the Aztecs in Mexico by Hernán Cortés, and the conquest of the Incas in Peru by Francisco Pizarro secured Spain’s initial supremacy in the Americas.
The conquistadores sent ships loaded with gold and silver back to Spain 
from Mexico and Peru. They increased the gold supply in Spain, making it the richest and most powerful kingdom in Europe. Spain’s success encouraged other states to turn to the Americas in search of gold and power. 
Indian Labor In Mexico and Peru, the Spanish encountered the well-
organized and populous Aztec and Inca empires. Even after diseases killed most natives, millions survived. The Spanish incorporated the surviving Indians into their own empire. To control them, the Spanish used the encomienda system in which Spain’s king granted natives who lived on a tract of land to individual Spaniards. These Indians were forced to farm or work in the mines. The fruits of their labors went to the Spanish, who in turn had to “care” for the Indians. 
20 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONEnslaved African Labor On their sugar plantations on islands off the 
African coast, the Portuguese had already shown that using enslaved Africans 
to grow crops could be profitable. They provided a model for other Europeans. The Spanish, to add to their labor force and to replace Indians who died from diseases and brutality, began trading with African partners who could supply enslaved people. The Spanish imported people under the asiento  system, which 
required colonists to pay a tax to the Spanish king on each enslaved person they imported to the Americas. 
As other Europeans established American colonies, they also imported 
enslaved Africans in large numbers. During the colonial era, more Africans than Europeans crossed the Atlantic to the Americas. Before the transatlantic slave trade ended in the late 1800s, slave traders sent between 10 million and 15 million enslaved people from Africa. Between 10 percent and 15 percent died on the voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, called the Middle Passage.
African Resistance Though transported thousands of miles from their 
homelands and brutally repressed, Africans resisted slavery in multiple ways. They often ran away, sabotaged work, or revolted. Further, they maintained aspects of African culture, particularly in music, religion, and folkways. 
Spanish Caste System
The combination of Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans made the Spanish colonies ethnically diverse. In addition, since most Spanish colonists were single men rather than families, many had children with native or African women. The result was that the Spanish colonies included many people with mixed heritage. In response, the Spanish developed a caste system that defined the status of people in the colonies by their heritage:
• At the top were pure-blooded Spaniards.
• In the middle were several levels of people ordered according to their mixture of European, Native American, and African heritage.
• At the bottom were people of pure Indian or Black heritage.

Topic 1.6
Cultural Interactions 
in the Americas
The Spanish have a perfect right to rule these barbarians of the New 
World and the adjacent islands, who in prudence, skill, virtues, and 
humanity are as inferior to the Spanish as children to adults, or women 
to men.
Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda, Spanish theologian, 1547
Learning Objective : Explain how and why European and Native 
American perspectives of others developed and changed in the period.
History is filled with experiences of contact between diverse people, such as 
the Romans and Africans in the Classical Era, or the Christians and Muslims 
in the Middle Ages. Often these conflicts were violent, but they were in small regions and lasted no more than a couple centuries. The contact between Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans in the Americas also featured violence, but the interaction was on a much larger scale for a much longer time.
Europeans and Native Americans held conflicting worldviews. For example, 
most Europeans believed in a single god, while most Native Americans honored many deities. European women had little role in public life, while Native American women in some tribes held decision-making positions. Europeans used legal documents to establish the right to plow a field or hunt in a forest. Native Americans relied more on tradition to make land use decisions. 
European Treatment of Native Americans
The Europeans who colonized North and South America generally viewed Native Americans as inferior people who could be exploited for economic gain, converted to Christianity, and used as military allies. However, Europeans used various approaches for ruling Native Americans and operating colonies. 
Spanish Policy
The Spanish overwhelmingly subjugated Native Americans. However, Spanish scholars also debated the status of Native Americans and the treatment of them.
Bartolomé de Las Casas One European who dissented from the views 
of most Europeans toward Native Americans was a Spanish priest named 
24 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONBartolomé de Las Casas. Though he had owned land and slaves in the West 
Indies and had fought in wars against the Indians, he eventually became an advocate for better treatment for Indians. He persuaded the king to institute the New Laws of 1542. These laws ended Indian slavery, halted forced Indian labor, and began to end the encomienda system that kept the Indians in serfdom. Conservative Spaniards, eager to keep the encomienda system, responded and successfully pushed the king to repeal parts of the New Laws.
Valladolid Debate The debate over the role for Indians in the Spanish 
colonies came to a head in a formal debate in 1550–1551 in Valladolid, Spain. On one side, Las Casas argued that the Indians were completely human and morally equal to Europeans, so enslaving them was not justified. On the other side, another priest, Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda, argued that Indians were less than human. Hence, they benefited from serving the Spaniards in the encomienda system. Neither side clearly persuaded the entire audience. Though Las Casas was unable to gain equal treatment for Native Americans, he established the basic arguments on behalf of justice for Indians. 
English Policy
Unlike the Spanish, the English settled in areas with no large native empires that could provide forced labor. Further, when English colonists arrived in the 1600s, European diseases had already dramatically reduced the indigenous population. In addition, many English colonists came in families rather than as single young men, so marriage with natives was less common. 
Initially, at least in Massachusetts, the English and the American Indians 
coexisted, traded, and shared ideas. American Indians taught the settlers how to grow new crops such as corn (maize) and showed them how to hunt in the forests. They traded furs for an array of English manufactured goods, including iron tools and weapons, that they found useful.
But peaceful relations soon gave way to conflict and warfare. Most English 
showed no respect for American Indian cultures, which they viewed as “savage. ” American Indians saw their way of life threatened as the English seized land to support their growing population. The English occupied the land and forced the small, scattered tribes they encountered to move away from the coast to inland territories. They expelled the natives rather than subjugating them.
French Policy
The French, looking for furs and converts to Catholicism, viewed American Indians as potential economic and military allies. Compared to the Spaniards 
and the English, the French maintained good relations with the tribes they encountered. Seeking to control the fur trade, the French built trading posts throughout the St. Lawrence Valley, the Great Lakes region, and along the Mississippi River. At these posts, they exchanged French goods for beaver pelts and other furs collected by American Indians. Because the French had few colonists, farms, or towns, they posed less threat to the native population than 
25  TOPIC 1.6   CULTURAL INTERACTIONS IN THE AMERICASdid other Europeans. In addition, French soldiers assisted the Huron people in 
fighting their traditional enemy, the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee). 
Survival Strategies by Native Americans 
As European settlements expanded, Native Americans responded to protect their cultures. One strategy was to ally with one European power or another. For example, in Mexico, several tribes allied with the Spanish to help them win their freedom from the Aztecs in the 16th century. Later, in the Ohio River Valley, the Delawares and the Shawnees allied closely with the French against English encroachment on their land. 
Other tribes simply migrated west to get away from settlers, though this 
often led them into conflict with Native Americans already living in a region. The conflicts reflected the strong tribal loyalty that Native Americans felt. Since they did not identify as part of a larger group that included all tribes, European settlers pushing westward rarely faced a unified response from Native Americans. Only later would the shared desire to resist European power lead people to identify as Native Americans as well as members of a particular tribe. Regardless of how they dealt with the European invasion, Native Americans would never be able to return to the life they had known prior to 1492.
The Role of Africans in America 
Africans contributed a third cultural tradition in the Americas. Their experience growing rice resulted in rice becoming an important crop in the colonies of South Carolina and Louisiana. They brought musical rhythms and styles of singing that shaped the development of music throughout the Americas. They also introduced European settlers to the banjo. By the 19th century, the banjo would be closely associated with the culture of the southeastern United States. 
Europeans justified slavery in many ways. Some cited passages from the 
Bible to support their belief that slavery had always existed and was approved by God. As slavery became exclusively for Africans, Europeans began to argue that Africans were biologically inferior, so enslaving them was acceptable. This was similar to the argument used by de Sepúlveda regarding Native Americans.

Questions 1–2 refer to the following excerpt.
“Concerning the treatment of Native American workers: When they were 
allowed to go home, they often found it deserted and had no other recourse than to go out into the woods to ﬁnd food and to die. When they fell ill, which was very frequently because they are a delicate people unaccustomed to such work, the Spaniards did not believe them and pitilessly called them lazy dogs, and kicked and beat them; and when illness was apparent they sent them home as useless, giving them some cassava for the twenty- to eighty-league [about 60 to 240 miles] journey. They would go then, falling into the ﬁrst stream and dying there in desperation; others would hold on longer, but very few ever made it home. I sometimes came upon dead bodies on my way, and upon others who were gasping and moaning in their death agony. ”

Topic 1.7
Causation in Period 1
Learning Objective : Explain the effects of the development of 
transatlantic voyages from 1491 to 1607.
The reasoning skill of “causation” is the suggested focus for evaluating the 
content of this period. As explained in the contextualization introduction to 
Period 1, there are many factors to consider in the broad topic of European encounters in the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. One needs to be able to describe what caused the Native Americans to develop diverse societies across the enormous and varied lands of North America. This appreciation of the status of Native Americans during this period will help to explain the specific developments  when the Europeans came to explore what they saw as a 
“new world. ” 
A number of factors had come together to explain the causes of the 
European explorations during this particular period. For example, both desires to spread Christianity and desires for economic gain. However, not all causes are equally significant. One task of a historian is to weigh the evidence to decide how much emphasis to place on each of these various causes. Among the most common differences among historians are debates over whether one cause was more important than another.
Note that causation implies that an event or development had an effect. The 
results of the contact are viewed by some as the Columbian Exchange, which explain both the short- and long-term impact not only on both sides of the Atlantic but on people throughout the world. Given the many factors involved, one can argue as to the historically significant effects  on the various peoples 
involved on both sides of the Atlantic. 
QUESTIONS ABOUT CAUSATION
1. Explain the factors that resulted in various Native American groups developing their own unique cultures.
2. Explain a significant development in Europe by the 15th and 16th centuries that caused a surge in exploration.
3. Explain the extent to which the Columbian Exchange had beneficial effects on both the Native Americans and Europeans.

Analyzing a Secondary Source
“Why did the English found colonies and make them stick? For most the goal 
was material. . . . For some the goal was spiritual. . . . But all the colonists who suffered perilous voyages and risked early death in America were either hustlers or hustled. That is, they knew the hardships beforehand and were courageous, desperate, or faithful enough to face them, or else they did not know what lay ahead but were taken in by the propaganda of sponsors. . . . In every case colonists left a swarming competitive country that heralded self-improvement but offered limited opportunities for it. ”

Topic 2.1
Contextualizing Period 2
Learning Objective : Explain the context for the colonization of North 
America from 1607 to 1754.
The period in the Americas from 1491 to 1607 was a time of European 
exploration, dominated by the Spanish. In the period from 1607 to 1754, 
exploration began giving way to expanding colonization. In North America, the Spanish, French, Dutch, and British established colonies, with the British dominating the region from Canada to the Caribbean islands. In particular, the British established 13 colonies along the Atlantic coast. Most of these provided a profitable trade and a home to a diverse group of Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans.
From the establishment of the first permanent English settlement in North 
America in 1607 to the start of a decisive war for European control of the continent in 1756, the colonies evolved. At first, they struggled for survival. Over time, they became a society of permanent farms, plantations, towns, and cities. European settlers brought various cultures, economic plans, and ideas for governing to the Americas. In particular, with varying approaches, they all sought to dominate the native inhabitants.
Early Settlements
The earliest Europeans in the Americas, the Spanish and Portuguese, settled in Central and South America. The Spanish slowly migrated into North America. Subsequently, the French, Dutch, and British settled along the Atlantic coast of North America and gradually migrated westward and developed various types of colonial systems and relationships with Native Americans.
The first two successful British colonies along the Atlantic coast of North 
America were Jamestown and Plymouth. They served as the starting points that would lead to 13 colonies as far south as Georgia. Depending on the environmental conditions and settlement patterns, each colony developed its own economic and cultural system. For many, transatlantic trade was important, with tobacco, timber, and rice being important products. Trade, along with ties of religion and language, created strong bonds between the colonies and Great Britain. However, in the mid-1700s, trade also became a point of conflict. Colonies increasingly resisted British control over their trade.UNIT 2 — Period 2: 1607–1754
33  TOPIC 2.1   C ONTE xTUALIz ING PERIOD 2Trade was also the mainstay of early contact between the Europeans and 
Native Americans. The colonists wanted a dependable food supply and the 
Native Americans were drawn to the iron tools and guns of the newcomers. But the Europeans generally treated the Native Americans as inferiors to be used or pushed aside. Trade also led to competition for resources among colonists and natives. In particular, the British and the French fought a series of wars for control of land. Native Americans such as the Iroquois and the Huron allied with Europeans or each other to advance their own interests.
Sources of Labor
As Europeans seized land from Native Americans, they looked for a source of labor to make the lands profitable. They first tried to enslave Native Americans. This failed because the Native Americans could escape too easily. Europeans then tried to employ indentured servants, individuals who agreed to work for a master for a set number of years (often seven) in exchange for transportation from Europe to the Americas. Indentured servants became common in the colonies, but they did not provide sufficient labor for people who owned land. 
The British, following the example of the Spanish and others, soon began 
importing enslaved laborers from Africa. Given the steady flow of support and families from Britain, the various 13 colonies gradually developed societies that both mirrored and varied from British society. From 1607 to the 1750s, the growth of these 13 British colonies would lead them to use trade and war to dominate both the Native Americans and the other European colonists.
ANALYZE THE CONTEXT
1. Explain a historical context for understanding the interaction between the Native Americans and the Europeans as colonies were established in North America in the period from 1607 to 1754.
2. Explain a historical context for the development of slavery in the European colonies in North America in the period from 1607 to 1754.

European Colonization  
in North America
If they desire that Piety and godliness should prosper; accompanied with 
sobriety, justice and love, let them choose a Country such as this is . . . 
which may yield sufﬁciency with hard labour and industry.
Reverend John White, The Planter's Plea, 1630
Learning Objective : Explain how and why various European colonies 
developed and expanded from 1607 to 1754.
M igration to the Americas during the 17th century and the first half of the 
18th century was both influenced by the environment and had a lasting impact 
on it. The many different peoples that settled in North America from Europe, together with the Native Americans already living on the continent and the enslaved Africans brought there, would ultimately form a society unlike any previously seen. 
Exploration in the new world by Europeans was quickly followed by 
colonization. The primary motivations for settling in the Americas in the 17th century were the desires for wealth, to spread Christianity, and to escape persecution. 
Spanish Colonies
Spanish settlements developed slowly in North America as a result of limited mineral resources and strong opposition from American Indians. Missionary zeal was an important motivator as Roman Catholic Spain worked to counter the expanding influence of the Reformation and Protestantism. These colonies were largely populated by men, and they would gradually include Native Americans and Africans in their society.
Florida  Juan Ponce de Leon claimed these lands for Spain in 1513. After a 
number of failures and the strong resistance of American Indians in the region, the Spanish established a permanent settlement at St. Augustine in 1565, more than 50 years before the English founded Jamestown. St. Augustine became the oldest city founded by Europeans in what became the mainland of the United States. Only a few small settlements developed as the Spanish found little silver and gold, a declining native population due to wars and disease, and periodic hurricanes. 
35  TOPIC 2.2   EUROPEAN COLONIz ATION IN NORTH AMERICA  New Mexico and Arizona In a region that had been settled by American 
Indians for about 700 years, Spanish colonists began arriving in 1598. They 
established Santa Fe as the capital of New Mexico in 1610. 
Texas Between Florida and New Mexico, the Spanish established 
settlements in Texas. These communities grew in the early 1700s as Spain resisted French efforts to explore the lower Mississippi River.
California With Russians exploring from Alaska, the Spanish started a 
settlement at San Diego in 1769. By 1784, the Franciscan order and Father Junípero Serra had established missions along the California coast.
French Colonies
Similar to the Spanish, the French colonizers were mainly men. However, there were few French. Some came as Christian missionaries. Those who came for economic reasons mostly worked in the lucrative fur trade, traveling throughout the interior of North America purchasing furs gathered by American Indians. Many traders married American Indian women, who then provided valuable services as guides, translators, and negotiators with other American Indians. The reliance of the French on trade made rivers particularly important in their colonies. 
• Quebec, the first French settlement in America was located on the St. Lawrence River. It was founded by Samuel de Champlain, the “Father of New France, ” in 1608. 
• In 1673, Louis Jolliet and Father Jacques Marquette explored the upper Mississippi River. Nine years later, Robert de La Salle explored the Mississippi basin, which he named Louisiana (after the French king, Louis XIV). 
• By 1718, the French had moved southward down the Mississippi River and established a permanent settlement, New Orleans, where the river entered the Gulf of Mexico. New Orleans became a prosperous trade center.
Dutch Colonies
During the 1600s, the Netherlands sponsored voyages of exploration. The government hired Henry Hudson, an English sailor, to seek westward passage to Asia. In 1609, while searching for a northwest passage, Hudson sailed up a broad river that was later named for him, the Hudson River. This expedition established Dutch claims to the surrounding area, New Amsterdam (and later New Y ork). The Dutch government granted a private company, the Dutch West India Company, the right to control the region for economic gain.
Like the French colonies, the Dutch colonies consisted of small numbers 
of traders who built strong trade networks among American Indians. However, the Dutch were more likely to settle in trading posts near the coast or along major rivers and less likely to intermarry with American Indians.
36 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONBritish Colonies
In the early 1600s, England was in a position to colonize the lands explored a 
century earlier by John Cabot. England’s population was growing more rapidly than its economy, so its number of poor and landless families was increasing. They were attracted to opportunities in the Americas. Using joint-stock companies to finance the risky enterprise of colonization, the English began settling colonies in the Americas.
Compared to other European colonists, those from England included a 
higher percentage of families and single females, and they were more interested in farming. As a result, English settlers were more likely to claim American Indian land and less likely to intermarry with Indians. In addition, the English colonies attracted a more diverse group of European settlers than did other colonies. Most of these settlers migrated in search of better lives or religious freedom.

The Regions of British Colonies
Liberty of conscience . . . we ask as our undoubted right by the law of 
God, of nature, and of our own country.
William Penn, “The Great Case of Liberty of Conscience, ” 1670
Learning Objective : Explain how and why environmental and other 
factors shaped the development and expansion of various British colonies 
that developed and expanded from 1607 to 1754.
The English colonies developed regional or sectional differences based on 
many influences including topography, natural resources, climate, and the 
background of their settlers. Starting with Jamestown (Virginia) in 1607 and ending in 1733 in Georgia, 13 distinct colonies developed along the Atlantic coast of North America. Every colony received its authority to operate by a charter granting special privileges from the monarch. Each charter described the relationship between the colony and the crown. Over time, three types of charters—and three types of colonies—developed: 
• Corporate colonies , such as Jamestown, were operated by joint-stock 
companies, at least during these colonies’ early years. 
• Royal colonies, such as Virginia after 1624, were to be under the direct authority and rule of the king’s government. 
• Proprietary colonies, such as Maryland and Pennsylvania, were under the authority of individuals granted charters of ownership by the king. 
The British took pride in free farmers working the land. Unlike the 
French and Spanish colonists, the English had a tradition of representative government. They were accustomed to elections for representatives speaking for property owners and deciding important measures, such as taxes, proposed by the king’s government. While political and religious conﬂicts dominated England, feelings for independence grew in the colonies. Eventually, tensions emerged between the king and his colonial subjects. 
Early English Settlements
The earliest English colonies were founded for very different reasons and hundreds of miles apart in Virginia and Massachusetts.
39  TOPIC 2.3   THE REGIONS OF BRITISH COLONIESJamestown
England’s King James I chartered the Virginia Company, a joint-stock 
company  that founded the ﬁrst permanent English colony in America at 
Jamestown  in 1607.
Early Problems The ﬁrst settlers of Jamestown suffered greatly, mostly 
from their own mistakes. The settlement’s location in a swampy area along the James River resulted in fatal outbreaks of dysentery and malaria. Many of the settlers were gentlemen unaccustomed to physical work or gold hunters who refused to hunt or farm. A source of goods came from trade with American Indians, but conflicts between settlers and the natives stopped trade and settlers starved. 
Through the leadership of Captain John Smith, Jamestown survived 
its first five years. Through the efforts of John Rolfe and his Indian wife, Pocahontas, the colony developed a variety of tobacco that became popular in Europe and a profitable crop. To recruit White settlers, Virginia provided 50 acres of land, called a headright,  to any settler or to anyone who paid for 
passage for a settler to the colony. While the headright system helped many Europeans move to Virginia, it mostly aided landowners who added to their holdings by sponsoring indentured servants. During the first several decades of colonization, planters mostly used White laborers. However, by the end of the 17th century, landowners relied more on enslaved Africans.
Transition to a Royal Colony Despite tobacco, by 1624 the Virginia 
colony remained near collapse. More than 5,000 people had settled in it, but death from disease and conflicts with Indians was so high that the population was only 1,300. Further, the Virginia Company was nearly bankrupt. King James I finally revoked the company charter and took direct control. Now known as Virginia, the colony became England’s ﬁrst royal colony. 
Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay
About 500 miles to the north of Jamestown, English settlers founded two other colonies, Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay, in the region that became known as New England. While many of the settlers in these colonies came as indentured servants in search of economic opportunity, the distinctive force that set the tone for these colonies was religious motivation, the search for wealth. Both were settled by English Protestants who dissented from the government-supported Church of England, known as the Anglican Church. The Church of England, lead by the English king, had broken away from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534. However, it had kept most of the Catholic rituals and governing structure. The dissenters, influenced by the teachings of Swiss theologian John Calvin, charged that the Church of England should break completely with Rome. England’s King James I, who reigned from 1603 to 1625, viewed the religious dissenters as a threat to his religious and political authority and ordered them arrested and jailed.
40 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Plymouth Colony The radical dissenters, the Separatists , wanted to 
organize a completely separate church that was independent of royal control. 
Several hundred Separatists left England for Holland in search of religious freedom. Because of their travels, they became known as Pilgrims. Economic hardship and cultural differences with the Dutch led many of the Pilgrims to seek another haven for their religion. They chose the new colony in America, then operated by the Virginia Company of London. In 1620, a small group of Pilgrims set sail for Virginia aboard the Mayﬂower . Fewer than half of the 
100 passengers on this ship were Separatists; the rest were people who had economic motives for making the voyage.
After a hard voyage that lasted 65 days, the Mayﬂower  dropped anchor 
off the Massachusetts coast, 600 miles north of Virginia. Rather than sail to 
Jamestown as planned, the Pilgrims established a new colony at Plymouth.
After a ﬁrst winter that saw half the settlers perish, the survivors were 
helped by local American Indians to adapt to the land. They celebrated a good 
harvest at a thanksgiving feast (the ﬁrst Thanksgiving) in 1621. Strong leaders, including Captain Miles Standish and Governor William Bradford, grew Plymouth slowly. Fish, furs, and lumber became the mainstays of the economy.
Massachusetts Bay Colony A group of more moderate dissenters, called 
Puritans, believed that the Church of England could be reformed, or purified. The persecution of Puritans increased when a new king, Charles I, took the throne in 1625. Seeking religious freedom, a group of Puritans gained a royal charter for the Massachusetts Bay Company (1629).
In 1630, a thousand Puritans led by John Winthrop sailed for Massachusetts 
and founded Boston. Religious and political conflict in England in the 1630s drove some 15,000 settlers to the Massachusetts Bay Colony—a movement known as the Great Migration (The same term is used for the movement of 
African Americans from southern to northern states in the 20th century.)
Puritans from Massachusetts Bay founded several settlements in New 
England. In contrast to the plantations in Virginia, these New England settlements were mixtures of small towns and family farms that relied on a blend of commerce and agriculture.
Religious Issues in Maryland
In 1632, King Charles I split off part of Virginia to create a new colony, Maryland. He granted control of it to George Calvert (Lord Baltimore), a Catholic noble, for his service to the king. Maryland was the ﬁrst proprietary colony. The king expected proprietors to carry out his wishes faithfully, thus giving him control.
The ﬁrst Lord Baltimore died and Maryland passed to his son, Cecil 
Calvert —the second Lord Baltimore. The son set about implementing his 
father’s plan in 1634 to provide a haven for his fellow Catholics, who faced persecution from Protestants in Britain.
Act of T oleration  To avoid persecution in England, several wealthy 
Catholics emigrated to Maryland and established plantations. However, they 
41  TOPIC 2.3   THE REGIONS OF BRITISH COLONIESwere quickly outnumbered by Protestant farmers who held a majority in 
Maryland’s assembly. In 1649, Calvert persuaded the assembly to adopt the Act of T oleration , the ﬁrst colonial statute granting religious freedom to all 
Christians. However, the statute also called for the death of anyone who denied the divinity of Jesus. 
Protestant Revolt  In the late 1600s, Protestants angered by a Catholic 
proprietor ignited a civil war. The Protestants triumphed, and they repealed the Act of Toleration. Catholics lost the right to vote in elections for the assembly. In the 18th century, Maryland’s economy and society was like that of Virginia, except that Maryland tolerated more diversity among Protestant sects. 
Development of New England
Strong religious convictions sustained settlers in their struggle to establish the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies. However, Puritan leaders showed intolerance of anyone who questioned their religious teachings, often banishing dissidents from the Bay colony. These dissidents formed settlements that became Rhode Island and Connecticut.

42 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONRhode Island One well-respected Puritan minister who moved from 
England to Boston was Roger Williams, who arrived in 1631. He believed 
that the individual’s conscience was beyond the control of any civil or church authority. His teachings placed him in conﬂict with other Puritan leaders, who ordered his banishment. Leaving Boston, Williams ﬂed southward to Narragansett Bay, where he and a few followers founded the community of Providence  in 1636, and Williams started one of the ﬁrst Baptist churches in 
America. The government allowed Catholics, Quakers, and Jews to worship freely. Further, the new colony was unique in that it recognized the rights of American Indians and paid them for the use of their land. 
Another dissident who questioned the doctrines of the Puritan authorities 
was Anne Hutchinson. She believed in antinomianism —the idea that since 
individuals receive salvation through their faith alone, they were not required 
to follow traditional moral laws. Banished from the Bay colony, Hutchinson and her followers founded Portsmouth in 1638. A few years later, Hutchinson migrated to Long Island and was killed in an American Indian uprising. 
In 1644, Roger Williams was granted a charter from the Parliament that 
joined Providence and Portsmouth into a single colony, Rhode Island. Because this colony tolerated diverse beliefs, it served as a refuge for many. 
Connecticut To the west of Rhode Island, the Connecticut River Valley 
attracted others who were unhappy with the Massachusetts authorities. The Reverend Thomas Hooker led a large group of Boston Puritans into the 
valley and founded Hartford in 1636. The Hartford settlers then drew up 
the ﬁrst written constitution in American history, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut (1639). It established a representative government with a 
legislature elected by popular vote and a governor chosen by that legislature. 
South of Hartford, a second settlement in the Connecticut Valley was 
started by John Davenport in 1637 and given the name New Haven. In 1665, 
New Haven joined with Hartford to form Connecticut . The royal charter for 
Connecticut granted it a limited degree of self-government, including election of the governor. 
New Hampshire The last colony to be founded in New England was New 
Hampshire. Hoping to increase royal control over the colonies, King Charles II separated New Hampshire from the Massachusetts Bay colony in 1679 and made it a royal colony, subject to the authority of an appointed governor. 
Halfway Covenant To be a full member of a Puritan congregation, 
individuals needed to have a confirmed religious experience, a conversion. However, fewer members of the new native-born generation were having such experiences. To maintain the church’s inﬂuence and membership, a halfway covenant  was offered by some clergy so that people could become partial 
members even if they had not felt a conversion. Nevertheless, as the years passed, strict Puritan practices weakened in most New England communities in order to maintain church membership. 
43  TOPIC 2.3   THE REGIONS OF BRITISH COLONIESRestoration Colonies
New American colonies were founded in the late 17th century during a period 
known as the Restoration. The name refers to the restoration of the monarchy under King Charles II in 1660 following a brief period of republican rule under a Puritan leader, Oliver Cromwell.
The Carolinas
As a reward for helping him gain the throne, Charles II granted a huge tract of land between Virginia and Spanish Florida to eight nobles. In 1663, these nobles became the lord proprietors of the Carolinas. In 1729, two royal colonies, South Carolina and North Carolina, were formed from the original grant.

South Carolina In 1670, a few colonists from England and some planters 
from the island of Barbados founded Charleston, named for their king, Charles 
44 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONII. Initially, the southern economy was based on trading furs and providing 
food for the West Indies. By the middle of the 18th century, South Carolina’s large rice-growing plantations, worked by enslaved Africans, resembled the 
economy and culture of the West Indies. 
North Carolina Unlike South Carolina, the region that became North 
Carolina had few good harbors and poor transportation. As a result, it developed few large plantations and little reliance on slavery. It attracted farmers from Virginia and New England who established small, self-sufﬁcient tobacco farms. Some made use of indentured servants and enslaved Africans. North Carolina in the 18th century earned a reputation for democratic views and autonomy from British control. 
The Middle Colonies
The four colonies between New England and Virginia—New Y ork, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware—are often called the Middle Colonies. They had fertile land that attracted a relatively diverse group of European immigrants, good harbors where cities developed, and tolerant attitudes toward religion. 
New Y ork Charles II wished to consolidate holdings along the Atlantic 
coast and close the gap between the New England and the Chesapeake 
colonies. This required compelling the Dutch to give up New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island and the Hudson River Valley.  
In 1664, the king granted his brother, the Duke of Y ork (the future James 
II), the lands lying between Connecticut and Delaware Bay. James dispatched 
a force that easily took control of the Dutch colony from its governor, Peter Stuyvesant. He ordered his agents to rename the colony New Y ork, but to treat the Dutch settlers well by allowing them the freedom to worship as they pleased and to speak their own language. 
James also ordered new taxes, duties, and rents without the consent of a 
representative assembly. He insisted that no assembly should be allowed in his colony. Taxation without representation met strong opposition from the English-speaking settlers. In 1683, James did yield by allowing New Y ork’s governor to grant broad civil and political rights, including a representative assembly. 
New Jersey Believing that the territory of New Y ork was too large, James 
split it in 1664. He gave the section located between the Hudson River and 
Delaware Bay to Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. In 1674, one received West New Jersey and the other East New Jersey. To attract settlers, both made generous land offers and allowed religious freedom and an assembly. Eventually, they sold their interests to groups of Quakers. Land titles in the Jerseys changed hands often, and inaccurate property lines added to the general confusion. To settle matters, the crown decided in 1702 to combine the two Jerseys into a single royal colony: New Jersey. 
45  TOPIC 2.3   THE REGIONS OF BRITISH COLONIESPennsylvania, “The Holy Experiment” To the west of New Jersey lay 
a broad expanse of forested land that the royal family gave to a military and 
political leader, William Penn, in payment for a debt. The land became known as Penn’s woods, or Pennsylvania. 
When Penn died, he left the land to his son, also named William Penn. 
The son had joined a group of Christians who called themselves the Religious Society of Friends. Commonly known as Quakers, they were considered radical by most people in Britain and the colonies. They believed that religious authority was found within each person and not in the Bible nor in any outside source. This led them to support equality among all men and women and to reject violence and resist military service. Because their beliefs challenged authority, the Quakers of England were persecuted and jailed for their beliefs.
Penn hoped his colony would provide a religious refuge for Quakers and 
other persecuted people as well as generate income and profits for himself. He put his Quaker beliefs to the test by enacting liberal ideas in government. He provided a Frame of Government (1682–1683), which guaranteed a representative assembly elected by landowners, and a written constitution, the Charter of Liberties (1701), which guaranteed freedom of worship for 
all and unrestricted immigration. Unlike other colonial proprietors, who governed from England, Penn crossed the ocean to supervise the founding of Philadelphia on the Delaware River. He brought a plan for a grid pattern of streets, which was later imitated by other cities. He also attempted to treat the American Indians fairly and to not cheat them when purchasing their land. 
To attract settlers, Penn hired agents and published notices throughout 
Europe promising political and religious freedom and generous land terms. Penn’s lands along the Delaware River had previously been settled by several thousand Dutch and Swedish colonists, who eased the arrival of the newcomers. 
Delaware In 1702, Penn granted the lower three counties of Pennsylvania 
their own assembly. In effect, Delaware became a separate colony, even though 
its governor was the same as Pennsylvania’s until the American Revolution. 
Georgia, The Last Mainland Colony
In 1732, Georgia , the thirteenth and final British colony between Canada and 
the Caribbean, was chartered. It was the only colony to receive direct ﬁnancial 
support from the government. The British had two reasons to start a new southern colony:
• They wanted to create a defensive buffer to protect South Carolina plantations from the Spanish Florida.
• They wanted a place to send the thousands of people in England imprisoned for debt. Sending debtors to a colony would both relieve the overcrowded jails and provide a chance for people to start life over. 
Given a royal charter for a proprietary colony, a group of philanthropists 
led by James Oglethorpe founded Savannah in 1733. Oglethorpe, the colony’s ﬁrst governor, put into effect a plan for making the colony thrive. There were 
46 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONstrict regulations, including bans on drinking rum and slavery. Nevertheless, 
partly because of the constant threat of Spanish attack, the colony did not prosper. 
By 1752, Oglethorpe’s group gave up. Georgia was taken over by the British 
government and became a royal colony. Restrictions on rum and slavery were dropped. The colony grew slowly, adopting the plantation system of South Carolina. In 1776, Georgia was the smallest of the 13 colonies that rebelled against the British.
Early Political Institutions
Britain had difficulty exerting tight control over the colonies. The distance across the Atlantic was great enough that communication was slow. Further, Britain was often consumed by domestic upheavals and wars with France, so it paid little attention to the colonies. Because of these factors, self-rule began early in the colonies. 
A Representative Assembly in Virginia The Virginia Company 
encouraged settlement by guaranteeing to settlers the same rights as residents of England had, including representation in lawmaking. In 1619, Virginia’s colonists organized the ﬁrst representative assembly in America, the House of Burgesses. It was dominated by elite planters.
Representative Government in New England Aboard the Mayﬂower  in 
1620, the Pilgrims drew up and signed a document in which they pledged to make decisions by the will of the majority. Known as the Mayﬂower Compact , this was an early form of self-government and a rudimentary 
written constitution.
Throughout New England, then, communities held town meetings to 
debate local decisions and to elect members to colonial legislatures. Voting rights were relatively broad for the time. In Massachusetts Bay Colony, all freemen—male members of the Puritan Church—had the right to elect the colony’s governor and a representative assembly.
Limits to Colonial Democracy Despite these steps, most colonists other 
than male property owners were excluded from the political process. Females and landless males had few rights, indentured servants had practically no rights, and enslaved people had none. Many colonial governors ruled with autocratic or unlimited powers, answering only to the king or to those who provided the colonies’ ﬁnancial support. Thus, the gradual development of democratic ideas in the colonies coexisted with antidemocratic practices such as slavery and the widespread mistreatment of American Indians.

Topic 2.4
Transatlantic Trade
The sad truth is that without complex business partnerships between 
African elites and European traders . . . the slave trade to the New World 
would have been impossible.
Henry Louis Gates Jr., “Ending the Slavery Blame-Game, ” New York Times, 2010
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of transatlantic  
trade over time.
W hile the colonists had various reasons for settling in the Americas, such 
as an opportunity to practice their religious faith or an opportunity to search 
for wealth, the European nations that controlled the colonies looked at them to increase their power. A principal way to become stronger was through transatlantic trade.
Triangular Trade 
Merchant ships regularly followed a triangular, or three-part, route, that connected North America, Africa, and Europe in various ways. A typical voyage might begin in New England: 
• A ship would leave a port in New England carrying rum across the Atlantic to West Africa. There the rum would be traded for hundreds of captive Africans. 
• Next, the ship would set out on the horrendous Middle Passage. Those Africans who survived the voyage would be traded in the West Indies for sugarcane. 
• Third, completing the last side of the triangle, the ship returned to a New England port where the sugar would be sold to be made into rum.
Variations on the route included stops in England or Spain. Every trade provided the slave-trading entrepreneur a substantial proﬁt.
In the 17th century, English trade in enslaved Africans was first 
monopolized by the Royal African Company. However, by the late 17th century, the RAC could not supply as many enslaved Africans as demanded by colonial planters. Parliament ended the company’s monopoly on the slave trade, and New England merchants entered the lucrative business. 
50 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONMercantilism and the Empire
Most European kingdoms in the 17th century believed in mercantilism , the 
economic theory that a country’s wealth was determined by how much more 
it exported than it imported. Hence, governments tried to promote the sales of goods to other countries and to discourage purchases through tariffs. In a mercantilist system, colonies existed for one purpose only: to enrich the parent country. They were to provide raw materials to the parent country to promote that country’s industries. Spanish and French rulers had followed mercantilist policies from the start of colonization. England began applying them after the end of the English Civil War in 1651.
Acts of Trade and Navigation England’s government implemented a 
mercantilist policy with a series of Navigation Acts between 1650 and 1673, 
which established three rules for colonial trade: 
• Trade to and from the colonies could be carried only by English or 
colonial-built ships, operated only by English or colonial crews. 
• All goods imported into the colonies, except for some perishables, had to pass through ports in England. COLONIAL TRIANGULAR TRADE ROUTES

51  TOPIC 2.4   TRANSATLANTIC TRADE• Speciﬁed or “enumerated” goods from the colonies could be exported 
to England only. Tobacco was the original “enumerated” good, but over the years, the list was greatly expanded. 
Impact on the Colonies The Navigation Acts had mixed effects on the 
colonies. The acts aided New England shipbuilding, provided Chesapeake tobacco a monopoly in England, and provided English military forces to protect the colonies from any attacks by the French and Spanish. The triangular slave trade that connected the colonies and Africa was largely unaffected by increased regulations. 
However, the acts also severely limited the development of the colonial 
economy. Since colonists could not manufacture their own goods, they had to pay high prices for manufactured goods from England. Since Chesapeake farmers could sell their crops only to England, they had to accept low prices for their crops. For example, in the 1660s, low tobacco prices that resulted from high production brought hard times to the Chesapeake colonies, Maryland and Virginia. When Virginia’s House of Burgesses tried to raise tobacco prices, the merchants of London retaliated by raising their prices on goods exported to Virginia. 
Besides trading with Great Britain, colonists also continued to trade with 
American Indians for furs, food, and other goods. This created ongoing contact between settlers and the indigenous population, leading to cultural exchanges, particularly along the western frontier of the colonies. For example, some Indians adopted Christianity and some colonial men married Indian women. While intermarriage was uncommon, the resulting couple almost always lived in the Indian rather than the settler community. The famous marriage between Pocahontas and John Rolfe in Virginia was a rare exception of an Indian-settler couple who lived in Jamestown.
Enforcement of the Acts  While the theory of mercantilism  called 
for strict enforcement of trade regulations, the practice was quite different. England was normally very lax in enforcing regulations, a policy known as salutary neglect.  Several factors made enforcement difficult:
• The Atlantic Ocean separated the British government from the colonies, so exerting any authority from London over its distant possessions was challenging.
• England faced larger problems than regulating trade. Between 1642 and 1763, it was in constant turmoil. It went through the English Civil War, a revolution that replaced the monarch, and four wars with France. 
• Britain’s colonial agents were often corrupt. As a result, colonial merchants could evade regulations easily with well-placed bribes to those in charge of enforcing regulations. 
In retrospect, regulation might not have been necessary. Because of their 
close economic and cultural ties, England and its colonies were natural trading partners. The colonies had abundant natural resources that they probably would have sold mostly to the English with or without regulation. 
52 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Dominion of New England 
Occasionally, though, the crown would attempt to overcome resistance to its 
trade laws. In 1684, it revoked the charter of Massachusetts Bay because it had been the center of smuggling activity. Whatever economic advantages this and other efforts brought England were offset by their harm to English-colonial relations. Colonists resented the regulatory laws imposed by the government in London. Especially in New England, colonists defied the acts by smuggling goods from other countries.
A New King  A new king, James II, succeeded to the throne in 1685. He 
was determined to increase royal control over the colonies by combining them into larger administrative units and doing away with representative assemblies. In 1686, he combined New Y ork, New Jersey, and the various New England colonies into the Dominion of New England. Sir Edmund Andros was sent 
from England to serve as governor of the dominion. The new governor made himself instantly unpopular by levying taxes, limiting town meetings, and revoking land titles. 
Overthrow of the King James II did not remain in power for long as his 
attempts at asserting his powers led to an uprising. The Glorious Revolution  of 
1688 succeeded in deposing James and replacing him with William and Mary. James’s fall from power brought the Dominion of New England to an end, and the colonies again operated under separate charters. 
Ongoing Trade Tensions
After the Glorious Revolution, mercantilist policies remained in force, but the efforts to enforce them were never sustained enough to be effective. Until 1763, salutary neglect and colonial resistance to regulation continued. Regulation of trade, while not the only source of friction, would remain the fundamental problem between the colonists and England.

Interactions Between  
American Indians and Europeans 
Fifty-six years after the sailing of the Mayflower, the Pilgrims’ children 
had not only defeated the Pokanokets . . . they had taken conscious, 
methodical measures to purge the land of its people. 
Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War, 2006
Learning Objective : Explain how and why interactions between various 
European nations and American Indians changed over time.
From the very beginning Europeans saw each other as rivals for power in the 
Americas. In general, they viewed American Indians as inferior people who 
could be used as forced labors or pushed off their land, but also as potential allies in conflicts with other Europeans or other American Indians. 
In response, Native Americans who survived the devastation of European 
diseases defended themselves and their cultures. Sometimes various tribes joined together to resist Europeans. Other times, a particular tribe allied with one group of Europeans to fight another or to fight against a traditional tribal rival. For example, in 1626 in southern New Y ork, the Mahican Indians persuaded Dutch settlers to join in an attack on the Mohawk Indians.
Conflict in New England
In the 1640s, the New England colonies faced the constant threat of attack from American Indians, the Dutch, and the French. With England in the midst of a civil war, the colonists expected little assistance.
New England Confederation In 1643, four New England colonies 
(Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, and New Haven) organized for 
their mutual protection. They formed a military alliance known as the New England Confederation . The confederation was directed by a board composed 
of two representatives from each colony. It had limited powers to act on boundary disputes, the return of runaway servants, and dealings with American Indians. 
The confederation lasted until 1684, when colonial rivalries and renewed 
control by the English monarch brought this ﬁrst experiment in colonial 
cooperation to an end. Though it lasted only four decades, it established an important precedent for colonies taking uniﬁed action for a common purpose.
55  TOPIC 2.5   I NTERACTIONS BETWEEN AMERICAN INDIANS AND EUROPEANS   Metacom’s War (King Philip’s War) Only a few years before the 
confederation’s demise, it helped the New England colonists win a vicious war. 
In response to English settlers encroaching on the American Indians’ lands, a chief of the Wampanoag, Metacom, known to the colonists as King Philip, 
united many tribes in southern New England. Some tribes, such as the Mohegans and the Pequots, supported the colonists because of their long-standing rivalry with the Wampanoag. The resulting conflict was called Metacom’s War (1675–1676). In it, several villages were burned to the ground, hundreds of people were killed, and thousands of people were injured. Eventually, the colonial forces and their Indian allies prevailed, killing Metacom and ending most American Indian resistance in New England. 
Conflict in Virginia
Sir William Berkeley, the royal governor of Virginia (1641–1652; 1660–
1677), used dictatorial powers to govern on behalf of the large planters. He antagonized small farmers on Virginia’s western frontier because he failed to protect them from Indian attacks. 
Bacon’s Rebellion Nathaniel Bacon, an impoverished gentleman farmer, 
seized upon the grievances of the western farmers to lead a rebellion against Berkeley’s government. Bacon and others resented the control exercised by a few large planters in the Chesapeake area. He raised an army of volunteers and, in 1676, conducted a series of raids and massacres against American Indian villages on the frontier, including some who had friendly relationships with the colonial government. Berkeley’s government in Jamestown accused Bacon of rebelling against royal authority. Bacon’s army defeated the governor’s forces and burned the Jamestown settlement. Soon afterward, Bacon died of dysentery, and the rebel army collapsed. Governor Berkeley suppressed the remnants of the insurrection, executing 23 rebels.
This drawing of Bacon (center, left) confronting Berkeley (center, right) was created for a history textbook 
written in 1895.

in the Chesapeake and other colonies became more stable and prosperous.
Spanish Rule and the Pueblo Revolt
Spain’s economic policy for its colonies was based on forcing Native Americans to labor for them through the encomienda system (see Topic 1.5). In religion, Spain’s Roman Catholic missionaries followed an aggressive, sometimes harsh, program to convert Native Americans to Christianity. The pressure of these efforts led to the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Various tribes of Pueblo Indians, including the Hopi and Zuni, united against the Spanish. Hundreds of people died in the fighting, and the Spanish were driven from the area until 1692. However, after the Spanish regained control in 1692, they made some accommodations to the American Indians in the region. By ruling less harshly, the Spanish found greater stability.

Topic 2.6
Slavery in the British Colonies
In every human Breast, God has implanted a Principle,  
which we call Love of Freedom.
Phillis Wheatley, “A Principle Which We Call Love of Freedom, ” 1774
Learning Objective 1 : Explain the causes and effects of slavery in the 
various British colonial regions.
Learning Objective 2 : Explain how enslaved people responded to 
slavery.
W ith the colonial emphasis on agriculture came a demand for labor. Since 
the Native Americans could escape too easily and the supply of indentured 
servants was too small, landowners looked for another source of workers. They turned to the labor of enslaved Africans, especially in the southern colonies. The transatlantic slave trade (see Topic 2.4) was important to the economy, and much of the trade was financed or conducted by people in the northern colonies.
Demand for Labor
In Maryland and Virginia, landowners saw great opportunities for profit because of the European demand for tobacco. They could get land by taking it or trading for it from the American Indians. But they could not find enough laborers willing to work for low wages. The high death rate from disease, food shortages, and battles with American Indians meant that the population of colonists grew slowly. Landowners tried several ways to find the workers they wanted. 
Indentured Servants The early colonists of the Virginia Company were 
struggling to survive and too poor to purchase enslaved Africans as the owners of sugar plantations in the West Indies did. Instead, the Virginia Company hoped to meet the desire for labor using indentured servants. Under contract with a master or landowner who paid for their passage, those from the British Isles agreed to work for a speciﬁed period—usually four to seven years—in return for room and board. Indentured servants were under the absolute rule of their masters until the end of their work period. At the end of that period, they gained their freedom and could work for wages or obtain land of their own. For landowners, the system provided laborers, but only temporarily.
60 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONHeadright System Virginia attempted to attract immigrants through 
offers of land. It offered 50 acres of land to each immigrant who paid for his 
own passage and to any plantation owner who paid for an immigrant’s passage. 
The Institution of Slavery
In 1619, an English ship serving the Dutch government sold an unusual group of about 25 indentured servants to Virginia: the servants were Black Africans. 
These first Africans in Virginia were not in life bondage, and children born to them were free. However, this soon changed. By the end of the 1660s, the Virginia House of Burgesses enacted laws that kept Africans and their offspring in permanent bondage. They were enslaved. 
By the early 18th century, the number of enslaved people and laws to 
control them had greatly expanded. All British colonies included at least some enslaved laborers. The fewest were in New England, where small farmers had little demand for additional workers. More were in the Middle Colonies, particularly in the port cities, where African Americans often worked loading and unloading ships and as sailors. Most were in the southern colonies, working on plantations. By 1750, half of Virginia’s population and two-thirds of South Carolina’s population were enslaved. 
The British colonies with the highest number of enslaved people were the 
West Indian sugar islands. During the course of American slavery , about 95 
percent of enslaved Africans were delivered to the West Indies or Brazil. Less than 5 percent went to the British colonies in North America.
Increased Demand for Enslaved Africans Several factors explain why 
slavery became increasingly important, especially in the southern colonies: 
• Reduced migration: Increases in wages in England reduced the supply of 
immigrants to the colonies. 
• Dependable workforce: Large plantation owners were disturbed by the political demands of small farmers and indentured servants and by the disorders of Bacon’s Rebellion (see Topic 2.5). They thought that slavery would provide a stable labor force totally under their control. 
• Low-cost labor: As tobacco prices fell (see Topic 2.4), rice and indigo became the most proﬁtable crops. To grow such crops required a large land area and many inexpensive, relatively unskilled ﬁeld hands. 
This increased demand also supported the active, profitable, and ruthless 
triangular trade (see Topic 2.4). 
Slave Laws  As the number of enslaved workers increased, White colonists 
adopted laws to ensure that they would be held in bondage for life and that slave status would be inherited. In 1641, Massachusetts became the ﬁrst colony to recognize the enslavement of “lawful” captives. Virginia in 1661 enacted legislation that children automatically inherited their mother’s enslaved status for life. By 1664, the English law that people baptized as Christians could not be enslaved was being overturned. Maryland declared that baptism did not affect 
61  TOPIC 2.6   S LAVERY IN THE BRITISH COLONIESthe enslaved person’s status and that White women could not marry African 
American men. As slavery became common, Whites began to regard all Blacks as inferior. Racism and slavery evolved into integral parts of colonial society. 
Resistance to Slavery Although very difficult, many Africans challenged 
enslavement. They struggled to maintain family ties, even though slaveowners could break up a family by selling off a husband or a wife or a child at any time. Even as many adopted Christianity, they kept elements of the African religious practices they had brought with them. They used songs and storytelling to maintain traditions and customs. They resisted slavery through direct action such as going on hunger strikes, breaking tools, refusing to work, or fleeing—even if they knew they would likely be caught and punished harshly. The owners’ concern over slave resistance was reflected over the years in the enactment of new laws to control them.

Colonial Society and Culture
I assert that nothing ever comes to pass without a cause.
Jonathan Edwards, The Freedom of Will, 1754
Learning Objective 1 : Explain how and why the movement of a variety 
of people and ideas across the Atlantic contributed to the development of 
American culture over time.
Learning Objective 2 : Explain how and why the different goals and 
interests of European leaders and colonists affected how they viewed themselves and their relationship with Britain.
The struggling English colonial villages at the start of the 17th century 
evolved by the middle of the 18th century to develop a culture distinct from 
any in Europe. If Americans in the 18th century constituted a new kind of society, what were its characteristics and what forces shaped its “new people”?
Population Growth
In 1701, the English colonies on the Atlantic coast consisted of barely 250,000 Europeans and Africans. By 1775, the population was 2,500,000 people. Among African Americans, the increase was more dramatic: from about 28,000 in 1701 to 500,000 in 1775. The spectacular gains in population resulted from two factors: immigration of almost 1 million people and a sharp natural increase, caused by a high birthrate among colonial families. An abundance of fertile land and a dependable food supply attracted thousands of Europeans and supported the raising of large families.
European Immigrants 
Newcomers to the British colonies came not only from England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, but also from western and central Europe. Many immigrants, most of whom were Protestants, came from the kingdom of France and various German-speaking states. Many were fleeing religious persecution and wars, while others were searching for economic opportunity as farmers, artisans, or merchants. Most immigrants settled in the middle colonies (Pennsylvania, New Y ork, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware) and on the western frontier 
64 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONof the southern colonies (Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia). Few headed for 
New England where land was limited and Puritans dominated.
English Settlers from England continued to come to the American 
colonies. However, with fewer problems at home, their numbers were relatively 
small.
Germans This group settled chiefly on the farmlands west of Philadelphia, 
an area that became known as Pennsylvania Dutch country. They maintained 
their German language, customs, and religious beliefs as Lutherans, Amish, Brethren, or Mennonites. They obeyed colonial laws but took little interest in English politics. By 1775, people of German stock comprised 6 percent of the colonial population.
Scotch-Irish These English-speaking people were Protestants who came 
from northern Ireland. Their ancestors had moved to Ireland from Scotland, and they were known as the Scotch-Irish or Scots-Irish. They had little respect for the British, who had pressured them to leave Ireland. Most settled along the frontier in western Pennsylvania, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. By 1775, they comprised 7 percent of the population.
Other Europeans Other groups included French Protestants (known as 
Huguenots), the Dutch , and the Swedes . These groups made up 5 percent of 
the population.
Enslaved Africans
The largest single group of people entering the English colonies did not come to America by choice. They were Africans who had been taken captive, forced onto European ships, and sold as enslaved laborers. They worked a range of occupations, such as laborer, bricklayer, or blacksmith, but the most common work was as field laborers on plantations. By 1775, African Americans (enslaved and free) made up 20 percent of the colonial population. Most lived in the southern colonies, and enslaved people formed a majority of the population in South Carolina and Georgia.
A few Africans obtained their freedom. They were either emancipated 
by their owner or allowed to work for money and to purchase their freedom. However, every colony passed laws that discriminated against African Americans.
American Indians
Colonial population growth created conflicts between settlers and American Indians already living in a region. Some American Indians formed alliances to protect their land, such as the Powhaten Confederation in Virginia and the Iroquois Confederation in the Great Lakes region. Others used European settlers as allies in their conflicts with rival tribes. Among the most peaceful relations between American Indians and settlers were those in Pennsylvania. William Penn often obtained land through treaties rather than violence. This frieze showing William Penn

The Structure of Colonial Society
Each of the 13 British colonies developed distinct patterns of life. However, they 
all also shared a number of characteristics. For example, most of the population was English in origin, language, and tradition. In all colonies, both Africans and non-English immigrants brought diverse influences that modified the culture of the majority in significant ways. 
Liberty and Opportunity
The colonies also offered people more self-determination than they found in Europe. This was evident in both religion and the economy.
Religious Toleration All of the colonies permitted the practice of 
different religions, but with varying degrees of freedom. Massachusetts, the most restrictive, accepted several types of Protestants, but it excluded Roman Catholics and all non-Christians. Rhode Island and Pennsylvania were the most open. Pennsylvania accepted all who believed in God, including Jews. However, only Christians could participate in government.
No Hereditary Aristocracy The extremes of Europe, with very wealthy 
nobility and masses of hungry poor, were missing in the colonies. A narrower class system, based on economics, was developing. Wealthy landowners were at the top; craft workers and small farmers made up the majority of people.
Social Mobility In all colonies, White residents had an opportunity to 
improve their standard of living and status by hard work. Acquiring land was much easier than in Europe.
The Family
The family was the center of colonial life. With an expanding economy and ample food supply, people married younger and reared more children than in Europe. More than 90 percent of the people lived on farms. While life was hard, most colonists had a higher standard of living than did most Europeans.
Men  Besides working as farmers or artisans, men could own property and 
participate in politics. The law gave the husband almost unlimited power in the home, including the right to beat his wife.
66 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONWomen  A colonial woman bore an average of eight children, many 
of whom would die at birth or in infancy. She performed multiple tasks 
including cooking, cleaning, making clothes, providing medical care, and educating children. She often worked next to her husband in the shop, on the plantation, or on the farm. Divorce was legal but rare, and women had limited legal and political rights. Y et the shared labors and mutual dependence with their husbands gave most women protection from abuse and an active role in decision making.
The Economy
By the 1750s, half of Britain’s world trade was with its American colonies. The government limited colonial manufacturing, such as making textiles. The rich American land and British mercantilist policy produced colonies almost entirely engaged in agriculture, forestry, and fishing. 
As communities grew, more people became ministers, lawyers, doctors, and 
teachers. The quickest route to wealth was land, although regional geography often provided distinct opportunities for hardworking colonists. 
New England Rocky soil and long winters limited most people to 
subsistence farming, producing just enough for the family. Most farms were small—less than 100 acres—and work was done by family and an occasional hired laborer. The descendants of the Puritans profited from logging, shipbuilding, fishing, trading, and rum-distilling.
Middle Colonies Rich soil produced an abundance of wheat and corn for 
export to Europe and the West Indies. Farms of up to 200 acres were common. Often indentured servants and hired laborers worked with the farm families. A variety of small manufacturing efforts developed, including iron-making. Trading led to the growth of cities such as Philadelphia and New Y ork. In 1750, Philadelphia was the largest city in the colonies, with a population of about 25,000 people.
Southern Colonies Because of the diverse geography and climate in these 
colonies, agriculture varied greatly. Most people lived on small subsistence family farms without slaves. A few lived on large plantations of more than 2,000 acres relying on slave labor. Colonial plantations were self-sufficient, growing their own food and using enslaved craftworkers. Products were tobacco in the Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies, timber and naval stores (tar and pitch) in the Carolinas, and rice and indigo in South Carolina and Georgia. Most plantations were located on rivers so they could ship exports to Europe.
Monetary System One way the British controlled the colonial economy 
was to limit the use of money. These limits forced colonies to use their limited gold and silver to pay for British imports that exceeded the value of colonial exports. To provide currency for domestic trade, many colonies issued paper money. However, they often issued too much money, causing it to decline in value, a process called inflation. The British government also claimed the right to veto any colonial laws that might harm British merchants. 
67  TOPIC 2.7   C OLONIAL SOCIETY AND CULTURETransportation Transporting goods by water was easier than over land 
on poor roads. Trading centers such as Boston, New Y ork, Philadelphia, and 
Charleston were located on the sites of good harbors and navigable rivers. Gradually overland travel by horse and stagecoach became more common in the 18th century. Taverns provided food and lodging for travelers and served as social centers where people exchanged news and discussed politics. By the mid-18th century, the colonies ran a postal system using horses and small ships.
Religion
Most colonists were Protestants, but each region had some religious diversity: 
• In New England, most people were Congregationalists (Puritans) or Presbyterians. 
• In New Y ork, people of Dutch descent often attended the Reformed Church. Most others belonged to the Church of England and were known as Anglicans (and later, Episcopalians). 
• In Pennsylvania, Lutherans, Mennonites, and Quakers were common. 
• In Virginia and other southern colonies, Anglicans were dominant. Maryland included many Catholics and some Jews.
Challenges Each religious group, even the Protestants who dominated, 
faced problems. Jews, Catholics, and Quakers suffered from intense discrimination. Congregationalist ministers were criticized as domineering. Many people resented the Church of England and saw it as a symbol of English control because it was headed by the king. 
Established Churches In the 17th century, most colonial governments 
taxed the people to support a particular Protestant denomination, an established church. As various immigrants increased the religious diversity, governments gradually reduced their support of churches. However, some direct tax support of some New England churches remained until the 1830s. 
The Great Awakening
By the early 18th century, sermons in Protestant churches tended to portray God as the creator of a perfect universe. Ministers gave less emphasis than their ancestors to human sinfulness and damnation. In the 1730s and 1740s, however, a dramatic change swept the colonies. This was the Great Awakening, a movement of fervent expressions of religious feeling among the masses.
Jonathan Edwards Among the best-known leaders of the Great 
Awakening was a Congregational minister from Massachusetts, Reverend Jonathan Edwards. When he first gave his sermon “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” to his own congregation, it excited little emotion. However, as he traveled and delivered it elsewhere it generated a fervent response. Invoking the vivid language of the Old Testament, Edwards presented a God that was angry with human sinfulness. Individuals who deeply repented would be saved, but those who ignored God’s commandments would suffer eternal damnation.
68 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONGeorge Whitefield  Beginning in 1739, George Whitefield spread the 
Great Awakening throughout the colonies, attracting audiences of 10,000 
people. In barns, tents, and fields, he stressed that God was all-powerful and would save only those who openly professed belief in Jesus Christ. Those who did not would be damned to hell. Whitefield taught that ordinary people with faith and sincerity could understand the gospels without ministers to lead them. 
Religious Impact The Great Awakening had a profound effect on religious 
practice. As sinners confessed their guilt and then joyously exulted in accepting salvation, emotionalism became more common in Protestant services. This caused splits in some denominations, such as the Congregationalists and Presbyterians, between supporters (“New Lights”) and opponents (“Old Lights”) of the new expressiveness of feeling. As people studied the Bible in their homes, ministers lost some authority over them. As a consequence, evangelical sects such as the Baptists and Methodists that often relied on traveling ministers attracted large numbers of new members. As the Great Awakening spread, new denominations challenged the Congregationalists and Anglicans. One result was that people called for stricter separation of church and state.
Political Influence The Great Awakening was one of the first common 
experiences shared by colonists as Americans. It had a democratizing effect by changing the way people viewed authority. If people made their own religious decisions without the “higher” authority of ministers, then could they also make their own political decisions without deferring to others? This revolutionary idea was not expressed in the 1740s, but 30 years later it would challenge the authority of a king and his royal governors.
Cultural Life
In the early 1600s, the chief concern of most colonists was survival. However, 100 years later, the colonial population had grown enough that the arts could flourish, at least among the well-to-do southern planters and northern merchants. 
Achievements in the Arts and Sciences
In the coastal areas, as fear of American Indians faded, people displayed their prosperity by adopting architectural and decorative styles from England. 
Architecture The Georgian style of London was widely imitated in 
houses, churches, and public buildings. Brick and stucco homes were built in this style along the eastern seaboard. On the frontier, a one-room log cabin was the common shelter.
Painting  Many colonial painters were itinerant artists who traveled the 
country in search of families who wanted their portraits painted. Shortly before the Revolution, two American artists, Benjamin West and John Copley , went 
to England where they established themselves as prominent artists.
69  TOPIC 2.7   C OLONIAL SOCIETY AND CULTURELiterature  With only a few printing facilities available, most authors wrote 
on serious subjects, chiefly religion and politics in the 18th century. These 
authors included Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards on religion. Political writings highlighting the conflict between American rights and English authority came from John Adams, James Otis, John Dickinson, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson, among others. The most popular writer was Benjamin Franklin. His witty aphorisms and advice were collected in Poor Richard’s Almanack , a best-selling book that was annually revised from 1732 to 1757.
The lack of support for fiction and poetry did not stop everyone. Phillis 
Wheatley was born in West Africa, enslaved, and living in Boston when she published a collection of her poems in 1773. She was freed soon after this. Her work is noteworthy both for her triumph over slavery and the quality of her verse. Charles Brockden Brown, a Quaker who was born in Philadelphia in 1771, was one of the first novelists to set his stories in North America. 
Science Most scientists, such as the botanist John Bartram  of Philadelphia, 
were self-taught. Benjamin Franklin won fame for his work with electricity and his developments of bifocal eyeglasses and the Franklin stove.
Education
Basic education was limited and varied among the colonies. Formal efforts were directed to males, since females were trained only for household work.
Elementary Education  In New England, the Puritans’ emphasis on 
reading the Bible led them to create the first tax-supported schools. A Massachusetts law in 1647 required towns to establish primary schools for boys. In the middle colonies, schools were either church-sponsored or private. In the southern colonies, parents gave their children whatever education they could. On plantations, tutors provided instruction for the owners’ children. 
Higher Education  The first colonial colleges were sectarian , promoting 
the doctrines of a particular religious group. The Puritans founded Harvard in 1636 to prepare ministers. The Anglicans opened William and Mary in Virginia in 1694, and the Congregationalists started Y ale in Connecticut in 1701. During this period the only nonsectarian college founded was the College of Philadelphia. Founded in 1765, it later became the University of Pennsylvania. Benjamin Franklin was among its founders.
Ministry During the 17th century, the Christian ministry was the only 
profession to enjoy widespread respect among the common people. Ministers were often the only well-educated people in a small community.
Physicians  Colonists who fell prey to epidemics of smallpox and diphtheria 
were often treated by “cures” that only made them worse. A doctor’s training was as an apprentice to an experienced physician. The first medical college was begun in 1765 as part of Franklin’s idea for the College of Philadelphia.
Lawyers  During the 1700s, as trade expanded and legal problems became 
more complex, people felt a need for expert assistance in court. The most able 
70 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONlawyers formed a bar (committee or board), which set rules and standards 
for young lawyers. Lawyers  gained respect in the 1760s and 1770s when they 
argued for colonial rights. John Adams, James Otis, and Patrick Henry were lawyers whose legal arguments would ultimately provide the intellectual underpinnings of the American Revolution.
The Press
News spread mainly through a postal system and local printing firms. 
Newspapers  By 1776, there were more than 40 newspapers issued weekly 
in the colonies. They provided month-old news from Europe, various ads for goods and services and for the return of runaway indentured servants and enslaved people, and pious essays giving advice for better living. 
The Zenger Case Newspaper printers in colonial days ran the risk of being 
jailed for libel if any article offended the authorities. English common law at the time stated that it was a crime to criticize the governor, no matter whether the criticism was true or false. In 1735, John Peter Zenger, a New Y ork publisher, was tried on a charge of libelously criticizing New Y ork’s royal governor. Zenger’s lawyer, Andrew Hamilton, argued that his client had printed the truth. 
Ignoring the law, the jury acquitted Zenger. While this case did not guarantee freedom of the press, it encouraged newspapers to criticize the government. 
The Enlightenment
In the 18th century, some educated Americans felt attracted to a European movement in literature and philosophy known as the Enlightenment. The leaders of this movement believed that the recent past was a “dark” era in which people relied too much on tradition and God’s intervention in human life. They believed that the “light” of reason could solve most of humanity’s problems.
A major inﬂuence on the Enlightenment and American thinking was 
John Locke, a 17th-century English philosopher. Locke, in his Two Treatises of Government, reasoned that while the state (the government) is supreme, it is bound to follow “natural laws” based on the rights that people have simply because they are human. He argued that sovereignty ultimately resides with the people rather than with the state. Furthermore, citizens had a right and obligation to revolt against a government that failed to protect their rights. Other Enlightenment philosophers adopted and expounded on Locke’s ideas. His stress on natural rights would provide a rationale for the American Revolution and the principles of the U.S. Constitution.
The Colonial Relationship with Britain
For all their diversity, in some ways, the colonies were becoming more like England. They built on English political traditions to develop self-governing local communities. Most colonists spoke English and could read the books and newspapers in the colonies. Many had commercial ties with England, either exporting tobacco or importing manufactured goods. Most colonists, including Puritans, Quakers, and Anglicans, were connected to England by religion.
71  TOPIC 2.7   C OLONIAL SOCIETY AND CULTUREColonial Identity  At the same time, the colonists were developing a 
distinctly American viewpoint and way of life. Their motivations for leaving 
Europe, the English political heritage, the diverse mixture of people, the emergence of writers and painters, and the influence of the American natural environment combined to create a culture unlike any in Europe. The colonists —especially White male property owners—exercised the rights of free speech and a free press, became accustomed to electing representatives to colonial assemblies, and tolerated a variety of religions. Observers were beginning to think of Americans as restless, enterprising, practical, and forever seeking to improve their circumstances.
Mistrust of the British Development of a colonial identity reflected 
diverging interests between the colonies and Great Britain. Colonists were eager to push westward, while the British desired peace on the frontier with American Indians. Colonists were comfortable with salutary neglect, while the British sometimes tried to enforce trade regulations. Colonists took pride in governing themselves according to English traditions of liberty, while the British claimed sovereignty over them as part of the empire. Finally, colonies were more ethnically and religiously diverse than England, which meant that many colonists did not identify from birth with the country that ruled them. These differences would become stronger after 1763. 
Politics and Government
By 1750, the colonies had similar systems of government, with a governor as chief executive and a legislature voting to adopt or reject the governor’s proposed laws. In every colony, the legislature consisted of two houses:
• Members of the lower house, or assembly, were elected by White male property owners. It voted for or against new taxes. Colonists thus became accustomed to paying taxes only if their chosen representatives approved. 
• Members of the upper house in the two self-governing colonies were also elected. In the other colonies, members were appointed by the king or the proprietor, and were also known as the council.
• Governors were either appointed by the crown, elected by the people (Rhode Island and Connecticut), or appointed by a proprietor (Pennsylvania and Maryland).
Local Government Colonists in New England established towns and 
villages. In these, the local government was the town meeting in which people would regularly come together to vote directly on public issues. In the southern colonies, where farms and plantations were more widely separated, towns were less common. Local government was carried on by a law-enforcing sheriff and other officials who served a large territory called a county. 
Voting  If democracy is defined as the participation of all people in the 
making of government policy, then colonial democracy was limited. Laws barred most people—White women, poor White men, slaves of both sexes, 
72 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONand most free Blacks—from voting. Nevertheless, the government was 
beginning to remove some barriers to voting in the 18th century. In particular, religious restrictions were declining. Property qualifications often remained.
Another variable in the development of democracy was who could serve in 
the assemblies and councils. In Virginia, the House of Burgesses was restricted to a small group of wealthy landowners. However, in Massachusetts, the legislature was open to small farmers. Even there, the educated, propertied elite held power for generations. The common people everywhere tended to defer to their “betters” and depend upon the privileged few to make decisions.
Political life in the colonies was restricted to landowning White males 
only. Y et, compared with Europe, the English colonies allowed greater self-government. This made the colonial political system unusual for its time.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WAS COLONIAL SOCIETY DEMOCRATIC?
Was colonial America “democratic” or not? The question is important for its own sake and also because it affects one’s perspective on the American Revolution and on the subsequent evolution of democratic politics in the United States. 
Democracy in Action Many historians have focused on the politics of 
colonial Massachusetts. Some have concluded that colonial Massachusetts was indeed democratic, at least for the times. By studying voting records and statistics, they determined that the vast majority of White male citizens could vote and were not restricted by property qualifications. According to these historians, class differences between the elite and the masses of people did not prevent the latter from participating fully in colonial politics. 
Consensus over Conflict Other historians question whether broad voting 
rights by themselves demonstrate the existence of real democracy. The true test of democratic practice, they argue, would be whether different groups in a colonial town felt free to debate political questions in a town meeting. In the records of such meetings, they found little evidence of true political conflict and debate. Instead, they found that the purpose of town meetings in colonial days was to reach a consensus and to avoid conflict and real choices. These historians believe that consensus-forming limited the degree of democracy. 
The Maritime Elite A third historical perspective is based on studies of 
economic change in colonial Boston. According to this view, a fundamental shift from an agrarian to a maritime economy occurred in the 18th century. In the process, a new elite emerged to dominate Boston’s finances, society, and politics. The power of this elite prevented colonial Massachusetts from being considered a true democracy.
The question remains: To what extent were Massachusetts and the other 
colonies democratic? The answer depends on the definition of democracy.
Support an Argument Explain two perspectives on the degree of democracy practiced 
in the British colonies.

75  TOPIC 2.8   C OMPARISONS IN PERIOD 2 
Topic 2.8
Comparisons in Period 2 
Learning Objective : Compare the effects of the development of colonial 
society in the various regions of North America.
The reasoning skill of “comparison” is the suggested focus for evaluating the 
content of this period. Historians often compare various European colonial 
systems or various British colonies. As explained in Topic 2.1, there are many factors to consider in the broad topic of the influences on the development of society in the 13 colonies from 1607 to 1754. On the AP exam, a question might be focused on any one factor such as migration, the North American environment, interaction with Native Americans, or British expectations to list but a few of the factors.
In an effort to “Explain the extent to which the British colonies were 
involved in political, cultural, and economic exchanges with Great Britain, ” one could show that from the very beginning the colonialists questioned the British government’s control while asking for their support and mirroring much of their culture.
One could show that, economically, the British policy of mercantilism 
dictated what the colonies could produce and with whom they could trade. This is specific evidence of an economic factor that negated colonial use of all their available resources that produced “enumerated” goods. One can take other specific evidence to demonstrate the complexity of the relationship between Britain and the colonies. For example, one could compare the colonial desire for government support to drive away the Native Americans to the colonial view of mercantilism. 
Further evidence can support the argument that in the 17th century the 
colonies had an evolving relationship with Britain. One element that could be compared is religion. How did the influence of the British-led Church of England compare with that of the Puritans, Quakers, and Catholics who played active roles in starting specific colonies? One might consider several plausible arguments and then decide which one is best supported by the evidence: 
• Colonial culture was more tolerant of religious diversity than was British culture.
• People in the colonies carried on the same religious conflicts that existed in Great Britain.
• Colonists held similar ideas about religious toleration as the British did, but circumstances led them to act more tolerantly.

QUESTIONS ABOUT COMPARISON
1. Explain the extent to which the 13 colonies developed differently during 
the 17th century. For example, compare the people who settled the specific colonies as well as the available resources and support they had. 
2. Explain the influence of British political, cultural, and economic views on the development of the 13 colonies. For example, compare how the British and colonists viewed mercantilism, representative government, and religion among many possible areas of interaction.
3. Explain the extent to which the various conditions in the English colonies led to the development of a unique system of slavery. For example, compare the influence of the colonial economy, geography, and population on the enslaving of Africans.
77  TOPIC 2.8   C OMPARISONS IN PERIOD 2 THINK AS A HISTORIAN:  ARGUMENTATION
Historians do more than repeat facts and quotations. They also develop 
arguments. Argumentation means using reasons and evidence effectively to make a point. The first part of an argument is making a claim. That means making a statement that can be proved or disproved.
Y ou may have made claims in English class or speech class. For example, 
maybe you argued “Schools should require students to wear uniforms. ” Or perhaps your topic was “The city should ban single-use plastic bottles. ” 
Historians’ claims are more robust and demanding than these. A historian’s 
claim must be historically defensible. That means there are specific and relevant facts, statistics, records, or accounts that support the claim.
Evaluate this claim: “The original thirteen colonies were based on 
republican ideals that persist in the United States to this day. ” Is this claim historically defensible? To decide, you’ll need to evaluate the evidence. Then you will need to consider whether the claim can be proved or disproved. 
On one hand, colonial governments included elections. On the other 
hand, most people today would not consider any of those colonies to be very inclusive. That’s because the colonies excluded most people from voting—including women, men who did not own property, indentured servants, and enslaved people. 
Historians consult secondary sources, including works by other historians, 
to help them make claims and develop arguments. However, only primary sources provide the actual words of people who were alive at the time. 
How could a historian prove the claim that the colonies were based 
on republican ideals? He or she might quote from documents such as the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, the first written constitution in American history. To disprove that same claim, a historian might quote from letters by indentured servants or women. Voting records would be valuable sources to historians on either side of the issue. 
• For each claim listed below, tell whether it is historically defensible and describe sources you would search for to prove or disprove the claim.
1. Native Americans’ escape from enslavement changed not only the colonies’ economies but also world history.
2. Britain’s salutary neglect ended up having negative outcomes for its colonies.
3. Metacom’s War marked the end of most Native American resistance in New England. However, it was not the end of Native American influence on that region.
4. The large numbers of children that colonial women bore affected the wealth and development of colonial economies.
5. In the 13 colonies, owning land was the likeliest way to become wealthy.

[On] the subject of uniting the colonies more intimately with Great Britain by 
allowing them representatives in Parliament, I have something further considered that matter and am of opinion that such a union would be very acceptable to the colonies, provided they had a reasonable number of representatives allowed them; and that all the old acts Parliament restraining the trade or cramping the manu-facturers of the colonies be at the same time repealed. . . . 
I should hope, too, that by such a union the people of Great Britain and the 
people of the colonies would learn to consider themselves as not belonging to dif-ferent community with different interests but to one community with one interest, which I imagine, would contribute to strengthen the whole and greatly lessen the danger of future separations.Document 6

Learning Objective : Explain the context in which America gained 
independence and developed a sense of national identity.
In the 150 years after 1607, the 13 British colonies in North America began to 
develop an identity distinct from Great Britain. In the following 50 years, these 
colonies helped fight a war against France, won their own independence, wrote a constitution, and established a democratic republic. The transformation from colonies to a new country resulted from a change in how the British ruled their colonies, the impact of European affairs and ideas on the colonists, and the development of American leaders and people who wanted self-government.
British-French Wars During the colonial period, the British and the 
French fought a series of wars for control of territory in Europe, the Americas, and South Asia. The last of these, the Seven Y ears’ War, began in North America in 1756. Because American Indians were heavily involved in defending their interests, and most allied with the French, this event is also known as the French and Indian War. The British victory in 1763 consolidated their control of North America and freed colonists from fear of French attacks. In addition, the contributions by the colonies reflected their political maturity. They became more confident of their ability to stand up for their interests. 
Colonial Independence To pay for the war, the British tried to collect 
more taxes from the colonies they were protecting. In contrast, many American colonists saw themselves as self-sufficient and were emboldened by “enlightened” thinking to call for greater self-governance. These clashing views caused the colonies to found a new nation.
The Articles of Confederation and the Constitution Inspired by the 
republican ideals of the American Revolution, the new country was initially governed by the Articles of Confederation. However, the national government was so weak that people soon replaced it with a new constitution with a stronger federal government but reserved certain powers for the states. With the addition of the Bill of Rights, it protected basic individual liberties. This Constitution still provides the basis of the U.S. government today. 
Conflicting Views of Government Debates over the new constitution 
continued as policy debates under the first president, George Washington.UNIT 3 — Period 3: 1754–1800
85  TOPIC 3.1    C ONTE xTUALIz ING PERIOD 3Truly “Founding Fathers, ” the leaders of the new government argued over the 
economy, individual rights, foreign affairs, relations with Native Americans, and the roles of the federal and state governments. 
By the end of Washington’s eight years in office, two political parties had 
emerged. The Democratic-Republicans argued for stronger state governments. The Federalists argued for a stronger federal government. After the Democratic-Republicans defeated the Federalists in the election of 1800, the young country faced a test of political stability. When the Federalists peacefully transferred power to their political rivals, the country passed the test. By 1820, the Federalists had disappeared as a party. However, their ideas continued to have influence through judges and later politicians. 
Changes in Economics, Politics, and Culture In the new country, 
immigrants continued to arrive. As people migrated westward in search of land and economic opportunities, they caused conflicts with the Native Americans living on those lands. The British, French, and Spanish who also claimed North American territory provided additional challenges. The United States had to defend its borders on land and its ships at sea in order to protect its economic and diplomatic interests.
As the United States established its place as a new country, people began 
to form their own cultures. While the United States declared independence in 1776 and ratified the Constitution in 1788, it was not until after 1800 that a national identity could be recognized.

The Seven Years’ War
It is truly a miserable thing that we no sooner leave fighting our neighbors, 
the French, but we must fall to quarrelling among ourselves.
Reverend Samuel Johnson, minister in Connecticut, 1763
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the Seven Years’ 
War (the French and Indian War).
Historic European rivalries, particularly between Great Britain, France, and 
Spain, had been brought to North America by the earliest immigrants from 
those nations. While the basis for the conflict between these nations may be found in Europe, disputes between them in their colonies served to intensify their differences. While Britain eventually triumphed in a series of 18th century wars, victory was at a cost that they never could have imagined: the rebellion and the loss of their Atlantic coast colonies. 
Empires at War, 1689–1763
Late in the 17th century, a series of wars broke out involving Great Britain, France, and Spain. They were worldwide in scope, with battles in Europe, India, and North America, and they often involved other Europeans and natives of India and North America. The stakes were high for power in Europe and for control of colonies and their lucrative trade. In North America, the most valuable possessions were sugar-producing islands in the Caribbean Sea and the fur-trading network with American Indians in the interior of North America.
The First Three Wars 
These conflicts occurred between 1689 and 1748 and were named after the British monarch under whose reign they occurred:
• In King William’s War (1689–1697), the British launched expeditions to capture Quebec from the French, but they failed. American Indians supported by the French burned British frontier settlements.
• In Queen Anne’s War (1702–1713), the British had more success. They gained both Nova Scotia from France and trading rights in Spanish America. 
87  TOPIC 3.2   THE SEVEN YEARS ’ WAR• King George’s War (1744–1748) was named for George II. In Georgia, 
James Oglethorpe led a colonial army that repulsed Spanish attacks. New Englanders captured Louisbourg in Canada, a major French fortress on Cape Breton Island that controlled access to the St. Lawrence River. In the peace treaty ending the war, however, Britain returned Louisbourg to the French in exchange for political and economic gains in India. New Englanders were furious about the loss of a fort that they had fought so hard to win.
The Decisive Conflict 
In the first three wars, European powers saw little value in committing regular troops to America. They relied on “amateur” colonial forces. Further, most of the fighting was in Europe. However, by 1754, when the fourth and decisive conflict began, conditions had changed. Great Britain and France recognized the great value of their colonies for the raw materials they produced. Only about 60,000 settlers lived in the French colonies, but they worked with Native Americans to carry on a valuable fur trade. The British colonies were more densely populated, with about 1.2 million people. They produced grain, fish, tobacco, lumber and other products that fueled British industry. 
The final war in this series was known in Europe as the Seven Y ears’ War . 
The North American phase of this war is often called the French and Indian 
War . It began in 1754 and ended in 1763.
Beginning of the War From the British point of view, the French provoked 
the war by building a chain of forts in the Ohio River Valley. One reason the French did so was to halt the westward growth of the British colonies. Hoping to stop the French from completing work on Fort Duquesne (Pittsburgh) and thereby win control of the Ohio River Valley, the governor of Virginia sent a small militia (armed force) under the command of a young colonel named George Washington. After gaining a small initial victory, Washington’s troops surrendered to a superior force of Frenchmen and their American Indian allies on July 3, 1754. With this military encounter in the wilderness, the final war for empire began.
At first the war went badly for the British. In 1755, another expedition 
from Virginia, led by General Edward Braddock, ended in a disastrous defeat, as more than 2,000 British regulars and colonial troops were routed by a smaller force of both French troops and American Indians near Fort Duquesne. The Algonquin allies of the French ravaged the frontier from western Pennsylvania to North Carolina. The French repulsed a British invasion of French Canada that began in 1756.
The Albany Plan of Union Recognizing the need for coordinating 
colonial defense, the British government had called for representatives from several colonies to meet in a congress at Albany, New Y ork, in 1754. The delegates from seven colonies adopted an agreement—the Albany Plan of Union —developed by Benjamin Franklin that provided for an intercolonial 
88 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONgovernment and a system for recruiting troops and collecting taxes from the 
various colonies for their common defense. Each colony was too concerned about preserving its own taxation powers to accept the plan, however, and it never took effect. The Albany congress was significant, however, because it set a precedent for later, more revolutionary, congresses in the 1770s.
British Victory The British prime minister, William Pitt, concentrated 
the government’s military strategy on conquering Canada. This objective was accomplished with the retaking of Louisbourg in 1758, the surrender of Quebec to General James Wolfe in 1759, and the taking of Montreal in 1760. After these British victories, the European powers negotiated a peace treaty (the Peace of Paris) in 1763. Great Britain acquired both French Canada and Spanish Florida. In compensation for Spain’s loss of Florida, France ceded (gave up) to Spain its huge territory west of the Mississippi River known as Louisiana. With this treaty, the British extended their control of North America, and French power on the continent virtually ended.
Immediate Effects of the War Britain’s victory in the Seven Y ears’ War 
was a turning point in the military and diplomatic conflict for control of North America among the British, the French, the colonists, and various tribes of American Indians:
• It gave Great Britain unchallenged supremacy among Europeans in North America.
• It challenged the autonomy of many American Indians.
• It established the British as the dominant naval power in the world. 
• It meant that the American colonies no longer faced the threat of concerted attacks from the French, the Spanish, and their American Indian allies. 
More important to the colonies, though, was a change in how the British 
and the colonists viewed each other.
The British View of the War The British came away from the war with a 
low opinion of the colonial military abilities. They held the American militia in contempt as a poorly trained, disorderly rabble. Furthermore, they noted that some of the colonies had refused to contribute either troops or money to the war effort. Most British were convinced that the colonists were both unable and unwilling to defend the new frontiers of the vastly expanded British empire. 
The Colonial View of the War The colonists took an opposite view of 
their military performance. They were proud of their record in all four wars and developed confidence that they could successfully provide for their own defense. They were not impressed with the British troops or leadership, as their methods of warfare seemed badly suited to the densely wooded terrain of eastern America. 
89  TOPIC 3.2   THE SEVEN YEARS ’ WARReorganization of the British Empire
More serious than the resentful feelings stirred by the war experience was 
the British government’s shift in its colonial policies. Previously, Britain had exercised little direct control over the colonies and had not enforced its navigation acts regulating colonial trade. This earlier policy of salutary neglect  
was abandoned as the British adopted more forceful policies for taking control of their expanded North American dominions.
All four wars—and the last one in particular—had been extremely costly. 
In addition, Britain now felt the need to maintain a large British military force to guard its American frontiers. Among British landowners, pressure was building to reduce the heavy taxes that the government had levied to fund the colonial wars. To pay for troops to guard the frontier without increasing taxes at home, King George III and the dominant political party in Parliament (the Whigs) wanted the American colonies to bear more of the cost of maintaining the British empire. 
Pontiac’s Rebellion The first major test of the new British imperial policy 
came in 1763 when Chief Pontiac led an attack against colonial settlements on the western frontier. The American Indians were angered by the growing westward movement of European settlers onto their land and by the British refusal to offer gifts as the French had done. Pontiac’s alliance of American Indians in the Ohio River Valley destroyed forts and settlements from New Y ork to Virginia. Rather than relying on colonial forces to retaliate, the British sent regular British troops to put down the uprising.

Proclamation of 1763 In an effort to stabilize the western frontier, the 
British government issued a proclamation that prohibited colonists from settling 
west of the Appalachian Mountains (see map in Topic 3.3). The British hoped that limiting settlements would prevent future hostilities between colonists and American Indians. But the colonists reacted to the proclamation with anger and defiance. After the British victory in the Seven Y ears’ War, colonists hoped

Taxation Without Representation
The people, even to the lowest ranks, have become more attentive 
to their liberties, more inquisitive about them, and more  
determined to defend them.
John Adams, 1765 
Learning Objective : Explain how British colonial policies regarding 
North America led to the Revolutionary War. 
W hat caused American colonists in the 1760s to become, as John Adams 
expressed, “more attentive to their liberties”? The chief reason for their 
discontent in these years was a dramatic change in Britain’s colonial policy. Britain began to assert its power in the colonies and to collect taxes and enforce trade laws much more aggressively than in the past. While some colonists accepted these changes, others grew angry in defense of what they viewed as violations of their political rights and their ability to carry on trade and commerce freely. As anger spread, colonists from Massachusetts to Georgia began to unite in protest of British actions.
British Actions and Colonial Reactions
The Proclamation of 1763 was the first of a series of acts by the British government that angered colonists. From the British point of view, the acts were justified as a fair, proper method for protecting its colonial empire and making the colonies pay their share for such protection. From the colonists’ view, each act represented an alarming threat to their liberties. Colonists combined a desire to defend long-established practices in Britain of representative government, local self-rule, and individual rights with the influence of the newer ideas of the Enlightenment (see Topic 3.4). One of the core issues dividing the British and the colonists was the idea of representation:
• Colonists pointed out that they could not directly elect representatives to Parliament , so they had no way to consent to or oppose British 
actions. 
• The British responded that the colonists, like all British citizens, had virtual representation in the government. According to this theory, all members of Parliament represented the interests of the entire empire, not just the small district that chose them.
93  TOPIC 3.3   T AxATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONNew Revenues and Regulations 
In the first two years of peace, King George III’s chancellor of the exchequer 
(treasury) and prime minister, Lord George Grenville, successfully pushed through Parliament three measures that aroused colonial suspicions of a British plot to subvert their liberties.
The Sugar Act (1764) This act (also known as the Revenue Act of 1764) 
placed duties on foreign sugar and certain luxuries. Its supporters wanted to regulate the sugar trade and to raise revenue. A companion law also provided for stricter enforcement of the Navigation Acts to stop smuggling. Those accused of smuggling were to be tried in admiralty courts by crown-appointed judges without juries.
The Quartering Act (1765) This act required the colonists to provide 
food and living quarters for British soldiers stationed in the colonies.
The Stamp Act In an effort to raise funds to support British military forces 
in the colonies, Lord Grenville turned to a tax long in use in Britain. The Stamp Act, enacted by Parliament in 1765, required that revenue stamps be placed on 
most printed paper in the colonies, including all legal documents, newspapers, pamphlets, and advertisements. This was the first direct tax—collected from those who used the goods—paid by the people in the colonies, as opposed to the taxes on imported goods, which were paid by merchants.
Reaction to the Stamp Act
People in every colony reacted with indignation to news of the Stamp Act. A young Virginia lawyer named Patrick Henry spoke for many when he stood up in the House of Burgesses to demand that the king’s government recognize the rights of all citizens—including the right not to be taxed without representation. In Massachusetts, James Otis initiated a call for cooperative action among the colonies to protest the Stamp Act. Representatives from nine colonies met in New Y ork in 1765 to form the so-called Stamp Act Congress. They resolved that only their own elected representatives had the legal authority to approve taxes.
The protest against the Stamp Act took a violent turn with the formation of 
the Sons and Daughters of Liberty, a secret society organized for the purpose 
of intimidating tax agents. Members of this society sometimes destroyed revenue stamps and tarred and feathered revenue officials.
Economic Pressure Boycotts against British imports were the most 
effective form of protest. It became fashionable in the colonies in 1765 and 1766 for people not to purchase any article of British origin. For example, instead of buying imported British cloth, colonial women proudly made their own. Faced with a sharp drop in trade, London merchants put pressure on Parliament to repeal the controversial Stamp Act.
Declaratory Act In 1766, Grenville was replaced by another prime 
minister, and Parliament voted to repeal the Stamp Act. When news of the 
94 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONrepeal reached the colonies, people rejoiced. Few colonists at the time noted that 
Parliament had also enacted a face-saving measure known as the Declaratory Act (1766). This act asserted that Parliament had the right to tax and make laws 
for the colonies “in all cases whatsoever. ” This declaration of policy would soon lead to renewed conflict between the colonists and the British government.
Second Phase of the Crisis, 1767–1773
The British government still needed new revenue. To obtain it, the newly appointed chancellor of the exchequer, Charles Townshend, proposed another tax measure.
The Townshend Acts In 1767, Parliament enacted new duties, known 
as the Townshend Acts, to be collected on colonial imports of tea, glass, and paper. The revenue would be used to pay crown officials in the colonies, thus making the officials independent of the colonial assemblies that had paid their salaries. The Townshend Acts also provided for the search of private homes for smuggled goods. All that an official needed to conduct such a search would be a writ of assistance (a general license to search anywhere) rather than a judge’s 
warrant to search a specific property. A related act suspended New Y ork’s assembly for its defiance of the Quartering Act.
At first, most colonists accepted the taxes because they were indirect, 
meaning they were paid by merchants who then raised their prices to cover the additional costs. They were not direct taxes that consumers paid on their purchases. 
However, leaders soon protested the new duties. While they accepted 
Parliament’s right to regulate trade as legitimate, they rejected taxation without representation as a violation of an essential principle of English law. In 1767 and 1768, John Dickinson made these points in Letters From a Farmer in Pennsylvania . He argued that Parliament could regulate colonial commerce, 
but if it wanted to tax colonists, it had to have the approval of assemblies that included colonial representatives. 
In 1768, James Otis and Samuel Adams  jointly wrote the Massachusetts 
Circular Letter and sent copies to every colonial legislature. It urged the colonies to petition Parliament to repeal the Townshend Acts. British officials in Boston ordered the letter retracted, threatened to dissolve the legislature, and increased the number of British troops. Responding to the circular letter, the colonists again conducted boycotts of British goods. Merchants increased their smuggling to avoid the Townshend duties.
Repeal of the Townshend Acts Meanwhile, in London, there was another 
change in the king’s ministers. Lord Frederick North became the new prime minister. He urged Parliament to repeal the Townshend Acts because they 
damaged trade and generated a disappointingly small amount of revenue. The repeal of the Townshend Acts in 1770 ended the colonial boycott and, except for an incident in Boston (the “massacre” described below), there was a three-year respite from political troubles as the colonies entered into a period 
95  TOPIC 3.3   T AxATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONof economic prosperity. However, Parliament retained a small tax on tea as a 
symbol of its right to tax the colonies.
Boston Massacre Most Bostonians resented the British troops quartered 
in their city to protect customs officials from attacks by the Sons and Daughters of Liberty. On a snowy day in March 1770, a crowd of colonists harassed the guards near the customs house. The guards fired into the crowd, killing five. Among them was Crispus Attucks, a dockworker of mixed African and American Indian heritage, who would later become a symbol for the antislavery movement. At their trial for murder, the six soldiers were defended by colonial lawyer John Adams. They were acquitted of murder, but two were convicted on the less serious charge of manslaughter. Adams’ radical cousin, Samuel Adams, angrily denounced the shooting incident as a “massacre” and used it to inflame anti-British feeling.
Renewal of the Conflict
Even during the relatively quiet years of 1770–1772, Samuel Adams and a few other Americans kept alive the view that British officials were undermining colonial liberties. A principal device for spreading this idea was by means of the Committees of Correspondence initiated by Samuel Adams in 1772. In Boston and other Massachusetts towns, Adams began the practice of organizing committees that would regularly exchange letters about suspicious or potentially threatening British activities. The Virginia House of Burgesses took the concept a step further when it organized intercolonial committees in 1773.
The Gaspee One incident frequently discussed in the committees’ letters 
was that of the Gaspee, a British customs ship that had caught several smugglers. 
In 1772, it ran aground off the shore of Rhode Island. Seizing their opportunity to destroy the hated vessel, a group of colonists disguised as American Indians ordered the British crew ashore and then set fire to the ship. The British ordered a commission to investigate and bring guilty individuals to Britain for trial.
Boston Tea Party The colonists continued their refusal to buy British tea 
because the British insisted on their right to collect tax on it. Hoping to help the British East India Company out of its financial problems, Parliament passed the Te a Ac t  in 1773, which made the price of the company’s tea—even with the 
tax included—cheaper than that of smuggled Dutch tea.
Many Americans refused to buy the cheaper tea because to do so would, in 
effect, recognize Parliament’s right to tax the colonies. A shipment of East India Company tea arrived in Boston harbor but found no buyers. Before the royal governor could bring the tea ashore, a group of Bostonians, mostly artisans and laborers, took action. Disguised as American Indians, they boarded the British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into the harbor. Colonial reaction to this incident (December 1773) was mixed. While many applauded the Boston Tea Party as a defense of liberty, others thought the destruction of private property too radical.
96 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONIntolerable Acts
In Great Britain, news of the Boston Tea Party angered King George III, Lord 
North, and members of Parliament. In retaliation, the British government enacted a series of punitive acts (the Coercive Acts), together with a separate act dealing with French Canada (the Quebec Act). The colonists were outraged by these various laws, which were given the epithet “Intolerable Acts .”
The Coercive Acts (1774) There were four Coercive Acts, directed mainly 
at punishing the people of Boston and Massachusetts and bringing them under control.
• The Port Act  closed the port of Boston, prohibiting trade in and out of 
the harbor until the destroyed tea was paid for.
• The Massachusetts Government Act reduced the power of the Massachusetts legislature while increasing the power of the royal governor.
• The Administration of Justice Act allowed royal officials accused of crimes to be tried in Great Britain instead of in the colonies.
• The Quartering Act was expanded to enable British troops to be quartered in private homes. It applied to all colonies. 
Quebec Act (1774) When it passed the Coercive Acts, the British 
government also passed a law organizing the Canadian lands gained from France. To satsify the French-speaking Canadians, the act established Roman Catholicism as the official religion of Quebec. It also set up a government without a representative assembly and extended Quebec’s boundary to the Ohio River. The plan, accepted by French Canadians, was resented in the 13 colonies. 
The colonists viewed the Quebec Act  as a direct attack on the American 
colonies because it took away lands that New Y ork, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Massachusetts, and Connecticut claimed along the Ohio River. They also feared that the British would attempt to enact similar laws in America to take away their representative government. Further, the predominantly Protestant Americans resented the recognition given to the Roman Catholic Church. 
The Demand for Independence 
Britain’s intensifying crackdown on resistance to its policies forced more and more colonists to take sides. Supporters of the British response included many wealthy merchants in New Y ork and Philadelphia and planters in the southern colonies. Opponents, from Virginia to Massachusetts, challenged the British with harsh criticisms. These words were supported by hostile actions towards the British throughout the colonies, but particularly in Boston and New England. As violence increased, enough people were willing to speak out publicly, participate in mass protests, and donate money that the movement for independence grew stronger.

nothing less than a deliberate assault launched surreptitiously by plotters against liberty both in England and in America. The danger to America, it was believed, was in fact only the small immediately visible part of the greater whole whose ultimate manifestation would be the destruction of the English constitution with all the rights and privileges embedded in it. . . .
It was this—the overwhelming evidence, as they saw it, that they were 
faced with conspirators against liberty determined at all costs to gain ends which their words dissembled [portrayed falsely]—that was signaled to the colonists after 1763, and it was this above all else that in the end propelled them into Revolution. ”
Bernard Bailyn, historian, The Logic of Rebellion, 1967
“The Americans, ‘born the heirs of freedom, ’ revolted not to create but to maintain their freedom. American society had developed differently from that of the Old World. . . . While the speculative philosophers of Europe were laboriously searching their minds in an effort to decide the first principles of liberty, the Americans had come to experience vividly that liberty in their everyday lives. . . . The Revolution was thus essentially intellectual and declaratory: it ‘explained the business to the world, and served to confirm what nature and society had before produced. ’ ‘ All was the result of reason. . . . ’ The Revolution had taken place not in a succession of eruptions that had crumbled the existing social structure, but in a succession of new thoughts and new ideas that had vindicated that social structure. . . . The Americans revolted not out of actual suffering but out of reasoned principle. ”

Topic 3.4
Philosophical Foundations  
of the American Revolution 
Government even in its best state is but a necessary evil;  
in its worst state an intolerable one.
Thomas Paine, Common Sense 1776 
Learning Objective : Explain how and why colonial attitudes about 
government and the individual changed in the years leading up to the 
American Revolution. 
For Americans, especially those who were in positions of leadership, there 
was a long tradition of loyalty to the king and Great Britain. As the differences 
between the colonists and the leaders of Great Britain increased, many Americans tried to justify the diverging directions. As discussed in Topic 2.7, the Enlightenment, particularly the writings of John Locke, had a profound 
influence on the colonies. 
Enlightenment Ideas 
The era of the Enlightenment was at its peak in the mid-18th century. These were the very years that future leaders of the American Revolution (Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams) were coming to maturity, and their ideas reflected the influence of Enlightenment thought.
Deism  Many Enlightenment thinkers in Europe and America were 
Deists. They believed in God, but in one who had established natural laws in creating the universe and then rarely or never intervened directly in human affairs. God set the rules but then allowed people to make choices. This view of God contrasted with the belief held by most Christians of their time that God regularly intervened in everyday life, often to reward or punish individuals or groups for their actions. 
Rationalism In general, Enlightenment thinkers trusted human reason 
to understand the natural world and to respond to the many problems of life and society. While most were Christians, their trust in reason led them to emphasize studying science and human behavior rather than following traditional interpretations of the Bible.
101  TOPIC 3.4   P HILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION   Social Contract In politics, one important Enlightenment idea was the social 
contract , the concept of an agreement among people to form a government to 
promote liberty and equality. This idea represented a sharp break from the prevailing 
assumption that monarchs ruled by divine right—because God had chosen them. Under the social contract, power came from “below, ” not from “above. ” This philosophy, derived from John Locke and others, had been developed further by the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Support for a social contract had a profound influence on educated Americans in the 1760s and 1770s—the decades of revolutionary thought and action that finally culminated in the American Revolution.
Thomas Paine’s Argument for Independence
In January 1776, one of the most important pieces of writing by an American colonist was published. The author, Thomas Paine, had been born in England before moving to the colonies. His pamphlet, Common Sense, argued in clear and forceful language that the colonies should become independent states and break all political ties with the British monarchy. Paine argued that it was contrary to common sense for a large continent to be ruled by a small and distant island and for people to pledge allegiance to a king whose government was corrupt and whose laws were unreasonable.
The pamphlet spread rapidly throughout the colonies and ignited public 
demands for independence. Unlike earlier writers, who focused their anger on Parliament and the ministers, Paine directly attacked King George III and even the ideas of a monarchy. Paine’s success was based largely on his ability to make complicated, abstract ideas understandable for common readers. Common Sense  
became a key factor in widening the divide between the colonies and Great Britain.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WHY DID THE COLONIES REBEL?
Did America’s break with Great Britain in the 18th century signify a true revolution with radical change, or was it simply the culmination of evolutionary changes in American life? 
Revolution as a Radical Break For many years, the traditional view of 
the founding of America was that the American Revolution was based on the ideas of the Enlightenment and had fundamentally altered society. In the early 20th century, Progressive historians believed that the movement to end British dominance had provided an opportunity to radically change American society. A new nation was formed with a republican government based on a division of powers between a national and state government and an emphasis on equality and the rights of the individual. The revolution was social as well as political.
Revolution Before the War  During the second half of the 20th century, 
some historians argued that American society had been more democratic and changed long before the war with Great Britain. The war reflected these changes. Historian Bernard Bailyn has suggested that the changes that are 

102 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONviewed as revolutionary—representative government, expansion of the right to 
vote, and written constitutions—had all developed earlier during the colonial period. According to this perspective, what was significant about the break from Great Britain was the recognition of an American philosophy based on liberty and democracy that would guide the nation.

Topic 3.5 
The American Revolution 
What do we mean by the revolution? The war? That was no part of the 
revolution; it was only an effect and consequence of it. The revolution was 
in the minds of the people.
John Adams, Letter to Thomas Jefferson, August 24, 1815 
Learning Objective : Explain how various factors contributed to the 
American victory in the Revolution.
Parliament’s passage of the Intolerable Acts  in 1774 intensified the conflict 
between the colonies and Great Britain. In the next two years, many Americans 
reached the conclusion—unthinkable to most colonists only a few years earlier—that the only solution to their quarrel with the British government was to sever all ties with it. How did events from 1774 to 1776 lead to revolution?
The First Continental Congress
The punitive Intolerable Acts drove all the colonies except Georgia to send delegates to a convention in Philadelphia in September 1774. The purpose of the convention—later known as the First Continental Congress—was to respond to what the delegates viewed as Britain’s alarming threats to their liberties. Most Americans had no desire for independence. They simply wanted to protest parliamentary infringements of their rights and restore the relationship with the crown that had existed before the Seven Y ears’ War.
The Delegates  Those attending the congress were outwardly similar: all 
were wealthy White men. But they held diverse views about the crisis, from radical to conservative. Leading the radicals—those demanding the greatest concessions from Britain—were Patrick Henry of Virginia and Samuel Adams and John Adams of Massachusetts. The moderates included George 
Washington of Virginia and John Dickinson of Pennsylvania. The conservative delegates—those who favored a mild statement of protest—included John Jay of New Y ork and Joseph Galloway of Pennsylvania. Unrepresented were the Loyalists, the colonists who would not challenge the king’s government in any way. 
Actions of the Congress The delegates voted on a series of proposed 
measures, each of which was intended to change British policy without offending moderate and conservative colonists. Joseph Galloway proposed a plan, similar to the Albany Plan of 1754, that would have reordered relations 
105  TOPIC 3.5    THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION  with Parliament and formed a union of the colonies within the British Empire. 
By only one vote, Galloway’s plan failed to pass. Instead, the convention adopted these measures: 
• It endorsed the Suffolk Resolves, a statement originally issued by Massachusetts. The Resolves called for the immediate repeal of the Intolerable Acts and for colonies to resist them by making military preparations and boycotting British goods. 
• It passed the Declaration and Resolves. Backed by moderate delegates, this petition urged the king to redress (make right) colonial grievances and restore colonial rights. In a conciliatory gesture, it recognized Parliament’s authority to regulate commerce.
• It created the Continental Association, a network of committees to enforce the economic sanctions of the Suffolk Resolves.
• It declared that if colonial rights were not recognized, delegates would meet again in May 1775.
Fighting Begins
Angrily dismissing the petition of the First Continental Congress, the king’s government declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion and sent additional troops to put down further disorders. The combination of colonial defiance and British determination to suppress it led to violent clashes in Massachusetts—what would be the first battles of the American Revolution.
Lexington and Concord On April 18, 1775, General Thomas Gage, the 
commander of British troops in Boston, sent a large force to seize colonial military supplies in the town of Concord . Warned of the British march by 
two riders, Paul Revere  and William Dawes, the militia (or Minutemen ) of 
Lexington assembled on the village green to face the British. The Americans were forced to retreat under heavy British fire with eight killed in the brief encounter. Who fired the first shot of this first skirmish of the American Revolution? The evidence is ambiguous, and the answer will probably never be known.
Continuing their march, the British entered Concord and destroyed some 
military supplies. Marching back to Boston, the long column of British soldiers was attacked by hundreds of militiamen firing from behind stone walls. The British suffered 250 casualties—and also humiliation at being so badly mauled by “amateur” fighters. 
Bunker Hill Two months later, on June 17, 1775, a true battle was fought 
between opposing armies on the outskirts of Boston. A colonial militia of Massachusetts farmers fortified Breed’s Hill, next to Bunker Hill, for which the ensuing battle was wrongly named. A British force attacked the colonists’ position and managed to take the hill, suffering over a thousand casualties. Americans claimed a victory of sorts, having succeeded in inflicting heavy losses on the attacking British army. 
106 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Second Continental Congress
Soon after the fighting broke out in Massachusetts, delegates to the Second 
Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in May 1775. The congress was divided. One group of delegates, mainly from New England, thought the colonies should declare their independence. Another group, mainly from the middle colonies, hoped the conflict could be resolved by negotiating a new relationship with Great Britain.
The congress adopted a Declaration of the Causes and Necessities 
for Taking Up Arms and called on the colonies to provide troops. George Washington was appointed the commander-in-chief of a new colonial army and sent to Boston to lead the Massachusetts militia and volunteer units from other colonies. Congress also authorized a force under Benedict Arnold to raid Quebec in order to draw Canada away from the British empire. An American navy and marine corps were organized in the fall of 1775 for the purpose of attacking British ships.
Peace Efforts 
At first the congress adopted a contradictory policy of waging war while at the same time seeking a peaceful settlement. Many in the colonies valued their heritage and Britain’s protection, so they did not want independence. They did, however, want a change in their relationship with Britain. In July 1775, the delegates voted to send an “Olive Branch Petition” to King George III, in which they pledged their loyalty and asked the king to intercede with Parliament to secure peace and the protection of colonial rights.
King George angrily dismissed the congress’s plea and agreed instead 
to Parliament’s Prohibitory Act  (August 1775), which declared the colonies 
in rebellion. A few months later, Parliament forbade all trade and shipping between Britain and the colonies.
The Declaration of Independence
After meeting for more than a year, the congress gradually and somewhat reluctantly began to favor independence rather than reconciliation. On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia introduced a resolution declaring the colonies to be independent. Five delegates, including Thomas Jefferson, formed a committee to write a statement in support of Lee’s resolution. The declaration drafted by Jefferson listed specific grievances against George III’s government and also expressed the basic principles that justified revolution: “We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. ”
The congress adopted Lee’s resolution calling for independence on July 2. 
It adopted Jefferson’s work, the Declaration of Independence, on July 4, 1776.
107  TOPIC 3.5    THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION  The Revolutionary War
From the first shots fired in Lexington and Concord in 1775 to the final signing 
of a peace treaty in 1783, the American War for Independence, or Revolutionary War, was a long and bitter struggle. As Americans fought, they also laid the foundations for a new national identity, as the former colonies became a new country, the United States of America.
The Competing Sides
About 2.6 million people lived in the 13 colonies in 1775. Maybe 40 percent of them actively joined the struggle against Britain. They called themselves American Patriots. Around 25 percent sided with the British as Loyalists. All 
others remained neutral, with many paying little attention to the struggle.
British Strength  The British entered the war with far greater resources 
than the colonists. They had three times the population, a wealthy economy that could finance a war, a large and well-trained army, and the most powerful navy in the world. From previous conflicts with French, they had experience fighting overseas in North America, the West Indies, and South Asia. 
Patriots The largest number of Patriots were from the New England states 
and Virginia. Most soldiers were reluctant to travel outside their own region. They would serve in local militia units for short periods, leave to work their farms, and then return to duty. Thus, even though several hundred thousand people fought on the Patriot side in the war, General Washington never had more than 20,000 regular troops under his command at one time. His army was chronically short of supplies, poorly equipped, and rarely paid. However, many colonists had a strong commitment to independence, so they provided a solid core of people resilient enough to undergo hardships. 
African Americans Initially, George Washington rejected the idea of 
African Americans serving in the Patriot army. However, when the British promised freedom to enslaved people who joined their side, Washington and the congress quickly made the same offer. Approximately 5,000 African Americans fought as Patriots. Most of them were free citizens from the north, who fought in mixed racial forces, although there were some units composed entirely of African Americans. These troops took part in most of the military actions of the war, and a number, including Peter Salem, were recognized for their bravery.
Tories The Revolutionary War was in some respects a civil war in which 
anti-British Patriots fought pro-British Loyalists. Those who maintained allegiance to the king were also called Tories (after the majority party in Parliament). Almost 60,000 American Tories fought next to British soldiers, supplied them with arms and food, and joined in raiding parties to pillage Patriot homes and farms. The war divided some families. For example, while Benjamin Franklin was a leading Patriot, his son William joined the Tories and served as the last royal governor of New Jersey.
108 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONHow many American Tories were there? They were often strongest in 
major port cities, except in Boston. In New Y ork, New Jersey, and Georgia, 
they were probably in the majority. Toward the end of the war, about 80,000 Loyalists emigrated from the states to settle in Canada or Britain rather than face persecution at the hands of the Patriots.
Although Loyalists came from all groups and classes, they tended to be 
wealthier and more conservative than the Patriots. Most government officials and Anglican clergy in America remained loyal to the crown.
American Indians At first, American Indians tried to stay out of the war. 
Eventually, however, attacks by colonists prompted many American Indians to support the British, who promised to limit colonial settlements in the west.
Initial American Losses and Hardships
The first three years of the war, 1775 to 1777, went badly for Washington’s poorly trained and equipped revolutionary army. It barely escaped complete disaster in a battle for New Y ork City in 1776, in which Washington’s forces were routed by the British. By the end of 1777, the British occupied both New Y ork and Philadelphia. After losing Philadelphia, Washington’s demoralized troops suffered through the severe winter of 1777–1778 camped at Val le y Forge in Pennsylvania.
Economic troubles added to the Patriots’ bleak prospects. British occupation 
of American ports resulted in a 95 percent decline in trade between 1775 and 1777. Goods were scarce, and inflation was rampant. The paper money issued by Congress, known as continentals, became almost worthless.
Alliance with France
The turning point for the American revolutionaries came with a victory at Saratoga in upstate New Y ork in October 1777. British forces under General John Burgoyne had marched from Canada in an effort to join forces marching from the west and south. Their objective was to cut off New England from the rest of the colonies (or states). Burgoyne’s troops were attacked at Saratoga by troops commanded by American generals Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold. The British were forced to surrender.
The diplomatic outcome of the Battle of Saratoga was even more 
important than the military result. News of the surprising American victory persuaded France to join the war against Britain. France’s king, Louis XVI, an absolute monarch, had no interest in aiding a revolutionary movement. But he did see a chance to weaken his country’s traditional foe, Great Britain, by undermining its colonial empire. France had secretly provided money and supplies to the American revolutionaries as early as 1775. After Saratoga, in 1778, France openly allied itself with the Americans. (A year later, Spain and Holland also entered the war against Britain.) The French alliance proved decisive in the American struggle for independence as it widened the war, forcing the British to divert military resources away from America.
109  TOPIC 3.5    THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION  Victory
Faced with a larger war, Britain decided to consolidate its forces in America. 
British troops were pulled out of Philadelphia, and New Y ork became the base of British operations. In a campaign through 1778–1779, the Patriots, led by George Rogers Clark, captured a series of British forts in the Illinois country to gain control of parts of the vast Ohio territory. In 1780, the British army adopted a southern strategy, concentrating its military campaigns in Virginia and the Carolinas, where Loyalists were especially numerous and active.
Yor kto w n  In 1781, the last major battle of the Revolutionary War was 
fought near Y orktown, Virginia, on the shores of Chesapeake Bay. Strongly supported by French naval and military forces, Washington’s army forced the surrender of a large British army commanded by General Charles Cornwallis.
Treaty of Paris News of Cornwallis’s defeat at Y orktown was a heavy blow 
to the Tory Party in Parliament that was conducting the war. The war had become unpopular in Britain, partly because it placed a heavy strain on the economy and the government’s finances. Lord North and other Tory ministers resigned and were replaced by Whig leaders who wanted to end the war.
In Paris, in 1783, the belligerents finally signed a peace treaty. The Treaty 
of Paris provided for the following: (1) Britain would recognize the existence of the United States as an independent nation. (2) The Mississippi River would be the western boundary of that nation. (3) Americans would have fishing rights off the coast of Canada. (4) Americans would pay debts owed to British merchants and honor Loyalist claims for property confiscated during the war.

modes of education which are adopted! The one is taught to aspire,  
and the other is early confined and limited. . . . The sister must  
be wholly domesticated, while the brother is led by the hand through  
all the flowery paths of science.
Judith Sargent Murray, “On the Equality of the Sexes” (1779) 
Learning Objective 1 : Explain the various ways the American Revolution 
affected society.
Learning Objective 2 : Describe the global impact of the American 
Revolution. 
Revolutionary ideas impacted American society before, during, and after the 
war that brought the colonies freedom from British control. These ideas shaped 
the new state governments that replaced the colonial ones (see Topic 3.7), and they had particular significance for women, enslaved workers, and Native Americans. 
Women in the Revolutionary Era
Both prior to and during the war, groups of women such as the Daughters of Liberty  organized to oppose British actions. Before the war, they took direct 
action by boycotting British goods. During the war, they provided supplies to the fighting forces. Some women followed men into the armed camps and worked as cooks and nurses. In a few instances, women fought in battle, either taking their husband’s place, as Mary McCauley (also known as Molly Pitcher) 
did at the Battle of Monmouth, or passing as a man and serving as a soldier, as Deborah Sampson  did for a year. Similarly, female Loyalists also provided 
support to colonial and British troops.
Economic Role The most important contribution of women during the 
war was maintaining the colonial economy. While fathers, husbands, and sons were away fighting, women ran family farms and businesses. They provided much of the food and clothing necessary for the war effort.
112 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONPolitical Demands The combination of hearing the revolutionary rhetoric 
and being actively engaged in the struggle influenced how many women viewed 
their role in society. A new view of their status in society evolved, a change referred to as Republican Motherhood. This new role called for educating women so that in the home they could teach their children the values of the new republic and their roles as citizens. This gave women a more active role in shaping the new nation’s political life. However, it was still a role carried out in the home, not in public, and it did not imply equality with men. Few people, male or female, advocated full equality. 
Despite their contributions, women continued in their second-class status. 
Unsuccessful were pleas such as those of Abigail Adams to her husband, John Adams: “I desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. ”
The Status of Enslaved African Americans 
The institution of slavery contradicted the spirit of the Revolution and the idea that “all men are created equal. ” For a time, the leaders of the Revolution recognized this and took some corrective steps. The Continental Congress abolished the importation of enslaved people, and most states went along with the prohibition. Several northern states ended slavery, while in the south, some owners voluntarily freed their enslaved laborers. Slavery was in decline. Many leaders, including slave owners such as James Madison, wanted it to end. However, he could not envision a society in which White and free Black people lived together. So, he hoped that freed people would simply return to Africa.
However, this changed dramatically with the development of the cotton 
gin in 1793 (Topic 3.12). By making cotton production more efficient, it quickly increased the demand for low-cost labor. Slave owners came to believe that enslaved labor was essential to their prosperity and that the ideals of the Revolution did not apply to the people they owned. By the 1830s, they developed a rationale for slavery that found religious and political justification for continuing to hold human beings in lifelong bondage.
Native Americans and Independence
American Indians generally supported the British in the Revolutionary War, so they did not benefit from the success of the colonies’ independence. Further, colonists’ racism and greed for land caused most of them to view American Indians as obstacles to settlement that should be removed. Very few colonists believed that the ideas of liberty and equality applied to American Indians. 
International Impact of the American Revolution
Just as the American Revolution was shaped by ideas imported by the European Enlightenment, so it influenced events elsewhere. The ideas that people have a right to govern themselves, that all people are created equal, and that individuals have inalienable rights have had wide appeal. Leaders of the French 
113  TOPIC 3.6   THE INFLUENCE OF REVOLUTIONARY IDEALS   Revolution (1789–1799) that overthrew the 
monarchy, the United Irishmen who rebelled against British rule (1798), the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804) that ended slavery, and numerous Latin American revolutions against European control in the 19th century all cited the Declaration of Independence as inspiration. In the 20th century, the impact of these ideas appeared in countries as diverse as Zimbabwe in central Africa and Vietnam in southeast Asia. One of the leaders inspired by the American Revolution was 
Toussaint L ’ ouverture of Haiti. He lead the largest successful revolution by enslaved people in history.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  HOW UNUSUAL WAS THE REVOLUTION?
Was the American Revolution similar to or different from other revolutions in 
history. Historians have provided different answers to this question.
Similarities with Other Revolutions In Anatomy of a Revolution  (1965), 
historian Crane Brinton was struck by how alike the America Revolution, the French Revolution (1789–1794), and the Russian Revolution (1917–1922) were. According to Brinton, each one passed through similar stages and became increasingly radical. 
Other historians have noted similarities between the American Revolution 
and the colonial rebellions in Africa and Asia after World War II. All were against distant Europe imperial powers. Many featured guerrilla forces (the colonies in the 1770s, Cuba in the 1950s, and Vietnam in the 1960s) and were weaker in the cities but stronger in the surrounding rural territories.
Differences with Europe Other historians have focused on the differences 
between American and European revolutions. For example, the French and Russians reacted to feudalism and aristocratic privilege that did not exist in the American colonies. In their view, Americans did not revolt against outmoded institutions but merely carried to maturity a liberal, republican movement that had been gaining force for years.
Impact  Historians also disagree on whether the American Revolution 
shaped later revolutions. Using the insights from comparisons has helped historians better understand the American Revolution in its historical context.

1. “In the decades following the Revolution, American society was transformed. . . . The Revolution resembled the breaking of a dam, releasing thousands upon thousands of pent-up pressures. . . . It was as if the whole traditional structure, enfeebled and brittle to begin with, broke apart, and the people and their energies were set loose in an unprecedented outburst. 
“Nothing contributed more to this explosion of energy than did the idea of 
equality. Equality was in fact the most radical and most powerful ideological force let loose in the Revolution. Its appeal was far more potent than any of the revolutionaries realized. Once invoked, the idea of equality could not be stopped, and it tore through American society and culture with awesome power. . . . Within decades following the Declaration of Independence, the United States became the most egalitarian nation in the history of the world, and it remains so today, regardless of its great disparities of wealth. ” 
Gordon S. Wood, Radicalism of the American Revolution , 1993 
116 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION“Today, ‘equality’ is generally interpreted to include protection for the 
rights of minorities; during the Revolution, ‘the body of the people’ referred exclusively to the majority. . . .
It is one of the supreme ironies of the American revolution that the 
assumption of authority by “the body of the people”—probably its most radical feature—served to oppress as well as to liberate. This was a real revolution: the people did seize power, but they exercised that power at the expense of others—loyalists, pacifists, merchants, Indians, slaves—who, although certainly people, were not perceived to be part of the whole. This was, after all, a war. It would not be the last time Americans sacrificed notions of liberty and equality in the name of the general good.
Our Revolutionary heritage works both ways. ‘The body of the people, ’ the 
dominant force during the 1770s, has empowered and deprived. ”

117  TOPIC 3.7   THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION  
Topic 3.7
The Articles of Confederation 
The source of the evil is the nature of the government.
Henry Knox to George Washington, December 17, 1786
Learning Objective : Explain how different forms of government 
developed and changed as a result of the Revolutionary Period. 
Having declared independence, the 13 colonies were faced with the task of 
fighting for it. To win such a war of independence, the colonists realized that 
they needed some form of government. The challenge was bringing together 13 distinct colonies united largely by a distrust and fear of a tyrannical British government. This led to an intentionally weak form of central government under a document, the Articles of Confederation, that was written by the Second Continental Congress during the Revolutionary War. 
Organization of New Governments
While the Revolutionary War was being fought, leaders of the 13 colonies worked to change them into independently governed states, each with its own constitution (written plan of government). At the same time, the revolutionary Congress that originally met in Philadelphia tried to define the powers of a new central government for the nation that was coming into being.
State Governments
By 1777, ten of the former colonies had written new constitutions. Most of these documents were both written and adopted by the states’ legislatures. In a few states (Maryland, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina), a proposed constitution was submitted to a vote of the people for ratification (approval).
Each state constitution was the subject of heated debate between 
conservatives, who stressed the need for law and order, and liberals, who were most concerned about protecting individual rights and preventing future tyrannies. Although the various constitutions differed on specific points, they had the following features in common:
List of Rights Each state constitution began with a “bill” or “declaration” 
listing basic rights and freedoms. Common provisions identified the right to a jury trial and the freedom of religion. These rights and freedoms belonged to all citizens, and state officials could not infringe (encroach) on them. 
118 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONSeparation of Powers  With a few exceptions, the powers of state 
government were given to three separate branches: (1) legislative powers to an 
elected two-house legislature, (2) executive powers to an elected governor, and (3) judicial powers to a system of courts. The principle of separation of powers was intended to be a safeguard against tyranny—especially against the tyranny of a too-powerful executive.
Voting  The right to vote was extended to all White males who owned 
some property. The property requirement, usually for a minimal amount of land or money, was based on the assumption that property owners had a larger stake in government than did the poor and property-less.
Office-holding Those seeking elected office usually had to meet a higher 
property qualification than the voters.
The Articles of Confederation
At Philadelphia in 1776, as Jefferson was writing the Declaration of Independence, John Dickinson drafted the first constitution for the United States as a nation. Congress modified Dickinson’s plan to protect the powers of the individual states. The Articles of Confederation, as the document was called, was adopted by Congress in 1777 and submitted to the states for ratification.
Ratification  Approval of the Articles was delayed by a dispute over state 
claims to the vast American Indian lands west of the Alleghenies. Some states, such as Rhode Island and Maryland, insisted that states give up these claims and the lands be under the jurisdiction of the new central government. When Virginia and New Y ork finally agreed to cede their claims to western lands, the Articles were ratified in March 1781.
Structure of Government The Articles established a central government 
that consisted of just one body, a congress. In this unicameral (one-house) legislature, each state was given one vote, with at least nine votes out of 13 required to pass important laws. There was no separate executive, nor a separate judiciary (court system). Amending the Articles required a unanimous vote. A Committee of States, with one representative from each state, could make minor decisions when the full Congress was not in session.
Powers  The Articles gave Congress the power to wage war, make treaties, 
send diplomatic representatives, and borrow money. However, Congress did not have the power to regulate commerce or to collect taxes. To finance any of its decisions, Congress had to rely upon taxes voted by each state. Neither did the government have executive power to enforce its laws. 
The United States Under the Articles, 1781–1789
The 13 states intended the central government to be weak—and it was. It consisted of a weak Congress and no executive or judicial branch.
119  TOPIC 3.7   THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION  Accomplishments
Despite its weaknesses, Congress under the Articles did have some lasting 
accomplishments:
• Independence: The U.S. government could claim some credit for the ultimate victory of Washington’s army and for negotiating favorable terms in the treaty of peace with Britain.
• Land Ordinance of 1785: Congress established a policy for surveying and selling the western lands. The policy set aside one square-mile section of land in each 36 square-mile township for public education.
• Northwest Ordinance of 1787: For the large territory lying between the Great Lakes and the Ohio River, Congress passed an ordinance (law) that set the rules for creating new states. The Northwest Ordinance granted limited self-government to the developing territory and prohibited slavery in the region.

120 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONBy reserving land for schools and banning slavery, the government made 
the Northwest Territory attractive to both White and free Black settlers. 
However, the government auctioned land by the square mile (640 acres). So, even though the starting price per acre was a low $1 per acre, the benefit of the system went first to those rich enough to spend at least $640 at once. The purchasers, then, sold off the land in smaller parcels to less wealthy Americans.
Weaknesses of the Articles
These accomplishments were overshadowed by the difficulties the country faced in addressing certain problems without a strong government.
Foreign Affairs Relations between the new United States and the 
European powers were troubled. European nations had little respect for a nation that could neither pay its debts nor take united action in a crisis. For example, the country could not enforce the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War. The U.S. government was too weak to stop Britain from maintaining military outposts on the western frontier and restricting trade. It was also too weak to force states to restore property to Loyalists and repay debts to foreigners as the treaty required. Britain and Spain threatened to take advantage of U.S. weakness by expanding their interests in the western lands. 
Economic Problems The underlying problem was that Congress had no 
taxing power and could only request that the states donate money for national needs. It had no dependable source of revenue to repay the money it borrowed to fight the war. Similarly, states had large unpaid debts as well. The unpaid debts resulted in limited credit and reduced foreign trade. The printing of worthless paper money by many states added to the problems. These problems combined to cause an economic depression.
Internal Conflicts The 13 states treated one another as rivals and 
competed for economic advantage. They placed tariffs and other restrictions on the movement of goods across state lines. A number of states faced boundary disputes with neighbors that increased interstate tension. The national government had no power to settle these disputes.
Shays’s Rebellion In the summer of 1786, Captain Daniel Shays, a 
Massachusetts farmer and Revolutionary War veteran, led other farmers in an uprising against high state taxes, imprisonment for debt, and lack of paper money. The rebel farmers stopped the collection of taxes and forced the closing of debtors’ courts. In January 1787, when Shays and his followers attempted to seize weapons from the Springfield armory, the state militia of Massachusetts broke Shays’s Rebellion.

1. “The government designed by the Articles of Confederation made it 
easy for relatively small groups of people—especially individual states or sections of the country—to block any change. There was a requirement for every single state to agree to alter the powers of the Confederation…
From the beginning the Union had been a pretty loose alliance, so people 
felt relatively free about saying they just didn’t feel like going along with a particular policy… The result was stalemate. I can tell you that the people who wrote the Constitution thought a stalemated government could not s u r v i v e .”
George William Van Cleve, interview, The Nation , 2017 
“The conventional view is that American political history from the Declaration of Independence to the Constitution was dominated by ‘the complete inability of the government set up by the Articles of Confederation to function. ’ This view ignores effective exercises of national power that took place during this period and the evolution of institutions extending beyond the text of the articles. Congress and the state judiciaries often read the Articles broadly and expansively in response to the practical needs of the country. The institutions created by Congress exercise wide powers that furthered national unity, and the states acquiesced. ”

123  TOPIC 3.8    THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AND DEBATES OVER RATIFICATION  
Topic 3.8 
The Constitutional Convention and 
Debates Over Ratification 
Thus I consent, sir, to this Constitution, because I expect no better,  
and because I am not sure that it is not the best.
Benjamin Franklin, 1787 
Learning Objective : Explain the differing ideological positions on the 
structure and function of the federal government.
W ith these words, Benjamin Franklin, the oldest delegate at the 
Constitutional Convention  in Philadelphia, attempted to overcome the 
skepticism of other delegates about the document that they had created. Would 
the new document, the Constitution, establish a central government strong enough to hold 13 states together in a union that could prosper and endure? Several problems led to a convention that wrote a new constitution, which was followed by intense debates on whether to ratify the new plan of government.
The Annapolis Convention
To review what could be done about the country’s inability to overcome critical problems, George Washington hosted a conference at his home in Mount Vernon, Virginia (1785). Representatives from Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania agreed that the problems were serious enough to hold further discussions at a later meeting at Annapolis, Maryland, with all the states invited. Only five states sent delegates to the Annapolis Convention in 1786. After discussing ways to improve commercial relations among the states, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton persuaded the others that 
another convention should be held in Philadelphia for the purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.
Drafting the Constitution at Philadelphia
After a number of states elected delegates to the proposed Philadelphia convention, Congress consented to give its approval to the meeting. It called upon all 13 states to send delegates to Philadelphia “for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation. ” Only Rhode Island, not trusting the other states, refused to send delegates.
124 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Delegates
Of the 55 delegates who went to Philadelphia for the convention in the summer 
of 1787, all were White, all were male, and most were college-educated. As a group, they were relatively young (averaging in their early forties). With few exceptions, they were far wealthier than the average American of their day. They were well acquainted with issues of law and politics. A number of them were practicing lawyers, and many had helped to write their state constitutions.
The first order of business was to elect a presiding officer and decide whether 
or not to communicate with the public at large. The delegates voted to conduct their meetings in secret and say nothing to the public about their discussions until their work was completed. George Washington was unanimously elected chairperson. Benjamin Franklin, the elder statesman at age 81, provided a calming and unifying influence. The work in fashioning specific articles of the Constitution was directed by James Madison (who came to be known, despite his objections, as the Father of the Constitution), Alexander Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, and John Dickinson. While they represented different states, these convention leaders shared the common goal of wanting to strengthen the young nation.
Several major leaders of the American Revolution were not at the 
convention. John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams were on diplomatic business abroad, and Thomas Paine was also in Europe. Samuel Adams and John Hancock were not chosen as delegates. Patrick Henry, opposing any growth in federal power, refused to take part. 
James Madison kept detailed notes on the debates at the convention. Since the convention did not allow outside 
observers and delegates were prohibited from talking to the press, his notes have shaped how historians interpret what happened during the convention. This engraving was probably made when Madison was in his 60s.

125  TOPIC 3.8    THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AND DEBATES OVER RATIFICATION  Key Issues at the Convention
The convention opened with the delegates disagreeing sharply on its 
fundamental purpose. Some wanted to simply revise the Articles. Strong nationalists, such as Madison and Hamilton, wanted to draft an entirely new document. They argued that the confederate model of government, in which the states were loosely united under a weak central government, was unworkable. They believed in federalism, a system with a strong but limited central government. The nationalists quickly took control of the convention.
Americans in the 1780s generally distrusted government and feared that 
officials would seize every opportunity to abuse their powers, even if they were popularly elected. Therefore, Madison and other delegates believed in the separation of powers , dividing power among different branches of 
government. They wanted the new constitution to be based on a system of checks and balances, in which the power of each branch would be limited by the powers of the others. (For more on federalism and separation of powers, see Topic 3.9.)
Representation  Especially divisive was the issue of whether the larger 
states such as Virginia and Pennsylvania should have proportionally more representatives in Congress  than the smaller states such as New Jersey and 
Delaware. Madison’s proposal—the Virginia Plan—favored the larger states. It was countered by the New Jersey Plan, which favored the smaller states. 
The issue was finally resolved by a compromise solution. Roger Sherman of Connecticut proposed the Connecticut Plan  or the Great Compromise . It 
provided for a bicameral (two-house) Congress. In the Senate , states would 
have equal representation, but in the House of Representatives, each state would be represented according to the size of its population.
Slavery  Two contentious issues grew out of slavery. Should enslaved 
people be counted in the state populations? Southerners argued they should. northerners said that since they did not have the rights of citizens, they should not. The delegates agreed to the Three-Fifths Compromise, which counted each enslaved individual as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of determining a state’s level of taxation and representation. Should the slave trade be allowed? Some delegates wanted to ban it for humanitarian reasons. Others were concerned about maintaining a supply of labor. The delegates decided to guarantee that enslaved people could be imported for at least 20 years longer, until 1808. Congress could vote to abolish the practice after that date if it wished.
Trade  The northern states wanted the central government to regulate 
interstate commerce and foreign trade. The south was afraid that export taxes would be placed on its agricultural products such as tobacco and rice. The Commercial Compromise allowed Congress to regulate interstate and 
foreign commerce, including placing tariffs (taxes) on foreign imports, but it prohibited placing taxes on any exports.
126 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Presidency The delegates debated over the president’s term of office. 
Some argued that the chief executive should hold office for life. The delegates 
limited the president’s term to four years but with no limit on the number of terms. They also debated the method for electing a president. Rather than having voters elect a president directly, the delegates decided to assign to each state a number of electors equal to the total of that state’s representatives and senators. This Electoral College system was instituted because the delegates feared that too much democracy might lead to mob rule. Finally, the delegates debated what powers to give the president. They finally decided to grant the president considerable power, including the power to veto acts of Congress. 
Ratification Procedure  On September 17, 1787, after 17 weeks of debate, 
the Philadelphia convention approved a draft of the Constitution to submit to the states for ratification. Anticipating opposition, the Framers (delegates) specified in Article VII that a favorable vote of only nine states out of 13 was required for ratification. Each state would hold popularly elected conventions to debate and vote on the proposed Constitution.
Federalists and Anti-Federalists
Ratification was fiercely debated for almost a year, from September 1787 until June 1788. Supporters of the Constitution and its strong federal government were known as Federalists. Opponents who feared that that new government would be too strong were known as Anti-Federalists. Federalists were most common along the Atlantic Coast and in the large cities, while Anti-Federalists tended to be small farmers and settlers on the western frontier.

127  TOPIC 3.8    THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AND DEBATES OVER RATIFICATION  The Federalist Papers
A key element in the Federalist campaign for the Constitution was a series of 
highly persuasive essays written for a New Y ork newspaper by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay. The 85 essays, later published in book form as The Federalist Papers, presented cogent reasons for believing in the practicality of each major provision of the Constitution.
The Path to Ratification
The Federalists won early victories in the state conventions in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania—the first three states to ratify. However, the Federalists were not confident of victory in enough other states for ratification. 
Debate on a Bill of Rights One of the main objections expressed by the 
Anti-Federalists was that the proposed Constitution lacked a list of specific rights that the federal government could not violate. They argued that Americans had fought the Revolutionary War to escape a tyrannical government in Britain. What was to stop a strong central government under the Constitution from acting similarly? Only by adding a bill of rights could Americans be protected against such a possibility.
Federalists responded that since members of Congress would be elected by 
the people, they did not need to be protected against themselves. Furthermore, people should assume that all rights were protected rather than create a limited list of rights that might allow unscrupulous officials to assert that unlisted rights could be violated. However, to win support for the Constitution, the Federalists promised to add to it a bill of rights as the first order of business for a new Congress. (For the language of the Bill of Rights, see Topic 3.9.)
Ratification Achieved With this promise, the Federalists successfully 
addressed the Anti-Federalists’ most significant objection. With New Hampshire voting yes in June 1788, the Federalists won the necessary nine states to achieve ratification of the Constitution. Even so, the large states of Virginia and New Y ork had not yet acted. If they failed to ratify, any chance for national unity and strength would be in dire jeopardy.
Final States In 1788, Virginia was by far the most populous of the original 
13 states. There, the Anti-Federalists rallied behind two strong leaders, George Mason and Patrick Henry, who viewed the Constitution and a strong central government as threats to Americans’ hard-won liberty. Virginia’s Federalists, led by Washington, Madison, and John Marshall, managed to prevail by a close vote only after promising a bill of rights.
News of Virginia’s vote had enough influence on New Y ork’s ratifying 
convention (combined with Alexander Hamilton’s efforts) to win the day for the Constitution in that state. North Carolina in November 1789 and Rhode Island in May 1790 reversed their earlier rejections and thus became the last two states to ratify the Constitution as the new “supreme law of the land. ”

130 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION
Topic 3.9
The Constitution
The Constitution is the guide which I never will abandon. 
George Washington, letter to the Boston city leaders, 1795
Learning Objective : Explain the continuities and changes in the 
structure and functions of the government with the ratification of the 
Constitution.
The men who wrote the newly ratified Constitution hoped it would both 
follow the ideals of the Enlightenment and provide a working system to guide 
the new republic. They wanted to correct the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation without creating a government with excessive power. To guard against tyranny, they divided power vertically—between the federal and state levels. The also divided federal power horizontally—among three branches. As a further step toward keeping government power in check, and to fulfill a promise made during the ratification debates, one of the first tasks of the new Congress was to propose a Bill of Rights. 
Federalism
The writers of the Constitution (or Framers) divided power between the federal government and state governments. The federal government would handle issues that affected the entire country, such as national defense and foreign affairs, and issues that crossed state boundaries, such interstate commerce and a postal service. States would be in charge of issues that affected only their state, such as schools and local elections. 
As changes in transportation, communication, and the economy have 
increased the interactions among people across state lines, the federal government has become more powerful. Further, constitutional amendments added specific powers to the federal government. For example, the 19th Amendment, ratified in 1920, gave Congress the power to protect the right of women to vote. 
By the 21st century, the government accounted for around 40 percent of 
the gross domestic product of the country. The federal goverment was usually responsible for over half of all public expenditures, paying for programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and the military, and transferring money to state and local governments. However, most public employees worked for state or local governments, with the largest number employed in schools and universities.
131  TOPIC 3.9   THE CONSTITUTIONSeparation of Powers
The Framers also divided powers among three main branches of government:
• legislative: Congress makes laws, passes taxes, and allocates spending
• executive: led by the president, it recommends and carries out laws and 
federal programs 
• judicial: it consists of the Supreme Court and all lower federal courts; it interprets the laws and the Constitution
The Constitution provided each branch of government ways to limit the 
power or at least influence the other two branches:
• Congress can pass laws, but the president can veto laws and the Supreme Court can rule them unconstitutional.
• The president can make treaties, but they must be ratified by Congress.
• The president can enforce the laws, but the Supreme Court can stop those actions if it finds that they violate the Constitution.
• The Supreme Court interprets the laws, but Congress can write new laws.
• The Supreme Court can order a president to enforce a law, but a president has the power to appoint justices.
The Bill of Rights
In 1789, the first Congress acted quickly to approve amendments to defend individual liberty. Drafted largely by James Madison, the ten ratified by the states in 1791 are known as the Bill of Rights. Originally, they protected against abuses by the central (or federal) government. Since the ratification of the 14th Amendment in 1868, most of the protections have been extended to apply to abuses by state governments as well. Below is the text of the Bill of Rights.
First Amendment “Congress shall make no law respecting an 
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. ”
Second Amendment “ A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the 
security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. ”
Third Amendment “No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any 
house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner prescribed by law. ”
Fourth Amendment “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, 
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. ”
132 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONFifth Amendment “No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or 
otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand 
Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation. ”
Sixth Amendment “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy 
the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed; which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense. ”
Seventh Amendment “In suits of common law, where the value in 
controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law. ”
Eighth Amendment “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive 
fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. ”
Ninth Amendment “The enumeration in the Constitution of certain 
rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. ”
Tenth Amendment “The powers not delegated to the United States by 
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States 
respectively, or to the people. ”

134 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONSHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
1. “The contest over the Constitution was not primarily a war over abstract 
political ideals, such as states’ rights and centralization, but over concrete economic issues, and the political division which accompanied it was substantially along the lines of the interests affected—the financiers, public creditors, traders, commercial men, manufacturers, and allied groups, centering mainly in the larger seaboard towns, being chief among the advocates of the Constitution, and the farmers, particularly in the inland regions, and the debtors being chief among its opponents. That other considerations, such as the necessity for stronger national defense, entered into the campaign is, of course, admitted, but with all due allowances, it may be truly said that the Constitution was a product of a struggle between capitalistic and agrarian interests. ”
 Charles A. Beard, historian, Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy, 1915
“It is easy to accept the general proposition that ideas and interests are somehow associated. . . . But there are some dangers in working with any such formula. The first is that ideas—or all those intangible emotional, moral, and intellectual forces that may roughly be combined under the rubric of ideas—will somehow be dissolved and that we will be left only with interests on our hands. . . Then there is the danger that interests will be too narrowly construed: that we will put too much emphasis on the motives and purposes of individuals and groups, not enough on the structural requirements of a social system or on the limitations imposed on men by particular historical situations . . . that the way in which men perceive and define their interests is in some good part a reflex of the ideas they have inherited and the experiences they have undergone. . . 
For the generation of the Founding Fathers, the central, formative, 
shattering, and then reintegrating experience of civic life was the Revolution, which recast the pattern of their interests and galvanized their inherited store of ideas. ”

135  TOPIC 3.10   S HAPING A NEW REPUBLIC  
Topic 3.10
Shaping a New Republic 
There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic  
into two great parties. . . . [It] is to be dreaded as the greatest political  
evil under our Constitution. 
John Adams, letter to Jonathan Jackson, 1780 
Learning Objective 1 : Explain how and why competition intensified 
conflict among peoples and nations from 1754 to 1800. 
Learning Objective 2 : Explain how and why political ideas, institutions, 
and party systems developed and changed in the new republic.
Having faced the challenges of declaring independence, fighting a 
Revolutionary War, agreeing on a Constitution, and forming a functioning 
government, the new nation’s continued existence was not guaranteed. Under the leadership of the first two presidents, George Washington and John Adams, the Republic dealt with a multitude of challenges, both foreign and domestic.
Washington’s Presidency
Members of the first Congress under the Constitution were elected in 1788 and began their first session in March 1789 in New Y ork City (then the nation’s temporary capital). People assumed that George Washington would be the electoral college’s unanimous choice for president, and indeed he was.
Organizing the Federal Government
Washington took the oath of office as the first U.S. president on April 30, 1789. From then on, what the Constitution and its system of checks and balances actually meant in practice would be determined from day to day by the decisions of Congress as the legislative branch, the president as the head of the executive branch, and the Supreme Court as the top federal court in the judicial branch.
Executive Departments  As chief executive, Washington’s first task 
was to organize new departments of the executive (law-enforcing) branch. The Constitution authorizes the president to appoint chiefs of departments, although they must be confirmed, or approved, by the Senate. Washington appointed four heads of departments: Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state, Alexander Hamilton as secretary of the treasury, Henry Knox as secretary of 
136 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONwar, and Edmund Randolph as attorney general. These four men formed a 
cabinet of advisers with whom President Washington met regularly to discuss major policy issues. Today, presidents still meet with their cabinets to obtain advice and information.
Federal Court System The only federal court mentioned in the 
Constitution is the Supreme Court. Congress, however, was given the power to create other federal courts with lesser powers and to determine the number of justices making up the Supreme Court. One of Congress’ first laws was the Judiciary Act of 1789, which established a Supreme Court with one chief justice and five associate justices. This highest court was empowered to rule on the constitutionality of decisions made by state courts. The act also provided for a system of 13 district courts and three circuit courts of appeals.
Hamilton’s Financial Program
One of the most pressing problems faced by Congress under the Articles had been the government’s financial difficulties. Alexander Hamilton, secretary of the treasury, presented to Congress a plan for putting U.S. finances on a stable foundation. Hamilton’s plan included three main actions. (1) Pay off the national debt  at face value and have the federal government assume the war debts of the 
states. (2) Protect the young nation’s “infant” (new and developing) industries and collect adequate revenues at the same time by imposing high tariffs on imported goods. (3) Create a national bank for depositing government funds and printing banknotes that would provide the basis for a stable U.S. currency. Support for this program came chiefly from northern merchants, who would gain directly from high tariffs and a stabilized currency.
Opponents of Hamilton’s financial plan included the Anti-Federalists, who 
feared that the states would lose power to the extent that the central government gained it. Thomas Jefferson led a faction of southern Anti-Federalists who viewed Hamilton’s program as benefiting only the rich at the expense of indebted farmers. After political wrangling and bargaining, Congress finally adopted Hamilton’s plan in slightly modified form. For example, the tariffs were not as high as Hamilton wanted.
Debt  Jefferson and his supporters agreed to Hamilton’s insistence that the 
U.S. government pay off the national debt at face value and assume payment of the war debts of the states. In return for Jefferson’s support on this aspect of his plan, Hamilton agreed to Jefferson’s idea for the nation’s capital to be in the south along the Potomac River (an area that, after Washington’s death, would be named Washington, D.C.).
National Bank Jefferson argued that the Constitution did not give 
Congress the power to create a bank. But Hamilton took a broader view of the Constitution, arguing that the document’s “necessary and proper” clause authorized Congress to do whatever was necessary to carry out its enumerated powers. Washington supported Hamilton on the issue, and the proposed bank was voted into law. Although chartered by the federal government, the Bank 
137  TOPIC 3.10   S HAPING A NEW REPUBLIC  of the United States was privately owned. As a major shareholder of the bank, 
the federal government could print paper currency and use federal deposits to stimulate business.
Foreign Affairs Under Washington
Washington’s first term as president (1789–1793) coincided with the outbreak of revolution in France, a cataclysmic event that was to touch off a series of wars between the new French Republic and the monarchies of Europe. Washington’s entire eight years as president, as well as the four years of his successor, John Adams, were taken up with the question of whether to give U.S. support to France, France’s enemies, or neither side.
French Revolution 
Americans generally supported the French people’s aspiration to establish a republic, but many were also horrified by reports of mob hysteria and mass executions. To complicate matters, the U.S.–French alliance remained in effect, although it was an alliance with the French monarchy, not with the revolutionary republic. Jefferson and his supporters sympathized with the revolutionary cause. They also argued that because Britain was seizing American merchant ships bound for French ports, the United States should join France in its defensive war against Britain.
Proclamation of Neutrality (1793) Washington, however, believed that 
the young nation was not strong enough to engage in a European war. Resisting popular clamor, in 1793 he issued a proclamation of U.S. neutrality in the conflict. Jefferson resigned from the cabinet in disagreement with Washington’s policy.
“Citizen” Genêt  Objecting to Washington’s policy, “Citizen” Edmond 
Genêt, the French minister to the United States, broke all the rules of diplomacy by appealing directly to the American people to support the French cause. So outrageous was his conduct, even Jefferson approved of Washington’s request to the French government that they remove Genêt. Recalled by his government, Genêt chose to remain in the United States, where he married and became a U.S. citizen.
The Jay Treaty (1794) with Great Britain 
Washington sent Chief Justice John Jay on a special mission to Britain to talk about two issues. One was Britain’s continued occupation of posts on the U.S. western frontier. The other was Britain’s offensive practice of searching and seizing American ships and impressing seamen into the British navy. After a year of negotiations, Jay brought back a treaty in which Britain agreed to evacuate its posts but included nothing about impressment. Narrowly ratified by the Senate, the unpopular Jay Treaty  angered American supporters of 
France, but it did maintain Washington’s policy of neutrality, which kept the United States at peace.
138 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Pinckney Treaty (1795) with Spain 
Totally unexpected was the effect that the Jay Treaty had on Spain’s policy 
toward its territories in the Americas. Seeing the treaty as a sign that the United States might be drawing closer to Spain’s longtime foe Britain, Spain decided to consolidate its holdings in North America. The Spanish influence in the Far West had been strengthened by a series of Catholic missions along the California coast, but they were concerned about their colonies in the southeast. Thomas Pinckney, the U.S. minister to Spain, negotiated a treaty with these provisions:
• Spain opened the lower Mississippi River and New Orleans to American trade. 
• The right of deposit was granted to Americans so that they could transfer 
cargoes in New Orleans without paying duties to the Spanish government. 
• Spain accepted the U.S. claim that Florida’s northern boundary should be at the 31st parallel (not north of that line, as Spain had formerly insisted).
Domestic Concerns under Washington
In addition to coping with foreign challenges, stabilizing the nation’s credit, and organizing the new government, Washington faced a number of domestic problems and crises.

American Indians Through the final decades of the 18th century, settlers 
crossed the Alleghenies and moved the frontier steadily westward into the Ohio Valley and beyond. In an effort to resist the settlers’ encroachment on their 
139  TOPIC 3.10   S HAPING A NEW REPUBLIC  lands, a number of the tribes formed the Northwest (or Western) Confederacy. 
The Shawnee, Delaware, Iroquois, and other tribes allied under the Miami war chief Little Turtle. Initially, they won a series of bloody victories over the settler militias. 
In some cases, the British were supplying the American Indians with 
arms and encouraging them to attack the settlers. Hearing this incensed the Americans. In 1794, the U.S. army, led by General Anthony Wayne, defeated the Confederacy tribes at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in northwestern Ohio. The next year, the chiefs of the defeated peoples agreed to the Treaty of Greenville , 
in which they surrendered claims to the Ohio Territory and promised to open it up to settlement.
The Whiskey Rebellion (1794) Hamilton, to make up the revenue lost 
because tariffs were lower than he wanted, persuaded Congress to pass excise taxes, particularly on the sale of whiskey. In western Pennsylvania, the refusal of a group of farmers to pay the federal tax on whiskey seemed to pose a major challenge to the viability of the U.S. government under the Constitution. The rebelling farmers could ill afford to pay a tax on the whiskey that they distilled from surplus corn. Rather than pay the tax, they defended their “liberties” by attacking the revenue collectors.
Washington responded to this crisis by federalizing 15,000 state militia and 
placing them under the command of Alexander Hamilton. The show of force had its intended effects. The Whiskey Rebellion collapsed with almost no bloodshed and the federal government solidified its authority. Some Americans applauded Washington’s action, contrasting it with the previous government’s helplessness to do anything about Shays’s Rebellion. Among westerners, however, the military action was widely resented and condemned as an unwarranted use of force against the common people. The government’s chief critic, Thomas Jefferson, gained in popularity as a champion of western farmers.
Western Lands In the 1790s, the Jay Treaty and the victory at the Battle 
of Fallen Timbers gave the federal government control of vast tracts of land. Congress encouraged the rapid settlement of these lands by passing the Public Land Act in 1796, which established orderly procedures for dividing and selling federal lands at moderate prices. The process for adding new states to the Union, as set forth in the Constitution, went smoothly. While the first new state was in New England (Vermont in 1791), the next two reflected the country’s push westward: Kentucky in 1792 and Tennessee in 1796.
The First Political Parties
Washington’s election by unanimous vote of the Electoral College in 1789 underscored the popular belief that political parties were not needed. The Constitution itself did not mention political parties, and the framers assumed none would arise. They were soon proven wrong. The debates between Federalists and Anti-Federalists in 1787 and 1788 were the first indication that a two-party system would emerge as a core feature of American politics.
140 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONOrigins
In colonial times, groups of legislators commonly formed temporary factions 
and voted together either for or against a specific policy. When an issue was settled, the factions would dissolve. The dispute between Federalists and Anti-Federalists over the ratification of the Constitution closely resembled the factional disputes of an earlier period. What was unusual about this conflict was that it was organized—at least by the Federalists—across state lines and in that sense prefigured the national parties that emerged soon afterward.
In the 1790s, sometimes called the Federalist era because it was dominated 
largely by Federalist policies, political parties began to form around two leading figures, Hamilton and Jefferson. The Federalist Party supported Hamilton and his financial program. In opposition, the Democratic-Republican Party 
supported Jefferson and tried to elect candidates in different states who opposed Hamilton’s program. The French Revolution further solidified the formation of national political parties . Americans divided sharply over whether to 
support France. A large number followed Jefferson’s lead in openly challenging President Washington’s neutrality policy.
Differences Between the Parties
The Federalists were strongest in the northeastern states and advocated the growth of federal power. The Democratic-Republicans were strongest in the southern states and on the western frontier and argued for states’ rights. By 1796, the two major political parties were taking shape and becoming better organized. In that year, President Washington announced that he intended to retire to private life at the end of his second term.

141  TOPIC 3.10   S HAPING A NEW REPUBLIC  Washington’s Farewell Address
Assisted by Alexander Hamilton, the retiring president wrote a speech known 
as his Farewell Address for publication in the newspapers in late 1796. This message had enormous influence because of Washington’s prestige. The president spoke against policies and practices that he considered unwise:
• Do not get involved in European affairs.
• Do not make “permanent alliances” in foreign affairs.
• Do not form political parties.
• Do not fall into sectionalism.
For the next century, future presidents would mostly heed Washington’s 
first two warnings against foreign entanglements. However, in the case of political parties, Washington was already behind the times. By the time he spoke, political parties were well on their way to becoming a vital part of the American political system and sectional differences were growing stronger. 
One long-term consequence of Washington’s decision to leave office after 
two terms was that later presidents followed his example. Presidents elected to two terms (including Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and Jackson) would voluntarily retire even though the Constitution placed no limit on a president’s tenure in office. The two-term tradition continued unbroken until 1940 when Franklin Roosevelt won election to a third term. Then, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, made the two-term limit a part of the Constitution.
John Adams’ Presidency
Even as Washington was writing his Farewell Address, political parties were working to gain majorities in the two houses of Congress and to line up enough electors from the various states to elect the next president. The vice president, John Adams, was the Federalists’ candidate, while former secretary of state Thomas Jefferson was the choice of the Democratic-Republicans.
Adams won by three electoral votes. Jefferson became vice president, 
since the original Constitution gave that office to the candidate receiving the second highest number of electoral votes. (Since the ratification of the 12th Amendment in 1804, the president and vice president have run as a team.)
The XYZ Affair Troubles abroad related to the French Revolution 
presented Adams with the first major challenge of his presidency. Americans were angered that French warships and privateers were seizing U.S. merchant ships. Seeking a peaceful settlement, Adams sent a delegation to Paris to negotiate with the French government. Certain French ministers, known only as X, Y , and Z because their names were never revealed, requested bribes as the basis for entering into negotiations. The American delegates indignantly refused. Newspaper reports of the demands made by X, Y , and Z infuriated many Americans, who now clamored for war against France. “Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute” became the slogan of the hour. One faction 
142 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONof the Federalist Party, led by Alexander Hamilton, hoped that by going to war 
the United States could gain French and Spanish lands in North America. 
President Adams, on the other hand, resisted the popular sentiment for 
war. Recognizing that the U.S. Army and Navy were not yet strong enough to fight a major power, the president avoided war and sent new ministers to Paris.
The Alien and Sedition Acts Anger against France strengthened the 
Federalists in the congressional elections of 1798 enough to win a majority in both houses. The Federalists took advantage of their victory by enacting laws to restrict their political opponents, the Democratic-Republicans. For example, since most immigrants voted Democratic-Republican, the Federalists passed the Naturalization Act, which increased from 5 to 14 the years required for immigrants to qualify for U.S. citizenship. They also passed the Alien Acts, which authorized the president to deport aliens considered dangerous and to detain enemy aliens in time of war. Most seriously, they passed the Sedition Act, which made it illegal for newspaper editors to criticize either the president or Congress and imposed fines or imprisonment for editors who violated the law.
The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions Democratic-Republicans 
argued that the Alien and Sedition Acts violated rights guaranteed by the 1st Amendment of the Constitution. In 1799, however, the Supreme Court had not yet established the principle of judicial review, the idea that the court could overturn a law that it found in conflict with the Constitution (see Topic 4.2). Democratic-Republican leaders challenged the legislation of the Federalist Congress by enacting nullifying laws of their own in the state legislatures. The Kentucky legislature adopted a resolution that had been written by Thomas Jefferson, and the Virginia legislature adopted a resolution introduced by James Madison. Both resolutions declared that the states had entered into a “compact” in forming the national government. Therefore, if any act of the federal government broke the compact, a state could nullify the federal law. Although only Kentucky and Virginia adopted nullifying resolutions in 1799, they set forth an argument and rationale that would be widely used in the nullification controversy of the 1830s (see Topic 4.8).
The immediate crisis over the Alien and Sedition Acts faded when 
the Federalists lost control of Congress after the election of 1800, and the Democratic-Republican majority allowed the acts to expire or repealed them. Further, in 1803, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Marshall asserted its power in deciding whether federal laws were constitutional.

145  TOPIC 3.11   DEVELOPING AN AMERICAN IDENTITY
Topic 3.11
Developing an American Identity
The American is a new man, who acts upon new principles; he must 
therefore entertain new ideas, and form new opinions. 
J. Hector St. John Crèvecoeur, Letters from an American Farmer, 1782 
Learning Objective : Explain the continuities and changes in American 
culture from 1754 to 1800.
A truly unique American identity would take at least a generation, if not more, 
to became clearly established and recognized. Admiration of the influence of 
the “founding fathers, ” the leaders who declared independence, fought a war to achieve it, and created a new system of government, became the core of an American identity which continues today. A clear example of this influence is demonstrated by the actions of George Washington. His Farewell Address (Topic 3.10) and two-term tradition as president retain their relevancy in varying degrees today. That people still debate the meaning of the founding fathers’ words and ideas reflects their importance in understanding the United States and its people, then and now. In the process of forging an identity, Americans retained much of their ancestors’ culture and traditions. The evolving identity would be built on the foundation of the people and culture of the 13 colonies (Topic 2.7), formed by the thought and experience of the Revolution (Topics 3.4 and 3.6), and enlarged by regional differences (Topic 2.3) and the ongoing additions of immigrants. 
Social Change
In addition to revolutionizing the politics of the 13 states, the War for Independence also profoundly changed American society. Some changes occurred immediately before the war ended, while others evolved gradually as the ideas of the Revolution began to filter into the attitudes of the common people. Together, these changes fostered growing awareness of how the United States was different from Great Britain and the rest of Europe. 
Abolition of Aristocratic Titles State constitutions and laws abolished 
old institutions that had originated in medieval Europe. No legislature could grant titles of nobility, nor could any court recognize the feudal practice of primogeniture (the first-born son’s right to inherit his family’s property). Whatever aristocracy existed in colonial America was further weakened by the confiscation of large estates owned by Loyalists. Many such estates were subdivided and sold to raise money for the war.
146 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONSeparation of Church and State Most states adopted the principle of 
separation of church and state. In other words, they refused to give financial 
support to any religious group. The Anglican Church (which became known as the Episcopal Church in the United States) formerly had been closely tied to the king’s government. However, it was disestablished (lost state support) in the south. Only in three New England states—New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Massachusetts—did the Congregational Church continue to receive state support in the form of a religious tax. This practice was finally discontinued in New England early in the 1830s.
Regional Variations As the example of church-state separation shows, all 
of the states did not change at the same time. The regional differences that emerged in the colonial period continued to shape how the states evolved. The term “southerner” had entered common usage in the 1780s. The biggest difference was in slavery. While slavery continued to decline in northern states, it became stronger than ever in southern states. 
Visitors also noticed differences in how people acted. In 1785, Jefferson 
wrote to a friend in France that an observant visitor could determine the line of latitude simply by paying attention to the character of the people in the area. In general, said Jefferson, northerners were more serious and persevering in their work, while southerners were more generous and forthright in their speech.
Political Change
The development of political parties (Topic 3.10) both added to and reflected the American identity. The distinctions between the two initial parties, the Federalist and Democratic-Republican, had their origins in the debate between Federalists and Anti-Federalists over the ratification of the Constitution. These distinctions matured largely based on regional differences and distinct views of the roles, functions, and powers of the federal government. The evolution of political parties continues today, as does the distinctiveness of an American identity. 
The Great Seal includes symbols that represent the United States. For example, the stars represent the 13 original 
states, the olive branch represents a desire for peace, and the arrows represent a readiness to go to war. The white stripes represent purity, the red stripes represent courage, and the blue field represents vigilance.

147  TOPIC 3.11   DEVELOPING AN AMERICAN IDENTITYCultural Change
While much of the nation’s culture reflected its British origins, gradually 
a distinctive national identity evolved. This change was facilitated by the expansion of newspapers in the late 1700s as a means of communication and a source for political discussion. Writer Charles Brockden Brown explored the meaning of an American identity through novels. In Philadelphia, Charles Wilson Peale  opened what is recognized as the first art gallery. In the 1790s, 
Pierre-Charles L ’Enfant developed the design for Washington, D.C., Gilbert Stuart  painted the nation’s leaders, and the American Academy of Fine Arts 
held its first exhibition. Later, developments such as the first dictionary for American English and a book on American geography would continue the process of creating a distinctive culture.

“Friends, what then is the American, this new man? He is either a 
European, or the descendant of a European, hence that strange mixture of blood, which you will find in no other country. I could point out to you a family whose grandfather was an Englishman, whose wife was Dutch, whose son married a Frenchwoman, and whose present four sons have now four wives of different nations. 
He is an American, who leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and 
manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the new rank he holds. He becomes an American by being received in the broad lap of our great alma mater. Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men, whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world. . . .

Topic 3.12
Movement in the Early Republic
I have long since given up the expectation of any early provision for 
getting in the extinguishment of slavery among us.
Thomas Jefferson letter to William Burwell, 1805 
Learning Objective 1 : Explain how and why migration and immigration 
to and within North America caused competition and conflict over time.
Learning Objective 2 : Explain the continuities and changes in regional 
attitudes about slavery as it expanded from 1754 to 1800. 
The founding of the Republic increased the movement of people, mainly 
westward. The uncertainties of rebellion and war had ended. With peace and 
the removal of British control came a re-ordering of government and life. At the same time, however, hostile forces remained on the borders of the new nation. The British to the north and west, and the Spanish to the south and west, both threatened the young country’s existence. In addition, both within and on the borders lived Native Americans who resented the expansion of European settlers onto their lands. 
Migration and Settlement
The people who moved west, whether they were born in America or came as free immigrants or indentured servants or enslaved Africans, faced a range of forces, both friendly and hostile. This movement was recognized and accepted from the very beginning of the nation. The Northwest Ordinance (Topic 3.7), enacted under the Articles of Confederation, provided a mechanism for migration and settlement. It planned for the sale of government land, an orderly adoption of western territory into new states, public education, and outlawed slavery in the territory. While the government had foreseen migration, it still could not eliminate the disputes and conflicts that developed. 
American Indians
By the end of the 18th century, Native Americans found themselves losing conflicts with settlers. As a result, they were increasingly either living on reservations or forced to migrate west. 
Laws  In 1790, the Indian Intercourse Act was one of the first laws passed 
by the new nation. The act placed the federal government in control of all legal 
150 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONactions with Native Americans. Only the federal government, not the states, 
could purchase their land and regulate any trade and traveling over their lands. These laws were largely ignored by the traders and settlers migrating westward.
Resistance While the settlers ignored laws and treaties intended to 
maintain peace with the American Indians, the government usually supported the settlers when disputes turned violent. For example, in the Northwest Territory in the 1790s, a confederation of Shawnee and other American Indians twice successfully defeated government troops. In response, a larger government force defeated the confederation at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in what is today northwestern Ohio (Topic 3.10). The American Indian position was further weakened in this area as the British, who had supported them, gradually closed the trading forts that they had maintained there in the years immediately following the Revolution.
West of the Mississippi Migration was a survivable option for many tribes. 
They faced overwhelming force, fatal foreign diseases, and the destruction of their hunting grounds depriving them of food and furs to trade. Some did remain where their ancestors had settled. They were unwilling to leave their traditional lands despite being surrounded by hostile settlers. The Iroquois stayed on reservations or moved north to Canada. Many, including the Shawnee in the north and Cherokees further south (Topic 4.8), moved across the Mississippi River. These journeys were perilous as those tribes native to the west resisted these incursions into their traditional lands.
The Southern Frontier Further south, near New Orleans and in Florida, the 
Spanish were primarily concerned with stopping the incursion of settlers from the United States. As a result, they allowed Native Americans more freedom.

151  TOPIC 3.12   MOVEMENT IN THE EARLY REPUBLICPopulation Change
The population increased for several reasons. 
• Europeans continued to immigrate to the United States, but in small 
numbers. The flow increased or decreased in reaction to political and economic upheavals in Europe. 
• Enslaved Africans continued to be brought into the country. Slaveowners recognized that the Constitution allowed this trade to end after 1808. 
• The largest population gain was natural, as births exceeded deaths. The high birth rate was tied to a plentiful food supply and the desire of families to have children who could help on the farms. 
The westward movement was aided by scouts and early settlers who blazed 
trails through the wilderness for others to follow. Men such as the legendary Daniel Boone led the way across the Appalachian Mountains and established the early White settlements in the old northwest.
Slavery 
By the late 18th century, some people openly opposed slavery. Many of these were Quakers, Mennonites, or other people motivated by their Christian faith. Some were influenced by the Enlightenment ideals about equality and liberty. They saw no place for slavery in a democratic republic. In addition, many people, including slaveowners such as James Madison, disliked slavery, hoping it would fade away as it had in Europe and was beginning to do in parts of Latin America. They believed that increasing immigration would provide low-cost free labor to replace enslaved workers.
Cotton  Slavery, though, grew rather than declined beginning in 1793. In 
that year, Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, a device for separating cotton fiber from the seeds. This turned a slow, costly process into a quick, inexpensive one. The change transformed the agriculture of the south. Suddenly, growing cotton became immensely profitable and the demand for enslaved African Americans increased dramatically. 
Mechanization of the textile industry also increased the value of cotton. The 
British were the first to mechanize. To protect their advantage, they passed laws against taking knowledge of their factory designs outside the country. However, a young apprentice named Samuel Slater broke the British law. He memorized a factory design, moved to the United States, and built his own factory. This launched the a new, more efficient textile industry in the United States.
The combination of the cotton gin and mechanization of the textile 
industry made cotton cloth less expensive and more plentiful than ever before. The production of cotton goods became a potent global industry. 
Conflict Over Expansion of Slavery Within the United States, plantation 
owners eager to increase cotton production based on enslave labor looked westward for more land. After 1800, they quickly settled in Alabama and 
152 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONMississippi, which each had excellent climate and geography for growing 
cotton. However, their desire for lands farther west and north would soon face resistance. The growing number of northerners who opposed slavery or who hoped to settle these land themselves without competition from enslaved workers reflected an increasing regional conflict over slavery. 
The Movements of Enslaved African Americans Some enslaved people 
were able to escape bondage. They might find liberty by reaching a free state in the north, although the Constitution included a clause that required states to return fugitives to their owners. Some went to Canada. More settled in land controlled by Indians or in Florida, which belonged to Spain until 1821. 
Most enslaved people who moved did so because of their owners’ search for 
greater profits. By the 1790s, the Chesapeake area planters had more enslaved people than they wanted. A decline in the uncertain tobacco market combined with a growing enslaved population through natural increases and expanded importation created a surplus of enslaved people. Efforts to train enslaved people in skilled trades or lease them as servants in the growing cities did not meet the owners’ financial desires. In addition, moving enslaved people from the fields to towns, where they could more easily board boats and carriages,  added to the risk of people escaping to freedom in the north. 
The growing demand for workers in cotton fields provided Chesapeake 
planters a new opportunity. They could sell their enslaved African Americans to cotton planters in newly settled lands farther south and west, such as Alabama and Mississippi. This interregional slave trade became very large, with between 500,000 and 1 million people transported before the Civil War began in 1861. This trade was particularly cruel because it often broke families apart. Many of the enslaved people who were sold never saw their parents, children, or other relatives again.

155  TOPIC 3.13   C ONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN PERIOD 3 
Topic 3.13
Continuity and Change in Period 3 
Learning Objective : Explain how the American independence 
movement affected society from 1754 to 1800. 
The reasoning skill of “Continuity and Change” is the suggested focus for 
evaluating this period. As explained in the contextualization for Period 3, 
there are many factors to consider in the topic of the American independence movement’s effects on society and the national identity. A reasonable argument to explain the effects of independence on society requires one to examine the relevant historical evidence .
On the AP exam, a question may be focused on any one factor such as 
the impact of the ideas that stimulated independence on new values dealing with politics, religion, and society. In response, one would have to present specific historical evidence of a change  in values, such as the expansion of 
rights to include recognition of a new role for women including Republican Motherhood . At the same time, evidence also supports a continuity  of values in 
that a woman’s status was still considered inferior to men.
This period includes many examples of continuity and change in religion, 
commerce, foreign policy, politics, civil liberties, and relations between White Americans and Native Americans. After the United States won independence, state support for churches declined but religious fervor remained strong. One could also cite historical evidence to argue that the independence movement did not always bring change. The generally hostile attitudes of the settlers toward Native Americans continued and government legal efforts to maintain peace failed, just as they had under British rule. 
QUESTIONS ABOUT CONTINUITY AND CHANGE
Use the questions below to make a historically defensible claim.
1. Explain the extent to which the ideas that inspired the revolution changed society while maintaining much of British culture. For example, people examined women’s role in society more closely while they continued to follow traditional British religious practices. 
2. Explain how the independence efforts supported efforts to protect individual freedoms while still continuing to limit some rights. For example, view how the Bill of Rights protected individuals while at the same time the government continued to limit the right to vote. 
156 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:  DEVELOPMENTS AND PROCESSES
To analyze historical evidence, you must be able to identify historical ideas and 
then explain them. Identifying a historical idea is fairly simple. Y ou just say what it is. The idea you identify may fall into one of three categories.
• Historical concept: This is the broadest category. A concept can be an idea or a general understanding of something. Colonization, religious toleration, and salutary neglect are examples of concepts.
• Historical development: A development is a change or occurrence. For instance, you have learned about the development of an economic and cultural system within each colony. Also, you have learned about the development of the slave trade and the development of a U.S. national identity.
• Historical process: A process is a series of actions or events that lead to an end. Y ou have already learned about the political process. Y ou have also learned about the processes of adding new states to the Union and the process of harvesting cotton.
Historians do much more than identify concepts, developments, and processes. They also explain them. This means describing what it is and how it works, and perhaps providing one or more examples. 
An AP® exam might include multiple-choice questions that require you to 
identify the best example of a historical concept, development, or processes. The short-answer and long-answer questions will also require explanations of historical ideas. Improving your skills at identifying and explaining will help you on the AP® exams, as well as in other courses. Beyond school, they are two of the most basic, commonly used skills in work and everyday life.

Topic 4.1 
Contextualizing Period 4
Learning Objective : Explain the context in which the republic developed 
from 1800 to 1848.
In the first half of the 19th century, the young nation expanded economically, 
politically, and culturally. Economically this meant taking advantage of new 
lands, new forms of transportation, and new industries. Politically it meant allowing more people to participate directly in their democracy. Culturally it meant developing distinctively American expressions of literature and art. In 1826, in the midst of the years covered in this period, the young nation of the United States celebrated its 50th birthday with great optimism. The founders of the country were passing on, and a new generation was taking over leadership. In this period, the leaders dealt with the challenges that accompanied the development of the young nation.
Independence had been declared, a Revolutionary War won, a Constitution 
written and ratified, and a new government established. Between 1800 and 1848, the United States went through rapid demographic, economic, and territorial growth as the new republic worked to define itself. In 1800, the country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. By 1848, it controlled territory all the way to the Pacific Ocean. 
Reforms, Revivals, and Identity In response to this growth, the country 
reformed several institutions and practices. It expanded participation in political parties. By dropping property ownership as a requirement to vote, nearly all adult White males could cast ballots. By using nominating conventions, more people could help choose party candidates. More public school laws were enacted to educate the children. Reforms were made to prisons and asylums to make them more humane. A religious revival, an awakening, spread across the country. Much of this development of rights and reforms still excluded American Indians, African Americans, and all women.
The country developed its own art, literature, and philosophy to reflect a 
sense of itself as independent from Europe. In this sense, the country developed a national culture. However, different sections of the country also continued to grow more distinctive. Slavery shaped a distinctively southern way of life, while the northeastern states became more focused on commerce and the Midwest region on agriculture. UNIT 4 — Period 4: 1800–1848
164 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONMarkets, Farming, and Manufacturing These changes took place as a 
market economy emerged. People became less dependent on what they raised 
or made for themselves and more involved in buying and selling goods. The country benefited from the addition of fertile land farther west and advances in industry and transportation everywhere. Agriculture and manufacturing grew together, with the help of local, state, and federal governments to build roads, canals, and harbors. New technology made both farming and manufacturing more productive. The greater reliance on markets meant that more men worked away from home and women had greater control over homelife.
National Strength and Signs of Division In this period, the country grew 
stronger and larger. Politically, President Andrew Jackson, elected in 1828 and 1832, led efforts to solidify the power of the federal government over states. In general, the United States promoted foreign trade (particularly the export of cotton) but avoided entanglement in European diplomatic affairs and wars. Efforts to improve life succeeded for many but not those enslaved. Landmarks in the institution of slavery came earlier, with the development of the cotton gin in 1793 and the end of the importation of enslaved Africans in 1808. With the territorial and economic growth, conflict with American Indians continued while rising concerns over slavery focused on whether it should be allowed in the newly acquired lands. 
As this period ended, most people had a positive view of a prosperous 
country. However, some recognized that the growing regional differences and the question of whether to allow slavery to expand into new states and territories needed to be resolved.

Topic 4.2 
The Rise of Political Parties 
and the Era of Jefferson
But every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have 
called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all 
Republicans, we are all Federalists.
Thomas Jefferson, First Inaugural Address, 1801
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of policy debates in 
the early republic.
Despite President Washington’s warning against forming political parties, 
two groups quickly emerged in the new republic. The Federalists, following the 
visions of Alexander Hamilton, and the Democratic-Republicans, espousing Thomas Jefferson’s views, competed for public approval and control of the government.
The Election of 1800
During Adams’s presidency, the Federalists rapidly lost popularity. People disliked the Alien and Sedition Acts. Further, they complained about the new taxes imposed to pay for a possible war against France. Though Adams avoided war, he had persuaded Congress that building up the U.S. Navy was necessary for the nation’s defense.
Establishment of Political Parties The presidential election of 1800 
provided the first election with a clear choice between political parties. The Federalist Party stood for a stronger national government and leaned toward Great Britain in European affairs. The Democratic-Republican Party emphasized the powers reserved to states and leaned toward the French. 
Both parties supported tariffs on imports as a way to raise revenue. 
Throughout the 19th century, tariffs would be the largest single source of revenue for the federal government. The debate on tariffs broke down on regional lines. Northern industrialists wanted higher tariffs to protect their companies from foreign competition. Southerners relied on exports of cotton and other crops. They pushed for lower tariffs in order to encourage trade.
166 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONElection Results Determining the winner of the 1800 presidential election 
was complicated. According to the original Constitution, each member of the 
Electoral College cast two votes for president. The winner became president, and the second-place finisher became vice president. In 1800, a majority of the presidential electors cast their ballots for two Democratic-Republicans: one for Thomas Jefferson and one for Aaron Burr. The two tied for the presidency. As the Constitution required, the House of Representatives voted to choose the winner, with each state allowed one vote. They debated and voted for days before they finally gave a majority to Jefferson. (Alexander Hamilton had urged his followers to support Jefferson, whom he considered less dangerous and of higher character than Burr.)
Democratic-Republican lawmakers elected in 1800 also took control of 
both the House and the Senate in the elections. So the Federalists had been swept from power in both the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government.
A Peaceful Revolution  The passing of power in 1801 from one political 
party to another was accomplished without violence. This was a rare event for the times and a major indication that the U.S. constitutional system would endure the various strains that were placed upon it. The Federalists quietly accepted their defeat in the election of 1800 and peacefully relinquished control of the federal government to Jefferson’s party, the Democratic-Republicans. The change from Federalist to Democratic-Republican control is known as the Revolution of 1800.
Jefferson’s Presidency
During his first term, Jefferson attempted to win the allegiance and trust of Federalist opponents by maintaining the national bank and debt-repayment plan of Hamilton. In foreign policy, he carried on the neutrality policies of Washington and Adams. At the same time, Jefferson retained the loyalty of Democratic-Republican supporters by adhering to his party’s guiding principle of limited central government. He reduced the size of the military, eliminated a number of federal jobs, repealed the excise taxes—including those on whiskey—and lowered the national debt. However, hoping to avoid internal divisions that distracted Washington, he appointed only Democratic-Republicans to his cabinet. Compared to Adams’s troubled administration, Jefferson’s first four years in office were relatively free of discord.
The Louisiana Purchase
The single most important achievement of Jefferson’s first administration was the acquisition by purchase of vast western lands known as the Louisiana Territory. This region encompassed a large tract of western land through which the Mississippi and Missouri rivers flowed, land little explored by Europeans. At the mouth of the Mississippi lay the territory’s most valuable property in terms of commerce—the port of New Orleans. 
167  TOPIC 4.2    THE RISE OF POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE ERA OF JEFFERSONThe Louisiana Territory had once been claimed by France, which then 
lost its claim to Spain. But in 1800, the French military and political leader 
Napoleon Bonaparte secretly forced Spain to give the Louisiana Territory back to France. Napoleon hoped to restore the French empire in the Americas. By 1803, however, Napoleon had lost interest in this plan for two reasons: 
• He wanted to concentrate French resources on fighting Great Britain
• A rebellion led by Toussaint Louverture against French rule on the island of Santo Domingo had resulted in heavy French losses.
U.S. Interest in the Mississippi River During Jefferson’s presidency, 
the western frontier extended beyond Ohio and Kentucky into the Indiana Territory. Settlers in this region depended for their economic existence on transporting goods on rivers that flowed westward into the Mississippi and southward as far as New Orleans. They were greatly alarmed therefore when, in 1802, Spanish officials, who were still in charge of New Orleans, closed the port to Americans. They revoked the right of deposit  granted in the Pinckney 
Treaty of 1795, which had allowed American farmers tax-free use of the port. People on the frontier clamored for government action. In addition to being concerned about the economic impact of the closing of New Orleans, President Jefferson was troubled by its consequences on foreign policy. He feared that so long as a foreign power controlled the river at New Orleans, the United States risked entanglement in European affairs.
Negotiations  Jefferson sent ministers to France with instructions to offer 
up to $10 million for both New Orleans and a strip of land extending from that port eastward to Florida. If the American ministers failed in their negotiations with the French, they were instructed to begin discussions with Britain for a U.S.-Britain alliance. Napoleon’s ministers, seeking funds for a war against Britain, offered to sell not only New Orleans but also the entire Louisiana Territory for $15 million. The opportunity to purchase so much land surprised American ministers. They quickly went beyond their instructions and accepted the French offer.
Constitutional Predicament  Jefferson and most Americans strongly 
approved of the Louisiana Purchase. Nevertheless, a constitutional problem troubled the president. Jefferson was committed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution and rejected Hamilton’s argument that certain powers were implied. No clause in the Constitution explicitly stated that a president could purchase foreign land. 
In this case, Jefferson determined to set aside his idealism for the country’s 
good. He submitted the purchase agreement to the Senate, arguing that lands could be added to the United States as an application of the president’s power to make treaties. Federalist senators criticized the treaty. However, casting aside the Federalist attacks, the Democratic-Republican majority in the Senate quickly ratified the purchase.

Consequences The Louisiana Purchase more than doubled the size of the 
United States, removed a European presence from the nation’s borders, and 
extended the western frontier to lands beyond the Mississippi. Furthermore, the acquisition of millions of acres of land strengthened Jefferson’s hopes that his country’s future would be based on an agrarian society of independent farmers rather than Hamilton’s vision of an urban and industrial society. In political terms, the Louisiana Purchase increased Jefferson’s popularity and showed the Federalists to be a weak, sectionalist (New England-based) party that could do little more than complain about Democratic-Republican policies.
Lewis and Clark Expedition Even before Louisiana was purchased, 
Jefferson had persuaded Congress to fund a scientific exploration of the trans-Mississippi West to be led by Captain Meriwether Lewis and Lieutenant William Clark. The Louisiana Purchase greatly increased the importance of the expedition. Lewis and Clark set out from St. Louis in 1804, crossed the Rockies, reached the Oregon coast on the Pacific Ocean, and then turned back and completed the return journey in 1806. The benefits of the expedition were many: greater geographic and scientific knowledge of the region, stronger U.S. 
169  TOPIC 4.2    THE RISE OF POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE ERA OF JEFFERSONclaims to the Oregon Territory, better relations with American Indians, and 
more accurate maps and land routes for fur trappers and future settlers.
Judicial Impeachments
Jefferson tried various methods for overturning past Federalist measures and appointments. Soon after entering office, he suspended the Alien and Sedition Acts and released those jailed under them. The Federalist appointments to the courts previously made by Washington and Adams were not subject to recall or removal except by impeachment. Federalist judges therefore continued in office, much to the annoyance of the Democratic-Republican president, Jefferson. Hoping to remove partisan Federalist judges, Jefferson supported a campaign of impeachment. The judge of one federal district was found to be mentally unbalanced. The House voted for his impeachment, and the Senate then voted to remove him. The House also impeached a Supreme Court justice, Samuel Chase, but the Senate acquitted him after finding no evidence of “high crimes. ” 
Except for these two cases, the impeachment campaign was largely a 
failure, as almost all the Federalist judges remained in office. Even so, the threat of impeachment caused the judges to be more cautious and less partisan in their decisions.
Jefferson’s Reelection
In 1804, Jefferson won reelection by an overwhelming margin, receiving all but 14 of the 176 electoral votes. His second term was marked by growing difficulties. He faced a plot by his former vice president, Aaron Burr. The Democratic-Republican Party split, with a faction (the “Quids”) accusing him of abandoning the party’s principles. Foreign troubles came from the Napoleonic wars in Europe.
Aaron Burr
A Democratic-Republican caucus (a closed meeting) in 1804 decided not to nominate Aaron Burr for a second term as vice president. Burr then embarked on a series of ventures, one of which threatened to break up the Union and another of which resulted in the death of Alexander Hamilton.
Federalist Conspiracy Secretly forming a political pact with some radical 
New England Federalists, Burr planned to win the governorship of New Y ork in 1804, unite that state with the New England states, and then lead this group of states to secede from the nation. Most Federalists followed Alexander Hamilton in opposing Burr, who was defeated in the New Y ork election. The conspiracy then disintegrated.
Duel with Hamilton Angered by an insulting remark attributed to 
Hamilton, Burr challenged the Federalist leader to a duel and fatally shot him. Hamilton’s death in 1804 deprived the Federalists of their last great leader and earned Burr the enmity of many.
170 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONTrial for Treason By 1806, Burr’s intrigues had turned westward with a 
plan to take Mexico from Spain and possibly unite it with Louisiana under 
his rule. Learning of the conspiracy, Jefferson ordered Burr’s arrest and trial for treason. Presiding at the trial was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Marshall, a long-time adversary of Jefferson. A jury acquitted Burr, basing its decision on Marshall’s narrow definition of treason and the lack of witnesses to any “overt act” by Burr.
John Marshall’s Supreme Court and Federal Power
One Federalist official continued to have major influence throughout the years of Democratic-Republican ascendancy: John Marshall. His decisions consistently favored the central government and the rights of property against the advocates of states’ rights. 
John Marshall
Ironically, the Federalist judge who caused Jefferson the most grief was one of his own cousins from Virginia, John Marshall. Marshall had been appointed chief justice of the Supreme Court during the final months of the presidency of John Adams. He held his post for 34 years, during which time he exerted as strong an influence on the Supreme Court as Washington had exerted on the presidency. Even when justices appointed by Democratic-Republican presidents formed a majority on the Court, they often sided with Marshall because they were persuaded that the U.S. Constitution had created a federal government with strong and flexible powers.

In 1955, John Marshall became one 
of the first Supreme Court justices to appear on a postage stamp. It came at a time when the Supreme Court was asserting the power of the federal courts to protect individual liberties, particularly against racial discrimination and unconstitutional criminal proceedings (see Topics 8.6 and 8.11).
171  TOPIC 4.2    THE RISE OF POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE ERA OF JEFFERSONInfluential Cases
Several of Marshall’s decisions became landmarks that defined the relationship 
between the central government and the states. First and foremost of these was Marbury v. Madison  (1803), which established the principle of judicial review. 
Marbury v. Madison (1803) The first major case decided by Marshall 
put him in direct conflict with President Jefferson. Just before leaving office, President John Adams made several “midnight appointments” of Federalists as judges. However, their commissions were not formally delivered before Jefferson took office. Jefferson wanted to block these appointments, so he ordered the new secretary of state, James Madison, not to deliver the commissions. One of the Adams appointees, William Marbury, sued for his commission. The case of Marbury v. Madison  went to the Supreme Court in 1803. Marshall ruled that 
Marbury had a right to his commission according to the Judiciary Act passed by Congress in 1789. However, Marshall said the Judiciary Act of 1789 had given to the Court greater power than the Constitution allowed. Therefore, the law was unconstitutional and Marbury would not receive his commission.
In effect, Marshall sacrificed what would have been a small Federalist gain 
(the appointment of Marbury) for a much larger, long-term judicial victory. By ruling a law of Congress to be unconstitutional, Marshall established the doctrine of judicial review . From this point on, the Supreme Court would 
exercise the power to decide whether an act of Congress or of the president was allowed by the Constitution. The Supreme Court could now overrule actions of the other two branches of the federal government.
Fletcher v. Peck (1810) In a case involving land fraud in Georgia, Marshall 
concluded that a state could not pass legislation invalidating a contract. This was the first time that the Supreme Court declared a state law to be unconstitutional and invalid. (In Marbury v. Madison, the Court ruled a federal law unconstitutional.)
Martin v. Hunter’s Lease (1816) The Supreme Court established that it 
had jurisdiction over state courts in cases involving constitutional rights.
Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1819) This case involved a law of New 
Hampshire that changed Dartmouth College from a privately chartered college into a public institution. The Marshall Court struck down the state law as unconstitutional, arguing that a contract for a private corporation could not be altered by the state.
McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) Maryland attempted to tax the Second 
Bank of the United States, which was located in Maryland. Marshall ruled that a state could not tax a federal institution because “the power to tax is the power to destroy” and federal laws are supreme over state laws. In addition, Marshall settled the long-running debate over constitutionality of the national bank. Using a loose interpretation of the Constitution, Marshall ruled that, even though no clause in the Constitution specifically mentions a national bank, the Constitution gave the federal government the implied power to create one.
172 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONCohens v. Virginia  (1821) A pair of brothers named Cohen were 
convicted in Virginia of illegally selling tickets for a lottery authorized by 
Congress for Washington, D.C. While Marshall and the Court upheld the conviction, they established the principle that the Supreme Court could review a state court’s decision involving any of the powers of the federal government.
Gibbons v. Ogden (1821) Could the state of New Y ork grant a monopoly 
to a steamboat company if that action conflicted with a charter authorized by Congress? In ruling that the New Y ork monopoly was unconstitutional, Marshall established the federal government’s broad control of interstate commerce.
Madison’s Presidency
Jefferson believed strongly in the precedent set by Washington of voluntarily retiring from the presidency after a second term. For his party’s nomination for president, he supported his close friend, Secretary of State James Madison.
The Election of 1808
Ever since leading the effort to write and ratify the Constitution, Madison was widely viewed as a brilliant thinker. He had worked tirelessly with Jefferson in developing the Democratic-Republican Party. On the other hand, he was a weak public speaker, possessed a stubborn temperament, and lacked Jefferson’s political skills. With Jefferson’s backing, Madison was nominated for president by a caucus of congressional Democratic-Republicans. Other factions of the Democratic-Republican Party nominated two other candidates. Even so, Madison was able to win a majority of electoral votes and to defeat both his Democratic-Republican opponents and the Federalist candidate, Charles Pinckney.

right or wrong but rather how he managed to implement decisions that defied in so many ways his long-standing commitment to limitations on executive power and the near-sacred character of republican principles. . . . Jefferson was not simply seized by power-hungry impulses once he assumed the presidency, since in a broad range of other policy areas he exhibited considerable discipline over the executive branch and habitual deference to the Congress; . . . he did not suddenly discover a pragmatic streak in his political philosophy, . . . he clung tenaciously to Jeffersonian principles despite massive evidence that they were at odds with reality. . . .

For Jefferson more than any other major figure in the revolutionary generation, the West was America’s future. ”
Joseph J. Ellis, historian, American Sphinx, 1997 
“The story of the Louisiana Purchase is one of strength, of Jefferson’s adaptability and, most important, his determination to secure the territory from France, . . . A slower or less courageous politician might have bungled the acquisition; an overly idealistic one might have lost it by insisting on strict constitutional scruples. . . . The philosophical Jefferson had believed an amendment necessary. The political Jefferson, however, was not going to allow theory to get in the way of reality. . . . [He] expanded the powers of the executive in ways that would have likely driven Jefferson to distraction had another man been president. Much of his political life, though, had been devoted to the study and the wise exercise of power. He did what had to be done to preserve the possibility of republicanism and progress. Things were neat only in theory. And despite his love of ideas and image of himself, Thomas Jefferson was as much a man of action as he was of t h e o r y.”

Politics and Regional Interests
But this momentous question [the Missouri Compromise],  
like a firebell in the night awakened and filled me with terror.  
I considered it the knell of the Union.
Thomas Jefferson, April 1820
Learning Objective : Explain how different regional interests affected 
debates about the role of the federal government in the early republic.
The election of James Monroe as president in 1816 (less than two years after 
the last battle of the War of 1812) inaugurated what one newspaper editorial 
characterized as an “Era of Good Feelings. ” The term gained wide currency and was later adopted by historians to describe Monroe’s two terms in office. A closer examination of this period shows a more complicated picture.
The Era of Good Feelings
The period’s nickname suggests the Monroe years were marked by a spirit of nationalism, optimism, and goodwill. In some ways, they were. One party, the Federalists, faded into oblivion, and Monroe’s party, the Democratic-Republicans, adopted some of their policies and dominated politics.
This perception of unity and harmony, however, can be misleading and 
oversimplified. Throughout the era, people had heated debates over tariffs, the national bank, internal improvements, and public land sales. Sectionalist tensions over slavery were increasing. Moreover, even a sense of party unity was illusory since antagonistic factions among Democratic-Republicans would soon split it in two. The actual period of “good feelings” may have lasted only from the election of 1816 to the Panic of 1819.
James Monroe
As a young man, James Monroe had fought in the Revolutionary War and suffered through the Valley Forge winter. He had become prominent in Virginia politics and had served as Jefferson’s minister to Great Britain and as Madison’s secretary of state. He continued the Virginia dynasty: of the first five presidents, four were from Virginia. The other, John Adams, was from Massachusetts.
In the election of 1816, Monroe defeated the Federalist, Rufus King, 
overwhelmingly—183 electoral votes to 34. By 1820, the Federalist Party had practically vanished, and Monroe received every electoral vote except one. With 
176 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONno organized political opposition, Monroe represented the growing nationalism 
of the American people. Under Monroe, the country acquired Florida, agreed on the Missouri Compromise, and adopted the Monroe Doctrine.
Economic Nationalism
One outgrowth of the War of 1812 was a political movement to support the growth of the nation’s economy. Subsidizing internal improvements (the building of roads and canals) was one aspect of the movement. Protecting budding U.S. industries from European competition was a second aspect. Often opinions on these economic issues were based on what appeared best for one’s section or region.
Tariff of 1816 Before the War of 1812, Congress had levied low tariffs on 
imports as a method for raising government revenue. Then, during the war, manufacturers erected many factories to supply goods that previously had been imported from Britain. Now in peacetime, these American manufacturers feared that British goods would be dumped on American markets and take away much of their business. Congress raised tariffs for the express purpose of protecting U.S. manufacturers from competition rather than to simply raise revenue. This was the first protective tariff in U.S. history—the first of many to come.
New England, which had little manufacturing at the time, was the only 
section to oppose the higher tariffs. Even the South and West, which had opposed tariffs in the past and would oppose them in the future, generally supported the 1816 tariff, believing that it was needed for national prosperity.
Henry Clay’s American System Henry Clay of Kentucky, a leader in the 
House of Representatives, proposed a comprehensive method for advancing the nation’s economic growth. His plan, which he called the American System, consisted of three parts: (1) protective tariffs, (2) a national bank, and (3) internal improvements. Clay argued that protective tariffs would promote American manufacturing and also raise revenue with which to build a national transportation system of federally constructed roads and canals. A national bank would keep the system running smoothly by providing a national currency. The tariffs would chiefly benefit the East, internal improvements would promote growth in the West and the South, and the bank would aid the economies of all sections.
Two parts of Clay’s system were already in place in 1816, the last year of 
James Madison’s presidency. Congress in that year adopted a protective tariff  and also chartered the Second Bank of the United States. (The charter of the First Bank—Hamilton’s brainchild—had been allowed to expire in 1811.)
On the matter of internal improvements, however, both Madison and 
Monroe objected that the Constitution did not explicitly provide for the spending of federal money on roads and canals. Throughout his presidency, Monroe consistently vetoed acts of Congress providing funds for road-building and canal-building projects. Thus, the individual states were left to make internal improvements on their own.

The Panic of 1819
The first major financial panic since the Constitution had been ratified shook 
the nation in 1819. The economic disaster occurred after the Second Bank of the United States tightened credit in an effort to control inflation. Many state banks closed, and unemployment, bankruptcies, and imprisonment for debt increased sharply. The depression hit the West hardest, where many people were in debt because they had speculated on land during the euphoria after the War of 1812. In 1819, the Bank of the United States foreclosed on large amounts of western farmland. As a result of the bank panic and depression, nationalistic beliefs were shaken. In the West, the economic crisis changed many voters’ political outlook. Westerners began calling for land reform and expressing strong opposition to both the national bank and debtors’ prisons.
Political Changes
The Federalist Party declined rapidly because it failed to adapt as the nation grew. After opposing the War of 1812 (see Topic 4.4) and leading a secessionist convention at Hartford, the party seemed out of step with the nationalistic temper of the times. After its crushing defeat in the election of 1816, it ceased to be a national party and failed to nominate a presidential candidate in 1820.
Changes in the Democratic-Republican Party Meanwhile, the 
Democratic-Republican Party, the only remaining national party, faced serious internal strains as it adjusted to changing times. Members such as John Randolph clung to the old party ideals of limited government and a strict interpretation of the Constitution. Most members, however, adopted what had once been Federalist ideas, such as maintaining a large army and navy and supporting a national bank. Some members reversed their views from one decade to the next. For example, Daniel Webster of Massachusetts strongly opposed both the tariffs of 1816 and 1824, but then supported even higher tariff rates in 1828. John C. Calhoun of South Carolina was another Democratic-Republican leader who reversed positions. An outspoken war hawk and nationalist in 1812, Calhoun championed states’ rights after 1828.
178 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONPolitical factions and sectional differences became more intense during 
Monroe’s second term. When Monroe, honoring the two-term tradition, 
declined to be a candidate again, four other Democratic-Republicans sought election as president in 1824. How this election split the party and led to the emergence of two rival parties is explained in Topic 4.8.
Western Settlement and the Missouri Compromise
In the ten years after the start of the War of 1812, the population of settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains had doubled. Most went to the region between the Appalachians and the Mississippi River. Some, though, were beginning to settle in the Louisiana Territory purchased in 1803. Much of the nationalistic and economic interest in the country was centered on the West, which presented both opportunities and new questions.
Reasons for Westward Movement
Several factors combined to stimulate rapid growth along the western frontier during the presidencies of Madison and Monroe.
Acquisition of Lands Military victories under Generals William Henry 
Harrison in the Indiana Territory and Andrew Jackson in Florida and the South over American Indians opened vast new territories for White settlers.
Economic Pressures The economic difficulties in the Northeast from 
the embargo and the war caused people from this region to seek a new future across the Appalachians. In the South, tobacco planters needed new land to replace the soil exhausted by years of poor farming methods. They found good land for planting cotton in Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas.
Improved Transportation  Pioneers had an easier time reaching the 
frontier as a result of the building of roads and canals, steamboats, and railroads.
Immigrants More Europeans were being attracted to America by 
speculators offering cheap land in the Great Lakes region and in the valleys of the Ohio, Cumberland, and Mississippi rivers.
New Questions and Issues
Despite their rapid growth, the new states of the West were small relative to those of the other two sections. To enhance their limited political influence in Congress, western representatives bargained with politicians from other sections. The primary concerns of the western states were as follows: (1) “cheap money” (easy credit) from state banks rather than from the Bank of the United States, (2) low prices for land sold by the federal government, and (3) improved transportation.
However, on the critical issue of slavery, westerners disagreed over 
permitting it. Those settling territory to the south wanted slavery for economic reasons (labor for the cotton fields), while those settling to the north had no use for slavery. In 1819, when the Missouri Territory applied to Congress for statehood, the slavery issue became a subject of angry debate.
179  TOPIC 4.3    P OLITICS AND REGIONAL INTERESTSThe Missouri Compromise
Ever since 1791–1792, when Vermont entered the Union as a free state and 
Kentucky entered as a slave state, politicians in Congress had attempted to preserve a sectional balance between the North and the South. Keeping a balance in the House of Representatives was difficult because the population in the North was growing more rapidly than in the South. By 1818, the northern states held a majority of 105 to 81 in the House. However, in the Senate, the votes remained divided evenly: 11 slave states and 11 free states. As long as this balance was preserved, southern senators could block legislation that they believed threatened the interests of their section.
Missouri’s bid for statehood alarmed the North because slavery was well 
established there. If Missouri came in as a slave state, it would tip the political balance in the South’s favor. Furthermore, Missouri was the first part of the Louisiana Purchase to apply for statehood. Southerners and northerners alike worried about the future status of other new territories applying for statehood from the rest of the vast Louisiana Purchase.
Tallmadge Amendment Representative James Tallmadge from New Y ork 
ignited the debate about the Missouri question by proposing an amendment to the bill for Missouri’s admission. The amendment called for (1) prohibiting the further introduction of slaves into Missouri and (2) requiring the children of Missouri slaves to be emancipated at the age of 25. If adopted, the Tallmadge Amendment would have led to the gradual elimination of slavery in Missouri. The amendment was defeated in the Senate as enraged southerners saw it as the first step in a northern effort to abolish slavery in all states.

I can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than I would, to relieve us Clay’s Proposals After months of heated debate in Congress and

2. admit Maine as a free state
3. prohibit slavery in the rest of the Louisiana Territory north of latitude 36° 30΄
Both houses passed the bills, and President Monroe added his signature in 
March 1820 to what became known as the Missouri Compromise.
Aftermath Sectional feelings on the slavery issue subsided after 1820. The 
Missouri Compromise preserved sectional balance for more than 30 years and provided time for the nation to mature. Nevertheless, if an era of good feelings existed, it was badly damaged by the storm of sectional controversy over Missouri. After this political crisis, Americans were torn between feelings of nationalism (loyalty to the Union) on the one hand and feelings of sectionalism (loyalty to one’s own region) on the other.

Topic 4.4 
America on the World Stage
The war has renewed and reinstated the national feelings and character 
which the Revolution had given, and which were daily lessened. . . .  
I hope the permanency of the Union is thereby better secured.
Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin, 1816
Learning Objective : Explain how and why American foreign policy 
developed over time.
From their founding as colonies to their fight for independence, the United 
States was strongly influenced by the actions of other nations. Even President 
Washington had to deal with foreign “entanglements” (see Topic 3.10) likely leading to his warning against “permanent alliances” in foreign affairs. 
Jefferson’s Foreign Policy
President Jefferson brought considerable experience in dealing with foreign affairs. He had served as a foreign minister in Europe and secretary of state prior to his election in 1800. This experience led to success with the Louisiana Purchase but would be challenged by numerous other foreign affairs questions.
Difficulties Abroad
As a matter of policy and principle, Jefferson tried to avoid war. Rejecting permanent alliances, he sought to maintain U.S. neutrality despite increasing provocations from both France and Britain during the Napoleonic wars.
Barbary Pirates The first major challenge to Jefferson’s foreign policy 
came not from a major European power but from the piracy practiced by the Barbary states on the North African coast. To protect U.S. merchant ships from being seized by Barbary pirates, Presidents Washington and Adams had reluctantly agreed to pay tribute to the Barbary governments. The ruler of Tripoli demanded a higher sum in tribute from Jefferson. Refusing to pay, Jefferson sent a small fleet of the U.S. Navy to the Mediterranean. Sporadic fighting with Tripoli lasted for four years (1801–1805). Although the American navy did not achieve a decisive victory, it did gain some respect and offered a measure of protection to U.S. vessels trading in Mediterranean waters.
Challenges to U.S. Neutrality Meanwhile, the Napoleonic wars continued 
to dominate the politics of Europe—and to shape the commercial economy of 
183  TOPIC 4.4    AMERICA ON THE WORLD STAGEthe United States. The two principal belligerents, France and Britain, attempted 
naval blockades of enemy ports. They regularly seized the ships of neutral nations and confiscated their cargoes. The chief offender from the U.S. point of view was Britain, since its navy dominated the Atlantic. Most infuriating was the British practice of capturing U.S. sailors who it claimed were British citizens and impressing (forcing) them to serve in the British navy.
Chesapeake-Leopard Affair  One incident at sea especially aroused 
American anger and almost led to war. In 1807, only a few miles off the coast of Virginia, the British warship Leopard  fired on the U.S. warship Chesapeake . 
Three Americans were killed, and four others were taken captive and impressed into the British navy. Anti-British feeling ran high, and many Americans demanded war. Jefferson, however, resorted to diplomacy and economic pressure as his response to the crisis.
Embargo Act (1807) As an alternative to war, Jefferson persuaded the 
Democratic-Republican majority in Congress to pass the Embargo Act in 1807. This measure prohibited American merchant ships from sailing to any foreign port. Since the United States was Britain’s largest trading partner, Jefferson hoped that the British would stop violating the rights of neutral nations rather than lose U.S. trade. The embargo, however, backfired and brought greater economic hardship to the United States than to Britain. The British were determined to control the seas at all costs, and they had little difficulty substituting supplies from South America for U.S. goods. 
The embargo’s effect on the U.S. economy, however, was devastating, 
especially for the merchant marine and shipbuilders of New England. So bad was the depression that a movement developed in the New England states to secede from the Union.
Recognizing that the Embargo Act had failed, Jefferson called for its repeal 
in 1809 during the final days of his presidency. Even after repeal, however, U.S. ships could trade legally with all nations except Britain and France.
President Madison’s Foreign Policy
Madison’s presidency was dominated by the same European problems that had plagued Jefferson’s second term. 
Commercial Warfare
Like Jefferson, Madison attempted a combination of diplomacy and economic pressure to deal with the Napoleonic wars. Unlike Jefferson, he finally consented to take the United States to war.
Nonintercourse Act of 1809 After the repeal of Jefferson’s disastrous 
embargo act, Madison hoped to end economic hardship while maintaining his country’s rights as a neutral nation. The Nonintercourse Act of 1809 provided that Americans could now trade with all nations except Britain and France.

Macon’s Bill No. 2 (1810) Economic hardships continued into 1810. 
Nathaniel Macon, a member of Congress, introduced a bill that restored U.S. 
trade with Britain and France. Macon’s Bill No. 2 provided, however, that if either Britain or France formally agreed to respect U.S. neutral rights at sea, then the United States would prohibit trade with that nation’s foe.
Napoleon’s Deception  Upon hearing of Congress’s action, Napoleon 
announced his intention of revoking the decrees that had violated U.S. neutral rights. Taking Napoleon at his word, Madison carried out the terms of Macon’s Bill No. 2 by embargoing U.S. trade with Britain in 1811. However, he soon realized that Napoleon had no intention of fulfilling his promise. The French continued to seize American merchant ships.
The War of 1812
Neither Britain nor the United States wanted their dispute to end in war. And yet war between them did break out in 1812.
Causes of the War
From the U.S. point of view, the pressures leading to war came from two directions: the continued violation of U.S. neutral rights at sea and troubles with the British on the western frontier.
Free Seas and Trade As a trading nation, the United States depended 
upon the free flow of shipping across the Atlantic. Y et the chief belligerents in Europe, Britain, and France had no interest in respecting neutral rights so long as they were locked in a life-and-death struggle with one another. They well remembered that Britain had seemed a cruel enemy during the American Revolution and the French had supported the colonists. In addition, Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans applauded the French for having overthrown their monarchy in their own revolution. Moreover, even though both the French and the British violated U.S. neutral rights, the British violations were worse because of the British navy’s practice of impressing American sailors.
185  TOPIC 4.4    AMERICA ON THE WORLD STAGEFrontier Pressures Added to long-standing grievances over British actions 
at sea were the ambitions of western Americans for more land. Americans 
on the frontier longed for the lands of British Canada and Spanish Florida. Standing in the way were the British and their Indian and Spanish allies.
Conflict with the American Indians was a perennial problem for the restless 
westerners. For decades, settlers had been gradually pushing the American Indians farther and farther westward. In an effort to defend their lands from further encroachment, Shawnee brothers—a warrior named Tecumseh and a religious leader known as the Prophet—attempted to unite all of the tribes east of the Mississippi River. White settlers became suspicious of Tecumseh and persuaded the governor of the Indiana Territory, General William Henry Harrison, to take aggressive action. In the Battle of Tippecanoe, in 1811, Harrison destroyed the Shawnee headquarters, which ended Tecumseh’s efforts to form an Indian confederacy. The British had provided only a little aid to Tecumseh. Nevertheless, Americans on the frontier blamed the British for instigating the rebellion.
War Hawks A congressional election in 1810 had brought a group of 
new, young Democratic-Republicans to Congress, many of them from frontier states (Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio). Known as war hawks because of their eagerness for war with Britain, they quickly gained significant influence in the House of Representatives. Led by Henry Clay of Kentucky and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, the war hawk members of Congress argued that war with Britain would be the only way to defend American honor, gain Canada, and destroy American Indian resistance on the frontier.
Declaration of War  British delays in meeting U.S. demands over neutral 
rights combined with political pressures from the war hawks finally persuaded Madison to seek a declaration of war against Britain. Ironically, the British government had by this time (June 1812) agreed to suspend its naval blockade. News of its decision reached the White House after Congress had declared war.
A Divided Nation
Neither Congress nor the American people were united in support of the war. In Congress, Pennsylvania and Vermont joined the southern and western states to provide a slight majority for the war declaration. Voting against the war were most representatives from New Y ork, New Jersey, and New England.
Election of 1812 A similar division of opinion was seen in the presidential 
election of 1812, in which Democratic-Republican strength in the South and West overcame Federalist and antiwar Democratic-Republican opposition to war in the North. Madison won reelection, defeating De Witt Clinton of New Y ork, the candidate of the Federalists and antiwar Democratic-Republicans.
186 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONOpposition to the War Americans who opposed the war viewed it as “Mr. 
Madison’s War” and the work of the war hawks in Congress. Most outspoken in 
their criticism of the war were New England merchants, Federalist politicians, and “ Quids, ” or “Old” Democratic-Republicans. New England merchants were 
opposed because, after the repeal of the Embargo Act, they were making sizable profits from the European war and viewed impressment as merely a minor inconvenience. Both commercial interests and religious ties to Protestantism made them more sympathetic to the Protestant British than to the Catholic French. Federalist politicians viewed the war as a Democratic-Republican scheme to conquer Canada and Florida, with the ultimate aim of increasing Democratic-Republican voting strength. For their part, the “Quids” criticized the war because it violated the classic Democratic-Republican commitment to limited federal power and to the maintenance of peace.
Military Defeats and Naval Victories
Facing Britain’s overwhelming naval power, Madison’s military strategists based their hope for victory on (1) Napoleon’s continued success in Europe and (2) a U.S. land campaign against Canada.
Invasion of Canada A poorly equipped American army initiated military 
action in 1812 by launching a three-part invasion of Canada, one force starting out from Detroit, another from Niagara, and a third from Lake Champlain. These and later forays into Canada were easily repulsed by the British defenders. An American raid and burning of government buildings in Y ork (Toronto) in 1813 only served to encourage retaliation by the British.VOTE ON DECLARING WAR IN 1812
Yes
NoNot voting or unsettled
187  TOPIC 4.4    AMERICA ON THE WORLD STAGENaval Battles The U.S. navy achieved some notable victories due largely 
to superior shipbuilding and the valorous deeds of American sailors, including 
many free African Americans. In late 1812, the U.S. warship Constitution  
(nicknamed “Old Ironsides”) raised American morale by defeating and sinking a British ship off the coast of Nova Scotia. American privateers, motivated by both patriotism and profit, captured numerous British merchant ships. Offsetting these gains was the success of the British navy in establishing a blockade of the U.S. coast, which crippled trading and fishing.
Probably the most important naval battle of the war was in 1813 on Lake 
Erie with American Captain Oliver Hazard Perry, declaring victory with, “We have met the enemy and they are ours. ” This led the way for General William Henry Harrison’s victory at the Battle of the Thames (near Detroit), in which Tecumseh was killed. The next year, 1814, ships commanded by Thomas Macdonough defeated a British fleet on Lake Champlain. As a result, the British had to retreat and abandon their plan to invade New Y ork and New England.
Chesapeake Campaign By the spring of 1814, the defeat of Napoleon 
in Europe enabled the British to increase their forces in North America. In the summer of that year, a British army marched through the nation’s capital, Washington, D.C., and set fire to the White House, the Capitol, and other government buildings. The British also attempted to take Baltimore, but Fort McHenry held out after a night’s bombardment—an event immortalized by Francis Scott Key in the words of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Southern Campaign Meanwhile, U.S. troops in the South were ably 
commanded by General Andrew Jackson. In March 1814, at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in present-day Alabama, Jackson ended the power of an important British ally, the Creek nation. The victory eliminated the Indians and opened new lands to White settlers. A British effort to control the Mississippi River was halted at New Orleans by Jackson leading a force of frontier soldiers, free African Americans, and Creoles. The victory was impressive—but also meaningless. The Battle of New Orleans was fought on January 8, 1815, two 
weeks after a treaty ending the war had been signed in Ghent, Belgium, but before news of the treaty had reached the military forces.
The Treaty of Ghent
By 1814, the British were weary of war. Having fought Napoleon for more than a decade, they now faced the prospect of maintaining the peace in Europe. At the same time, Madison’s government recognized that the Americans would be unable to win a decisive victory. American peace commissioners traveled to Ghent, Belgium, to discuss terms of peace with British diplomats. On Christmas Eve 1814, an agreement was reached. The terms halted fighting, returned all conquered territory to the prewar claimant, and recognized the prewar boundary between Canada and the United States.
188 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Treaty of Ghent, promptly ratified by the Senate in 1815, said nothing 
at all about the grievances that led to war. Britain made no concessions 
concerning impressment, blockades, or other maritime differences. Thus, the war ended in stalemate with no gain for either side.
The Hartford Convention
Just before the war ended, the New England states threatened to secede from the Union. Bitterly opposed to both the war and the Democratic-Republican government in Washington, radical Federalists in New England urged that the Constitution be amended and that, as a last resort, secession be voted upon. To consider these matters, a special convention was held at Hartford, Connecticut, in December 1814. Delegates from the New England states rejected the radical calls for secession. But to limit the growing power of the Democratic-Republicans in the South and West, they adopted a number of proposals. One of them called for a two-thirds vote of both houses for any future declaration of war.
Shortly after the convention dissolved, news came of both Jackson’s victory 
at New Orleans and the Treaty of Ghent. These events ended criticism of the war and further weakened the Federalists by stamping them as unpatriotic.
The War’s Legacy
From Madison’s point of view, the war achieved none of its original aims. Nevertheless, it had a number of important consequences for the future development of the American republic, including the following:
1. Having survived two wars with Britain, the United States gained the respect of other nations.
2. The United States accepted Canada as a part of the British Empire.
3. Denounced for its talk of secession, the Federalist Party came to an end as a national force and declined even in New England.
4. Talk of nullification and secession in New England set a precedent that would later be used by the South.
5. Abandoned by the British, American Indians were forced to surrender land to White settlement.
6. With the British naval blockade limiting European goods, U.S. factories were built and Americans moved toward industrial self-sufficiency.
7. War heroes such as Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison would soon be in the forefront of a new generation of political leaders.
8. The feeling of nationalism grew stronger as did a belief that the future for the United States lay in the West and away from Europe.
189  TOPIC 4.4    AMERICA ON THE WORLD STAGEMonroe and Foreign Affairs
Following the War of 1812, the United States adopted a more aggressive, 
nationalistic approach in its relations with other nations. During Madison’s presidency, when problems with the Barbary pirates again developed, a fleet under Stephen Decatur was sent in 1815 to force the rulers of North Africa to 
allow American shipping the free use of the Mediterranean. President Monroe and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams continued to follow a nationalistic policy that actively advanced American interests while maintaining peace.
Canada
Although the Treaty of Ghent of 1814 had ended the war between Britain and the United States, it left unresolved most of their diplomatic differences, including many involving Canada.
Rush-Bagot Agreement (1817) During Monroe’s first year as president, 
British and American negotiators agreed to a major disarmament pact. The Rush-Bagot Agreement strictly limited naval armament on the Great Lakes. In time, the agreement was extended to place limits on border fortifications as well. Ultimately, the border between the United States and Canada was to become the longest unfortified border in the world.
Treaty of 1818 Improved relations between the United States and Britain 
continued in a treaty that provided for (1) shared fishing rights off the coast of Newfoundland; (2) joint occupation of the Oregon Territory for ten years; and (3) the setting of the northern limits of the Louisiana Territory at the 49th parallel, thus establishing the western U.S.-Canada boundary line.
Florida
During the War of 1812, U.S. troops had occupied western Florida, a strip of land on the Gulf of Mexico extending all the way to the Mississippi Delta. Previously, this land had been held by Spain, Britain’s ally. After the war, Spain had difficulty governing the rest of Florida (the peninsula itself) because its troops had been removed from Florida to battle revolts in the South American colonies. The chaotic conditions permitted groups of Seminoles, runaway slaves, and White outlaws to conduct raids into U.S. territory and retreat to safety across the Florida border. These disorders gave Monroe and General Andrew Jackson an opportunity to take military action in Spanish Florida, a territory long coveted by American expansionists.
Jackson’s Military Campaign In late 1817, the president commissioned 
General Jackson to stop the raiders and, if necessary, pursue them across the border into Spanish west Florida. Jackson carried out his orders with a vengeance and probably went beyond his instructions. In 1818, he led a force of militia into Florida, destroyed Seminole villages, and hanged two Seminole chiefs. Capturing Pensacola, Jackson drove out the Spanish governor and hanged two British traders accused of aiding the Seminoles.
190 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONMany members of Congress feared that Jackson’s overzealousness would 
precipitate a war with both Spain and Britain. However, Secretary of State John 
Quincy Adams persuaded Monroe to support Jackson, and the British decided not to intervene.
Florida Purchase Treaty (1819) Spain, worried that the United States 
would seize Florida and preoccupied with troubles in Latin America, decided to get the best possible terms for Florida. By treaty in 1819, Spain turned over all of its possessions in Florida and its own claims in the Oregon Territory to the United States. In exchange, the United States agreed to assume $5 million in claims against Spain and give up any U.S. territorial claims to the Spanish province of Texas. The agreement is also called the Adams-Onís Treaty.
The Monroe Doctrine
Although focused on its own growth, the United States did not ignore the ambitions of Europe in the Western Hemisphere. The restoration of a number of monarchies in Europe after the fall of Napoleon in 1815 produced a backlash against republican movements. Restored monarchies in France, Austria, and Prussia, together with Russia, worked together to suppress liberal elements in Italy and Spain. They also considered helping Spain to return to power in South America, where a number of republics had recently declared their independence. 
In addition, Russia’s presence in Alaska worried both Britain and the United 
States. Using their trading posts in Alaska as a base, Russian seal hunters had spread southward and established a trading post at San Francisco Bay. British and U.S. leaders decided they had a common interest in protecting North and South America from possible aggression by a European power.
British Initiative  British naval power deterred the Spanish from 
attempting a comeback in Latin America. But to maintain British trade with the Latin American republics required diplomacy. British Foreign Secretary George Canning proposed to Richard Rush, the U.S. minister in London, a joint Anglo-American warning to the European powers not to intervene in South America.
American Response Monroe and most of his advisers thought Canning’s 
idea of a joint declaration made sense. However, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams disagreed. He believed that joint action with Britain would restrict U.S. opportunities for further expansion in the hemisphere. Adams reasoned as follows: (1) If the United States acted alone, Britain could be counted upon to stand behind the U.S. policy; (2) No European power would risk going to war in South America, and if it did, the British navy would surely defeat the aggressor. President Monroe decided to act as Adams advised—to issue a statement to the world that did not have Britain as a coauthor.
The Doctrine On December 2, 1823, President Monroe inserted into his 
annual message to Congress a declaration of U.S. policy toward Europe and Latin America. The Monroe Doctrine, as it came to be called, asserted “as a 
191  TOPIC 4.4    AMERICA ON THE WORLD STAGEprinciple in which the rights and interests of the United States are involved, that 
the American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European power s .”
Monroe declared further that the United States opposed attempts by 
a European power to interfere in the affairs of any republic in the Western Hemisphere.
Impact  Monroe’s bold words of nationalistic purpose were applauded 
by the American public but were soon forgotten, as most citizens were more concerned with domestic issues. In Britain, Canning was annoyed by the doctrine because he recognized that it applied not just to the other European powers but to his country as well. The British, too, were warned not to intervene and not to seek new territory in the Western Hemisphere. The European monarchs reacted angrily to Monroe’s message. Still, they recognized that their purposes were thwarted not by his words but by the might of the British navy.
The Monroe Doctrine had less significance at the time than in later decades, 
when it would be hailed by politicians and citizens alike as the cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy toward Latin America. In the 1840s, President James Polk was the first of many presidents to justify his foreign policy by referring to Monroe’s warning words.

Market Revolution 
I never thought my cotton gin would change history.
Eli Whitney (1765–1825)
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the innovations  
in technology, agriculture, and commerce over time.
In the early 1800s, the Jeffersonian dream of a nation of independent farmers 
remained strong in rural areas. Innovations and new technology in the 19th 
century would steadily decrease the demand for people working in agriculture and increase the demand for people working in commerce. Ironically, Jefferson, a father of a political revolution, would see his ideal nation of small farmers overwhelmed by an economic revolution based on new knowledge.
As the 19th century progressed, an increasing percentage of the American 
people were swept up in the dynamic economic changes of the Industrial Revolution. Political conflicts over tariffs, internal improvements, and the Bank of the United States (see Topics 4.3 and 4.8) reflected the importance to people’s lives of a national economy that was rapidly growing.
Development of the Northwest
The Old Northwest consisted of six states that joined the Union before 1860: 
Ohio (1803), Indiana (1816), Illinois (1818), Michigan (1837), Wisconsin (1848), and Minnesota (1858). These states came from territories formed out of land ceded to the national government in the 1780s by one of the original 13 states. The procedure for turning these territories into states was part of the Northwest Ordinance passed by Congress in 1787 (see Topics 3.7 and 3.12).
In the early years of the 19th century, much of the Old Northwest was 
unsettled frontier and the part of it that was settled relied upon the Mississippi to transport grain to southern markets and the port of New Orleans. By mid-century, however, this region became closely tied to the other northern states by two factors: (1) military campaigns by federal troops that drove American Indians from the land and (2) the building of canals and railroads that established common markets between the Great Lakes and the East Coast. 
Agriculture In the Old Northwest, corn and wheat were very profitable 
and fed people in growing urban areas. Using the newly invented steel plow (by John Deere) and mechanical reaper (by Cyrus McCormick), a farm family 
was more efficient and could plant more acres, needing to supplement its labor 
194 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONonly with a few hired workers at harvest time. Part of the crop was used to feed 
cattle and hogs and also to supply distillers and brewers with grain for making whiskey and beer. Farmers shipped grain quickly to cities to avoid spoilage.
Transportation
Vital to the development of both a national and an industrial economy was an efficient network of interconnecting roads and canals for moving people, raw materials, and manufactured goods. 
Roads Pennsylvania’s Lancaster Turnpike, built in the 1790s, connected 
Philadelphia with the rich farmlands around Lancaster. Its success stimulated the construction of other privately built and relatively short toll roads that, by the mid-1820s, connected most of the country’s major cities.
Despite the need for interstate roads, states’ rights advocates blocked the 
spending of federal funds on internal improvements. Construction of highways that crossed state lines was therefore unusual. One notable exception was the National, or Cumberland Road, a paved highway and major route to the west extending more than a thousand miles from Maryland to Illinois. It was begun in 1811 and completed in the 1850s, using both federal and state money, with the different states receiving ownership of segments of the highway.
Canals The completion of the Erie Canal in New Y ork State in 1825 was 
a major event in linking the economies of western farms and eastern cities. The success of this canal in stimulating economic growth touched off a frenzy of canal building in other states. In little more than a decade, canals joined together all of the major lakes and rivers east of the Mississippi. Improved transportation meant lower food prices in the East, more immigrants settling in the West, and stronger economic ties between the two sections.
Steam Engines and Steamboats The development of steam-powered 
engines in the 18th century revolutionized the location of factories. When factories ran on the power of moving water, they had to be located on a stream. However, a steam engine could be set up anywhere—in mills, mines, and factories. They first became widely used in Great Britain, but they spread to the United States in the 19th century.
The age of mechanized, steam-powered travel began in 1807 with the 
successful voyage up the Hudson River of the Clermont,  a steamboat developed 
by Robert Fulton . Early steamboats could travel upriver at speeds of almost five 
miles per hour. Commercially operated steamboat lines soon made round-trip shipping on the nation’s great rivers both faster and cheaper. Hauling freight from Cincinnati to New Y ork took more than seven weeks before the days of steamboats and canals. After, it took less than three weeks.
Railroads Even more rapid and reliable links between cities became 
possible with the building of the first U.S. railroad lines in the late 1820s. The early railroads were hampered at first by safety problems, but by the 1830s, they were competing directly with canals as an alternative method for carrying passengers and freight. The combination of railroads with the other major 
195  TOPIC 4.5   MARKET REVOLUTION  improvements in transportation rapidly changed small western towns such as 
Cleveland, Cincinnati, Detroit, and Chicago into booming commercial centers of the expanding national economy. These improvements in transportation linked the regions of the North and the Midwest, as people in growing cities in Massachusetts and New Y ork purchased much-needed wheat and corn raised in Ohio, Illinois, and states farther west. However, railroads were less common in the South, which continued to rely on rivers more than rails. 
Communication
Changes in transportation brought the country closer together. But it could travel only as fast as ships could sail and horses could run. In 1844, inventor Samuel F . B. Morse demonstrated a successful telegraph , which transmitted 
messages along wires almost instantaneously. As wires were strung around the country, often along railroad tracks and later under oceans, for the first time in human history, people were able to communicate as fast as electricity could travel. Suddenly, managers in New Y ork City, government officials in Washington, D.C., and military leaders in headquarters could direct people dozens, hundreds, or thousands of miles away more easily than ever before.

Telegraphs used a system of short and long signals (dots and dashes) to send messages. The 
chart above provided a visual way to learn the code for each letter, asserting that people who studied it could learn the code in one hour or less.
Growth of Industry
At the start of the 19th century, a manufacturing economy had barely begun 
in the United States. By mid-century, however, U.S. manufacturing surpassed agriculture in value, and by century’s end, it was the world’s leader. This rapid industrial growth was the result of a unique combination of factors.
196 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONMechanical Inventions Protected by patent laws, inventors looked 
forward to handsome rewards if their ideas for new tools or machines proved 
practical. Eli Whitney, who had developed the cotton gin in 1793 (see Topic 
3.12), was only the most famous of hundreds of Americans whose long hours of tinkering in their workshops resulted in improved technology. During the War of 1812, he developed a system for making rifles using interchangeable parts , identical components that can be assembled to make a final product. 
Before this, the parts of a rifle were not standardized enough that one could be replaced for another. Under Eli’s system, each part could be mass produced and then the parts could be put together to make a gun. This vastly increased the efficiency of making guns and other items. Interchangeable parts then became the basis for mass production methods in the new northern factories.
Corporations for Raising Capital In 1811, New Y ork passed a law that 
made it easier for a business to incorporate and raise capital (money) by selling shares of stock. Other states soon followed New Y ork’s lead. Owners of a corporation risked only the amount of money that they invested in a venture. They were not personally responsible for losses incurred by the corporation. Changes in state corporation laws facilitated the raising of the large sums of capital necessary for building factories, canals, and railroads.
Factory System  When Samuel Slater emigrated from Britain, taking 
information about factory designs out of the country was illegal. However, he had memorized the system and technology used in British cotton mills, and he applied these secrets to help establish the first U.S. textile factory in 1791. Early in the next century, the embargo and the War of 1812 stimulated domestic manufacturing and the protective tariffs enacted by Congress helped the new factories prosper.
In the 1820s, New England emerged as the country’s leading manufacturing 
center as a result of the region’s abundant waterpower for driving the new machinery and excellent seaports for shipping goods. Also, the decline of New England’s maritime industry made capital available for manufacturing, while the decline of farming in the region yielded a ready labor supply. Other northern states with similar resources and problems—New Y ork, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania—followed New England’s lead. As the factory system expanded, it encouraged the growth of financial businesses such as banking and insurance.
Labor  At first, factory owners had difficulty finding workers for their 
mills. Factory life could not compete with the lure of cheap land in the West. In response to this difficulty, textile mills in Lowell, Massachusetts, recruited 
young farm women and housed them in company dormitories. In the 1830s, other factories imitated the Lowell System . Many factories also made extensive 
use of child labor. Children as young as seven left home to work in the new factories. Toward the middle of the century, northern manufacturers began to employ immigrants in large numbers.
197  TOPIC 4.5   MARKET REVOLUTION  Unions Trade (or craft) unions were organized in major cities as early 
as the 1790s and increased in number as the factory system took hold. Many 
skilled workers (shoemakers and weavers, for example) had to seek employment in factories because their own small shops (the crafts system) produced items that could no longer compete with lower-priced, mass-produced goods. Long hours, low pay, and poor working conditions led to widespread discontent among factory workers. A prime goal of the early unions was to reduce the workday to ten hours. The obstacles to union success, however, were many: (1) immigrant replacement workers, (2) state laws outlawing unions, and (3) frequent economic depressions with high unemployment.
Commercial Agriculture
In the early 1800s, farming became more of a commercial enterprise and less of a means of providing subsistence for the family. Several factors promoted this switch to cash crops: 
• Large areas of western land were made available at low prices by the federal government. 
• State banks made acquiring land easier by providing farmers with loans at low interest rates.
• Initially, western farmers were limited to sending their products down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to southern markets. The development of canals and railroads opened new markets in the growing factory cities in the East.
Cotton and the South
Throughout the 19th century, the principal cash crop in the South was cotton. Eli Whitney’s invention of the cotton gin in 1793 (see Topic 3.12) transformed the agriculture of an entire region. Now that they could easily separate the cotton fiber from the seeds, southern planters found cotton more profitable than tobacco and indigo, the leading crops of the colonial period. They invested their capital in the purchase of enslaved African Americans and new land in Alabama and Mississippi (see Topic 4.13).
The cotton industry connected the South with a global economy. Mills in New 
England and Europe depended on cotton grown by enslaved workers in the South. Shipping firms, banks, and insurance companies based in the North, particularly New Y ork City, prospered through their roles in the transport of cotton. Further, in order to devote all of their land to growing cotton, many plantation owners purchased pork, corn, and other food from states in the Midwest.

Effects of the Market Revolution 
on Society and Culture
A high and honorable feeling generally prevails, and the people begin to 
assume, more and more, a national character . . . .
Hezekiah Niles, Niles’ Weekly Register, 1815
Learning Objective : Explain how and why innovation in technology, 
agriculture, and commerce affected various segments of American 
society over time.
The wide impact of the market revolution that resulted from the innovations 
in technology, agriculture, and commerce affected all groups of people in the 
growing nation. They resulted in the development of a distinctively American culture, an increase in religious fervor, and support for various reform movements.
Specialization on the farm, the growth of cities, industrialization, and the 
development of modern capitalism meant the end of self-sufficient households and a growing interdependence among people. These changes combined to bring about a revolution in the marketplace. Farmers provided food to feed workers in cities, who in turn provided an array of mass-produced goods to farm families. For most Americans, the standard of living increased. At the same time, however, adapting to an impersonal, fast-changing economy presented challenges and problems.
Women
As American society became more urban and industrialized, the nature of work and family life changed for women, many of whom no longer worked next to their husbands on family farms. Women seeking employment in a city were usually limited to two choices: domestic service or teaching. Factory jobs, as in the Lowell System, were not common. The overwhelming majority of working women were single. If they married, they left their jobs and took up duties in the home.
In both urban and rural settings, women were gaining relatively more 
control over their lives. As more men worked away from home, women took on new responsibilities as moral leaders within the home, a development known as the cult of domesticity (see Topic 4.11). Marriages arranged by one’s 
201  TOPIC 4.6   EFFECTS OF THE MARKET REVOLUTION ON SOCIETY AND CULTUREparents became less common, and some women elected to have fewer children. 
Nevertheless, legal restrictions on women remained. For example, they could not vote.
Economic and Social Mobility
Real wages improved for most urban workers in the early 1800s, but the gap between the very wealthy and the very poor increased. Social mobility (moving upward in income level and social status) did occur from one generation to the next, and economic opportunities in the United States were greater than in Europe. Extreme examples of poor, hard-working people becoming millionaires, however, were rare.
Population Growth and Change
Population growth provided both the laborers and the consumers required for industrial development. Between 1800 and 1825, the U.S. population doubled; in the following 25 years, it doubled again. A high birthrate accounted for most of this growth, but it was strongly supplemented after 1830 by immigrants arriving from Europe, particularly from Great Britain and Germany. The nonwhite population—African Americans and American Indians—also grew in total number. However, as a percentage of the total population, nonwhites declined from almost 20 percent in 1790 to 15 percent in the 1850s. The enslaved population increased steadily despite the ban on the importation of enslaved Africans after 1808. In no other country in the Americas did the enslaved population generally increase after the slave trade ended. 
By the 1830s, almost one-third of the population lived west of the Alleghenies. 
At the same time, both old and new urban areas were growing rapidly.
Immigration In 1820, about 8,000 immigrants arrived from Europe, but 
beginning in 1832, there was a sudden increase. After 1832, the number of new arrivals never fell below 50,000 a year and in one year, 1854, climbed as high as 428,000. From the 1830s through the 1850s, nearly 4 million people from northern Europe crossed the Atlantic to seek a new life in the United States.
The surge in immigration between 1830 and 1860 was chiefly the result of 
the following: (1) the development of inexpensive and relatively rapid ocean transportation, (2) famines and revolutions in Europe that drove people from their homelands, and (3) the growing reputation of the United States as a country offering economic opportunities and political freedom. 
Arriving by ship in the northern seacoast cities of Boston, New Y ork, and 
Philadelphia, many immigrants remained where they landed while others traveled to farms and cities of the Old Northwest. Few journeyed to the South, where the plantation economy and slavery limited the opportunities for free labor. The immigrants strengthened the U.S. economy by providing both a steady stream of inexpensive labor and an increased demand for mass-produced consumer goods.
202 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONUrban Life The North’s urban population grew from approximately  
5 percent of the population in 1800 to 15 percent by 1850. As a result of such 
rapid growth in cities from Boston to Baltimore, slums also expanded. Crowded housing, poor sanitation, infectious diseases, and high rates of crime soon became characteristic of large working-class neighborhoods. Nevertheless, the new opportunities in cities offered by the Industrial Revolution  continued 
to attract people from farming communities, including both native-born Americans and immigrants from Europe. 
New Cities  At key transportation points, small towns grew into thriving 
cities after 1820: Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago on the Great Lakes, Cincinnati on the Ohio River, and St. Louis on the Mississippi River. The cities served as transfer points, processing farm products for shipment to the East and distributing manufactured goods from the East to their region.

Organized Labor
As manufacturing became increasingly important in the economy, goods 
became less expensive. For those who could afford them, the standard of living improved. The shift in the economy also created a small class of people, including some factory owners and bankers, who were very wealthy and a growing middle class of people. 
Industrial development meant that a large number of people who had once 
earned their living as independent farmers and artisans became dependent on wages earned in a factory. With the common problems of low pay, long hours, and unsafe working conditions, urban workers in different cities organized both unions and local political parties to protect their interests. The first U.S. labor party, founded in Philadelphia in 1828, succeeded in electing a few members of the city council. For a brief period in the 1830s, an increasing number of urban workers joined unions and participated in strikes. 
Organized labor achieved one notable victory in 1842 when the 
Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in Commonwealth v. Hunt  that “peaceful 
unions” had the right to negotiate labor contracts with employers. During the 1840s, some state legislatures in the North passed laws establishing a ten-hour workday for industrial workers. Improvement for workers, however, continued to be limited by (1) periodic depressions, (2) employers and courts that were hostile to unions, and (3) an abundant supply of low-wage immigrant labor.

Expanding Democracy
“The political activity which pervades the United States must be seen 
in order to be understood. No sooner do you set foot upon American 
soil than you are stunned by a kind of tumult.
Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America, 1835
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the expansion of 
participatory democracy from 1800 to 1848.
The changing politics of the period from 1800 to 1848 paralleled complex 
social and economic changes.
Greater Equality
Visitors to the United States in the 1830s such as Alexis de Tocqueville, a young 
French aristocrat, were amazed by the informal manners and democratic attitudes of Americans. In hotels, men and women from all classes ate together at common tables. On stagecoaches, steamboats, and later in railroad cars, there was also only one class for passengers, so rich and poor alike sat together in the same compartments. European visitors could not distinguish between classes in the United States. Men of all backgrounds wore simple dark trousers and jackets, while less well-to-do women emulated the fanciful and confining styles illustrated in wide-circulation women’s magazines like Godey’s Lady’s 
Book . Equality was becoming the governing principle of American society.
The Rise of a Democratic Society
Among the White majority in American society, people shared a belief in the principle of equality—more precisely, equality of opportunity for White males. These beliefs ignored the enslavement of most African Americans and discrimination against everyone who was not White. Equality of opportunity would, at least in theory, allow a young man of humble origins to rise as far as his natural talent and industry would take him. The hero of the age was the “self-made man. ”
There was no equivalent belief in the “self-made woman. ” Restrictions, both 
legal and cultural, limited what women could do. But by the end of the 1840s, feminists would take up the theme of equal rights and insist that it should be applied to both women and men (see Topic 4.11).
206 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONPolitics of the Common Man
Between 1824 and 1840, politics moved out of the fine homes of rich southern 
planters and northern merchants who had dominated government in past eras and into middle- and lower-class homes. Several factors contributed to the spread of democracy, including new suffrage laws, changes in political parties and campaigns, improved education, and increases in newspaper circulation.
Universal White Male Suffrage Western states newly admitted to the 
Union—Indiana (1816), Illinois (1818), and Missouri (1821)—adopted state constitutions that allowed all White males to vote and hold office. These newer constitutions omitted any religious or property qualifications for voting. Most eastern states soon followed suit, eliminating such restrictions. As a result, throughout the country, all White males could vote regardless of their social class or religion. Voting for president rose from about 350,000 in 1824 to more than 2.4 million in 1840, a nearly sevenfold increase in just 16 years, mostly as a result of changes in voting laws. In addition, political offices could be held by people in the lower and middle ranks of society. 
Changes to Parties and Campaigns
Though not mentioned in the Constitution, political parties quickly became important. They channeled the energies of people into choosing leaders.
Party Nominating Conventions In the past, candidates for office had 
commonly been nominated either by state legislatures or by “King Caucus”—a closed-door meeting of a political party’s leaders in Congress. Common citizens had no opportunity to participate. In the 1830s, however, caucuses were replaced by nominating conventions. Party politicians and voters would gather in a large meeting hall to nominate the party’s candidates. The Anti-Masonic 
Party  was the first to hold such a nominating convention. This method was 
more open to popular participation, hence more democratic.
Popular Election of the Electors In the presidential election of 1832, 
only South Carolina used the old system in which the state legislature chose the electors for president. All other states had adopted the more democratic method of allowing the voters to choose a state’s slate of presidential electors.
Two-Party System  The popular election of presidential electors—and, 
indirectly, the president—had important consequences for the two-party system. Campaigns for president now had to be conducted on a national scale. To organize these campaigns, candidates needed large political parties.
Rise of Third Parties While only the large national parties (the Democrats 
and the Whigs in the 1830s) could hope to win the presidency, other political parties also emerged. The Anti-Masonic Party and the Workingmen’s Party, 
for example, reached out to groups of people who previously had shown little interest in politics. The Anti-Masons attacked the secret societies of Masons and accused them of belonging to an antidemocratic elite. The Workingmen’s Party tried to unite artisans and skilled laborers into a political organization.
207  TOPIC 4.7   Ex PANDING DEMOCRACYMore Elected Offices During the Jacksonian era, a larger proportion of 
state and local officials were elected to office instead of being appointed as they 
had been in the past. This change gave the voters more voice in their government and also tended to increase their interest in participating in elections.
Popular Campaigning  Candidates for office directed their campaigns to 
the interests and prejudices of the common people. Politics also became a form of local entertainment. Campaigns of the 1830s and 1840s featured parades of floats and marching bands and large rallies in which voters were treated to free food and drink. The negative side to the new campaign techniques was that in appealing to the masses, candidates would often resort to personal attacks and ignore the issues. A politician, for example, might attack an opponent’s “aristocratic airs” and make him seem unfriendly to “the common man. ”
Spoils System and Rotation of Officeholders Winning government jobs 
became the lifeblood of party organizations. At the national level, President Jackson believed in appointing people to federal jobs (as postmasters, for example) strictly according to whether they had actively campaigned for the Democratic Party. Any previous holder of the office who was not a Democrat was fired and replaced with a loyal Democrat. This practice of dispensing government jobs in return for party loyalty was called the spoils system  because 
of a comment that, in a war, victors seize the spoils, or wealth, of the defeated.
In addition, Jackson believed in a system of rotation in office. By limiting 
a person to one term in office, he could then appoint some other deserving Democrat in his place. Jackson defended the replacement and rotation of officeholders as a democratic reform. “No man, ” he said, “has any more intrinsic claim to office than another. ” Both the spoils system and the rotation of officeholders affirmed the democratic ideal that one man was as good as another and that ordinary Americans were capable of holding any government office. These beliefs also helped build a strong two-party system.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  THE JACKSONIANS AND EXPANDING 
DEMOCRACY
Historians debate whether the election of Jackson in 1828 marked a revolutionary and democratic turn in American politics. The traditional view is that Jackson’s election began the era of the common man, when the masses of newly enfranchised voters drove out the entrenched ruling class and elected one of their own. The Revolution of 1828 was a victory of the democratic West against the aristocratic East. On the other hand, 19th-century Whig historians viewed Jackson as a despot whose appeal to the uneducated masses and “corrupt” spoils system threatened the republic.
Urban Workers In the 1940s, the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. 
argued that Jacksonian democracy relied as much on the support of eastern urban workers as on western farmers. Jackson’s coalition of farmers and workers foreshadowed a similar coalition that elected another Democratic president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the 1930s.

“Our citizens who have not yet voted, have one more day in which they

The old party lines are nearly obliterated, but there has sprung up a new interest which is formidable, both for the number of its adherents, and the disorganizing purposes by which they are actuated. By throwing open the polls to every man that walks, we have placed the power in the hands of those who have neither property, talents, nor influence in other circumstances; and who require in their public offices no higher qualifications than they possess themselves. ”
New York Journal of Commerce, November 7, 1829Cultural Influence Contemporary historians have used quantitative 
analysis of voting returns to show that increased voter participation was evident in local elections years before 1828 and did not reach a peak until the election of 1840, an election that the Whig Party won. Some historians argue that religion and ethnicity were more important than economic class in shaping votes. For example, Catholic immigrants objected to the imposition of the Puritan moral code (e.g., temperance) by the native-born Protestants.
Economic Clash Recent historians see Jackson’s popularity in the 1830s as 
a reaction of subsistence farmers and urban workers against threatening forces of economic change. A capitalist, or market, economy was taking shape in the early years of the 19th century. This market revolution divided the electorate. Some, including many Whigs, wanted a greater role for business owners. Jackson’s veto of the bank captured popular fears about the rise of capitalism.

Andrew Jackson, on his veto of the national bank bill, July 10, 1832
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of continuing policy 
debates about the role of the federal government from 1800 to 1848.
The era marked by the emergence of popular politics in the 1820s and the 
presidency of Andrew Jackson (1829–1837) is often called the Age of the 
Common Man or the Era of Jacksonian Democracy. Historians debate whether Jackson was a major molder of events, a political opportunist exploiting the democratic ferment of the times, or merely a symbol of the era. Nevertheless, the era and Jackson’s name are strongly linked. 
Jackson Versus Adams
Political change in the Jacksonian era began several years before Jackson moved into the White House as president. In the controversial election in 1824, Jackson won more popular and electoral votes than any other candidate but he ended up losing the election.
The Election of 1824
Recall the brief Era of Good Feelings that characterized U.S. politics during the two-term presidency of James Monroe. The era ended in political bad feelings in 1824, the year of a bitterly contested and divisive presidential election. By then, the old congressional caucus system for choosing presidential candidates had broken down. As a result, four candidates from the Democratic-Republican Party of Jefferson campaigned for the presidency: John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay , William Crawford, and Andrew Jackson.
Among voters in states that counted popular votes (six did not), Jackson 
won. But because the vote was split four ways, he lacked a majority in the Electoral College as required by the Constitution. Therefore, the House of Representatives had to choose a president from among the top three candidates. Henry Clay used his influence in the House to provide John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts with enough votes to win the election. When President Adams appointed Clay his secretary of state, Jackson and his followers charged that the decision of the voters had been foiled by secret political maneuvers. Angry Jackson supporters accused Adams and Clay of making a “corrupt bargain.”

President John Quincy Adams
Adams further alienated the followers of Jackson when he asked Congress 
for money for internal improvements, aid to manufacturing, and even a national university and an astronomical observatory. Jacksonians viewed all these measures as a waste of money and a violation of the Constitution. Most significantly, in 1828, Congress patched together a new tariff law, which generally satisfied northern manufacturers but alienated southern planters. Southerners denounced it as a “tariff of abominations. ”
The Revolution of 1828
Adams sought reelection in 1828. But the Jacksonians were now ready to use the discontent of southerners and westerners and the new campaign tactics of party organization to sweep “Old Hickory” (Jackson) into office. Going beyond parades and barbecues, Jackson’s party resorted to smearing the president and accusing Adams’s wife of being born out of wedlock. Supporters of Adams retaliated in kind, accusing Jackson’s wife of adultery. The mudslinging campaign attracted a lot of interest, and voter turnout soared.
Jackson won handily, carrying every state west of the Appalachians. His 
reputation as a war hero and man of the western frontier accounted for his victory more than the positions he took on issues of the day.
The Presidency of Andrew Jackson
Jackson was a different kind of president from any of his predecessors. A strong leader, he not only dominated politics for eight years but also became a symbol of the emerging working class and middle class (the so-called common man). Born in a frontier cabin, Jackson gained fame as an Indian fighter and as hero of the Battle of New Orleans and came to live in a fine mansion in Tennessee as a wealthy planter and slaveowner. But he never lost the rough manners of the frontier. He chewed tobacco, fought several duels, and displayed a violent temper. Jackson was the first president since Washington to be without a college 
212 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONeducation. In a phrase, he could be described as an extraordinary ordinary 
man. This self-made man and living legend drew support from every social group and every section of the country.
Presidential Power  Jackson presented himself as the representative of 
all the people and the protector of the common man against abuses of power by the rich and the privileged. He was a frugal Jeffersonian, who opposed increasing federal spending and the national debt. Jackson interpreted the powers of Congress narrowly and, therefore, vetoed more bills—12—than all six preceding presidents combined. For example, he vetoed the use of federal money to construct the Maysville Road because it was wholly within one state, Kentucky, the home state of Jackson’s rival, Henry Clay.
Jackson’s closest advisers were a group known as his “kitchen cabinet” who 
did not belong to his official cabinet. Because of them, the appointed cabinet had less influence on policy than under earlier presidents.
Peggy Eaton Affair The champion of the common man also went to the 
aid of the common woman, at least in the case of Peggy O’Neale Eaton. The wife of Jackson’s secretary of war, she was the target of malicious gossip by other cabinet wives, much as Jackson’s recently deceased wife had been in the 1828 campaign. When Jackson tried to force the cabinet wives to accept Peggy Eaton socially, most of the cabinet resigned. This controversy contributed to the resignation of Jackson’s vice president, John C. Calhoun, a year later. For remaining loyal during this crisis, Martin Van Buren  of New Y ork was chosen 
as vice president for Jackson’s second term.
Indian Removal Act (1830) Jackson’s concept of democracy did not 
extend to American Indians. Jackson sympathized with land-hungry citizens who were impatient to take over lands held by American Indians. Jackson thought the most humane solution was to compel the American Indians to leave their traditional homelands and resettle west of the Mississippi. In 1830, he signed into law the Indian Removal Act, which forced the resettlement of many thousands of American Indians.
By 1835, most eastern tribes had reluctantly complied and moved west. 
The Bureau of Indian Affairs was created in 1836 to assist the resettled tribes.
Most politicians supported a policy of Indian removal. Georgia and other 
states passed laws requiring the Cherokees to migrate to the West. When the Cherokees challenged Georgia in the courts, the Supreme Court ruled in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831) that Cherokees were not a foreign nation with the right to sue in a federal court. But in a second case, Worcester v. Georgia (1832), the high court ruled that the laws of Georgia had no force within Cherokee territory. In this clash between a state’s laws and the federal courts, Jackson sided with the states. The Court was powerless to enforce its decision without the President’s support.
Trail of Tears Most Cherokees repudiated the settlement of 1835, which 
provided land in the Indian territory. In 1838, after Jackson had left office, the U.S. Army forced 15,000 Cherokees to leave Georgia. The hardships on the Trail of Tears westward caused the deaths of 4,000 Cherokees.

Nullification Crisis Jackson favored states’ rights—but not disunion. 
In 1828, the South Carolina legislature declared the increased tariff of 1828, 
the so-called Tariff of Abominations, to be unconstitutional. In doing so, it affirmed a theory advanced by Jackson’s first vice president, John C. Calhoun. According to this nullification theory , each state had the right to decide whether 
to obey a federal law or to declare it null and void (of no effect).
In 1830, the conflicting views of the nature of the federal Union under the 
Constitution led to a dramatic exchange of speeches between Senators Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Robert Hayne of South Carolina. Hayne argued for the rights of states. In response, Webster attacked the idea that any state could defy or leave the Union. 
Following this famous Webster-Hayne debate, President Jackson declared 
his own position in a toast he presented at a political dinner. “Our federal Union, ” he declared, “it must be preserved. ” Calhoun responded immediately with another toast: “The Union, next to our liberties, most dear!”
In 1832, Calhoun’s South Carolina increased tensions by holding a special 
convention to nullify both the hated 1828 tariff and a new tariff of 1832. The convention passed a resolution forbidding collection of tariffs within the state. Jackson reacted decisively. He told the secretary of war to prepare the military. He persuaded Congress to pass the Force Bill, which gave him authority to act against South Carolina. Jackson also issued a Proclamation to the People of South Carolina, stating that nullification and disunion were treason.
214 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONBut federal troops did not march in this crisis. Jackson opened the door 
for compromise by suggesting that Congress lower the tariff. South Carolina 
postponed nullification and later formally rescinded it after Congress enacted a new tariff along the lines suggested by the president, along with some adjustments that appealed to Northern industrialists.
Opposition to Antislavery Efforts Jackson’s strong defense of federal 
authority forced the militant advocates of states’ rights to retreat. On another issue, however, militant southerners had Jackson’s support. The president shared southerners’ alarm about the growing antislavery movement in the North. He used his executive power to stop antislavery literature from being sent through the U.S. mail. Southern Jacksonians trusted that Jackson would not extend democracy to African Americans.
Bank Veto Another major issue of Jackson’s presidency concerned the 
rechartering of the Bank of the United States. This bank and its branches, although privately owned, received federal deposits and attempted to serve a public purpose by cushioning the ups and downs of the national economy. The bank’s president, Nicholas Biddle, managed it effectively. Biddle’s arrogance, however, contributed to popular suspicion that the bank abused its powers and served the interests of only the wealthy. Jackson shared this suspicion. In addition, Jackson believed that the Bank of the United States was unconstitutional.
Henry Clay, Jackson’s chief political opponent, favored the bank. In 
1832, an election year, Clay challenged Jackson by persuading a majority in Congress to pass a bank recharter bill. Jackson promptly vetoed it, denouncing the bank as a private monopoly that enriched the wealthy and foreigners at the expense of the common people and a “hydra of corruption. ” The voters backed Jackson, who won reelection with more than three-fourths of the electoral vote.
The Two-Party System
The brief one-party system that had characterized Monroe’s presidency (the Era of Good Feelings) had given way to a two-party system under Jackson. Supporters of Jackson were now known as Democrats, while supporters of his leading rival, Henry Clay, were called Whigs. The Democratic Party harked back to the old Democratic-Republican Party of Jefferson, and the Whig Party resembled the defunct Federalist Party of Hamilton. Just as the Federalists had supported a national bank and a national road in order to promote economic growth, the Whigs supported spending federal money for internal improvements, such as roads, canals, and harbors. 
At the same time, the new parties reflected the changed conditions of the 
Jacksonian era. Democrats and Whigs alike were challenged to respond to the relentless westward expansion of the nation and the emergence of an industrial economy.
215  TOPIC 4.8    J ACKSON AND FEDERAL POWERJackson’s Second Term
After winning reelection in 1832, Jackson moved to destroy the Bank of the 
United States.
Pet Banks Jackson attacked the bank by withdrawing all federal funds. 
Aided by Secretary of the Treasury Roger Taney, he transferred the funds to 
various state banks, which Jackson’s critics called “pet banks. ”
Specie Circular As a result of both Jackson’s financial policies and the 
feverish purchase of western lands by many speculators, prices for land and various goods became greatly inflated. Jackson hoped to check the inflationary trend by issuing a presidential order known as the Specie Circular. It required that all future purchases of federal lands be made in specie (gold and silver) rather than in paper banknotes. Soon afterward, banknotes lost their value and land sales plummeted. Right after Jackson left office, a financial crisis—the Panic of 1837—plunged the nation’s economy into a depression.
The Election of 1836
Following the two-term tradition set by his predecessors, Jackson did not seek a third term. To make sure his policies were carried out even in his retirement, Jackson persuaded the Democratic Party to nominate his loyal vice president, Martin Van Buren, who was a master of practical politics.
Fearing defeat, the Whig Party adopted the unusual strategy of nominating 
three candidates from three different regions. In doing so, the Whigs hoped to throw the election into the House of Representatives, where each state had one vote in the selection of the president. The Whig strategy failed, however, as Van Buren took 58 percent of the electoral vote.

President Van Buren and the Panic of 1837
Just as Van Buren took office, the country suffered a financial panic as one 
bank after another closed its doors. Jackson’s opposition to the rechartering of the Bank of the United States was only one of many causes of the panic and resulting economic depression. But the Whigs were quick to blame the 
216 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONDemocrats for their laissez-faire economics, which advocated for little federal 
involvement in the economy.
The “Log Cabin and Hard Cider” Campaign of 1840
In the election of 1840, the Whigs were in a strong position to defeat Van Buren and the Jacksonian Democrats. Voters were unhappy with the bad state of the economy. In addition, the Whigs were better organized than the Democrats and had a popular war hero, William Henry “Tippecanoe” Harrison, as their presidential candidate. The Whigs took campaign hoopla to new heights. To symbolize Harrison’s humble origins, they put log cabins on wheels and paraded them down the streets of cities and towns. They also passed out hard cider for voters to drink and buttons and hats to wear. Name-calling as a propaganda device also marked the 1840 campaign. The Whigs attacked “Martin Van Ruin” as an aristocrat with a taste for foreign wines.
A remarkable 78 percent of eligible voters (White males) cast their ballots. 
Old “Tippecanoe” and John Tyler of Virginia, a former states’ rights Democrat who joined the Whigs, took 53 percent of the popular vote and most of the electoral votes in all three sections: North, South, and West. This election established the Whigs as a national party.
However, Harrison died of pneumonia less than a month after taking 
office, and “His Accidency, ” John Tyler, became the first vice president to succeed to the presidency. President Tyler was not much of a Whig. He vetoed the Whigs’ national bank bills and other legislation and favored southern and expansionist Democrats during the balance of his term (1841–1845). 
The Western Frontier
Jackson’s view of Native Americans and the Trail of Tears both reflect a common opinion and approach in the 19th century. If as the United States expanded westward, the definition of the “West” kept changing, attitudes towards the land and the American Indians remained constant. In the 1600s, the West referred to all the lands not along the Atlantic coast. In the 1700s, the West meant lands on the other side of the Appalachian Mountains. By the mid-1800s, the West lay beyond the Mississippi River and reached to California and the Oregon Territory on the Pacific coast. 
American Indians
The original settlers of the West—and the entire North American continent—were various groups of American Indians. However, from the time of Columbus, American Indians were cajoled, pushed, or driven westward as White settlers encroached on their original homelands. 
Exodus  By 1850, the vast majority of American Indians were living west 
of the Mississippi River. Those to the east had either been killed by disease, died 
217  TOPIC 4.8    J ACKSON AND FEDERAL POWERin battles, emigrated reluctantly, or had been forced to leave their land by treaty 
or military action. The Great Plains, however, would provide only a temporary respite from conflict with White settlers. 
Life on the Plains Horses brought to America by the Spanish in the 1500s 
revolutionized life for American Indians on the Great Plains. Some tribes continued to live in villages and farm, but the horse allowed tribes such as the Cheyenne and the Sioux to become nomadic hunters following the buffalo. Those living a nomadic way of life could more easily move away from advancing settlers or oppose their encroachments by force. 
The Frontier
Although the location of the western frontier constantly shifted, the concept  
of the frontier remained the same from generation to generation. The same forces that had brought the original colonists to the Americas motivated their descendants and new immigrants to move westward. In the public imagination, the West represented the possibility of a fresh start for those willing to venture there. If not in fact, at least in theory and myth, the West beckoned as a place promising greater freedom for all ethnic groups: American Indians, African Americans, European Americans, and eventually Asian Americans as well. 
Mountain Men From the point of view of White Americans, the Rocky 
Mountains in the 1820s were a far-distant frontier—a total wilderness except for American Indian villages. The earliest White people in the area had followed Lewis and Clark and explored American Indian trails as they trapped for furs. These mountain men, as they were called, served as the guides and pathfinders for settlers crossing the mountains into California and Oregon in the 1840s. 
White Settlers on the Western Frontier
Whether the frontier lay in Minnesota or Oregon or California in the 1830s and 1840s, daily life for White settlers was similar to that of the early colonists. They worked hard from sunrise to sunset and lived in log cabins, sod huts, or other shelters built from locally available resources. Disease and malnutrition were far greater dangers than attacks by American Indians. 
Women  Often living many miles from the nearest neighbor, pioneer 
women performed myriad daily tasks, including those of doctor, teacher, seamstress, and cook—as well as chief assistant in the fields to their farmer husbands. The isolation, endless work, and rigors of childbirth resulted in a short lifespan for frontier women. 
Environmental Damage Settlers had little understanding of the fragile 
nature of land and wildlife. As settlers moved into an area, they would clear entire forests and after only two generations, exhaust the soil with poor farming methods. At the same time, trappers and hunters brought the beaver and the buffalo to the brink of extinction.

1. “He [Jackson] believed that removal was the Indians’ only salvation against 
certain extinction. . . . 
Not that the President was motivated by concerns for the Indians  .  .  .  . 
Andrew Jackson was motivated principally by two considerations: first . . . military safety . . . that Indians must not occupy areas that might jeopardize the defense of this nation; and second, . . . the principle that all persons residing within states are subject to the jurisdiction and laws of those states. . . . 
Would it have been worse had the Indians remained in the East? Jackson 
thought so. He said that they would ‘disappear and be forgotten. ’ One thing does seem certain: the Indians would have been forced to yield to state laws and white society. Indian Nations per se would have been obliterated. ”
Robert V . Remini, historian, Andrew Jackson: The Course of 
American Freedom, 1822–1832, 1998
“The Georgia legislature passed a law extending the state’s jurisdiction . . . over the Cherokees living within the state. 
Georgia’s action forced the President’s hand. He must see to it that a 
removal policy long covertly pursued by the White House would now be enacted into law by Congress. . . .
Jackson as usual spoke publicly in a tone of friendship and concern for 
Indian welfare. . . . He, as President, could be their friend only if they removed beyond the Mississippi, where they should have a ‘land of their own, which they shall possess as long as Grass grows or water runs . . . . ’
A harsh policy was nevertheless quickly put in place. It is abundantly clear that Jackson and his administration were determined 
to permit the extension of state sovereignty because it would result in the harassment of Indians, powerless to resist, by speculators and intruders hungry for Indian land. ”

European countries from which settlers had come. With their independence 
assured by the early 19th century, Americans increasingly developed a culture of their own, often one with a strong nationalistic tone. However, Americans continued to be influenced by their European heritage and to look to Europe for new ideas. Furthermore, the growing national culture emerged at the same time regional variations of it became increasingly evident. 
Cultural Nationalism
The generation of Americans that became adults in the first decades of the 19th century had concerns that differed from those of the nation’s founders. The young were excited about the prospects of the new nation expanding westward and had little interest in European politics now that the Napoleonic wars (as well as the War of 1812) were in the past. As fervent nationalists, they believed their young country was entering an era of unlimited prosperity. Patriotic themes infused every aspect of American society, from art to schoolbooks. Heroes of the Revolution were enshrined in the paintings by Gilbert Stuart, Charles Willson Peale, and John Trumbull. A fictionalized biography extolling the virtues of George Washington, written by Parson Mason Weems, was widely read. The expanding public schools embraced Noah Webster’s blue-backed speller, which promoted patriotism long before his famous dictionary was published. The basic ideas and ideals of nationalism and patriotism would dominate most of the 19th century.
A Changing Culture: Ideas, the Arts, and Literature 
In Europe, during the early years of the 19th century, artists and writers shifted away from the Enlightenment emphasis on reason, order, and balance and 
223  TOPIC 4.9    THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AMERICAN CULTURE  toward intuition, feelings, individual acts of heroism, and the study of nature. 
This new movement, known as romanticism, was most clearly expressed in the United States by the transcendentalists, a small group of New England thinkers.
The Transcendentalists
Writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau questioned the doctrines of established churches and the business practices of the merchant class. They argued for a mystical and intuitive way of thinking as a means for discovering one’s inner self and looking for the essence of God in nature. Their views challenged the materialism of American society by suggesting that artistic expression was more important than the pursuit of wealth. Although the transcendentalists valued individualism highly and downplayed the importance of organized institutions, they supported a variety of reforms, especially the antislavery movement.
Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) The best-known transcendentalist, 
Ralph Waldo Emerson, was a very popular American writer and speaker. His essays and lectures expressed the individualistic and nationalistic spirit of Americans by urging them not to imitate European culture but to create a distinctive American  culture. He argued for self-reliance, independent thinking, 
and the primacy of spiritual matters over material ones. A northerner who lived in Concord, Massachusetts, Emerson became a leading critic of slavery in the 1850s and then an ardent supporter of the Union during the Civil War.
Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) Also living in Concord and a close 
friend of Emerson was Henry David Thoreau. To test his transcendentalist philosophy, Thoreau conducted a two-year experiment of living simply in a cabin in the woods outside town. He used observations of nature to help him search for essential truths about life and the universe. Thoreau’s writings from these years were published in the book for which he is best known, Walden  
(1854). Because of this book, Thoreau is remembered today as a pioneer ecologist and conservationist.
Though often detached from politics, Thoreau felt strongly that the U.S. war 
against Mexico (1846–1848) was immoral. To express his opposition, he refused to pay a tax that would support the war. For breaking the tax law, Thoreau was arrested and jailed. He stayed only one night—an unknown person paid his tax for him. Thoreau’s reflections on the necessity for disobeying unjust laws and accepting the penalty in his essay known as “On Civil Disobedience” added to his lasting fame. In the 20th century, Thoreau’s ideas and actions would inspire the nonviolent movements of both Mohandas Gandhi in India and Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States.
Brook Farm Could a community of people live out the transcendentalist 
ideal? In 1841, George Ripley, a Protestant minister, launched a communal experiment at Brook Farm in Massachusetts. His goal was to achieve “a more natural union between intellectual and manual labor. ” Living at Brook Farm at times were some of the leading intellectuals of the period. Emerson went, as 
224 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONdid Margaret Fuller , a feminist (advocate of women’s rights) writer and 
editor; Theodore Parker, a theologian and radical reformer; and Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, a novelist. A bad fire and heavy debts forced the end of the 
experiment in 1849. But Brook Farm was remembered for its atmosphere of artistic creativity, its innovative school, and its appeal to New England’s intellectual elite and their children.
Other Communal Experiments
Brook Farm was just one attempt to set up an intentionally organized society. The idea of withdrawing from conventional society to create an ideal community, or utopia , in a fresh setting was not a new idea. But never before were social 
experiments so numerous as during the antebellum  years. The open lands of 
the United States proved fertile ground for more than a hundred experimental communities. The early members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints undertook one type of a religious communal effort (see Topic 4.10). Brook Farm was an example of a humanistic, or secular, experiment. Although many of the communities were short-lived, these “backwoods utopias” reflect the diversity of the reform ideas of the time.
Shakers One of the earliest religious communal movements, the Shakers 
had about 6,000 members in various communities by the 1840s. Shakers held property in common and kept women and men strictly separate (forbidding marriage and sexual relations). For lack of new recruits, the Shaker communities virtually died out by the mid-1900s.
The Amana Colonies The settlers of the Amana Colonies in Iowa were 
Germans who belonged to the religious reform movement known as Pietism. Like the Shakers, they emphasized simple, communal living. However, they allowed for marriage. Their communities continue to prosper, although they no longer practice their communal ways of living. 
New Harmony The secular (nonreligious) experiment in New Harmony, 
Indiana, was the work of the Welsh industrialist and reformer Robert Owen . 
Owen hoped his utopian socialist community would provide an answer to the problems of inequity and alienation caused by the Industrial Revolution. The experiment failed, however, as a result of both financial problems and disagreements among members of the community.
Oneida Community After undergoing a religious conversion, John 
Humphrey Noyes started a cooperative community in Oneida, New Y ork, in 1848. Dedicated to an ideal of perfect social and economic equality, community members shared property and, later, marriage partners. Critics attacked the Oneida system of planned reproduction and communal child-rearing as a sinful experiment in “free love. ” Despite the controversy, the community managed to prosper economically by producing and selling silverware of excellent quality.
Fourier Phalanxes In the 1840s, the theories of the French socialist Charles 
Fourier attracted the interest of many Americans. In response to the problems 
225  TOPIC 4.9    THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AMERICAN CULTURE  of a fiercely competitive society, Fourier advocated that people share work and 
housing in communities known as Fourier Phalanxes. This movement died out quickly as Americans proved too individualistic to live communally.
Arts and Literature
The democratic and reforming impulses of the Age of Jackson expressed themselves in painting, architecture, and literature. 
Painting  Genre painting—portraying the everyday life of ordinary people 
doing ordinary things such as riding riverboats and voting on election day—became popular among artists in the 1830s. For example, George Caleb Bingham depicted common people in various settings and carrying out domestic chores. William S. Mount won popularity for his lively rural compositions. Thomas Cole and Frederick Church emphasized the heroic beauty of American landscapes, especially in dramatic scenes along the Hudson River in New Y ork state and the western frontier wilderness. The Hudson River School, as it was called, expressed the Romantic Age’s fascination with the natural world.
Architecture Inspired by the democracy of classical Athens, American 
architects adapted Greek styles to glorify the democratic spirit of the republic. Columned facades like those of ancient Greek temples graced the entryways to public buildings, banks, hotels, and even some private homes.
Literature  In addition to the transcendentalist authors (notably Emerson 
and Thoreau), other writers helped to create a literature that was both Romantic and yet distinctively American. Partly as a result of the War of 1812, the American people became more nationalistic and eager to read works about American themes by American writers. Most prominent writers came from New England or the Mid-Atlantic states:
• Washington Irving wrote fiction, such as “Rip Van Winkle” and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, ”  using American settings.
• James Fenimore Cooper’s Leatherstocking Tales  were a series of novels 
written from 1824 to 1841 that glorified the nobility of scouts and settlers on the American frontier.
• Nathaniel Hawthorne questioned the intolerance and conformity in American life in short stories and novels, including The Scarlet Letter (1850). 
• Herman Melville’s innovative novel Moby-Dick  (1855) reflected 
the theological and cultural conflicts of the era as it told the story of Captain Ahab’s pursuit of a white whale.
• Edgar Allan Poe, like many Romantic writers, focused on irrational aspects of human behavior. His poems such as “The Raven” and short stories such as “The Tell-Tale Heart” portrayed mysterious or even horrifying events.

Topic 4.10
The Second Great Awakening
A revival is nothing else than a new beginning of obedience to God. 
Reverend Charles Grandison Finney, “What a Revival of Religion Is, ” 1835
Learning Objective : Explain the causes of the Second Great Awakening.
Religious revivals swept through the United States starting in the late 18th 
century and through the first half of the 19th century. Some of these, known as 
the Second Great Awakening, marked a reassertion of the traditional Calvinist 
(Puritan) teachings of original sin and predestination. Others represented new developments in Christianity in the United States. 
Causes of Religious Reform
Several factors fostered the conditions for the religious reforms of the late 18th and first half of the 19th century known as the Second Great Awakening:
• The growing emphasis on democracy and the individual that influenced politics and the arts also affected how people viewed religion. Worshippers were attracted to services that were more participatory and less formal. 
• The rational approach to religion favored by the Deists and Unitarians prompted a reaction toward more emotional expressions of beliefs in worship services.
• The market revolution caused people to fear that growing industrialization and commercialization were leading to increased greed and sin.
• The disruptions caused by the market revolution and the mobility of people led them to look for worship settings that were outside formal churches based in urban areas. 
Revivals
The Second Great Awakening began among highly educated people such as Reverend Timothy Dwight, president of Y ale College in Connecticut. Dwight 
and others saw themselves as traditional Calvinists leading a counterattack against the liberal views that emerged in the 1790s. His campus revivals 
230 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONmotivated a generation of young men to become evangelical preachers. In the 
revivals of the early 1800s, successful preachers were audience-centered and easily understood by the uneducated. They spoke about the opportunity for salvation for all, a message attuned to the democratization of American society. They attracted thousands to existing churches and led the establishment of new religious organizations. 
Revivalism on the Frontier In 1823, Presbyterian minister Charles 
Grandison Finney started a series of revivals in upstate New Y ork, where many New Englanders had settled. Instead of delivering sermons based on rational argument, Finney appealed to people’s emotions and fear of damnation. He prompted thousands to publicly declare their revived faith. He preached that every individual could be saved through faith and hard work—ideas that strongly appealed to the rising middle class. Because of Finney’s influence, western New Y ork became known as the “burned-over district” for its frequent “hell-and-brimstone” revivals.
Baptists and Methodists In the South and on the western frontier, Baptist 
and Methodist circuit preachers, such as Peter Cartwright, would travel from one location to another and attract thousands to hear their dramatic preaching at outdoor revivals, or camp meetings. These preachers activated the faith of many who had never belonged to a church. By 1850, the Baptists and the Methodists were the largest Protestant denominations in the country.

Camp meetings featured a preacher speaking to a crowd of people who often traveled 
from miles around to attend. The tents in the background provided places for people  to stay if they could not return home at night.
231  TOPIC 4.10   THE SECOND GREAT AWAKENINGNew Denominations
Besides energizing existing denominations, the religious fervor of the time 
fostered the growth of new ones. Two were particularly influential.
Millennialism Much of the religious enthusiasm of the time was based on 
the widespread belief that the world was about to end with the second coming of Jesus. One preacher, William Miller, gained tens of thousands of followers by predicting a specific date (October 21, 1844) for the second coming. Nothing happened on the appointed day, but the Millerites continued as a new Christian denomination, the Seventh-Day Adventists.
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, formerly called the Mormon Church, was founded by Joseph Smith in 1830 in New Y ork. Smith based his beliefs on a book of Scripture—The Book of Mormon —that traced a connection between American Indians 
and the lost tribes of Israel. Smith and his followers, facing persecution, moved to Ohio, then Missouri, and then Illinois. There, Smith was murdered by a local mob. 
To survive, Church members, led by Brigham Y oung, migrated to the 
western frontier. They settled on the banks of the Great Salt Lake in Utah and named their community New Zion . Their cooperative social organization 
helped them prosper in the wilderness. 
However, the Church faced strong opposition because Smith had approved 
the practice of polygamy, allowing a man to have more than one wife. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints officially prohibited polygamy in 1890. It is no longer affiliated with any group that allows it.
Reforms Backed by Religion 
The Second Great Awakening, like the first in the 18th century, caused divisions between the newer evangelical sects and the older Protestant churches throughout the country. But it also touched off several social reform movements, including efforts to reduce drinking, end slavery, and provide better treatment for people with mental illness. Activist religious groups provided both the leadership and the well-organized voluntary societies that drove many reform movements during the antebellum era.

1. “The transformation of American theology in the first quarter of the 
nineteenth century released the very forces of romantic perfectionism that conservatives most feared. . . . As it spread, perfectionism swept across denominational barriers and penetrated even secular thought. . . .
As the sum of individual sins, social wrong would disappear when enough 
people had been converted and rededicated to right conduct. Deep and lasting reform, therefore, meant an educational crusade based on the assumption that when a sufficient number of individual Americans had seen the light, they would automatically solve the country’s social problems. Thus formulated, perfectionist reform offered a program of mass conversion achieved through educational rather than political means. In the opinion of the romantic reformers the regeneration of American society began, not in legislative enactments or political manipulation, but in [an] . . . appeal to the American urge for individual self-improvement. ”
John L. Thomas, historian, Romantic Reform in America, 1815–1865, 1965 
“In the United States, the public sphere formed itself in a void, growing lush from the fertilization of religious and political controversies as its signature forms spread rapidly from city to town and town to village.

An Age of Reform
We would have every path laid open to Woman as freely as to Man . . . .  
As the friend of the Negro assumes that one man cannot by right  
hold another in bondage, so should the friend of Woman assume that 
Man cannot by right lay even well-meant restrictions on Woman.
Margaret Fuller, reformer and activist, 1845
Learning Objective : Explain how and why various reform movements 
developed and expanded from 1800 to 1848.
Several historic reform movements began during the Jacksonian era and 
in the following decades. This period before the Civil War started in 1861 
is known as the antebellum period . During it, a diverse mix of reformers 
dedicated themselves to such causes as establishing free (tax-supported) public schools, improving the treatment of the mentally ill, controlling or ending the sale of alcohol, winning equal rights for women, and abolishing slavery. The enthusiasm for reform had many historic sources: the Puritan sense of mission; the Enlightenment belief in human goodness; the Jacksonian emphasis on democracy; and the changes in relationships among men and women, social classes, and ethnic groups. Religious beliefs were an important source.
Improving Society
Reform movements evolved during the antebellum era. At first, the leaders of reform hoped to improve people’s behavior through moral persuasion, appealing to individuals’ sense of right and wrong. However, after they tried sermons and pamphlets, reformers often moved on to political action and to ideas for creating new institutions to replace the old.
Temperance
The high rate of alcohol consumption (five gallons of hard liquor per person in 1820) prompted reformers to target alcohol as a cause of crime, poverty, abuse of women, and other social ills. Temperance became the most popular of the reform movements.
The temperance movement began by using moral exhortation. In 1826, 
Protestant ministers and others concerned with drinking and its effects founded the American Temperance Society. The society tried to persuade drinkers 
to take a pledge of total abstinence. In 1840, a group of recovering alcoholics 
235  TOPIC 4.11   A N AGE OF REFORMformed the Washingtonians and argued that alcoholism was a disease that 
needed practical, helpful treatment. By the 1840s, various temperance societies together had more than a million members.
German and Irish immigrants were largely opposed to the temperance 
campaign. But they lacked the political power to prevent state and city governments from passing reforms. Factory owners and politicians joined with the reformers when it became clear that temperance measures could increase workers’ output on the job. In 1851, the state of Maine went beyond simply placing taxes on the sale of liquor and became the first state to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors. Twelve states followed within a decade. However, in the 1850s, the issue of slavery came to overshadow the temperance movement. The movement would gain strength again in the late 1870s, with strong support from the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. It would achieve national success with the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1919, which banned the sale of intoxicating liquors.
Movement for Public Asylums
Humanitarian reformers of the 1820s and 1830s called attention to the increasing numbers of criminals, emotionally disturbed persons, and paupers. Often these people were forced to live in wretched conditions and were regularly either abused or neglected by their caretakers. To alleviate the suffering of these individuals, reformers proposed setting up new public institutions—state-supported prisons, mental hospitals, and poorhouses. Reformers hoped that inmates would be cured as a result of being withdrawn from squalid surroundings and treated to a disciplined pattern of life in some rural setting.
Mental Hospitals Dorothea Dix, a former schoolteacher from 
Massachusetts, was horrified to find mentally ill persons locked up with convicted criminals in unsanitary cells. She launched a cross-country crusade, publicizing the awful treatment she had witnessed. In the 1840s, one state legislature after another built new mental hospitals or improved existing institutions and mental patients began receiving professional treatment.
Schools for Blind and Deaf Persons Two other reformers founded 
special institutions to help people with physical disabilities. Thomas Gallaudet opened a school for the deaf, and Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe started a school for the blind. By the 1850s, special schools modeled after the work of these reformers had been established in many states of the Union.
Prisons Pennsylvania took the lead in prison reform, building new prisons 
called penitentiaries  to take the place of crude jails. Reformers placed prisoners 
in solitary confinement to force them to reflect on their sins and repent. The experiment was dropped because of the high rate of prisoner suicides. These prison reforms reflected a major doctrine of the asylum movement: structure and discipline would bring about moral reform. A similar penal experiment, the Auburn system in New Y ork, enforced rigid rules of discipline while also 
providing moral instruction and work programs.
236 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONPublic Education
Another reform movement started in the Jacksonian era focused on the need 
for establishing free public schools for children of all classes. Middle-class reformers were motivated in part by their fears for the future of the republic posed by growing numbers of the uneducated poor—both immigrant and native-born. Workers’ groups in the cities generally supported the reformers’ campaign for free (tax-supported) schools.
Free Common Schools Horace Mann was the leading advocate of the 
common (public) school movement. As secretary of the newly founded Massachusetts Board of Education, Mann worked for compulsory attendance for all children, a longer school year, and increased teacher preparation. In the 1840s, the movement for public schools spread rapidly to other states.
Moral Education  Mann and other educational reformers wanted 
children to learn not only basic literacy, but also moral principles. Toward this end, William Holmes McGuffey, a Pennsylvania teacher, created a series of elementary textbooks that became widely used to teach reading and morality. The McGuffey readers extolled the virtues of hard work, punctuality, and 
sobriety—the kind of behaviors needed in an emerging industrial society.
Many public schools reflected the Protestant beliefs of the majority of 
community residents. In response, Roman Catholics founded private schools for the instruction of Catholic children.
Higher Education  The religious enthusiasm of the Second Great 
Awakening helped fuel the growth of private colleges. Beginning in the 1830s, various Protestant denominations founded small denominational colleges, especially in the newer western states (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa). Several new colleges, including Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts (founded by Mary Lyon in 1837) and Oberlin College in Ohio, began to admit women. Adult education was furthered by lyceum lecture societies, which brought speakers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson to small-town audiences.
Changes in Families and Roles for Women
American society was still overwhelmingly rural in the mid-19th century. But in the growing cities, the impact of the Industrial Revolution was redefining the family. Industrialization reduced the economic value of children. In middle-class families, birth control was used to reduce average family size, which declined from 7.04 family members in 1800 to 5.42 in 1830. Affluent women now had the leisure time to devote to organizations based on religion or moral uplift. The New Y ork Female Moral Reform Society, for example, helped impoverished young women avoid being forced into lives of prostitution.
Cult of Domesticity Industrialization also changed roles within families. 
In traditional farm families, men were the moral leaders. However, when men took jobs outside the home to work for salaries or wages in an office or a factory, they were absent most of the time. As a result, the women in these households who remained at home took charge of the household and children. 
237  TOPIC 4.11   A N AGE OF REFORMThe idealized view of women as moral leaders in the home is called the cult of 
domesticity .
Women’s Rights Women reformers, especially those involved in the 
antislavery movement, resented the way men relegated them to secondary roles in the movement. For example, men prevented women from taking part fully in policy discussions. Among the women who spoke out against discrimination was Sarah Grimké in Letters on the Equality of the Sexes, and the Condition of Women  (1838). Sarah and her sister, Angelina Grimké, were 
among the leaders opposing slavery. Another pair of reformers, Lucretia Mott  
and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, began campaigning for women’s rights after they 
had been barred from speaking at an antislavery convention.
Seneca Falls Convention (1848) The leading feminists met at Seneca 
Falls, New Y ork, in 1848. At the conclusion of their convention—the first women’s rights convention in American history—they issued a document closely modeled after the Declaration of Independence. Their “Declaration of Sentiments” declared that “all men and women are created equal” and listed women’s grievances against laws and customs that discriminated against them.
Following the Seneca Falls Convention, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan 
B. Anthony led the campaign for equal voting, legal, and property rights for women. In the 1850s, however, the issue of women’s rights was overshadowed by the crisis over slavery.
Antislavery Movement
Opponents of slavery ranged from moderates who proposed gradual abolition to radicals who demanded immediate abolition without compensating their owners. The Second Great Awakening led many Christians to view slavery as a sin. This moral view made compromise with defenders of slavery difficult.
American Colonization Society The idea of transporting those people 
freed from slavery to an African colony was first tried in 1817 with the founding of the American Colonization Society. This appealed to some opponents of slavery. It also appealed to many White Americans who wanted to remove all free Black Americans from U.S. society. In 1822, the American Colonization Society established an African American settlement in Monrovia, Liberia. Colonization never proved practical. For the most part, free African Americans did not want to leave the land where they and their ancestors had been born. Between 1820 and 1860, only about 12,000 African Americans moved to Africa, while the enslaved population grew by 2.5 million.
American Antislavery Society In 1831, William Lloyd Garrison began 
publication of an abolitionist newspaper, The Liberator, an event that marks the 
beginning of the radical abolitionist movement. The uncompromising Garrison advocated immediate abolition of slavery in every state and territory without compensating the slaveowners. In 1833, Garrison and other abolitionists founded the American Antislavery Society. Garrison stepped up his attacks by condemning and burning the Constitution as a proslavery document. He 
238 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONargued for “no Union with slaveholders” until they repented for their sins by 
freeing their slaves.
Liberty Party  Garrison’s radicalism soon led to a split in the abolitionist 
movement. Believing that political action was a more practical route to reform than Garrison’s moral crusade, a group of northerners formed the Liberty Party in 1840. They ran James Birney as their candidate for president in 1840 
and 1844. The party’s one campaign pledge was to bring about the end of slavery by political and legal means.
Black Abolitionists Individuals who had escaped enslavement and free 
African Americans were among the most outspoken and convincing critics of slavery. One who was formerly enslaved, such as Frederick Douglass, could speak about the brutality and degradation of slavery from firsthand experience. An early follower of Garrison, Douglass later advocated both political and direct action to end slavery and racial prejudice. In 1847, he started the antislavery journal The North Star . Other African American leaders, such as 
Harriet Tubman, David Ruggles, Sojourner Truth, and William Still , helped 
organize the effort to assist fugitive slaves escape to free territory in the North or to Canada, where slavery was prohibited.
Violent Abolitionism David Walker and Henry Highland Garnet were 
two northern African Americans who advocated the most radical solution to the slavery question. They argued that those enslaved should take action themselves by rising up in revolt against their owners. In 1831, an enslaved Virginian, Nat Turner, led a revolt in which 55 Whites were killed. In retaliation, 
Whites killed hundreds of African Americans in brutal fashion and put down the revolt. Before this event, there had been some antislavery sentiment and discussion in the South. After the revolt, fear of future uprisings as well as Garrison’s inflamed rhetoric put an end to antislavery talk in the South.
Other Reforms
Efforts to reform individuals and society during the antebellum era also included several smaller movements besides those calling for temperance and abolition:
• The American Peace Society, founded in 1828, had the objective of abolishing war. It actively protested the war with Mexico in 1846.
• Some reformers fought for laws to protect sailors from being flogged. 
• Advocates of dietary reforms, such as eating whole wheat bread or Sylvester Graham’s crackers, wanted to promote good digestion.
• Several women called for dress reform for women so they could move about more easily. For example, Amelia Bloomer called for women to wear pantalettes instead of long skirts.
• One unusual reform was phrenology, a pseudoscience that studied the bumps on a person’s skull to assess the person’s character and ability.

Learning Objective : Explain the continuities and changes in the 
experience of African Americans from 1800 to 1848.
At the outset of the 19th century, many people throughout the nation 
believed and hoped that slavery would gradually disappear. They thought that 
the exhaustion of soil in the coastal lands of Virginia and the Carolinas and the constitutional ban on the importation and enslaving of Africans after 1808 would make slavery economically unfeasible. However, the rapid growth of the cotton industry and the expansion of slavery into new states such as Alabama and Mississippi ended hopes for a quiet end to slavery. As the arguments over the Missouri Compromise suggested, the slavery issue defied easy answers.

242 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONFree African Americans
By 1860, there were approximately 500,000 free African Americans living 
throughout the United States.
In the North The 250,000 African Americans who lived in the North in 
1860 constituted only 1 percent of northerners. However, they represented 50 percent of all free African Americans in the country. Freedom enabled them to maintain a family and, in some instances, own land. In response to discrimination in White-dominated churches, many free African Americans formed their own Christian congregations. Some of these congregations joined together as the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
However, freedom did not mean economic or political equality for African 
Americans, since strong racial prejudices kept them from voting and holding jobs in most skilled professions and crafts. In the mid-1800s, immigrants displaced them from occupations and jobs that they had held since the time of the Revolution. Denied membership in unions, African Americans were often hired as strikebreakers—and often dismissed after the strike ended. 
In the South As many as 250,000 African Americans in the South 
were not enslaved. They were free citizens (even though, as in the North, racial prejudice restricted their liberties). A number of those enslaved had been emancipated during the American Revolution. Some were mulatto children whose White fathers had decided to liberate them. Others achieved freedom on their own, when permitted, through self-purchase—if they were fortunate enough to have been paid wages for extra work, usually as skilled craftspeople. 
Most free southern Blacks lived in cities where they could own property. 
By state law, they were not equal with Whites, were not permitted to vote, and were barred from entering certain occupations. Constantly in danger of being kidnapped by slave traders, they had to show legal papers proving their free status. They remained in the South for various reasons. Some wanted to be near family members who were still in bondage. Others thought of the South as their home and believed the North offered no greater opportunities. 
Resistance by the Enslaved
Conditions of slavery varied from one plantation to the next, but all suffered from being deprived of their freedom. Families could be separated at any time by an owner’s decision to sell a wife, a husband, or a child. Women were vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Despite the hard, nearly hopeless circumstances of their lives, enslaved African Americans maintained a strong sense of family and of religious faith. 
Those enslaved contested their status through a range of actions, including 
restrained resistance, running away, or open rebellion. The search for freedom was continuous and took many forms.
243  TOPIC 4.12    A FRICAN AMERICANS IN THE EARLY REPUBLICRestrained Actions On a daily basis, an untold number of those enslaved 
engaged in work slowdowns and equipment sabotage. What Whites called 
“laziness” in those enslaved was in reality a subtle defiance against their situation.
Runaways For an individual, escape from enslavement was a challenging 
goal. It was even more difficult for women who were caring for their children or pregnant. All escaping faced organized militia patrols and hunters who were paid a bounty for those they captured. Those returned to their owners were normally severely physically mistreated. The growth of the “Underground Railroad” and increasing demands of Southerners for stricter fugitive slave laws (see Topics 4.11, 5.4, 5.5) demonstrate the increasing number of slaves willing to attempt running away despite the risks.
Source: Library of Congress
When Robert Jackson and two other enslaved men from Virginia attempted to escape, they were 
caught in a barn in Maryland. After a violent struggle, they were captured and returned to slavery.
Rebellions While there were few large uprisings instigated by those 
enslaved, their impact on both other enslaved people and on White 
Southerners was considerable. In particularly, the successful slave revolt and the establishment of an independent nation in Haiti in the early 1800s caused consternation among slaveholders in the South. For years Southerners resisted political recognition or any diplomatic interaction with Haiti. 
One of the earliest reported organized efforts to rebel was on a plantation 
near Richmond, Virginia, in 1800. Gabriel Prosser is reputed to have engaged approximately a thousand others enslaved to rise up against their oppressors. Betrayed before they could take action, Gabriel and a number of his followers were executed. 
244 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONAnother notable conspiracy for freedom was organized by Denmark 
Vese y , a free African American, in 1822, near Charleston, South Carolina. 
Vesey and other fellow congregants of a large African Methodist Church that 
included many slaves were reputedly inspired by their readings from the Bible and possibly discussions of the recent Missouri Compromise limiting the spread of slavery. They forged a plan to seize ships in the harbor and sail away to freedom, possibly to Haiti. These efforts were ended by informers before Vesey could act, and he along with over thirty conspirators were hanged.
There is one instance of an uprising by those enslaved that was well known. 
Nat Turner, enslaved in Southampton County, Virginia, in 1831, and considered a religious zealot by some, organized an attack on his surrounding community. In a single day, over 50 White men, women, and children were killed. Reaction was swift, and the militia killed not only Turner and his followers but also many innocent African Americans in reprisal for the rebellion. 
While any efforts at organized rebellions were quickly and violently 
suppressed, they had a lasting influence. They gave hope to enslaved African Americans, drove southern states to tighten already strict slave codes with growing fear, and demonstrated to many the evils of slavery. Revolts polarized the country by making slaveholders more defensive about slavery and nonslaveholders more critical of the institution.

1. “Slaves apparently thought of the South’s peculiar institution chiefly as a 
system of labor extortion. Of course they felt its impact in other ways—in their social status, their legal status, and their private lives—but they felt it most acutely in their lack of control of their own time and labor. . . .
In Africa the Negroes had been accustomed to a strictly regulated 
family life and a rigidly enforced moral code. But in America the disintegration of their social organization removed the traditional sanctions which had encouraged them to respect their old customs. . . . Here, as at so many other points, the slaves had lost their native culture without being able to find a workable substitute and therefore lived in a kind of cultural chaos. . . . Marriage, insisted Frederick Douglass, had no existence among slaves. . . . His consolation was that at least some slaves ‘maintained their honor, where all around was corrupt. ’ ”
Kenneth M. Stampp, historian, The Peculiar Institution, 1956
“We have made a great error in the way in which we have viewed slave life, and this error has been perpetuated by both whites and blacks, racists and antiracists. . . .
What the sources show . . . is that the average plantation slave lived in a 
family setting, developed strong family ties, and held the nuclear family as the proper social norm. . . . We do not know just how many slaves lived as a family or were willing and able to maintain a stable family life during slavery. But the number was certainly great, whatever the percentage, and as a result, the social norm that black people carried from slavery to freedom was that of the nuclear family. . . . There are moments in the history of every people—in which they cannot do more than succeed in keeping themselves together and maintaining themselves as human beings with a sense of individual dignity and collective identity. Slavery was such a moment for black people in America. ”

I never use the word “nation” in speaking of the United States.  
I always use the word “Union” or “Confederacy.” We are not a nation  
but a union, a confederacy of equal and sovereign States.
Senator John C. Calhoun, South Carolina, 1849
Learning Objective : Explain how geographic and environmental factors 
shaped the development of the South from 1800 to 1848.
Initially the English colonies had developed as parts of distinct regions: New 
England, Middle, and Southern. A combination of geography and cultural 
differences among immigrants, compounded by limited contact because of poor transportation, shaped the differences among the regions. As the colonies became states and as transportation improved in the 19th century, the regional distinctions remained, based on a combination of geography and economics. 
The states where slavery was widely practiced formed a distinctive region, 
the South. By 1861, the region included 15 states, all but four of which (Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri) seceded and joined the Confederacy. 
Agriculture and King Cotton
Agriculture was the foundation of the South’s economy, even though by the 1850s, small factories in the region were producing approximately 15 percent of the nation’s manufactured goods. Tobacco, rice, and sugarcane were important cash crops, but these were far exceeded by the South’s chief economic activity: the production and sale of cotton. 
The development of mechanized textile mills in England, coupled with 
Eli Whitney’s  cotton gin, made cotton cloth affordable, not just in Europe 
and the United States, but throughout the world. Before 1860, the world depended chiefly on Britain’s mills for its supply of cloth, and Britain, in turn, depended chiefly on the American South for its supply of cotton fiber. Originally, the cotton was grown almost entirely in two states, South Carolina and Georgia, but as demand and profits increased, planters  moved westward 
into Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. New land was constantly in demand because the high cotton yields desired for profits quickly depleted the soil. By the 1850s, cotton provided two-thirds of all U.S. exports and

Slavery, the “Peculiar Institution”
Wealth in the South was measured in terms of land and enslaved people. The 
latter were treated as a form of property, subject to being bought and sold. However, some Whites were sensitive about how they treated the other humans, so they referred to slavery as “that peculiar institution. ” In colonial times, people justified slavery as an economic necessity, but in the 19th century, apologists for slavery mustered historical and religious arguments to support their claim that it was good for both the enslaved and the master. 
Population  The cotton boom was largely responsible for a fourfold 
increase in the number of people held in slavery, from 1 million in 1800 to nearly 4 million in 1860. Most of the increase came from natural growth, although thousands of Africans were also smuggled into the South in violation of the 1808 law against importing enslaved people. In parts of the Deep 
249  TOPIC 4.13   S OUTHERN SOCIETY IN THE EARLY REPUBLICSouth , enslaved African Americans made up as much as 75 percent of the 
total population. Fearing slave revolts, southern legislatures added increased 
restrictions on movement and education to their slave codes. 
Economics Enslaved workers were employed doing whatever their owners 
demanded of them. Most labored in the fields, but many learned skilled crafts or worked as house servants, in factories, or on construction gangs. Because of the greater profits to be made on the new cotton plantations in the West, many owners in the Upper South sold their enslaved workers to owners in the cotton-rich Deep South of the lower Mississippi Valley. By 1860, the value of an enslaved field hand had risen to almost $2,000 at a time when a typical wage for a laborer was $1 a day. One result of the heavy capital investment in slavery was that the South had much less capital than the North to undertake industrialization. 
White Society
Southern Whites observed a rigid hierarchy among themselves. Aristocratic planters lived comfortably at the top of society, while poor farmers and mountain people struggled at the bottom.
Aristocracy Members of the South’s small elite of wealthy planters owned 
at least 100 enslaved people and at least 1,000 acres. The planter aristocracy maintained its power by dominating the state legislatures of the South and enacting laws that favored the large landholders’ economic interests. 
Farmers The vast majority of slaveholders held fewer than 20 people in 
bondage and worked only several hundred acres. Southern White farmers produced the bulk of the cotton crop, worked in the fields alongside enslaved African Americans, and lived as modestly as farmers of the North. 
Poor Whites Three-fourths of the White households in the South owned 
no enslaved people. They could not afford the rich river-bottom farmland controlled by the planters, and many lived in the hills as subsistence farmers. These “hillbillies” or “poor White trash, ” as planters derisively called them, 
defended the system, hoping that some day they, too, could own enslaved people. Further, the slave system meant that White farmers, no matter how poor, still felt superior on the social scale to Black people. 
Mountain People A number of small farmers lived in frontier conditions 
along the slopes and valleys of the Appalachian and Ozark mountains. They were somewhat isolated from the rest of the South. The mountain people disliked the planters and slavery. During the Civil War, many (including a future president, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee) remained loyal to the Union. 
Cities  The South was an agricultural region with few large commercial 
cities. The largest city in the region was New Orleans, with a population of about 170,000. It was the fifth-largest city in the country, after New Y ork, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston. Only three other southern cities—St. Louis, Louisville, and Charleston—had populations greater than 40,000 people. 
250 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe South developed a unique culture and outlook on life. As cotton became 
the basis of its economy, slavery became the focus of its political thought. 
White southerners felt increasingly isolated and defensive about slavery as northerners grew hostile toward it, and as Great Britain, France, Mexico, and other European and Latin America states outlawed it altogether. 
Code of Chivalry Dominated by the aristocratic planter class, the 
agricultural South was in some ways a feudal society. Southern gentlemen ascribed to a code of chivalrous conduct, which included a strong sense of personal honor, the defense of womanhood, and paternalistic attitudes toward all who were deemed inferior, especially slaves. 
Education  The upper class valued a college education for their children. 
Acceptable professions for gentlemen were limited to farming, law, the ministry, and the military. For the lower classes, schooling beyond the early elementary grades was generally not available. To reduce the risk of slave revolts, the law strictly prohibited teaching enslaved people to read or write. 
Religion The slavery question affected churches. Partly because they 
preached biblical support for slavery, both Methodist and Baptist denominations gained members in the South. However, both groups split into northern and southern branches in the 1840s. The Unitarians, who challenged slavery, faced declining membership and hostility. Even Catholics and Episcopalians, who took a neutral stand on slavery, saw their numbers decline in the South. 
Social Reform The antebellum reform movement of the first half of the 
19th century was largely found in the northern and western states, with little impact in the South. While “modernizers” worked to perfect society in the North, southerners were more committed to tradition and slower to support public education and humanitarian reforms. They were alarmed to see northern reformers join forces to support the antislavery movement. Increasingly, they viewed social reform as a northern threat against the southern way of life.

During the two decades following the end of World War II, Black Americans led a vigorous fight against racial discrimination. In the context of this civil rights movement, historians began to revaluate slavery. 
Features of Slavery Before 1945, scholarship on slavery followed Ulrich 
B. Phillips’s American Negro Slavery (1918). He portrayed slavery as failing economically but maintained by paternalistic White owners who gave civilization to enslaved but contented Black Americans. Most of his views have been entirely discredited. For example, historians demonstrated that owners

“That we have cultivated cotton, cotton, cotton and bought everything else, 
has long enough been our opprobrium [disgrace]. It is time we should be roused by some means or other to see, that such a course of conduct will inevitably terminate in our ultimate poverty and ruin.

We have good land, unlimited water-powers, capital in plenty, and a patriotism which is running over in some places. ”
Georgia Courier, June 21, 1827and enslaved people were in continual conflict. Kenneth Stampp summarized this view in The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South (1956). Two years later, Alfred Conrad and John Meyers published an influential article that provided evidence that slavery was profitable, adding to the argument that the institution would not fade away as it had in most of Latin America. 
Slavery's Impact on Black Culture Historians have bitterly disagreed 
over the legacy of slavery on the culture of African Americans. Stanley Elkins, in Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional Life (1959), argued that slavery 
was so oppressive that no distinctive Black culture could develop. In contrast, Eugene Genovese’s Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made (1974) argued that enslaved African Americans did develop and maintain a culture based on  family life, tradition, and religion. 
Recent scholars have expanded on how enslaved people not only created 
their own culture but found creative ways to resist their condition. Tera W . Hunter's Bound in Wedlock: Slave and Free Black Marriage in the Nineteenth 
Century (2017) highlighted how enslaved people developed long-term 
relationships, despite obstacles to traditional marriage created by their owners.

Topic 4.14
Causation in Period 4
Learning Objective : Explain the extent to which politics, economics,  
and foreign policy promoted the development of American identity from 
1800 to 1848.
You can use the reasoning skill “causation” with the content of Period 4 to 
consider the extent to which politics, economics, and foreign policy influenced 
the development of American identity between 1800 and 1848. By examining the relationships among the pieces of historical evidence, one can develop an 
argument to explain how the rise of one political party, Democratic-Republicans, was connected to the fall of another, the Federalists. These developments caused people to use political parties to express their American identity. 
In economics, the development of new means of transportation led to the 
market revolution. The shift toward a market economy caused people to change how they thought of themselves. They identified as producers of goods to sell others and as workers for others, and they took pride in being industrious. The market revolution also influenced foreign policy. People looked to territorial expansion such as the Louisiana Purchase to provide new opportunities. They focused on the west and away from foreign involvements. 
While the historical evidence relates to the coalescence of a stronger 
American identity, this same evidence shows a people with growing differences resulting from new religious and cultural ideas. These differences were particularly sharp over the place of slavery in the growing nation.
QUESTIONS ABOUT CAUSATION
Use the questions below to make a historically defensible claim.
1. Explain the factors that caused the expansion of participation in politics, including the right to vote. For example, as new states were formed on the western frontier, they embraced the ideal of equality for all White males and adopted universal male suffrage as well as nominating conventions to limit the power of any elite group.
2. Explain the developments in technology, agriculture, and commerce that caused the market revolution during the period from 1800 to 1848. For example, technological innovations that produced a canal system, steamboats, and railroads tied together the cities and farms and thus enabled the development of the market system. 
254 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:  CLAIMS AND EVIDENCE IN SOURCES
When analyzing sources, you need to identify the author’s argument. Then 
you need to weigh the evidence used to support it. To a historian, an effective argument is a historically defensible claim backed up with reasons and evidence that are logical and relevant. Breaking the tasks down into steps makes it easier: 
• Identify the argument. What claim is the source making? What position 
is the source taking about a person, event, or issue?
• Identify the evidence. What information does the source use to support 
the argument? Are there facts, statistics, quotations, details, or images? Consider whether this information directly relates to the argument.
• Compare arguments. Historians and witnesses to history often have 
conflicting opinions about any individual, event, or issue. Which arguments have more evidence? Which arguments have higher-quality evidence?
The AP® exam includes long essay questions and a document-based 
question that ask you to develop an argument. Some short-answer items and some multiple-choice items also relate to claims and evidence in sources.

WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  GATHER AND ORGANIZE THE EVIDENCE
After analyzing the task and developing questions you need to answer to 
complete it (see page 157), the next step in writing a long essay is to gather and organize your evidence. Gathering evidence  relies on recall—how much 
you remember from your reading and other studies. Organizing evidence requires the skills of seeing patterns and connections and using historical reasoning. 
Suppose you are answering this long essay question: “Evaluate the extent 
to which the American Revolution was primarily an effort to maintain basic British rights. Make a list of questions for deeper analysis (see page 157), and answer them. In doing so, you should list the information you will use in your essay to answer the question. Y our essay might include the following: 
• British rights included beliefs about taxation, such as the difference between direct and indirect taxation.
• Colonists believed that as British citizens, they had certain individual liberty and restraints on government.
• Colonists felt that the British had ignored or violated these rights.
• Colonists often traded goods with non-British colonies and countries in violation of British laws. The right to smuggle was not a basic British right, but it was a custom that colonists wanted to defend.
• Colonists had gone further than the British in recognizing press freedom (the Zenger case) and religious toleration. 
After writing everything you can remember, organize your evidence. Review your notes, looking for patterns related to the task. Which pieces of evidence represent a continuity, a way to preserve British rights? Which represent a change from how British rights were traditionally interpreted? Make a simple chart to place the evidence in the correct category. Then evaluate the extent to which change outweighed continuity or vice versa. 
Application: On a separate sheet of paper, expand on the evidence you recall 
about colonial attitudes regarding basic British rights by adding notes to the above list. Then make a chart like the one below. Place each piece of evidence in the appropriate column.

I have favored this Missouri Compromise, believing it to be all that could be effected under the present Constitution, and from extreme unwillingness to put the Union at hazard. But perhaps it would have been a wiser as well as a bolder course to have persisted in the restriction upon Missouri, till it should have ter -
minated in a convention of the States to revise and amend the Constitution. This would have produced a new Union of thirteen or fourteen States, unpolluted with slavery, with a great and glorious object to effect, namely, that of rallying to their standard the other States by the universal emancipation of their slaves. If the Union must be dissolved, slavery is precisely the question upon which it ought to break. For the present, however, this contest is laid asleep.

UNIT 5 — Period 5: 1844–1877
Topic 5.1
Contextualizing Period 5
Learning Objective : Explain the context in which sectional conflict 
emerged from 1844 to 1877.
Between 1844 and 1877, the United States expanded its territory to the 
Pacific Ocean and suffered from rising sectionalism over the issue of expanding 
slavery into this new territory. In 1861, tensions exploded into the Civil War that permanently expanded the power of the federal government. After four years of fighting and the death of 750,000 people, the country emerged with a “new birth of freedom” as a result of the end of slavery. But racism remained. 
The first half of the 19th century included many advances in the young 
nation. Political, demographic, economic, and territorial development changed the country. The right to vote expanded political participation. New technology and transportation combined to support a market revolution that altered the relationships between peoples in the different regions. Reforms in education and other areas improved life. New expressions in art and literature signified an emergent American culture. Y et these advancements were not shared by all, and challenges, particularly over foreign affairs and slavery, remained.
Growth in Land and Population Between 1844 and 1877, the United 
States expanded westward, with many citizens believing it had a destiny to control all the land to the Pacific Ocean. The country added land through negotiations, purchase, and war. The largest acquisition came from the Mexican War, through which the United States established its southern border and claimed ports on the Pacific. 
This rapid expansion attracted new immigrants, who left Europe because 
of famine, poverty, and political turmoil. In response to immigration, particularly of people from Ireland and China, some native-born Americans argued against citizenship for new residents. This resulted in the forming of political organizations to restrict immigration and citizenship.
Political Conflicts over Slavery Expansion and sectionalism also 
intensified differences over politics, economics, and, most seriously, slavery. Slaveowners became more insistent on their right to own enslaved people and argued for strong federal laws to return enslaved people who escaped bondage. Abolitionists became more insistent on ending slavery. Free-Soilers argued that the institution should not be allowed into the territories. Opponents of 
261  TOPIC 5.1   C ONTE xTUALIz ING PERIOD 5slavery organized an “underground railroad” to help fugitives escape from 
slavery. Congress passed a series of compromises attempting to settle the issue of whether slavery could expand into new territories. 
The Civil War and Reconstruction Then, in 1860, the Republicans 
nominated Abraham Lincoln for president. Though opposed to slavery, he also opposed immediate abolition. Still, his election frightened slaveholders. They feared that, despite his pledge to allow slavery to continue where it existed, his opposition to the expansion of slavery would lead to its eventual end. Eleven states left the Union, and a four-year civil war ravaged the country.
The Union victory ended slavery and shifted power to the federal  
government from the states. The 12 years after the war, known as Reconstruction, were marked by conflict. It was a period of fierce confrontations between the executive and legislative branches and between the federal and state governments. These confrontations reshaped how people thought about federalism and the separation of powers among the branches of government. 
Racism and Discrimination Further, the country suffered from 
tremendous racial conflict. As the freed African Americans worked to established new lives, White-dominated legislatures passed Black Codes that restricted the basic rights of Black citizens. In place of slavery, a new labor system known as sharecropping emerged that kept Black farmers in conditions almost as subservient to White landowners as slavery had. Finally, White Americans attempting to maintain racial supremacy killed thousands of Black citizens. 
While the Civil War preserved the Union, historians vigorously debate the 
successes and failures of Reconstruction. In the future, the nation that survived a civil war would continue to grow, expand, and industrialize. Further, it would continue to struggle over achieving equal treatment for all of its people.

Topic 5.2
The Idea of Manifest Destiny
Away, away with all these cobweb issues of the rights of discovery, 
exploration, settlement, contiguity [nearness], etc. . . . [The American] 
claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess 
the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the 
development of the great experiment of liberty.
John L. O’Sullivan, “The True Title,”  New York Morning News, 1845
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of westward 
expansion from 1844 to 1877.
W hile European settlers began assuming a right to territorial conquest 
during the colonial era, writers such as John O’Sullivan promoted that idea 
across the land in the 1840s and 1850s. Expansionists wanted the United States to extend westward to the Pacific and southward into Mexico, Cuba, and Central America. By the 1890s, expansionists fixed their sights on acquiring islands in the Pacific and the Caribbean. 
The phrase Manifest Destiny expressed the popular belief that the United 
States had a divine mission to extend its power and civilization across the breadth of North America. (For a map showing the territorial expansion of the United States, see the multiple-choice questions in Topic 5.3.) Enthusiasm for expansion reached a fever pitch in the 1840s. It was driven by a number of forces: nationalism, population increase, rapid economic development, technological advances, and reform ideals. But not all Americans united behind expansionism. Critics argued vehemently that at the root of the expansionist drive was the ambition to spread slavery into western lands.
Conflicts Over Texas, Maine, and Oregon
U.S. interest in pushing its borders south into Texas (a Mexican province) and west into the Oregon Territory (claimed by Britain) largely resulted from American pioneers migrating into these lands during the 1820s and 1830s. 
Texas
In 1823, after having won its national independence from Spain, Mexico hoped to attract settlers—including Anglo settlers—to farm its sparsely populated northern frontier province of Texas. Moses Austin, a Missouri banker, had obtained a large land grant in Texas but died before he could recruit American 
263  TOPIC 5.2   THE IDEA OF MANIFEST DESTINYsettlers for the land. His son, Stephen Austin, succeeded in bringing 300 
families into Texas and thereby beginning a steady migration of American settlers into the vast frontier territory. By 1830, Americans (both White farmers and enslaved Black people) outnumbered Mexicans in Texas by three to one.
Friction between the Americans and the Mexicans worsened in 1829 when 
Mexico outlawed slavery and required all immigrants to convert to Roman Catholicism. Many settlers refused to obey these laws. In reaction, Mexico closed Texas to additional American immigrants. Land-hungry Americans from the Southern states ignored the Mexican prohibition and streamed into Texas by the thousands.
Revolt and Independence A change in Mexico’s government intensified 
the conflict. In 1834, General Antonio López de Santa Anna made himself dictator of Mexico and abolished that nation’s federal system of government. When Santa Anna attempted to enforce Mexico’s laws in Texas, a group of American settlers led by Sam Houston revolted and declared Texas an 
independent republic in March 1836. In its new constitution, Texas made slavery legal again.
A Mexican army led by Santa Anna captured the town of Goliad and 
attacked the Alamo in San Antonio, killing every one of its American defenders. Shortly afterward, however, at the Battle of the San Jacinto River, an army under Sam Houston caught the Mexicans by surprise and captured their general, Santa Anna. Under the threat of death, the Mexican leader was forced to sign a treaty that recognized independence for Texas and granted the new republic all territory north of the Rio Grande. However, when the news of San Jacinto reached Mexico City, the Mexican legislature rejected the treaty and insisted that Texas was still part of Mexico.
Annexation Denied As the first president of the Republic of Texas (or 
Lone Star Republic), Houston applied to the U.S. government for his country to be annexed, or added to, the United States as a new state. However, presidents Jackson and Van Buren both put off the request for annexation primarily because of political opposition among Northerners to the expansion of slavery. If annexed, Texas might be divided into five new states, which could mean ten additional proslavery members of the U.S. Senate. The threat of a costly war with Mexico also dampened expansionist zeal. The next president, William Henry Harrison, died after a month in office. His successor, John Tyler (1841–1845), was a Southern Whig who was worried about the growing influence of the British in Texas. He worked to annex Texas, but the U.S. Senate rejected his treaty of annexation in 1844.
Boundary Dispute in Maine
Another diplomatic issue arose in the 1840s over the ill-defined boundary between Maine and the Canadian province of New Brunswick. At this time, Canada was still under British rule and many Americans regarded Britain as their country’s most significant enemy—an attitude carried over from the 
264 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONRevolution and the War of 1812. A conflict between rival groups of lumber 
workers on the Maine-Canadian border erupted into open fighting. Known as the Aroostook War, or “battle of the maps, ” the conflict was soon resolved in a treaty negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster and the British ambassador, Lord Alexander Ashburton. In the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842, the disputed territory was split between Maine and British Canada. The treaty also settled the boundary of the Minnesota territory, leaving what proved to be the iron-rich Mesabi Range on the U.S. side of the border.
Boundary Dispute in Oregon
A far more serious British-American dispute involved Oregon, a vast territory on the Pacific Coast that originally stretched as far north as the Alaskan border. At one time, this territory was claimed by four different nations: Spain, Russia, Great Britain, and the United States. Spain gave up its claim to Oregon in a treaty with the United States (the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819).
Britain based its claim to Oregon on the Hudson’s Bay Company’s profitable 
fur trade with the American Indians of the Pacific Northwest. However, by 1846, fewer than a thousand British settlers lived north of the Columbia River.
The United States based its claim on (1) the exploration of the Columbia 
River by Captain Robert Gray in 1792; (2) the overland expedition to the Pacific Coast by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1805; and (3) the fur trading post and fort in Astoria, Oregon, established by John Jacob Astor in 1811. Protestant missionaries and farmers from the United States settled in the Willamette Valley in the 1840s. Their success in farming this fertile valley caused 5,000 Americans to catch “Oregon fever” and travel 2,000 miles over the Oregon Trail to settle in the area south of the Columbia River.
By the 1844 election, many Americans believed that taking undisputed 
possession of all of Oregon and annexing the Republic of Texas was their country’s Manifest Destiny. In addition, expansionists hoped to persuade Mexico to give up its province on the West Coast—the huge land of California. By 1845, Mexican California had a small Spanish-Mexican population of some 7,000 along with a much larger number of American Indians, but American emigrants were arriving in sufficient numbers “to play the Texas game. ”
The Election of 1844
The possibility of annexing Texas and allowing the expansion of slavery split the Democratic Party in 1844. The party’s Northern wing opposed immediate annexation and wanted to nominate former president Martin Van Buren to run again. Southern Whigs who were proslavery and proannexation rallied behind former vice president John C. Calhoun of South Carolina as a candidate. 
The Van Buren-Calhoun dispute deadlocked the Democratic convention. 
After hours of wrangling, the Democrats finally nominated a dark horse  
(lesser-known candidate). They chose James K. Polk of Tennessee, a protegé of Andrew Jackson, who was firmly committed to Manifest Destiny. Polk favored 
265  TOPIC 5.2   THE IDEA OF MANIFEST DESTINYthe annexation of Texas, the acquisition of California, and the “reoccupation” 
of Oregon Territory all the way to the border with Russian Alaska at latitude 54° 40´. The Democratic slogan of “Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!” appealed strongly to American Westerners and Southerners who were in an expansionist mood. 
Henry Clay of Kentucky, the Whig nominee, attempted to straddle the 
controversial issue of Texas annexation, opposing it and then supporting it. This strategy alienated a group of voters in New Y ork State, who abandoned the Whig Party to support the antislavery Liberty Party (see Topic 4. 11). In a close election, the Whigs’ loss of New Y ork’s electoral votes proved decisive and Polk, the Democratic dark horse, was the victor. The Democrats interpreted the election as a mandate to add Texas to the Union.
Annexing Texas and Dividing Oregon
Outgoing president John Tyler took the election of Polk as a signal to push the annexation of Texas through Congress. Instead of seeking Senate approval of a treaty that would have required a two-thirds vote, Tyler persuaded both houses of Congress to pass a joint resolution for annexation. This procedure required only a simple majority of each house. Tyler left Polk with the problem of dealing with Mexico’s reaction to annexation.
On the Oregon question, Polk decided to back down from his party’s 
bellicose campaign slogan. Instead of fighting for 54° 40´, he signed an agreement with the British to divide the Oregon territory at the 49th parallel (the parallel that had been established as the northern border in 1818 for the Louisiana Territory). Final settlement of the issue was delayed until the United States agreed to grant Vancouver Island and the right to navigate the Columbia River to Britain. In June 1846, the treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Some Northerners viewed the treaty as a sellout to Southern interests because it removed British Columbia as a source of potential free states. Nevertheless, by this time war had broken out between the United States and Mexico. Not wanting to fight both Britain and Mexico, Senate opponents of the treaty reluctantly voted for the compromise settlement.
Settlement of the Western Territories 
Following the peaceful acquisition of Oregon and the more violent acquisition of California (see Topic 5.3), the migration of Americans into these lands increased. The arid region between the Mississippi Valley and the Pacific Coast was popularly known in the 1850s and 1860s as the Great American Desert. Emigrants passed quickly over this vast area to reach the more inviting lands on the West Coast. Therefore, California and Oregon were settled several decades before people attempted to farm the Great Plains.
Fur Traders’ Frontier
Fur traders known as mountain men were the earliest nonnative individuals to open the Far West. In the 1820s, they held yearly rendezvous in the Rockies with 
266 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONAmerican Indians to trade for animal skins. James Beckwourth, Jim Bridger, 
Kit Carson, and Jedediah Smith were among the hardy band of explorers and trappers who provided much of the early information about trails and frontier conditions to later settlers.
Overland Trails
After the mountain men, a much larger group of pioneers made the hazardous journey west in hopes of clearing the forests and farming the fertile valleys of California and Oregon. By 1860, hundreds of thousands had reached their westward goal by following the Oregon, California, Santa Fe, and Mormon trails. The long and arduous trek usually began in St. Joseph or Independence, Missouri, or in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and followed the river valleys through the Great Plains. Inching along at only 15 miles a day, a wagon train needed months to finally reach the foothills of the Rockies or face the hardships of the southwestern deserts. The final life-or-death challenge was to get through the mountain passes of the Sierras and Cascades before the first heavy snow. While pioneers feared attacks by American Indians, the most common and serious dangers were disease and depression from the harsh everyday conditions on the trail.

267  TOPIC 5.2   THE IDEA OF MANIFEST DESTINYMining Frontier
The discovery of gold in California in 1848 set off the first of many migrations 
to mineral-rich mountains of the West in the 1800s. Gold or silver rushes occurred in Colorado, Nevada, the Black Hills of the Dakotas, and other western territories. The mining boom brought tens of thousands of men and some women into the western mountains. Mining camps and towns—many of them short-lived—sprang up wherever a strike (discovery) was reported. Largely as a result of the gold rush, California’s population soared from a mere 14,000 in 1848 to 380,000 by 1860. Booms attracted miners from around the world. By the 1860s, almost one-third of the miners in the West were Chinese.
Farming Frontier
Most pioneer families moved west to start homesteads and begin farming. Congress’s Preemption Acts of the 1830s and 1840s gave squatters the right to settle public lands and purchase them for low prices once the government put them up for sale. In addition, the government made it easier for settlers by offering parcels of land as small as 40 acres for sale.
However, moving west was not for the poor. At a time when a typical 
laborer made about $1.00 per day, a family needed at least $200 to $300 to make the overland trip. The trek to California and Oregon was largely a middle-class movement.
The isolation of the frontier made life for pioneers especially difficult 
during the first years, but rural communities soon developed. The institutions that the people established (schools, churches, clubs, and political parties) were modeled after those that they had known in the East or, for immigrants from abroad, in their native lands.
Urban Frontier
Western cities that arose as a result of railroads, mineral wealth, and farming attracted a number of professionals and business owners. For example, San Francisco and Denver became instant cities created by the gold and silver rushes. Salt Lake City grew because it offered fresh supplies to travelers on overland trails for the balance of their westward journey.
Foreign Commerce
The growth in manufactured goods as well as in agricultural products (both Western grains and Southern cotton) caused a large growth of exports and imports. Other factors also played a role in the expansion of U.S. trade in the mid-1800s:
1. Shipping firms encouraged trade and travel across the Atlantic by establishing a regular schedule for departures instead of the 18th-century policy of waiting to sail until a ship was full.
268 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION2. The demand for whale oil to light the homes of middle-class Americans 
caused a whaling boom between 1830 and 1860. New England merchants took the lead in this industry.
3. Improvements in ship design came just in time to speed gold seekers on their journey to the California gold fields. The development of the American clipper ship cut the six-month trip from New Y ork around the Horn of South America to San Francisco to as little as 89 days.
4. Steamships took the place of clipper ships in the mid-1850s because they had greater storage capacity, could be maintained at lower cost, and followed a schedule more reliably.
5. The United States expanded trade to Asia. New England merchants conducted profitable trade with China for tea, silk, and porcelain. The government sent Commodore Matthew C. Perry and a small fleet of naval ships to Japan, which had been closed to most foreigners for over two centuries. In 1854, Perry pressured Japan’s government to sign the Kanagawa Treaty, which allowed U.S. vessels to enter two Japanese ports to take on coal. This treaty soon led to a trade agreement.
Expansion After the Civil War
From 1855 until 1870, the issues of union, slavery, civil war, and postwar reconstruction would overshadow the drive to acquire new territory. Even so, Manifest Destiny continued to be an important force for shaping U.S. policy. In 1867, for example, Secretary of State William Seward succeeded in purchasing Alaska at a time when the nation was just recovering from the Civil War.

[hostility], and high idealism. Without question, there were those who proclaimed America’s providential mission to expand as a eulogistic [honorary] cover for speculation in land and paper. But those were hardly the motives of John L. O’Sullivan, the writer who coined the term . . . . For O’Sullivan and his allies, the expansionist imperative was essentially democratic . . . in a supercharged moral sense, stressing America’s duties to spread democratic values and institutions to a world still dominated by monarchs and deformed superstitions. ’”

“O’Sullivan and Y oung America provided a . . . set of aspirations that could be embraced by expansionists with less lofty ambitions . . . .

271  TOPIC 5.3    MANIFEST DESTINY AND THE ME xICAN –AMERICAN WAR
Topic 5.3 
Manifest Destiny and 
the Mexican–American War
The Southern rebellion was largely the outgrowth of the Mexican war.
Ulysses S. Grant, Personal Memoirs of General U.S. Grant, 1885
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the Mexican–
American War.
The U.S. annexation of Texas quickly led to diplomatic trouble with Mexico. 
The Mexicans’ anger over the annexation and the newly elected President Polk’s 
desire to expand the nation to the Pacific Ocean combined to bring both sides to the edge of war.
Conflict with Mexico
Upon taking office in 1845, President Polk dispatched John Slidell as his special envoy to the government in Mexico City. Polk wanted Slidell to (1) persuade Mexico to sell the California and New Mexico territories to the United States and (2) settle the disputed Mexico-Texas border. Slidell’s mission failed on both counts. The Mexican government refused to sell California and insisted that Texas’s southern border was on the Nueces River. Polk and Slidell asserted that the border lay farther to the south, along the Rio Grande.
Immediate Causes of the War
While Slidell waited for Mexico’s response to the U.S. offer, Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to move his army toward the Rio Grande, across 
territory claimed by Mexico. On April 24, 1846, a Mexican army crossed the Rio Grande and captured an American army patrol, killing 11. Polk used the incident to justify sending his prepared war message to Congress. Northern Whigs opposed going to war over the incident and doubted Polk’s claim that American blood had been shed on American soil. Whig protests were in vain. A large majority in both houses approved the war resolution. 
Military Campaigns
Most of the war was fought in Mexican territory by small armies of Americans. Leading a force that never exceeded 1,500, General Stephen Kearney succeeded in taking the New Mexico territory and southern California. Backed by only 
272 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONseveral dozen soldiers, a few navy officers, and American civilians who had 
recently settled in northern California, John C. Frémont quickly overthrew Mexican rule in the region in June 1846. He proclaimed California to be an independent republic. Because the new republic’s flag included a California grizzly bear, it became known as the Bear Flag Republic.
Meanwhile, Zachary Taylor’s force of 6,000 men drove the Mexican army 
from Texas, crossed the Rio Grande into northern Mexico, and won a major victory at Buena Vista (February 1847). President Polk then selected General Winfield Scott to invade central Mexico. The army of 14,000 under Scott’s command succeeded in taking the coastal city of Vera Cruz and then captured Mexico City in September 1847. 
Consequences of the War
For Mexico, the war was a military disaster from the start, but the Mexican government was unwilling to sue for peace and concede the loss of its northern lands. Finally, after the fall of Mexico City, the government had little choice but to agree to U.S. terms.
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) The treaty negotiated by diplomat 
Nicholas Trist with Mexico consisted of terms favorable to the United States:
• Mexico recognized the Rio Grande as the southern border of Texas.
• The United States took possession of the former Mexican provinces of California and New Mexico—the Mexican Cession. For these territories, the United States paid $15 million and assumed responsibility for any claims of American citizens against Mexico.
In the Senate, some Whigs opposed the treaty because they saw the war as 
an immoral effort to expand slavery. A few Southern Democrats disliked the treaty for opposite reasons. As expansionists, they wanted the United States to take all of Mexico. Since this land was south of the line established in the Missouri Compromise dividing slave and free territory, it was a region where slavery could expand into. Nevertheless, the treaty was finally ratified in the Senate.
Wilmot Proviso The issue of slavery made the U.S. entry into a war with 
Mexico controversial from start to finish. In 1846, Pennsylvania Congressman David Wilmot proposed that an appropriations bill be amended to forbid slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico. This prohibition appealed to many voters and lawmakers who wanted to preserve the land for White settlers and protect them from having to compete with enslaved labor. The Wilmot Proviso, as it was called, passed the House, where the populous Northern states had greater power, twice. Both times, it was defeated in the Senate, where Southern states had greater influence.
Prelude to Civil War? By increasing tensions between the North and the 
South, did the war to acquire territories from Mexico lead inevitably to the American Civil War? Without question, the acquisition of vast western lands 
273  TOPIC 5.3    MANIFEST DESTINY AND THE ME xICAN –AMERICAN WARdid renew the sectional debate over the extension of slavery. Many Northerners 
viewed the war with Mexico as part of a Southern plot to extend the “slave power. ” Southerners realized they could not count on Northerners to accept the expansion of slavery. The Wilmot Proviso was the first round in an escalating political conflict that led ultimately, though not inevitably, to civil war.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WHY WAS MANIFEST DESTINY 
SIGNIFICANT?
Traditional historians stressed the accomplishments of westward expansion in bringing civilization and democratic institutions to a wilderness area. The heroic efforts of mountain men and pioneering families to overcome a hostile environment have long been celebrated by historians and the popular media.
Attitudes about Race As a result of the civil rights movement of the 1950s 
and 1960s and the continuing diversification of American society, historians became more sensitive than their predecessors to racist language and beliefs. They recognized the racial undercurrents in the political speeches of the 1840s that argued for expansion into American Indian, Mexican, and Central American territories. 
Some historians argue that racist motives prompted the decision to 
withdraw U.S. troops from Mexico instead of occupying it. They point out that Americans who opposed the idea of keeping Mexico had asserted that it was undesirable to incorporate large non-Anglo populations into the republic.
Diverse Contributions Recent historians have broadened their research 
into westward movement. Rather than concentrating on the achievements of Anglo pioneers, they have focused more on these topics: (1) the impact on American Indians whose lands were taken, (2) the influence of Mexican culture on U.S. culture, (3) the contributions of African American and Asian American pioneers, and (4) the role of women in the development of western family and community life.
The Impact on Mexico Some Mexican historians point out that the Treaty 
of Guadalupe Hidalgo took half of Mexico’s territory. They argue that the war of 1846 gave rise to a number of long-standing economic and political problems that have impeded Mexico’s development as a modern nation.
Economics over Race Some historians argue that the war with Mexico, 
especially the taking of California, was motivated by imperialism rather than by racism. They argue that the United States had commercial ambitions in the Pacific and wanted California as a base for trade with China and Japan. U.S. policy makers were afraid that California would fall into the hands of Great Britain or another European power if the United States did not move in first.
Support an Argument Explain two perspectives on either causes or effects of the 
belief in Manifest Destiny important during the 19th century.

276 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION
Topic 5.4 
The Compromise of 1850
I owe a paramount allegiance to the whole Union— 
a subordinate one to my own State.
Senator Henry Clay, Kentucky, July 22, 1850
Learning Objective : Explain the similarities and differences in how 
regional attitudes affected federal policy in the period after the  
Mexican–American War.
M anifest Destiny and expansion intensified the debate about the spread of 
slavery. Abolitionists and White people eager to settle Western lands without 
the competition of slave labor opposed expansion. Slaveowners and people who felt they benefited from slavery wanted the continued growth of slavery. At the same time, most Americans still hoped for compromise that could keep the Union together.
Southern Expansion
Many Southerners resented the Missouri Compromise because it barred slavery from the Louisiana Purchase lands. They were also dissatisfied with the territorial gains from the Mexican War because they were not large enough. In general, they were eager to find new land for cultivation using enslaved labor. 
Manifest Destiny to the South
In the early 1850s, many slaveowners hoped to acquire new territories, especially in areas of Latin America where they thought plantations worked by enslaved people were economically feasible. The most tempting, eagerly sought possibility in the eyes of Southern expansionists was the acquisition of Cuba.
Ostend Manifesto President Polk offered to purchase Cuba from Spain for 
$100 million, but Spain refused to sell the last major remnant of its once glorious empire in the Americas. Several Southern adventurers led small expeditions to Cuba in an effort to take the island by force. These forays, however, were easily defeated, and those who participated were executed by Spanish firing squads.
Elected to the presidency in 1852, Franklin Pierce adopted pro-Southern 
policies and dispatched three American diplomats to Ostend, Belgium, where they secretly negotiated to buy Cuba from Spain. The agreement that the diplomats drew up, called the Ostend Manifesto, was leaked to the press in the United States. Antislavery members of Congress reacted angrily and forced President Pierce to drop the scheme.
277  TOPIC 5.4    THE COMPROMISE OF 1850Walker Expedition Expansionists continued to seek new empires with 
or without the federal government’s support. Southern adventurer William 
Walker had tried unsuccessfully to take Baja California, the long peninsula stretching south of San Diego, from Mexico in 1853. Then, leading a force mostly of Southerners, he seized power in Nicaragua in 1855. Walker’s regime even gained temporary recognition from the United States in 1856. However, his grandiose scheme to develop a proslavery Central American empire collapsed when a coalition of Central American countries invaded his country and defeated him. Walker was executed by Honduran authorities in 1860.
Clayton-Bulwer Treaty (1850) Another American ambition was to build 
a canal through Central America. A canal would provide a shortcut to allow ships traveling from the Northern Atlantic to the Northern Pacific to avoid sailing around South America. Great Britain had the same ambition. To prevent each other from seizing this opportunity on its own, Great Britain and the United States agreed to the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty of 1850. It provided that 
neither nation would attempt to take exclusive control of any future canal route in Central America. This treaty continued in force until the end of the century. A new treaty signed in 1901 (the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty) gave the United States a free hand to build a canal without British participation.
Gadsden Purchase Although he failed to acquire Cuba, President Pierce 
succeeded in purchasing a small strip of land from Mexico in 1853 for $10 million (see map in Topic 5.2). Though the land was semidesert, it lay on the best route for a railroad through the region. Known as the Gadsden Purchase, it forms the southern sections of present-day New Mexico and Arizona.
Conflict Over Status of Territories
The issue of slavery in the territories gained in the Mexican War became the focus of sectional differences in the late 1840s. The Wilmot Proviso, which excluded slavery from the new territories, would have upset the Compromise of 1820 and the delicate balance of 15 free and 15 slave states. However, the proviso’s defeat only increased sectional feelings. 
Three Conflicting Positions on Slavery Expansion
Most people held one of three positions on whether to allow slavery in the Western territories. No single policy would appeal to them all, but many people hoped for a compromise that would allow each group to get something of what it wanted. 
Free-Soil Movement Northern Democrats and Whigs supported the 
Wilmot Proviso and the position that all African Americans—slave and free—should be excluded from the Mexican Cession (territory ceded to the U.S. by Mexico in 1848). While abolitionists advocated eliminating slavery everywhere, many Northerners who opposed the westward expansion of slavery did not oppose slavery in the South. They sought to keep the West a land of opportunity for Whites only. This meant keeping out both enslaved and 
278 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONfree African Americans. In 1848, Northerners who opposed allowing slavery 
in the territories organized the Free-Soil Party, which adopted the slogan “free soil, free labor, and free men. ” In addition to its chief objective—preventing the extension of slavery—the new party advocated free homesteads (public land grants to small farmers) and internal improvements such as roads and harbors. 
Southern Positions Southern plantation owners, whose wealth and social 
status made them politically powerful, viewed attempts to restrict the expansion of slavery as violations of their constitutional right to take their property wherever they wished. They saw the Free-Soilers—and the abolitionists—as intent on the destruction of slavery. Some Southerners held more moderate views. They would agree to extend the Missouri Compromise line westward to the Pacific Ocean and permit territories north of that line to be free of slavery.
Popular Sovereignty  A Democratic senator from Michigan, Lewis Cass, 
proposed a compromise solution that soon won considerable support from moderates across the country. Instead of Congress determining whether to allow slavery in a new western territory or state, Cass suggested that the matter be determined by a vote of the people who settled a territory. Cass’s approach to the problem was known as squatter sovereignty, or popular sovereignty .
The Election of 1848
The expansion of slavery into the territories was a vital issue in the presidential race of 1848. Three parties represented different positions on the issue:
• The Democrats nominated Senator Cass and adopted a platform pledged to popular sovereignty. 
• The Whigs nominated Mexican War hero General Zachary Taylor, who had never been involved in politics and took no position on slavery in the territories. 
• A third party, the Free-Soil Party, opposed expansion. It nominated former president Martin Van Buren. The party consisted of Conscience Whigs (who opposed slavery) and antislavery Democrats. Members of this latter group were ridiculed as “barnburners” because their defection threatened to destroy the Democratic Party.
Taylor narrowly defeated Cass, in part because of the vote given the Free-
Soil Party in key Northern states such as New Y ork and Pennsylvania.
Compromises to Preserve the Union 
The Gold Rush of 1849 and the influx of about 100,000 settlers into California created the need for law and order in the West. In 1849, Californians drafted a constitution for their new state—a constitution that banned slavery. Even though President Taylor was a Southern slaveholder himself, he supported the immediate admission of both California and New Mexico as free states. (At this time, however, the Mexican population of the New Mexico territory had little interest in applying for statehood.)
279  TOPIC 5.4    THE COMPROMISE OF 1850Taylor’s plan sparked talk of secession among the “fire-eaters” (radicals) in 
the South. Some Southern extremists even met in Nashville in 1850 to discuss 
secession. By this time, however, the astute Kentucky senator Henry Clay had proposed yet another compromise for solving the political crisis:
• Admit California to the Union as a free state.
• Divide the remainder of the Mexican Cession into two territories— Utah and New Mexico—and allow the settlers in these territories to decide the slavery issue by majority vote, or popular sovereignty.
• Give the land in dispute between Texas and the New Mexico territory to the new territories in return for the federal government assuming Texas’s public debt of $10 million.
• Ban the slave trade in the District of Columbia but permit Whites to own enslaved people there as before.
• Adopt a new Fugitive Slave Law and enforce it rigorously.
In the ensuing Senate debate over the compromise proposal, the three 
congressional giants of the age—Henry Clay of Kentucky, Daniel Webster of Massachusetts, and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina—delivered their last great speeches. (Webster and Calhoun, who were both born in 1782, died in 1850; Clay died two years later.) Webster argued for compromise in order to save the Union, and in so doing alienated the Massachusetts abolitionists who formed the base of his support. Calhoun argued against compromise and insisted that the South be given equal rights in the acquired territory.
Northern opposition to compromise came from younger antislavery 
lawmakers, such as Senator William H. Seward of New Y ork, who argued that a higher law than the Constitution existed. Opponents managed to prevail until the sudden death in 1850 of President Taylor, who had also opposed Clay’s plan. Succeeding him was a strong supporter of compromise, Vice President Millard Fillmore. Stephen A. Douglas, a young Democratic senator from Illinois, engineered different coalitions to pass each part of the compromise separately. President Fillmore readily signed the bills into law.
Passage The passage of the Compromise of 1850 bought time for the 
Union. Because California was admitted as a free state, the compromise added to the North’s political power. The political debate deepened the commitment of many Northerners to saving the Union from secession. Parts of the compromise became sources of controversy, especially the new Fugitive Slave Law and the provision for popular sovereignty.

Topic 5.5 
Sectional Conflict:  
Regional Differences
I did not write it. God wrote it. I merely did his dictation.
Harriet Beecher Stowe, describing her book Uncle Tom’s Cabin, 1879
Learning Objective 1 : Explain the effects of immigration from various 
parts of the world on American culture from 1844 to 1877.
Learning Objective 2 : Explain how regional differences related to 
slavery caused tension in the years leading up to the Civil War.
Among the issues that divided people politically in the mid-1800s were 
immigration, particularly by Roman Catholics, and how to promote and 
respond to industrial growth. However, the dominant issue increasingly became the possible expansion of slavery into the territories. 
Immigration Controversy 
As immigration increased, especially from Ireland and Germany, opposition arose on many fronts. Some Americans disliked the ethnicity or religious faiths of the immigrants, while others feared them as low-wage workers who might take their jobs. 
Irish
During this period, half of all the immigrants—almost 2 million—came from Ireland. These Irish immigrants were mostly tenant farmers driven from their homeland by crop failures and a devastating famine in the 1840s. They came with limited interest in farming, few skills, and little money. They faced discrimination because of their Roman Catholic religion. The Irish worked hard, often competing with African Americans for domestic work and low-skill jobs that required physical strength and endurance. Most stayed where they landed, so strong Irish communities developed in Northern cities such as Boston, New Y ork, and Philadelphia. In Irish neighborhoods, people continued the customs they brought with them. For example, perhaps one-third spoke Irish. Several newspapers included an Irish-language section and churches held services for Irish speakers. 
283  TOPIC 5.5    S ECTIONAL CONFLICT : REGIONAL DIFFERENCES  The Irish did bring two valuable skills. Since their country was dominated 
by the British, most Irish spoke English well and understood electoral politics. 
Using these skills, many entered local politics. They often organized their fellow immigrants and joined the Democratic Party, which was traditionally anti-British and pro-worker. Initially excluded from New Y ork City’s Democratic organization, Tammany Hall, the Irish had secured jobs and influence by the 
1850s. By the 1880s they controlled Tammany Hall. 
Germans
Both economic hardships and the failure of democratic revolutions in 1848 caused more than 1 million Germans to seek refuge in the United States in the late 1840s and the 1850s. Most German immigrants had some modest means as well as considerable skills as farmers and artisans. Moving westward in search of cheap, fertile farmland, they established homesteads throughout the Old Northwest and generally prospered. At first their political influence was limited. As they became more active in public life, many strongly supported public education and staunchly opposed slavery. 
Like the Irish, they often formed close-knit communities in cities where 
the German language was commonly spoken. Germans in rural areas often formed their own Roman Catholic or Lutheran churches. 
Nativist Opposition to Immigration
Many native-born Americans were alarmed by the influx of immigrants, fearing that the newcomers would take their jobs and dilute the culture of the Anglo majority. These ethnic tensions were closely tied to religion. Most of the native-born opponents of immigration were Protestants and most of the Irish and many of the German immigrants were Roman Catholics. In the 1840s, hostility to these immigrants, known as nativism, led to sporadic rioting in the big cities. 
Nativists formed a secretive antiforeign society, the Supreme Order of 
the Star-Spangled Banner, which evolved into a political organization, the American Party. Because party members often responded “I know nothing” to political questions, the American Party was commonly called the Know-Nothing Party. The policies they supported included increasing the time required for immigrants to attain citizenship from five years to twenty-one years and allowing only native-born citizens to hold public office. 
For a short period in the early 1850s, as the Whig Party disintegrated, the 
Know-Nothing Party gained strength, particularly in the New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. In the 1856 presidential election the party unsuccessfully ran former president Millard Fillmore. 
By the late 1850s, antiforeign feeling faded in importance as the North and 
the South grew increasingly divided over slavery. However, nativism would periodically return when enough native-born citizens felt threatened by a sudden increase in immigration.

The Expanding Economy 
The era of territorial expansion coincided with a period of remarkable economic 
growth from the 1840s to 1857.
Industrial Technology 
Before 1840, factory production had been concentrated mainly in the textile mills of New England. After 1840, industrialization spread rapidly to the other states of the Northeast. New factories produced shoes, sewing machines, ready-to-wear clothing, firearms, precision tools, and iron products for railroads and other new technologies. The invention of the sewing machine by Elias Howe took much of the production of clothing out of homes and into factories. An electric telegraph demonstrated in 1844 by its inventor, Samuel F. B. Morse, went hand in hand with the growth of railroads in enormously speeding up communication and transportation across the country.
Railroads
The canal-building era of the 1820s and 1830s was replaced in the next two decades with the expansion of rail lines, especially across the Northeast and Midwest. The railroads soon emerged as America’s largest industry. As such, they required immense amounts of capital and labor and gave rise to complex business organizations. Local merchants and farmers would often buy stocks in the new railroad companies in order to connect their area to the outside world. Local and state governments also helped the railroads grow by granting special loans and tax breaks. Then, in 1850, the U.S. government made its first land grant to railroads. It gave 2.6 million acres of federal land to build the Illinois Central Railroad from Lake Michigan to the Gulf of Mexico.
Cheap and rapid transportation particularly promoted Western agriculture. 
Farmers in Illinois and Iowa were now more closely linked by rail to the 
285  TOPIC 5.5    S ECTIONAL CONFLICT : REGIONAL DIFFERENCES  Northeast than by the rivers to the South. The railroads united the commercial 
interests of the Northeast and Midwest and would also give the North strategic advantages in the Civil War.
Panic of 1857
In 1857 a financial panic caused a sharp decrease in prices for Midwestern agricultural products and a sharp increase in unemployment in Northern cities. However, cotton prices remained high and the South was less affected. As a result, some Southerners believed that their plantation economy was superior to the Northern economy and that continued union with the Northern economy was not needed.
Agitation Over Slavery
For a brief period—between the Compromise of 1850 and the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854—political tensions relaxed slightly. However, the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act and the publication of a best-selling antislavery novel kept the slavery question before the public. 
Fugitive Slave Law
The passage of a strict Fugitive Slave Law in 1850 persuaded many Southerners to accept that California would be a free state. However, many Northerners bitterly resented the law. As a result, it drove a wedge between North and South.
Enforcement  The law’s purpose was to help owners track down runaway 
(fugitive) enslaved people who had escaped to a Northern state, capture them, and return them to their Southern owners. The law removed fugitive slave cases from state courts and made them the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government. It also authorized special U.S. commissioners to issue warrants to arrest fugitives. A captured person who claimed to be free and not someone who had just escaped slavery was denied the right of trial by jury. State and local law enforcement officials were required to help enforce the federal law. 
Opposition  Anyone who attempted to hide a runaway or obstruct 
enforcement of the law was subject to heavy penalties. However, Black and White activists in the North bitterly resisted the law. Through court cases, protests, and sometimes force, they tried to protect African Americans from being returned—or taken for the first time—into slavery. 
Underground Railroad
The Underground Railroad was a loose network of activists who helped 
enslaved people escape to freedom in the North or Canada. Most of the “conductors” and those operating the “stations” were free African Americans and people who had escaped slavery themselves with the assistance of White abolitionists. The most famous conductor was Harriet Tubman, a woman who had escaped slavery. She made at least 19 trips into the South to help some 300 people escape. 
286 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONFree Black citizens in the North and abolitionists also organized vigilance 
committees to protect fugitive slaves from the slave catchers. During the Civil 
War, African American leaders such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and Sojourner Truth worked for emancipation and supported Black soldiers.
Books on Slavery—Pro and Con
Popular books as well as unpopular laws stirred the people of all regions. 
Uncle Tom’s Cabin  The most influential book of its day was a novel about 
the conflict between an enslaved man, Tom, and the brutal White slave owner, Simon Legree. The publication of Uncle Tom’s Cabin  in 1852 by the Northern 
writer Harriet Beecher Stowe moved a generation of Northerners and many 
Europeans to regard all slave owners as cruel and inhuman. Southerners condemned the “untruths” in the novel and looked upon it as one more proof of the North’s incurable prejudice against the Southern way of life. Later, when President Lincoln met Stowe, he is reported to have said, “So you’re the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war. ”
In response to Stowe's book, Mary Eastment wrote the pro-slavery novel 
Aunt Phillis's Cabin. She portrayed a world of kind slaveowners and happily enslaved people. 
Impending Crisis of the South  Appearing in 1857, Hinton R. Helper’s 
nonfiction book, Impending Crisis of the South , attacked slavery from another 
angle. The author, a native of North Carolina, used statistics to demonstrate to fellow Southerners that slavery weakened the South’s economy. Southern states quickly banned the book, but it was widely distributed in the North by antislavery and Free-Soil leaders.

Southern Reaction Responding to the Northern literature that condemned 
slavery, proslavery Southern Whites counterattacked, arguing that slavery 
was good for both the master and the enslaved. They pointed out that slavery was sanctioned by the Bible and grounded in philosophy and history. Slavery was also permitted by the U.S. Constitution. Southern authors contrasted the 
287  TOPIC 5.5    S ECTIONAL CONFLICT : REGIONAL DIFFERENCES  conditions of Northern wage workers—“wage slaves” forced to work long hours 
in factories and mines—with the familial bonds that developed on plantations between slaves and masters. George Fitzhugh, the best-known proslavery author, questioned the principle of equal rights for “unequal men” and attacked the wage system as worse than slavery. Among his works were Sociology for the South  (1854) and Cannibals All!  (1857).
Effect of Law and Literature
The Fugitive Slave Law and the books on slavery increasingly polarized the nation. Many Northerners who had opposed the expansion of slavery only for economic reasons and had scorned abolition became more concerned about slavery as a moral issue. At the same time, a growing number of Southerners, particularly wealthy ones, became more convinced that Northerners would abolish slavery and the way of life based upon it as soon as they could.

289  TOPIC 5.6   F AILURE OF COMPROMISE
Topic 5.6
Failure of Compromise
The real issue in this controversy—the one pressing upon every  
mind—is the sentiment on the part of one class that looks  
upon the institution of slavery as a wrong, and of another class  
that does not look upon it as a wrong.
Abraham Lincoln, during a debate with Stephen Douglas in Alton, Illinois, 1858
Learning Objective : Explain the political causes of the Civil War.
By 1861, politicians attempted many compromises to prevent war. Historians 
agree on the sequence of major events from 1848 to 1861 that led to the outbreak 
of the Civil War between the Union and the Confederacy. Facts alone, however, do not automatically assemble themselves into a convincing interpretation of why war occurred when it did. Three large issues, all related to slavery, divided 
the North and the South: (1) attitudes about the morality of slavery, (2) views about the constitutional rights of states, particularly the right to protect slavery, and (3) differences over economic policies between the free-labor industrial North and the slave-labor agricultural South. Some historians argue that solving these issues was possible but blundering politicians and extremism resulted in an unnecessary war. Others argue that the war was inevitable.
National Parties in Crisis
The potency of the slavery controversy increased political instability. The two major parties—the Democrats and the Whigs—grew weak and divided over how to resolve the sectional differences over slavery. One effort to settle the issue, the application of popular sovereignty in the territory of Kansas, resulted in disaster.
The Election of 1852
Signs of trouble for the Whig Party appeared in the 1852 election for president. The Whigs nominated another military hero of the Mexican War, General Winfield Scott. Attempting to ignore the slavery issue, the Whigs concentrated on the party’s traditional platform: improving roads and harbors. But Scott quickly discovered that sectional issues could not be held in check. The antislavery and Southern factions of the party fell to quarreling, and the party was on the verge of splitting apart.
290 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Democrats nominated a compromise candidate, Franklin Pierce 
of New Hampshire, who they hoped would be a safe choice, one acceptable 
to people in all regions. A Northerner, Pierce was acceptable to Southern Democrats because he supported the Fugitive Slave Law. In the Electoral College, Pierce and the Democrats won all but four states, suggesting the days of the Whig Party were numbered.
The Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)
The Democrats, firmly in control of both the White House and Congress, found they could not avoid the issue of slavery in the territories. Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois proposed building a transcontinental railroad through the center of the country, with a major terminus in Chicago, to promote Western settlement (and increase the value of his own real estate in Chicago). 
Southerners preferred a more southerly route. To win their support, 
Douglas introduced a bill to divide the Nebraska Territory into two parts, the Kansas and Nebraska territories, and allow settlers in each territory to decide whether to allow slavery. Since these territories were located north  of the 36°30´ 
line, Douglas’s bill gave Southerners an opportunity to expand slavery into lands that had been closed to it by the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Many Northern Democrats condemned the bill as a surrender to “slave power. ” Still, after three months of bitter debate, both houses of Congress passed Douglas’s bill as the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, and President Pierce signed it into law. 
Extremists and Violence
The Kansas-Nebraska Act, in effect, repealed the Missouri Compromise that had lessened regional tensions for more than three decades. After 1854, the conflicts between antislavery and proslavery forces exploded, both in Kansas and on the floor of the United States Senate. 
“Bleeding Kansas”
Stephen Douglas, the Kansas-Nebraska Act sponsor, expected the slavery issue in the territory to be settled peacefully by the antislavery farmers from the Midwest who migrated to Kansas and constituted a majority. Slaveholders from neighboring Missouri also set up homesteads in Kansas as a means of winning control for the South. Northern abolitionists and Free-Soilers responded by organizing the New England Emigrant Aid Company (1855), which paid for the transportation of antislavery settlers to Kansas. Fighting broke out between the proslavery and the antislavery groups, and the territory became known as “bleeding Kansas. ”
Proslavery Missourians, called “border ruffians” by their enemies, crossed 
the border to create a proslavery legislature in Lecompton, Kansas. Antislavery settlers refused to recognize this government and created their own legislature in Topeka. In 1856, proslavery forces attacked the free-soil town of Lawrence, 
291  TOPIC 5.6   F AILURE OF COMPROMISEkilling two and destroying homes and businesses. Two days later, John Brown, 
a stern abolitionist, retaliated. He and his sons attacked a proslavery farm settlement at Pottawatomie Creek, killing five.

In Washington, the Pierce administration did nothing to keep order in 
the Kansas territory and failed to support honest elections there. As Kansas became bloodier, the Democratic Party became more divided between its Northern and Southern factions. The plan to let territories decide on slavery for themselves had resulted in chaos and bloodshed.
Caning of Senator Sumner The violence in Kansas spilled over into the 
halls of the U.S. Congress. In 1856, Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner attacked the Democratic administration in a vitriolic speech, “The Crime Against Kansas. ” His remarks included personal charges against South Carolina 
senator Andrew Butler. Butler’s nephew, Congressman Preston Brooks, defended his uncle’s honor by walking into the Senate chamber and beating Sumner over the head repeatedly with a cane. Sumner never fully recovered from the attack. The action by Brooks outraged the North, and the House voted to censure him while Southerners applauded the deed. The Sumner-Brooks incident was another sign of growing passions on both sides.
292 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONBirth of the Republican Party
The increasing tensions over slavery divided Northern and Southern Democrats, 
and completely broke apart the Whig Party. Ex-Whigs scattered. Those who were frightened about immigration joined the Know-Nothing Party. With the support of new members, the Know-Nothings won a few local and state elections in the mid-1850s. However, as the expansion of slavery became the paramount political issue, the significance of immigration declined, and along with it, the Know-Nothing Party.
Ex-Whigs who supported the expansion of slavery usually joined the 
Democratic Party. The South became the core of the party, although Democrats were still strong in the North. 
Former Whigs who opposed slavery expansion formed the core of a new 
party. The Republican Party  was founded in Wisconsin in 1854 as a reaction 
to the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Composed of Free-Soilers and antislavery Whigs and Democrats, its purpose was to oppose the spread of slavery in the territories—not to end slavery itself. Its first platform called for the repeal of both the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Fugitive Slave Law. As violence increased in Kansas, more and more people, including some abolitionists, joined the Republican Party, and it became the second largest party in the country. But it was strictly a Northern, or sectional, party. Its success alienated and threatened the South.
The Election of 1856
The Republicans’ first test of strength came in the presidential election of 1856. Their nominee was a California senator, the explorer and “Pathfinder, ” John C. Frémont. The Republican platform called for no expansion of slavery, free homesteads, and a probusiness protective tariff. The Know-Nothings also competed strongly in this election, with their candidate, former President Millard Fillmore, winning 20 percent of the popular vote.
As the one major national party, the Democrats expected to win. They 
nominated James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, rejecting President Pierce and 
Stephen Douglas because they were too closely identified with the controversial Kansas-Nebraska Act. As expected, the Democrats won a majority of the popular and electoral vote. The Republicans made a strong showing for a sectional party. In the Electoral College, Frémont carried 11 of the 16 free states. Some predicted that the antislavery Republicans could win the White House without a single vote from the South.
The election of 1856 foreshadowed the emergence of a powerful political 
party that would win all but four presidential elections between 1860 and 1932.
Constitutional Issues
Both the Democrats’ position of popular sovereignty and the Republicans’ stand against the expansion of slavery received serious blows during the Buchanan administration (1857–1861). Republicans attacked Buchanan as a weak president.
293  TOPIC 5.6   F AILURE OF COMPROMISELecompton Constitution
One of Buchanan’s first challenges as president in 1857 was to decide whether 
to accept or reject a proslavery state constitution for Kansas submitted by the Southern legislature at Lecompton. Buchanan knew that the Lecompton Constitution , as it was called, did not have majority support. Even so, he asked 
Congress to accept the document and admit Kansas as a slave state. Congress did not do so because many Democrats, including Stephen Douglas, joined with the Republicans in rejecting the constitution. The next year, 1858, the proslavery document was overwhelmingly rejected by Kansas settlers, most of whom were antislavery Republicans.
Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857)
Congressional folly and presidential ineptitude contributed to the sectional crisis of the 1850s. Then the Supreme Court worsened the crisis when it infuriated many Northerners with a controversial proslavery decision in the case of an enslaved man named Dred Scott. Scott had been held in slavery in Missouri and then taken to the free territory of Wisconsin, where he lived for two years before returning to Missouri. Arguing that his residence on free soil made him a free citizen, Scott sued for his freedom in Missouri in 1846. The case worked its way through the court system. It finally reached the Supreme Court, which rendered its decision in March 1857, only two days after Buchanan was sworn in as president.
Presiding over the Court was Chief Justice Roger Taney, a Southern 
Democrat. A majority of the Court decided against Scott and gave these reasons:
• Dred Scott had no right to sue in a federal court because the Framers of the Constitution did not intend African Americans to be U.S. citizens.
• Congress did not have the power to deprive any person of property without due process of law. If slaves were a form of property, then Congress could not exclude slavery from any federal territory.
• The Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional because it excluded slavery from Wisconsin and other Northern territories.
The Court’s ruling delighted Southern Democrats and infuriated Northern 
Republicans. In effect, the Court declared all parts of the Western territories open to slavery. Republicans denounced the decision as “the greatest crime in the annals of the republic. ” The timing of the decision, after Buchanan’s inauguration, led Northerners to suspect the Democratic president and majority on the Supreme Court, including Taney, had planned the decision so that it would settle the slavery question. This increased Northern suspicions of a conspiracy and induced thousands of Democrats to vote Republican. Northern Democrats such as Senator Douglas were left with the impossible task of supporting popular sovereignty without rejecting the Dred Scott decision. Douglas’s hopes for compromise and the presidency were in jeopardy.
294 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONLincoln-Douglas Debates
In 1858, the focus of the nation was on Stephen Douglas’s campaign for 
reelection as senator from Illinois. Challenging him was a successful trial lawyer and former member of the Illinois legislature, Abraham Lincoln, as the Republican candidate. Lincoln had served one term in Congress in the 1840s as a Whig. Nationally, he was an unknown compared to Douglas (the Little Giant), who was the champion of popular sovereignty and possibly the best hope for holding the nation together if elected president in 1860.
Lincoln was not an abolitionist. As a moderate who was against the 
expansion of slavery, he spoke effectively of slavery as a moral issue. (“If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. ”) Accepting the Illinois Republicans’ nomination, he delivered his celebrated “house-divided” speech that won him fame. “I believe this government, ” said Lincoln, “cannot endure, permanently half slave  and half free , ” a statement that made Southerners view Lincoln as a 
radical. In seven campaign debates in different Illinois towns, Lincoln shared the platform with his famous opponent, Douglas. The Republican challenger attacked Douglas’s indifference to slavery as a moral issue.
In a debate in Freeport, Illinois, Lincoln challenged Douglas to reconcile 
popular sovereignty with the Dred Scott decision. In what became known as the Freeport Doctrine, Douglas responded that slavery could not exist in a 
community if the local citizens did not pass laws (slave codes) maintaining it. His views angered Southern Democrats because, from their point of view, Douglas did not go far enough in supporting the implications of the Dred Scott decision.
Douglas won his campaign for reelection to the U.S. Senate. In the long run, 
however, he lost ground in his own party by alienating Southern Democrats. Lincoln, on the other hand, emerged from the debates as a national figure and a leading contender for the Republican nomination for president in 1860.

296 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONSHORT-ANSWER QUESTION
Use complete sentences; an outline or bulleted list alone is not acceptable.
Question 1 is based on the following excerpts.
1. “The country had been founded in compromise, and to compromise it was 
dedicated. . . . But this conception of compromise was in trouble, and the word would . . . become an epithet. . . .
The underlying issue was the North’s increasing power. And that power 
endangered slavery. Secessionists worried if slavery did not expand into the territories, the black population would stay where it was, bottled up and likely to explode. Fear motivated them. That is to say, racial anxiety was as pervasive as economic anxiety when it came to secession, though it was hard to separate the two, for they were threaded together with the rope that bound secessionists and many Southerners to their land, their way of life, their mint juleps, and their pride of race.
Lincoln’s election was thus not so much the cause  of secession as its 
excuse: institutional restraints (read: the federal government) had insulted 
Southerners, imperiled their way of life, and held them in thrall to Northern financiers who had forced planters to buy goods in a protected market. ”
Brenda Wineapple, Ecstatic Nation, 2013 
“During the 1850s, however, the forces that had worked to hold the nation together in the past fell victim to new and much more divisive pressures that were working to split the nation apart. Driving the sectional tensions of the 1850s was a battle over national policy toward the western territories which were clamoring to become states of the Union—and over the place of slavery within them. Should slavery be permitted in the new states? And who should decide whether to permit it or not? . . . Positions on slavery continued to harden in both the North and South until ultimately each region came to consider the other its enemy. ”

Topic 5.7 
Election of 1860 and Secession
I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this  
guilty land will never be purged away but with blood.
John Brown, December 1859
Learning Objective : Describe the effects of Lincoln’s election.
In Northern states outside of Illinois where Douglas and the Democrats 
defeated Lincoln, the Republicans did well in the congressional elections of 
1858. This greatly alarmed many Southerners. They worried not only about the antislavery plank in the Republicans’ program but also about that party’s economic program, which favored Northern industrialists at the expense of the South. The higher tariffs pledged by the Republicans would help Northern businesses but hurt the South, which depended on exporting cotton. The events leading up to Lincoln’s election and the secession of eleven Southern states from the Union set the stage for war. 
The Road to Secession
Southern fears grew that a Republican victory in 1860 would spell disaster for their economy and threaten their “constitutional right, ” as affirmed by the Supreme Court, to own enslaved people as property. Adding to their fears were Northern radicals supporting John Brown, the man who had massacred five farmers in Kansas in 1856.
John Brown’s Raid at Harpers Ferry
John Brown confirmed the South’s worst fears of radical abolitionism when he tried to start an uprising of enslaved people in Virginia. In October 1859, he led a small band of followers, including his four sons and some formerly enslaved people, to attack the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry . His impractical plan was 
to use guns from the arsenal to arm Virginia’s enslaved African Americans, whom he expected to rise up in revolt. Federal troops under the command of Robert E. Lee captured Brown and his band after a two-day siege. Brown and six of his followers were tried for treason by the state of Virginia. At the trial, Brown spoke with simple eloquence of his humanitarian motives in wanting to free enslaved people. However, he was convicted and hanged.
Brown’s raid divided Northerners. Moderates condemned his use of 
violence, while abolitionists hailed him as a martyr. Southern whites saw the raid, and Northern support for it, as final proof of the North’s true intentions—to use slave revolts to destroy the South. 
298 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Election of 1860
After John Brown’s raid, more and more Americans feared that their country was 
moving to disintegration. The presidential election of 1860 would test the Union.
Breakup of the Democratic Party As 1860 began, the Democratic Party 
represented the last hope for compromise. The Democrats held their national convention in Charleston, South Carolina. Stephen Douglas was the party’s leading candidate and the most capable of winning the presidency. Blocking his nomination were angry Southerners and supporters of President Buchanan.
After deadlocking at Charleston, the Democrats held a second convention 
in Baltimore. Many delegates from the slave states walked out, enabling the remaining delegates to nominate Douglas on a platform of popular sovereignty and enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law. Southern Democrats then held their own convention in Baltimore and nominated Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky as their candidate. The Southern Democratic platform called for the unrestricted extension of slavery in the territories and annexation of Cuba, a Spanish colony that still practiced slavery. 
Republican Nomination of Lincoln When the Republicans met in 
Chicago, they enjoyed hopes of an easy win over the divided Democrats. They drafted a platform that appealed to the economic self-interest of Northerners and Westerners. They called for the exclusion of slavery from the territories, a protective tariff for industry, free land for homesteaders, and internal improvements to encourage Western settlement, including a railroad to the Pacific. To win moderates on slavery, they rejected the well-known New Y ork Senator William Seward, a strong opponent of slavery. They turned to a little-known Illinois lawyer Abraham Lincoln, a strong debater. They believed that Lincoln could carry the Midwestern states of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. One cloud darkened the Republicans’ otherwise bright future. In the South, radicals warned that if the country elected Lincoln, their states would leave the Union.
A Fourth Political Party Fearing a Republican victory, a group of former 
Whigs, Know-Nothings, and moderate Democrats formed a new party: the Constitutional Union Party . For president, they nominated John Bell of 
Tennessee and pledged enforcement of the laws and the Constitution and, above all, preservation of the Union.
Election Results While Douglas campaigned across the country, Lincoln 
remained at home in Springfield, Illinois, meeting with Republican leaders and giving statements to the press. The election results were predictable. Lincoln carried every free state of the North, which represented a solid majority of 59 percent of the electoral votes. Breckinridge, the Southern Democrat, carried the Deep South, leaving Douglas and Bell with just a few electoral votes in the border states.
However, Lincoln won only 39.8 percent of the popular  vote, so he would 
be a minority president. The new political reality was that the populous free states had enough electoral votes to elect a president without any electoral votes from the South. Southern fears that the North would dominate the federal government—and could soon threaten slavery—appeared to be coming true. 
299  TOPIC 5.7    ELECTION OF 1860 AND SECESSIONSecession of the Deep South
In 1860, Republicans controlled neither the Senate nor the Supreme Court. 
Even so, the election of Lincoln was all that Southern secessionists needed to call for immediate disunion. In December 1860, a special convention in South Carolina voted unanimously to secede, saying they needed to protect slavery. Within six weeks, state conventions in Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas did the same. In several states, particularly Georgia and Alabama, many people were uncertain about or opposed to secession. However, large slaveowners, arguing that states had a right to defend slavery, prevailed.
In February 1861, representatives of the seven states of the Deep South met 
in Montgomery, Alabama, and created the Confederate States of America. The constitution of this Southern country was like the U.S. Constitution, except that the Confederacy placed limits on the government’s power to impose tariffs and restrict slavery. Elected president and vice president were Jefferson Davis of Mississippi and Alexander Stephens of Georgia.

Crittenden Compromise A lame-duck president (a leader completing a 
term after someone else has been elected to his or her office), Buchanan had five 
months in office before Lincoln succeeded him. Buchanan was a conservative who did nothing to prevent the secession. Congress was more active. In a last-ditch effort to appease the South, Senator John Crittenden of Kentucky proposed a constitutional amendment that would guarantee the right to hold slaves in 
300 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONall territories south of the old Missouri Compromise line, 36°30´. Lincoln, 
however, said that he could not accept this compromise because it violated the Republican position against extension of slavery into the territories.
Southern Whites who voted for secession believed they were acting in 
the tradition of the Revolution of 1776. They argued that they had a right to national independence and to dissolve a constitutional compact that no longer protected them from the “tyranny” of Northern rule. Many also thought that Lincoln, like Buchanan, might permit secession without a fight. Those who thought this had badly miscalculated.
A Nation Divided 
When Lincoln took office as the president in March 1861, people wondered if he would challenge the secession militarily. In his inaugural address, Lincoln assured Southerners that he would not interfere with slavery where it existed. At the same time, he warned, no state had the right to break up the Union. He appealed for restraint: “In your hands, my dissatisﬁed fellow-countrymen, and 
not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail 
you. Y ou can have no conﬂict without being yourselves the aggressors.
Fort Sumter
Despite the president’s message of conciliation, the danger of a war was acute. Critical was the status of federal forts in states that had seceded. Fort Sumter , 
in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, was cut off by Southern control of the harbor. Rather than either giving up Fort Sumter or attempting to defend it, Lincoln announced that he was sending provisions of food to the small federal garrison. He thus gave South Carolina the choice of either permitting the fort to hold out or opening ﬁre. Carolina’s guns thundered and thus, on April 12, 1861, the war began. The attack on Fort Sumter and its capture after two days of pounding united most Northerners behind a patriotic ﬁght to save the Union. 
Secession of the Upper South
Before South Carolina attacked Fort Sumter, only seven states of the Deep South had seceded. After it was clear that Lincoln would use troops to defend the Union, four states of the Upper South—Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas—seceded and joined the Confederacy. As in the earlier states, the decision to secede was controversial. The Confederates then moved their capital to Richmond, Virginia. The people of western Virginia remained loyal to the Union, becoming a separate state in 1863. 
Keeping the Border States in the Union
Four other slaveholding states remained in the Union. The decisions of Delaware, Maryland, Missouri, and Kentucky not to join the Confederacy were 
partly a result of pro-Union sentiment in those states and partly the result of shrewd federal policies. In Maryland, pro-secessionists attacked Union troops and threatened the railroad to Washington. The Union army resorted to martial 
301  TOPIC 5.7    ELECTION OF 1860 AND SECESSIONlaw to keep the state under federal control. In Missouri, U.S. troops prevented 
the pro-South elements from gaining control, although guerrilla forces for the Confederacy were active during the war. In Kentucky, the state legislature voted to remain neutral. Lincoln initially respected its neutrality and waited for the South to violate it before moving in federal troops. 
Keeping the border states in the Union was a military and political goal for 
Lincoln. Their loss would increase the Confederate population by 50 percent and weaken the North’s strategic position. Partly to avoid alienating Unionists in the border states, Lincoln rejected initial calls for the emancipation of slaves. 
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WHAT CAUSED THE CIVIL WAR?
Was slavery the primary cause of the Civil War? In the decades after the war, Northern historians argued emphatically that the South’s attachment to slavery was the principal, if not the only, cause. They blamed the war on a conspiracy of slave owners—a small minority of Southerners—who wanted only to expand slavery at the expense of White and Black Americans alike.
Southern historians, on the other hand, viewed the conflict between the 
two sections, North and South, as a dispute over the nature of the Constitution. They argued that Northern politicians violated the original compact of the states by attacking their property rights (the ownership of enslaved people). Therefore, the Southern states had to secede to defend their constitutional rights and escape tyranny of the Northern majority. 
By the early 20th century, passions had cooled on both sides, and scholars 
of the Progressive era (1900–1917) thought economic interests were the foundation of all political conflict. The Civil War, then, was a clash between two opposing economic systems: the industrial North versus the agricultural South. They downplayed the divisive issue of slavery.
American disillusionment with World War I led historians to question 
whether the Civil War was necessary or inevitable. Previously, people had assumed that the Civil War was an “irrepressible conflict. ” In the 1920s and 1930s, historians challenged that assumption, arguing that blundering politicians and fanaticism on both sides, such as radical abolitionists in the North and secessionists in the South, were chiefly responsible for the war. The leaders admired from this perspective were politicians of the 1850s who worked for compromise, such as Henry Clay and Stephen Douglas. They criticized Lincoln for his passionate “house-divided” speech.
In the 1950s and 1960s, the civil rights movement provided the backdrop for 
rethinking the causes of the Civil War. Historians who were affected by African Americans’ struggles for civil rights returned to the view that slavery was the chief cause of disunion after all. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a leading historian of the 1950s, argued: “ A society closed in the defense of evil institutions thus creates moral differences far too profound to be solved by compromise. ” In this view, slavery was an inherently evil institution and the root of a conflict that was indeed “irrepressible. ”

Use complete sentences; an outline or bulleted list alone is not acceptable.
1. “[In the Civil War,] great issues were at stake, issues about which 
Americans were willing to fight and die, issues whose resolution profoundly transformed and redefined the United States. The Civil War was a total war in three senses: It mobilized the total human and material resources of both sides; it ended not in a negotiated peace but in total victory by one side and unconditional surrender by the other; it destroyed the economy and social system of the loser and established those of the winner as the norm for the future. . . .
The North went to war to preserve the Union; it ended by creating a nation. ”
James M. McPherson, historian, “ A War That Never Goes 
Away, ” American Heritage, March 1990
“Should we consecrate a war that killed and maimed over a million 
Americans? Or should we question . . . whether this was really a war of necessity that justified its appalling costs? . . . 
Very few Northerners went to war seeking or anticipating the destruction 
of slavery. They fought for the Union, and the Emancipation Proclamation was a means to that end: a desperate measure to undermine the South and save a democratic nation that Lincoln called ‘the last, best hope of earth. ’ . . . 
From the distance of 150 years, Lincoln’s transcendent vision at Gettysburg 
of a ‘new birth of freedom’ seems premature. . . . Rather than simply consecrate the dead with words, he said, it is for ‘us the living’ to rededicate ourselves to the unfinished work of the Civil War. ”

Topic 5.8 
Military Conflict in the Civil War
It is enough to make the whole world start to see the awful amount 
of death and destruction that now stalks abroad. I see no signs of a 
remission till one or both the armies are destroyed.
General William T. Sherman, June 1864 
Learning Objective : Explain the various factors that contributed to the 
Union victory in the Civil War.
The Civil War between the Union and the Confederacy (1861–1865) was the 
costliest American war in terms of the loss of human life, resulting in the deaths 
of 750,000 people. Most important, the Civil War freed 4 million enslaved African Americans, giving the nation what President Lincoln called a “new birth of freedom. ” The war also transformed American society by accelerating industrialization and modernization in the North and destroying much of the South. These changes were so fundamental and profound that some historians refer to the Civil War as the Second American Revolution .
War
Less than 100 years after fighting a war to establish their republic, the Union and the Confederacy each entered the Civil War with strengths and weaknesses.
Military Differences The Confederacy started with the advantage of 
having to ﬁght only a defensive war to win, while the Union had to conquer an area as large as Western Europe. The Confederacy had to move troops and supplies shorter distances than the Union. It had a long, indented coastline that was difﬁcult to blockade, experienced military leaders, and high troop morale. 
The Union’s population of 22 million against the Confederate’s of 5.5 
million free Whites would work to its favor in a war of attrition. Its population advantage was aided by 800,000 immigrants, and emancipation brought 180,000 African Americans into the Union army. The Union could also count on a loyal U.S. Navy, which ultimately gave it command of the rivers and territorial waters. 
Economic Differences The Union dominated the nation’s economy, 
controlling most of the banking and capital of the country, 85 percent of the factories, 70 percent of the railroads, and 65 percent of the farmland. The skills of Northern clerks and bookkeepers proved valuable in the logistical support of military operations. Confederates hoped that European demand for its 
305  TOPIC 5.8    M ILITARY CONFLICT IN THE CIVIL WARcotton would bring recognition and ﬁnancial aid. Like other rebel movements 
in history, the Confederates counted on outside help to be successful. 
Political Differences The two sides had distinct goals. The Confederates 
were struggling for independence, while the Union was fighting to preserve the Union. But states’ rights proved a liability for the Confederate government; to win the war, they needed a strong central government with strong public support. They had neither, while the Union had an established central government. The ultimate hope of the Confederates was that the people of the Union would turn against Lincoln and the Republicans and quit the war because it was too costly. 
The Confederate States of America The Confederate constitution was 
modeled after the U.S. Constitution, but it denied the Confederate congress the powers to levy a protective tariff and to appropriate funds for internal improvements. However, it did prohibit the foreign slave trade. President Jefferson Davis tried to increase his executive powers during the war, but Southern governors resisted his attempts, some holding back troops and resources to protect their own states. At one point, Vice President Alexander H. Stephens, in defense of states’ rights, even urged the secession of Georgia in response to the “despotic” actions of the Confederate government. 
The Confederacy was chronically short of money. It tried loans, income 
taxes, and even impressment of private property, but these revenues paid only a part of war costs. The government issued more than $1 billion in paper money, causing severe inflation. By war’s end, a Confederate dollar was worth less than two cents. The Confederate congress nationalized railroads to promote industrial growth, but it was not enough. In a war of attrition, the Confederacy faced the challenge of making its resources last until the Union stopped fighting. 
First Years of a Long War: 1861–1862 
People at ﬁrst expected the war to last no more than weeks. Lincoln called the ﬁrst volunteers for a period of only 90 days. “On to Richmond!” was the cry, but it would take four years of ﬁghting before Union troops marched into the Confederate capital. 
Union Strategy General-in-Chief Winﬁeld Scott, veteran of the 1812 and 
Mexican wars, devised a three-part strategy for winning a long war: 
• Use the U.S. Navy to blockade Southern ports (called the Anaconda Plan ), cutting off essential supplies from reaching the Confederacy 
• Take control of the Mississippi River, dividing the Confederacy in two 
• Raise and train an army 500,000 strong to conquer Richmond 
The ﬁrst two parts of the strategy proved easier to achieve than the third, 
but ultimately all three were important in achieving Northern victory. 
After the Union’s defeat at Bull Run, federal armies experienced a succession 
of crushing defeats as they attempted various campaigns in Virginia.
306 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONFirst Battle of Bull Run In the ﬁrst major battle of the war (July 1861), 
30,000 federal troops marched from Washington, D.C., to attack Confederate 
forces near Bull Run Creek at Manassas Junction, Virginia. As the Union forces seemed close to victory, Confederate reinforcements under General Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson counterattacked and sent the inexperienced Union troops in disorderly ﬂight back to Washington. The battle ended the illusion of a short war and also promoted the myth that the rebels were invincible in battle. 
Peninsula Campaign General George B. McClellan, the new commander 
of the Union army in the East, insisted that his troops be given a long period of training before going into battle. Finally, after many delays that tested Lincoln’s patience, McClellan’s army invaded Virginia in March 1862. The Union army was stopped by brilliant tactical moves by Confederate general Robert E. Lee, the commander of the South’s eastern forces. After ﬁve months, McClellan was forced to retreat and was ordered back to the Potomac, where he was replaced by General John Pope.

Major battle
Second Battle of Bull Run Lee struck quickly against Pope’s army in 
Northern Virginia. He drew Pope into a trap, struck the enemy’s ﬂank, and 
sent the Union army back to Bull Run. Pope withdrew to defend Washington. 
307  TOPIC 5.8    M ILITARY CONFLICT IN THE CIVIL WARAntietam  Following his victory at Bull Run, Lee led his army across the 
Potomac into Maryland. He hoped that a Confederate victory in a Union state 
would convince Britain to give recognition and support to the Confederacy. By this time (September 1862), Lincoln had restored McClellan to command. McClellan had the advantage of knowing Lee’s plan because a copy of it had been dropped accidentally by a Confederate ofﬁcer. The Union army intercepted the Confederates at Antietam  Creek in the Maryland town of Sharpsburg. Here 
the bloodiest single day of combat in the entire war took place, with more than 22,000 soldiers killed or wounded. 
Unable to break through Union lines, Lee’s army retreated to Virginia. 
Disappointed with McClellan for failing to pursue Lee’s army, Lincoln removed him for the ﬁnal time as the Union commander. 
While essentially a draw on the battlefield, Antietam was among the most 
significant battles of the war. Because the Confederates did not win, they failed to get what they so urgently needed—recognition and aid from Great Britain and France. Because the Union did not lose, Lincoln found enough encouragement in a Union victory. As explained in Topic 5.9, Lincoln used the partial triumph to announce a direct assault on the institution of slavery. 
Fredericksburg Replacing McClellan with the aggressive General Ambrose 
Burnside, Lincoln discovered that a strategy of reckless attack could have even worse consequences than McClellan’s strategy of caution. In December 1862, a Union army under Burnside attacked Lee’s army at Fredericksburg, Virginia, and suffered immense losses: 12,000 dead or wounded compared to 5,000 Confederate casualties. Both Union and Confederate generals were slow to learn that improved weaponry took the romance out of heroic charges against entrenched positions. By the end of 1862, the awful magnitude of the war was all too clear—with no prospect of victory for either side. 
The second year of war, 1862, was a disastrous one for the Union except for 
two engagements, one at sea and the other on the rivers of the West. 
Monitor vs. Merrimac  The Union’s hopes for winning the war depended 
upon its ability to maximize its economic advantages by an effective blockade of Confederate ports (the Anaconda Plan). During McClellan’s Peninsula campaign, the Union’s blockade strategy was jeopardized by an unusual Confederate ship, the Merrimac , that attacked and sank several Union ships 
near Hampton Roads, Virginia. Unlike the standard wooden ships of the day, the Merrimac was covered with metal plates. The “ironclad” seemed 
unstoppable. However, on March 9, 1862, the Union’s own ironclad, the Monitor, engaged the Merrimac  in a ﬁve-hour duel. The battle ended in a draw, 
but the Monitor prevented the Confederates’ new weapon from breaking the 
U.S. naval blockade. The two ships marked a turning point in naval warfare, as ironclad ships replaced wooden ones.
Grant in the West The battle of the ironclads occurred at about the same 
time as a bloodier encounter was taking place in western Tennessee. The Union’s campaign for control of the Mississippi River was partly under the command 
308 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONof a West Point graduate, Ulysses S. Grant, who had joined up for the war after 
an unsuccessful civilian career. Striking south from Illinois in early 1862, Grant used a combination of gunboats and army maneuvers to capture Fort Henry and Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River (a branch of the Mississippi). These stunning victories, in which 14,000 Confederate soldiers were taken prisoner, opened up the state of Mississippi to Union attack. 
A few weeks later, a Confederate army under Albert Johnston surprised 
Grant at Shiloh , Tennessee, but the Union army forced the Confederates to 
retreat after terrible losses on both sides (more than 23,000 dead and wounded). Grant’s drive down the Mississippi was complemented in April 1862 by the capture of New Orleans by the Union navy under David Farragut. 
Foreign Affairs and Diplomacy
The Confederacy’s hopes for independence hinged as much on its diplomats as on soldiers. Confederate leaders expected that cotton would prove to be “king” and induce Britain or France, or both, to give aid to their war effort. Besides cotton for their textile mills, wealthy British industrialists and aristocrats looked forward to ending the American democratic experiment. From the Union’s point of view, it was critically important to prevent the Confederacy from gaining the foreign support and recognition that it desperately needed. 
Trent  Affair  Britain came close to siding with the Confederacy in late 
1861 over an incident at sea. Confederate diplomats James Mason and John Slidell were traveling to England on a British steamer, the Trent, on a mission 
to gain recognition for their government. A Union warship stopped the British ship, removed Mason and Slidell, and brought them to the United States as prisoners of war. Britain threatened war over the incident unless the diplomats were released. Despite intense criticism, Lincoln gave in to British demands. Mason and Slidell were set free, but they failed to obtain full recognition of the Confederacy from either Britain or France. 
Confederate Raiders The British did allow the Confederates to purchase 
warships from British shipyards. These commerce-raiders did serious harm to U.S. merchant ships. One of them, the Alabama , captured more than 60 
vessels before being sunk off the coast of France by a Union warship. After the war, Great Britain eventually agreed to pay the United States $15.5 million for damages caused by Confederate attacks in ships built in Britain.
Failure of Cotton Diplomacy In the end, the Confederacy’s hopes for 
European intervention were disappointed. “King Cotton” did not have the power, as Europe quickly found ways of obtaining cotton from other sources. Shipments of cotton began arriving from Egypt and India for the British textile industry. Also, other materials could be used for textiles, and the woolen and linen industries took advantage of this opportunity. 
Two other factors went into Britain’s decision not to recognize the 
Confederacy. First, General Lee’s setback at Antietam played a role. Without a decisive Confederate victory, the British government would not risk 
309  TOPIC 5.8    M ILITARY CONFLICT IN THE CIVIL WARrecognition. Second, Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation (January 1863) 
made the end of slavery an objective of the Union, which appealed strongly to Britain’s working class. While conservative leaders of Britain were sympathetic to the Confederacy, they could not defy the pro-Northern, antislavery feelings of the British majority. 
The Union Triumphs, 1863–1865
By early 1863, the fortunes of war were turning against the Confederacy. Although General Lee started the year with a victory at Chancellorsville, Virginia, the Confederate economy was in bad shape as planters lost control of their slave labor, and an increasing number of starving soldiers were deserting the Confederate army. 
Turning Point
The decisive turning point in the war came in the ﬁrst week of July when the Confederacy suffered two crushing defeats in the West and the East. 
Vicksburg In the West, by the spring of 1863, Union forces controlled 
New Orleans as well as most of the Mississippi River and surrounding valley. The Union objective of securing complete control of the Mississippi River was close when General Grant began his siege of the heavily fortiﬁed city of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Union artillery bombarded Vicksburg for seven 
weeks before the Confederates ﬁnally surrendered the city (and nearly 29,000 soldiers) on July 4. Federal warships now controlled the full length of the Mississippi, which cut off Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas from the rest of the Confederacy. 
Gettysburg Meanwhile, in the East, Lee again took the offensive by 
leading an army into Maryland and Pennsylvania. If he could either destroy the Union army or capture a major Northern city, Lee hoped to force the Union to call for peace—or to gain foreign intervention for the Confederacy. On July 1, 1863, the Confederate army surprised Union units at Gettysburg in southern Pennsylvania. What followed was the most crucial battle of the war and the bloodiest, with more than 50,000 casualties. Lee’s assault on Union lines on the second and third days, including a famous but unsuccessful charge led by George Pickett, proved futile and destroyed part of the Confederate army. Lee’s forces retreated to Virginia, never to regain the offensive. 
Grant in Command
In Grant, Lincoln ﬁnally found a general who would ﬁght and could win. In early 1864, he brought Grant east to Virginia and made him commander of all Union armies. Grant settled on a strategy of war by attrition. He aimed to wear down the Confederacy’s armies and destroy their lines of supply. Fighting for months, Grant’s Army of the Potomac suffered heavier casualties than Lee’s forces in the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor. But Grant succeeded in reducing Lee’s army in each battle and forcing it into 
310 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONa defensive line around Richmond. Rather than a small-scale war “between 
gentlemen” over control of territory, the war had become more like a modern “total” war in which victory depended on undercutting civilian support for the opponent’s military.
Sherman’s March The chief instrument of Grant’s aggressive tactics for 
subduing the South was the veteran general William Tecumseh Sherman. Leading a force of 100,000 men, Sherman set out from Chattanooga, Tennessee, on a campaign of deliberate destruction that went across the state of Georgia and then swept north into South Carolina. Sherman was a pioneer of the tactics of total war. Marching through Georgia, his troops destroyed everything, burning cotton ﬁelds, barns, and houses—everything the enemy might use to survive. Sherman took Atlanta in September 1864 in time to help Lincoln’s reelection. He marched into Savannah in December and completed his campaign in February 1865 by setting ﬁre to Columbia, the capital of South Carolina and cradle of secession. Sherman’s march had its intended effect: to break the spirit of the Confederacy and destroy its will to ﬁght. 
The End of the War
The effects of the Union blockade, combined with Sherman’s march of destruction, spread hunger through much of the South in the winter of 1864–1865. In Virginia, Grant continued to outﬂank Lee’s lines until they collapsed around Petersburg, resulting in the fall of Richmond on April 3, 1865. Everyone knew the end was near. 
Surrender at Appomattox The Confederate government tried to negotiate 
for peace. However, Lincoln would accept nothing short of restoration of the Union, and Jefferson Davis still demanded nothing less than independence. Lee retreated from Richmond with an army of fewer than 30,000 men. He tried to escape to the mountains, only to be cut off and forced to surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, 1865. The Union general treated his longtime enemy with respect and allowed Lee’s men to return to their homes with their horses. 
Still to be seen were the long-term effects of the war. What would be the 
impact of the many changes led by Lincoln and his government on the policies, laws, and society of the United States? What would the nearly 4 million African Americans freed from slavery do as free people? What would happen to American democracy?

Government Policies During 
the Civil War
The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The 
occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise—with the occasion.
Abraham Lincoln, Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862
Learning Objective : Explain how Lincoln’s leadership during the Civil 
War impacted American ideals over the course of the war.
M ore than any previous president, Lincoln acted in unprecedented ways, 
drawing upon his powers as both chief executive and commander in chief, 
often without the authorization or approval of Congress. For example, right after the Fort Sumter crisis he (1) called for 75,000 volunteers to put down the “insurrection” in the Confederacy, (2) authorized spending for a war, and (3) suspended the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Since Congress was not in session, the president acted completely on his own authority, explaining that it was “indispensable to the public safety. ” 
The End of Slavery
Though Lincoln in the 1850s spoke out against slavery as “an unqualiﬁed evil, ” as president he hesitated to take action against slavery. Lincoln’s concerns included (1) a wish to keep the support of the border states, (2) the constitutional protections of slavery, (3) the racial prejudice of many Northerners, and (4) the fear that premature action could be overturned in the next election. All these concerns made the timing and method of ending slavery difficult. Enslaved individuals were freed during the war as a result of military events, governmental policy, and their own actions. 
Conﬁscation Acts
Early in the war (May 1861), several enslaved people escaped to the Union lines. General Benjamin Butler refused to return them to their Confederate owners, arguing that their labor could be used to help the Confederates. Therefore, they were “contraband, ” and he was not required to return them. Building on this example, Congress passed two laws known as the Confiscation Acts:
314 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION• The law passed in August 1861 gave the Union army the power to seize 
enemy property, including enslaved people, used to wage war against the United States. The law also empowered the president to use those freed in the Union army in any capacity, including battle.
• The law passed in July 1862 freed persons enslaved by any individual in rebellion against the United States.
Because of these laws, thousands of “contrabands” were using their feet to escape slavery by going into Union camps. As they did, they added pressure on the Union to abolish slavery. At the same time, they deprived the Confederacy of badly needed laborers to grow food to avoid starvation.
Emancipation Proclamation
By July 1862, Lincoln had decided to use his powers as commander in chief to free all enslaved persons in the states then at war. He justified his policy as a “military necessity. ” However, he worried that such a move would alienate conservative Northerners who were pro-Union and pro-slavery. Furthermore, the action might look desperate if it came when the army was losing battles, so he delayed announcement of the policy. At the same time, he encouraged the border states to plan for emancipation that provided compensation to the owners. No one proposed providing compensation to the freedpeople.
After the Confederates retreated at the Battle of Antietam on September 22, 
1862, Lincoln issued a warning that slaves in states still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, would be “then, thenceforward, and forever free. ” On the ﬁrst day of the new year, 1863, he issued his Emancipation Proclamation, which stated: 
I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States and parts of States are, and henceforward shall be, free; and that the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authorities thereof, shall recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons. 
Consequences Since the president’s proclamation applied only to the 
Confederate states outside Union control, it freed only about 1 percent of enslaved 
people. Slavery in the border states also continued. Still, the proclamation was 
important because it enlarged the purpose of the war by adding weight to the Confiscation Acts. Now Union armies were openly ﬁghting against slavery, not merely against secession. By the end of the war, hundreds of thousands of enslaved people had become free by escaping to Union lines. 
African Americans in the War 
An even greater blow to the Confederacy was that the Union army soon had thousands of dedicated new recruits. Almost 200,000 African Americans, most of whom had recently escaped slavery, served in the Union army and navy. Segregated into all-Black units, such as the Massachusetts 54th Regiment, they won the respect of White Union soldiers for their bravery under ﬁre. More than 37,000 African American soldiers died in this “ Army of Freedom. ”
315  TOPIC 5.9    G OVERNMENT POLICIES DURING THE CIVIL WAREffects of the War on Civilian Life
Both during the war and in the years that followed, American society underwent 
deep and sometimes wrenching changes. 
Political Change
The electoral process continued during the war with surprisingly few restrictions. Secession of the Southern states left Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. Northerners were split into several factions:
• Radical Republicans demanded immediate abolition of slavery.
• Free-Soil Republicans focused on economic opportunities for Whites. 
• Most Democrats supported the war but criticized Lincoln’s conduct of it. 
• Some Democrats, called Peace Democrats or Copperheads, opposed the war and wanted a negotiated peace. 
Civil Liberties Like many wartime leaders, Lincoln focused more on 
prosecuting the war than on protecting constitutional rights. Early in the war, he suspended the writ of habeas corpus in states with strong pro-Confederate sentiment. Suspension of this constitutional right meant that persons could be arrested without being informed of the charges against them. During the war, an estimated 13,000 people were arrested on suspicion of aiding the enemy. Without a right to habeas corpus, many of them were held without trial. 
Democrats accused Lincoln of tyranny, but most historians have been 
less critical. In the border states, people had difficulty distinguishing between combatants and noncombatants. Furthermore, the Constitution allows only Congress, not the president, to suspend the writ of habeas corpus “when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it. ” After the war, the Supreme Court ruled in Ex Parte Milligan (1866) that the government had 
improperly subjected civilians to military trials. The Court declared that such procedures could be used only when regular civilian courts were unavailable. 
The Draft When the war began in 1861, those who fought were volunteers. 
As the need for replacements increased, both the Union and the Confederacy resorted to laws for conscripting, or drafting, men into service. The Union’s March 1863 Conscription Act made all men aged 20 to 45 liable for military service. However, a draftee could avoid service by ﬁnding a substitute to serve or paying a $300 exemption fee. The law provoked ﬁerce opposition among poorer laborers, most of whom were Irish or German immigrants. They feared that when they returned to civilian life their jobs would be taken by freed African Americans. In July 1863, protests against the draft in New Y ork City quickly turned into a riot against the city’s Black residents. About 117 people were killed before federal troops and a temporary suspension of the draft restored order. 
The Election of 1864 The Democrats’ nominee for president was the 
popular General George McClellan, whose platform calling for peace had wide appeal among millions of war-weary voters. The Republicans renamed their 
316 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONparty the Unionist Party as a way of attracting the votes of “War Democrats” 
(those who disagreed with the Democratic platform). A brief “ditch Lincoln” movement ﬁzzled out, and the Republican (Unionist) convention again chose Lincoln as its presidential candidate and a loyal War Democrat from Tennessee, Senator Andrew Johnson, as his running mate. The Lincoln-Johnson ticket won 212 electoral votes to the Democrats’ 21. The popular vote was much closer as McClellan took 45 percent of the total votes cast. 
Political Dominance of the North The suspension of habeas corpus and 
the operation of the draft were only temporary. More important were the long-term effects of the power of the federal government and the balance of power between the North and the South. With the military triumph of the Union came a clearer deﬁnition of the nature of the federal union. Old arguments for nulliﬁcation and secession receded. After the Civil War, few people doubted the supremacy of the federal government. 
The abolition of slavery—in addition to its importance to freed African 
Americans—gave new meaning to the concept of American democracy. In his famous Gettysburg Address, November 19, 1863, Lincoln rallied Americans 
to the idea that their nation was “dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. ” Lincoln was probably alluding to the Emancipation Proclamation when he spoke of the war bringing “a new birth of freedom. ” His words—and even more, the abolition of slavery—advanced the cause of democratic government in the United States and inspired democracy around the world. 
Economic Change
The costs of the war in both money and men were staggering and called for extraordinary measures by the government. 
Financing the War The Union ﬁnanced the war by borrowing $2.6 billion 
through the sale of government bonds. To gain added funds, Congress raised tariffs, added excise taxes, and instituted the ﬁrst income tax. The U.S. Treasury also issued $430 million in a paper currency, greenbacks, not backed by gold, which contributed to creeping inﬂation. Prices in the North rose by about 80 percent during the war. To manage the added revenue Congress created a national banking system in 1863, the ﬁrst since Andrew Jackson vetoed the recharter of the Bank of the United States in the 1830s.

317  TOPIC 5.9    G OVERNMENT POLICIES DURING THE CIVIL WARModernizing Northern Society Economic historians differ on the 
question of whether, in the short run, the war promoted or retarded the growth 
of the Northern economy. Workers’ wages did not keep pace with inﬂation, but the war accelerated many aspects of a modern industrial economy. By placing a premium on mass production and complex organization, the war sped up the consolidation of the North’s manufacturing businesses. War proﬁteers took advantage of the need for military supplies to sell shoddy goods at high prices—a problem that decreased after the federal government took control of the contract process away from the states. Fortunes made during the war produced a concentration of capital in the hands of a new class of millionaires who would ﬁnance the North’s industrialization in the postwar years. 
Republican politics also stimulated the economic growth of the North and 
the West. With a wartime majority in Congress, the Republicans passed the probusiness Whig program that was designed to stimulate the industrial and commercial growth of the United States: 
• The Morrill Tariff Act (1861) raised tariff rates to increase revenue and protect American manufacturers. Its passage initiated a Republican program of high protective tariffs to help industrialists. 
• The Homestead Act  (1862) promoted settlement of the Great Plains by 
offering parcels of 160 acres of public land free to any person or family that farmed that land for at least ﬁve years. Like the headright system in colonial Virginia and the sale of land in the Northwest Territory, this act helped many White settlers, but very few African Americans.
• The Morrill Land Grant Act (1862) encouraged states to use the sale of federal land grants to found and maintain agricultural and technical colleges. These schools not only educated farmers, engineers, and scientists, but they also became centers of research and innovation.
• The Paciﬁc Railway Act (1862) authorized the building of a 
transcontinental railroad over a northern route in order to link the economies of California and the Western territories with the Eastern states. 
While four years of nearly total war, the tragic human loss of 750,000 lives 
and an estimated $15 billion in war costs and property losses had enormous effects on the nation, far greater changes were set in motion. The Civil War destroyed slavery and devastated the Southern economy. It also acted as a catalyst to transform America into a complex modern industrial society of capital, technology, national organizations, and large corporations. 
Assassination of Lincoln
Only a month before Lee’s surrender, Lincoln delivered one of his greatest speeches, the second inaugural address. He urged that the defeated South be treated benevolently, “with malice toward none; with charity for all. ”

Reconstruction
“The whole fabric of Southern society must be changed, and  
never can it be done if this opportunity is lost. Without this, this 
government can never be, as it never has been, a true republic.”
Thaddeus Stevens, September 6, 1865
Learning Objective : Explain the effects of government policy during 
Reconstruction on society from 1865 to 1877.
The silencing of the cannons of war left the victorious United States with 
immense challenges. How would the South rebuild its shattered society and 
economy after four years of war? What would be the place in that society of  
4 million freed Black Americans? How responsible was the federal government for helping former slaves adjust to freedom? Should the states of the Confederacy be treated as though they had never left the Union—Lincoln’s position—or as conquered territory under military occupation? Under what conditions would those states be fully accepted as equal partners in the Union? Finally, who had the authority to decide these questions, the president or Congress? 
Postwar Conditions
Slavery gradually crumbled as African Americans escaped to Union-controlled territory. The last people to hear they were free lived in Texas. The date they heard the news, June 19th, became a day for celebration known as Juneteenth.
Most freedpeople began their free lives with no money, no land, and no 
formal education. Near the end of the war, some freedpeople in South Carolina and Georgia received “40 acres and a mule” under an order from Union General William Sherman. However, this order was soon cancelled by President Andrew Johnson. The land they had was taken away from them.
The South was devastated by the war. It had lost about one-third of its 
horses, cattle, and hogs. Roads, bridges, railroad tracks, and fencing had been destroyed. Though people had not died from mass starvation as often happens in war, chronic food shortages, particularly for African Americans, left many in poor health and susceptible to epidemic diseases.
The regional, political, and economic conﬂicts that existed before and 
during the Civil War continued after the war. Northern Republicans wanted to continue the economic progress begun during the war. Southern aristocrats still wanted low-cost labor to work their plantations. The freedmen and 
321  TOPIC 5.10   R ECONSTRUCTIONfreedwomen hoped for independence and equal rights. However, traditional 
beliefs limited the actions of the federal government. Concepts of limited government and states’ rights discouraged national leaders from taking bold action. Little economic help was given to White or Black Southerners, as most Americans believed that people had an opportunity and a responsibility to care for themselves. The physical rebuilding of the South was left up to the states and individuals, while the federal government concentrated on political issues. 
Reconstruction Plans of Lincoln and Johnson
Throughout his presidency, Abraham Lincoln held ﬁrmly to the belief that the Southern states could not constitutionally leave the Union and therefore never did leave. He viewed the Confederates as only a disloyal minority. After Lincoln’s assassination, Andrew Johnson attempted to carry out Lincoln’s plan for the political Reconstruction  of the 11 former states of the Confederacy. 
Lincoln’s Policies
Lincoln believed the Southern states could regain their full place in the Union by meeting a minimum test of political loyalty. 
Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction (1863) As early as December 
1863, Lincoln set up a process for political reconstruction of the state governments in the South so that Unionists were in charge rather than secessionists. The president’s Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction was simple: 
• Full presidential pardons would be granted to most Confederates who (1) took an oath of allegiance to the Union and the U.S. Constitution, and (2) accepted the emancipation of slaves. 
• A state government could be reestablished and accepted as legitimate by the U.S. president as soon as at least 10 percent of the voters in that state took the loyalty oath. 
In practice, Lincoln meant that each Southern state would be required 
to rewrite its state constitution to abolish slavery. Lincoln’s seemingly lenient policy was designed both to shorten the war and to give added weight to his Emancipation Proclamation.
Wade-Davis Bill (1864) Many Republicans in Congress objected to 
Lincoln’s 10-percent plan, arguing that it would allow supposedly reconstructed state governments to be dominated by disloyal secessionists. In 1864, Congress passed the Wade-Davis Bill, which required 50 percent of the voters of a state to take a loyalty oath and permitted only non-Confederates to vote for a new state constitution. Lincoln pocket-vetoed the bill after Congress adjourned. Congress was ready to reassert its powers, as Congresses usually do after a war. 
Freedmen’s Bureau In March 1865, Congress created an important 
new agency: the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, or Freedmen’s Bureau. The bureau acted as a welfare agency, providing food, shelter, and medical aid for both Black and White Americans left destitute by 
322 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONthe war. At ﬁrst, the Freedmen’s Bureau had authority to resettle freedpeople on 
conﬁscated farmlands in the South. Its efforts at resettlement, however, were later frustrated when President Johnson pardoned Confederate owners of the conﬁscated lands, and courts restored most of the lands to their original owners. 
The bureau’s greatest success was in education. Under the able leadership of 
General Oliver O. Howard, it established nearly 3,000 schools for freedpeople, including several colleges. Before federal funding was stopped in 1870, the bureau’s schools taught an estimated 200,000 African Americans how to read. 
Johnson and Reconstruction
Andrew Johnson’s origins were as humble as Lincoln’s. A self-taught tailor, he rose in Tennessee politics by championing poor Whites in conﬂict with rich planters. Johnson was the only senator from a Confederate state who remained loyal to the Union. He was appointed Tennessee’s governor when it was occupied by Union troops. Johnson was a Southern Democrat, but Republicans picked him to encourage pro-Union Democrats to vote for Lincoln. Johnson ended up being the wrong man for the job. As a White supremacist, he was bound to clash with Republicans in Congress who believed that the war was fought not just to preserve the Union but also to liberate African Americans from slavery. 
Johnson’s Reconstruction Policy At ﬁrst, many Republicans in Congress 
welcomed Johnson’s presidency because of his animosity toward the Southern aristocrats who had led the Confederacy. In May 1865, Johnson issued his own Reconstruction plan. In addition to Lincoln’s terms, it provided for the disenfranchisement (loss of the right to vote and hold ofﬁce) of (1) all former leaders and ofﬁceholders of the Confederacy and (2) Confederates with more than $20,000 in taxable property. However, the president could grant individual pardons to “disloyal” Southerners. This was an escape clause for the wealthy planters, and Johnson made use of it. As a result of his pardons, many former Confederate leaders were back in ofﬁce by the fall of 1865. 
Johnson’s Vetoes One sign of the battle between Congress and the 
presidents was his use of the veto. The three presidents before Johnson vetoed a total of 23 bills. In his one term, he vetoed 29 bills. Johnson alienated even moderate Republicans in early 1866 with vetoes of two bills. One increased the services and protection of the Freedmen’s Bureau. The other was a civil rights bill that nulliﬁed the Black Codes and guaranteed full citizenship and equal rights to African Americans. The vetoes marked the end of the first round of Reconstruction. During this round, Presidents Lincoln and Johnson had restored the 11 former Confederate states to the Union, ex-Confederates had returned to high ofﬁces, and Southern states began passing Black Codes to restrict the rights of former slaves.
Congressional Reconstruction
By the spring of 1866, the angry response of many members of Congress to Johnson’s policies led to the second round of Reconstruction. This one was 
323  TOPIC 5.10   R ECONSTRUCTIONdominated by Congress and featured policies that were harsher on Southern 
Whites and more protective of freed African Americans.
Radical Republicans
Republicans had long been divided between (1) moderates, who were chieﬂy concerned with economic gains for the White middle class, and (2) radicals, who championed civil rights for Black citizens. Although most Republicans were moderates, several became more radical in 1866, partly out of fear that a reuniﬁed Democratic Party might again become dominant. After all, now that the federal census counted all people equally (no longer applying the old three-ﬁfths rule for enslaved persons), the South would have more representatives in Congress than before the war and more strength in the Electoral College. 
The leading Radical Republican in the Senate was Charles Sumner of 
Massachusetts. In the House, Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania hoped to revolutionize Southern society through a period of military rule in which African Americans could exercise their civil rights, attend schools operated by the federal government, and take ownership of lands conﬁscated from the planters. Many Radical Republicans endorsed several liberal causes: women’s suffrage, rights for labor unions, and civil rights for Northern African Americans. Although their program was never fully implemented, the Radical Republicans struggled to extend equal rights to all Americans. 
Thirteenth Amendment Laws, but not the U.S. Constitution, banned 
slavery. To free all enslaved people in the border states, the country needed to ratify an amendment. Even the abolitionists gave Lincoln credit for playing an active role in the political struggle to secure enough votes in Congress to pass the 13th Amendment. By December 1865 (months after Lincoln’s death), this 
amendment abolishing slavery was ratiﬁed by the required number of states. Its language was clear: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. ”
After the adoption of the 13th Amendment in 1865, 4 million people 
(3.5 million in the Confederate states and 500,000 in the border states) were “freedmen” and “freedwomen. ” For these people and their descendants, economic hardship and political oppression would continue for generations. Even so, the end of slavery represented a momentous step. Suddenly, formerly enslaved people who had no rights could claim protection by the U.S. Constitution and had open-ended possibilities of freedom. 
Civil Rights Act of 1866 Among the first actions in Congressional 
Reconstruction were votes to override, with some modiﬁcations, Johnson’s vetoes of both the Freedmen’s Bureau Act and the ﬁrst Civil Rights Act. The Civil Rights Act pronounced that all African Americans were U.S. citizens (thereby nullifying the decision in the Dred Scott case) and attempted to provide a legal shield against the operation of the Southern states’ Black Codes. Fearing that the law could be repealed if the Democrats ever won control of 
324 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONCongress, Republicans looked for a more permanent solution in the form of a 
constitutional amendment. 
Fourteenth Amendment In June 1866, Congress passed and sent to the 
states an amendment, ratiﬁed in 1868, that had immediate and even greater long-term signiﬁcance: 
• It declared that all persons born or naturalized in the United States were citizens.
• It obligated the states to respect the rights of U.S. citizens and provide them with “equal protection of the laws” and “due process of law.”  
For the ﬁrst time, the Constitution required states as well as the federal 
government to uphold the rights of citizens. The amendment’s key clauses about citizenship and rights produced mixed results in 19th-century courtrooms. However, in the 1950s and later, the Supreme Court used the power of the federal government to protect individuals from encroachment of their constitutional rights by state and local governments, making “equal protection of the laws” and the “due process” clause the keystone of civil rights for minorities, women, children, disabled persons, and those accused of crimes. 
Other parts of the 14th Amendment applied speciﬁcally to Congress’s plan 
of Reconstruction. These clauses:
• disqualiﬁed former Confederate political leaders from holding either state or federal ofﬁces 
• repudiated the debts of the defeated governments of the Confederacy 
• penalized a state if it kept any eligible person from voting by reducing that state’s proportional representation in Congress and the Electoral College 
Report of the Joint Committee In June 1866, a joint committee of the 
House and the Senate issued a report declaring that the reorganized Confederate states were not entitled to representation in Congress. Therefore, those elected from the South as senators and representatives should not be permitted to take their seats. The report further asserted that Congress, not the president, had the authority to determine the conditions for allowing reconstructed states to rejoin the Union. By this report, Congress ofﬁcially rejected the presidential plan of Reconstruction and promised to substitute its own plan, part of which was embodied in the 14th Amendment. 
The Election of 1866 Unable to work with Congress, Johnson took to 
the road in the fall of 1866 to attack his opponents. His speeches appealed to the racial prejudices of White citizens by arguing that equal rights for Black Americans would result in an “ Africanized” society. Republicans counterattacked by accusing Johnson of being a drunkard and a traitor. They appealed to anti-Southern prejudices by “waving the bloody shirt”—inﬂaming the anger of Northern voters by reminding them of the hardships of war. 
325  TOPIC 5.10   R ECONSTRUCTIONRepublican propaganda emphasized that Southerners were Democrats and, by 
a jump in logic, branded the Democrats a party of rebellion and treason. 
Election results gave the Republicans an overwhelming victory. After 1866, 
Johnson’s political adversaries—both moderate and Radical Republicans—had more than a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate. 
Reconstruction Acts of 1867 Over Johnson’s vetoes, Congress passed three 
Reconstruction Acts in 1867 that placed the South under military occupation. The acts divided the former Confederate states into ﬁve military districts, each under the control of the Union army. In addition, the acts increased the requirements for gaining readmission to the Union: an ex-Confederate state had to ratify the 14th Amendment and place guarantees in its constitution to grant the franchise (right to vote) to all adult males, regardless of race. 
Impeachment of Andrew Johnson
Also in 1867, Congress passed the Tenure of Ofﬁce Act over Johnson’s veto. This law prohibited the president from removing a federal ofﬁcial or military commander without Senate approval. The purpose of the law was strictly political. Congress wanted to protect the Radical Republicans in Johnson’s cabinet, such as Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, who was in charge of the military governments in the South.
Johnson challenged the constitutionality of the new law by dismissing 
Stanton. The House responded by impeaching Johnson. He was charged with 11 “high crimes and misdemeanors, ” thus becoming the ﬁrst president to be impeached. In 1868, after a three-month Senate trial, Johnson’s foes fell one vote short of the two-thirds vote needed to remove him from ofﬁce. 
Reforms After Grant’s Election
The impeachment and trial of Andrew Johnson occurred in 1868, a presidential election year. At their convention, the Democrats nominated another candidate, Horatio Seymour, so that Johnson’s presidency would have ended soon in any case, with or without a conviction in Congress. 
The Election of 1868 At their presidential convention, the Republicans 
turned to a war hero, General Ulysses S. Grant, even though he had no political experience. Despite Grant’s popularity in the North, he managed to win only 300,000 more popular votes than his Democratic opponent. The votes of 500,000 Black men gave the Republican ticket its margin of victory. Even the most moderate Republicans began to realize that the voting rights of the freedmen needed federal protection if their party hoped to keep control of the White House in future elections. 
Fifteenth Amendment Republican majorities in Congress acted 
quickly in 1869 to secure the vote for African Americans. Adding one more Reconstruction amendment to those already adopted (the 13th Amendment in 1865 and the 14th Amendment in 1868), Congress passed the 15th Amendment, which prohibited any state from denying or abridging a citizen’s 
326 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONright to vote “on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. ” It 
was ratified in 1870. While it banned open racial discrimination in voting laws, it did not prevent states from passing other restrictions on voting rights that disproportionately affected African Americans.
Civil Rights Act of 1875 The last civil rights reform passed by Congress 
during Reconstruction was the Civil Rights Act of 1875. This guaranteed equal accommodations in public places (hotels, railroads, and theaters) and prohibited courts from excluding African Americans from juries. The law was poorly enforced, as moderate and conservative Republicans tired of trying to reform an unwilling South and feared losing White votes in the North. By 1877, Reconstruction was abandoned by Congress. 
Reconstruction in the South
During the second round of Reconstruction by Congress, the Republican Party in the South dominated the governments of the former Confederate states. Beginning in 1867, each Republican-controlled government was under the military protection of the Army until Congress was satisﬁed that a state had met its Reconstruction requirements. Then the troops were withdrawn. The period of Republican rule in a Southern state lasted from as little as one year (Tennessee) to as much as nine years (Florida), depending on how long it took conservative Democrats to regain control.

327  TOPIC 5.10   R ECONSTRUCTIONComposition of the Reconstruction Governments
In every Republican state government in the South except South Carolina, 
Whites were in the majority in both houses of the legislature. In South Carolina, freedmen controlled the lower house in 1873. Republican legislators included native-born White Southerners, freedmen, and recently arrived Northerners. 
“Scalawags” and “Carpetbaggers” Democratic opponents derisively 
called Southern Republicans “scalawags” and Northern newcomers “carpetbaggers” (after cheap luggage made from carpet fabric). Southern Whites who supported the Republican governments were usually former Whigs who were interested in economic development for their states and peace between the sections. Northerners went south after the war for various reasons. Some were investors interested in setting up new businesses, while others were ministers and teachers with humanitarian goals. Some went simply to plunder. 
African American Legislators Most African Americans who held elective 
ofﬁce in the reconstructed state governments were educated property holders who took moderate positions on most issues. During the Reconstruction era, Republicans in the South sent two African Americans, Blanche K. Bruce and Hiram Revels, to the Senate and more than a dozen African Americans to the House of Representatives. Revels was elected in 1870 to take the Mississippi Senate seat once held by Jefferson Davis. Seeing African Americans and former slaves in positions of power caused bitter resentment among ex-Confederates. 
African Americans Adjusting to Freedom
Undoubtedly, the Southerners who had the greatest adjustment to make during the Reconstruction era were the freedmen and freedwomen. Having been so recently emancipated from slavery, they were faced with the challenges of securing their economic survival as well as their political rights as citizens. 
Building Black Communities Freedom meant many things to African 
Americans: reuniting families, learning to read and write, or migrating to cities where “freedom was freer. ” Most of all, formerly enslaved people viewed emancipation as an opportunity for achieving independence from White control. This drive for autonomy was most evident in the founding of hundreds of independent African American churches after the war. By the hundreds of thousands, Black members left White-dominated churches for the Negro Baptist and African Methodist Episcopal churches. During Reconstruction, Black ministers emerged as leaders in the African American community. 
The desire for education induced large numbers of African Americans to 
use their scarce resources to establish independent schools for their children and to pay educated African Americans to become their teachers. Black colleges such as Howard, Atlanta, Fisk, and Morehouse were established during Reconstruction to prepare African American ministers and teachers. 
Another aspect of African Americans’ search for independence and self-
sufﬁciency was the decision of many freedpeople to migrate away from the South and establish new Black communities in frontier states such as Kansas.

The North During Reconstruction
The North’s economy in the postwar years continued to be driven by the 
Industrial Revolution and the probusiness policies of the Republicans. As the South struggled to reorganize its labor system, Northerners focused on railroads, steel, labor problems, and money. 
Greed and Corruption
During the Grant administration, as the material interests of the age took center stage, the idealism of Lincoln’s generation and the Radical Republicans’ crusade for civil rights were pushed aside. 
Rise of the Spoilsmen In the early 1870s, Republican Party leadership 
passed from reformers (Thaddeus Stevens, Charles Sumner, and Benjamin Wade ) to political manipulators such as senators Roscoe Conkling of New 
Y ork and James Blaine of Maine. These politicians were masters of the game of patronage—giving jobs and government favors (spoils) to their supporters. 
Corruption in Business and Government The postwar years were 
notorious for the corrupt schemes devised by business bosses and political bosses to enrich themselves at the public’s expense. For example, in 1869, Wall Street ﬁnanciers Jay Gould  and James Fisk obtained the help of President 
Grant’s brother-in-law in a scheme to corner the gold market. The Treasury Department broke the scheme, but not before Gould had made a huge proﬁt. 
In the Crédit Mobilier affair, insiders gave stock to inﬂuential members 
of Congress to avoid investigation of the proﬁts they were making—as high as 348 percent—from government subsidies for building the transcontinental railroad. In the case of the Whiskey Ring, federal revenue agents conspired with the liquor industry to defraud the government of millions in taxes. While Grant himself did not personally proﬁt from the corruption, his loyalty to dishonest men around him badly tarnished his presidency. 
Local politics in the Grant years were equally scandalous. In New Y ork 
City, William Tweed, the boss of the local Democratic Party, masterminded 
dozens of schemes for helping himself and his cronies steal $200 million from New Y ork’s taxpayers before The New York Times and the cartoonist Thomas 
Nast  exposed “Boss” Tweed and brought about his arrest and imprisonment 
in 1871. 
329  TOPIC 5.10   R ECONSTRUCTIONThe Election of 1872
The scandals of the Grant administration drove reform-minded Republicans to 
break with the party in 1872 and select Horace Greeley , editor of the New York 
Tribune, as their presidential candidate. The Liberal Republicans  advocated 
civil-service reform, an end to railroad subsidies, withdrawal of troops from the South, reduced tariffs, and freer trade. Surprisingly, the Democrats also nominated Greeley. The regular Republicans countered by merely “waving the bloody shirt” again—and it worked. Grant was reelected in a landslide. 
The Panic of 1873
Grant’s second term began with an economic disaster that rendered thousands of Northern laborers both jobless and homeless. Overspeculation by ﬁnanciers and overbuilding by industry and railroads led to widespread business failures and depression. Debtors on the farms and in the cities argued about what should be done. Grant ﬁnally adopted the ideas of Eastern bankers and creditors, setting a new trend for the Republican Party. Black Southerners were the biggest losers, as preoccupation with the financial crisis diverted the North’s attention away from what was happening in the South. 
Women’s Changing Roles
Every part of American society away from the battleﬁeld was touched by the war. The impact of the war on the roles and opportunities of women was significant.
The absence of millions of men from the ﬁelds and factories added to the 
responsibilities of women in all regions. They stepped into the vacuum created by the war, operating farms and plantations and taking factory jobs customarily held by men. In addition, women played a critical role as military nurses and as volunteers in soldiers’ aid societies. When the war ended and the war veterans returned home, most urban women vacated their jobs in government and industry, while rural women gladly accepted male assistance on the farm.
Women’s Suffrage
The responsibilities undertaken by women during the war also boosted demands for equal voting rights for women. Some members of the women’s suffrage movement who had worked tirelessly for the abolition of slavery opposed the passage of the 14th and 15th Amendments. While they supported extending the franchise to African Americans, they objected to the fact that these amendments specifically limited it to men. Ironically, this was the first time sex was mentioned in the Constitution, in an amendment meant to extend rights but that ended up discriminating against half the nation’s citizens.
In 1869, Wyoming Territory became the first territory or state to grant 
women full suffrage rights. The suffragists’ goal would not be achieved until women’s efforts in another war—World War I— ﬁnally convinced enough male conservatives to adopt the 19th Amendment, with wording that echoed that of the 15th Amendment.

Topic 5.11
Failure of Reconstruction
Though slavery was abolished, the wrongs of my people were not  
ended. Though they were not slaves, they were not yet quite free. 
Frederick Douglass, 1882 
Learning Objective : Explain how and why Reconstruction resulted in 
continuity and change in regional and national understandings of what  
it meant to be American.
Views of Reconstruction have varied greatly. Many historians have seen it 
as a missed opportunity to promote racial equality. However, some have 
pointed out that the institutions and amendments from the Reconstruction era provided the foundation for the civil rights movement that emerged nearly a century after the Civil War ended.
Lincoln’s Last Speech
In his last public address (April 11, 1865), Lincoln encouraged Northerners to accept Louisiana as a reconstructed state. (Louisiana had already drawn up a new constitution that abolished slavery in the state and provided for African Americans’ education.) The president also addressed the question—highly controversial at the time—of whether freedmen should be granted the right to vote. Lincoln said: “I myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very 
intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers. ” Three days later, Lincoln’s evolving plans for Reconstruction were ended with his assassination. His last speech suggested that, had he lived, he probably would have moved closer to the position taken by the progressive, or Radical, Republicans. In any event, hope for lasting reform was dealt a devastating blow by the sudden removal of Lincoln’s skillful leadership. 
Evaluating the Republican Record
As mentioned in Topic 5.10, Congress and presidents fought over specific amendments, laws, and actions. In evaluating Reconstruction, it is particularly useful to look at the controversial record of the Republicans during their brief control of Southern state politics. Did they abuse their power for selﬁsh ends (corruption and plunder), or did they govern responsibly in the public interest? They did some of each. 
333  TOPIC 5.11   F AILURE OF RECONSTRUCTIONAccomplishments On the positive side, Republican legislators liberalized 
state constitutions in the South by providing for universal male suffrage, 
property rights for women, debt relief, and modern penal codes. They promoted the building of railroads, roads, bridges, and other internal improvements. They established such institutions as hospitals, asylums, and homes for the disabled. The reformers provided for state-supported public-school systems, which beneﬁted Whites and African Americans alike. They paid for all of this by overhauling the tax system and selling bonds.
Failures  Long after Reconstruction ended, many Southerners and some 
Northern historians continued to depict Republican rule as utterly wasteful and corrupt. Some instances of graft and wasteful spending did occur, as Republican politicians took advantage of their power to take kickbacks and bribes from contractors who did business with the state. However, corruption occurred throughout the country, in Northern states and cities as well. No geographic section, political party, or ethnic group was immune to the decline in ethics in government during the postwar era. 
The End of Reconstruction
The way Reconstruction ended shows how it failed to fulfill the nation’s needs. During Grant’s second term, it was apparent that Reconstruction had entered a third phase, which would be its final one. With Radical Republicanism on the wane, Southern conservatives—known as redeemers —took control of one state 
government after another. This process was completed by 1877. The redeemers had different backgrounds, but they agreed on their political program: states’ rights, reduced taxes and spending on social programs, and White supremacy. 
White Supremacy and the Ku Klux Klan
During the period that Republicans controlled state governments in the South, some Whites organized secret societies to intimidate African Americans and White reformers. The most prominent of these was the Ku Klux Klan, founded in 1867 by a former Confederate general, Nathaniel Bedford Forrest. The “invisible empire” burned Black-owned buildings and ﬂogged and murdered several thousand freedmen to keep them from exercising their voting rights. To give federal authorities the power to stop Ku Klux Klan violence and to protect the civil rights of citizens, Congress passed the Force Acts of 1870 and 1871. 
Southern Governments Just eight months after Johnson took ofﬁce 
in 1865, all 11 of the ex-Confederate states qualiﬁed under the president’s Reconstruction plan to become part of the Union. The Southern states drew up constitutions that repudiated secession, negated the debts of the Confederate government, and ratiﬁed the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. On the other hand, none of the new constitutions extended voting rights to Blacks citizens. Furthermore, to the dismay of Republicans, former leaders of the Confederacy won seats in Congress. For example, Alexander Stephens, the former Confederate vice president, was elected U.S. senator from Georgia. 
334 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONBlack Codes The Republicans became further disillusioned with Johnson 
as Southern state legislatures adopted Black Codes that restricted the rights 
and movements of African Americans:
• They could not rent land or nor borrow money to buy land. 
• They could not testity against Whites in court.
• They had to sign work agreements or they could be arrested for vagrancy. Under this contract-labor system, African Americans worked cotton ﬁelds under White supervision for deferred wages.
The costs of being convicted of any crime could be disastrous for an 
African American. The 13th Amendment had abolished slavery “except as a punishment for crime. ” Hence, a person convicted of a minor or even made-up offense could be rented from the government by a landowner or business and used as essentially slave labor.
Sharecropping  The South’s agricultural economy was in turmoil after the 
war, in part because landowners had lost their compulsory labor force. At ﬁrst, White landowners attempted to force freed African Americans into signing contracts to work the ﬁelds. These contracts set terms that bound the signer to almost permanent and unrestricted labor. African Americans’ insistence on autonomy, however, combined with changes in the postwar economy, led White landowners to adopt a system based on tenancy and sharecropping. Under sharecropping , the landlord provided the seed and needed farm supplies in 
return for a share (usually half) of the harvest. 
While sharecropping gave poor people of all races in the rural South the 
opportunity to work a piece of land for themselves, sharecroppers usually remained dependent on the landowners or in debt to local merchants. By 1880, no more than 5 percent of Southern African Americans owned their own land. Sharecropping had evolved into a new form of servitude. 
The Amnesty Act of 1872
Seven years after Lee’s surrender at Appomattox, many Northerners were ready to put the war behind them. In 1872 Congress passed a general Amnesty Act that removed the last restrictions on ex-Confederates, except for the top leaders. The chief political consequence of the act was to allow Southern conservatives to vote for Democrats and thus to retake control of state governments. 
The Election of 1876
By 1876, federal troops had been withdrawn from all Southern states except—South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. The Democrats had returned to power in all of the other former Confederate states. This was important in the presidential election. 
At their convention, the Republicans looked for someone untouched by 
the corruption of the Grant administration. They nominated the governor of Ohio, Rutherford B. Hayes. The Democrats chose New Y ork’s reform governor, 
335  TOPIC 5.11   F AILURE OF RECONSTRUCTIONSamuel J. Tilden , who had fought the corrupt Tweed Ring. In the popular 
votes, the Democrats won a clear majority and expected to put Tilden in the 
White House. However, in three Southern states, the returns were contested. To win the election, Tilden needed only one electoral vote from the contested 
returns of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. 
A special electoral commission was created to determine who was entitled 
to the disputed votes of the three states. In a straight party vote of 8–7, the commission gave all the votes to Hayes, the Republican. Outraged Democrats threatened to ﬁlibuster the results and send the election to the House of Representatives, which they controlled. 
The Compromise of 1877
Leaders of the two parties worked out an informal deal. The Democrats would allow Hayes to become president. In return, he would (1) immediately end federal support for the Republicans in the South, and (2) support the building of a Southern transcontinental railroad. Shortly after his inauguration, President Hayes fulﬁlled his part in the Compromise of 1877 and promptly withdrew the last of the federal troops protecting African Americans and other Republicans. 
The end of a federal military presence in the South was not the only thing 
that brought Reconstruction to an end. In a series of decisions in the 1880s and 1890s, the Supreme Court struck down a number of Reconstruction laws that protected Black citizens from discrimination. Even though some Southern leaders called for a “New South” based on industrial development, most Southerners, regardless of race, remained poor farmers. The region fell further behind the rest of the nation in prosperity. 
By 1877 the nation was more interested in its recent Centennial 
celebration and was again looking westward and for industrial growth. Tired of Reconstruction, the majority left it to the historians to decide the success or failure of Reconstruction. 
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  DID RECONSTRUCTION FAIL? 
Historical opinions on Reconstruction have changed dramatically over the past century. Scholars have disagreed over how well it worked and who deserves praise or blame for what happened.
Blame for Too Much Equality Generations of both Northern and 
Southern historians, starting with William Dunning in the early 1900s, portrayed Reconstruction as a failure. Dunning and others charged that illiterate African Americans and corrupt Northern carpetbaggers abused the rights of Southern Whites and stole vast sums from the state governments. These historians blamed the Radical Republicans for bringing on these conditions by their desire to punish the South and to give formerly enslaved people too many rights. The Dunning school of historical thought provided a rationale for the racial segregation in the early 20th century. It was given popular expression in a 1915 movie, D. W . Grifﬁth’s The Birth of a Nation, which pictured the Ku 

336 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONKlux Klansmen as heroes coming to the rescue of Southern Whites oppressed 
by vindictive Northern radicals and African Americans. 
Praise for Accomplishments African American historians such as W . E. B. 
Du Bois and John Hope Franklin countered Dunning by highlighting the positive achievements of the Reconstruction governments and Black leaders. Their view was supported and expanded upon in 1965 with the publication of Kenneth Stampp’s Era of Reconstruction. Other historians of the 1960s and 
1970s also stressed the signiﬁcance of the civil rights legislation passed by the Radical Republicans and pointed out the humanitarian work of Northern reformers. 
Blame for Too Little Equality By the 1980s, some historians criticized 
Congress’s approach to Reconstruction, not for being too radical, but for being not radical enough. They argued that Congress failed to provide land for African Americans, which would have enabled them to achieve economic independence. Furthermore, these historians argued, the military occupation of the South should have lasted longer to protect the freedmen’s political rights. Eric Foner’s comprehensive Reconstruction: America’s Unﬁnished Revolution (1988) acknowledged the limitations of Reconstruction in achieving lasting reforms but also pointed out that, in the post-Civil War years, the freedmen and freedwomen established many of the institutions in the African American community upon which later progress depended: churches, schools, universities, and businesses. According to Foner, it took a “second Reconstruction” after World War II (the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s) to achieve the promise of the “ﬁrst Reconstruction. ”

century, the United States, for a moment, offered the freedmen a measure of political control over their own destinies. However brief its sway, Reconstruction allowed scope for a remarkable political and social mobilization of the black community. It opened doors of opportunity that could never be completely closed. Reconstruction transformed the lives of Southern blacks in ways unmeasurable by statistics and unreachable by law. It raised their expectations and aspirations, redefined their status in relation to the larger society, and allowed space for the creation of institutions that enabled them to survive the repression that followed. And it established constitutional principles of civil and political equality that, while flagrantly violated after Redemption, planted the seeds of future struggle. ”
Eric Foner, “The New View of Reconstruction, ”  
American Heritage, 1983
“Reconstruction, which was far from radical, constituted the most democratic decades of the nineteenth century, South or North, so much so that it amounted to the first progressive era in the nation’s history. Just ten years after Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney endorsed the expansion of slavery into the western territories and announced that black Americans, even if free born, could not be citizens of the republic, blacks were fighting for the franchise in northern states; battling to integrate streetcars in Charleston, New Orleans, and San Francisco; funding integrated public schools; and voting and standing for office in the erstwhile Confederacy. . . . Black veterans, activists, ministers, assemblymen, registrars, poll workers, editors, and a handful of dedicated white allies risked their lives in this cause, nearly brought down a racist president, but ultimately lost their fight because of white violence. ”

Comparison in Period 5
Learning Objective : Compare the relative significance of the effects of 
the Civil War on American values.
The reasoning process of comparison  is based on describing similarities and 
differences between specific historical developments. It helps highlight the 
many factors that show the effects of the Civil War on American values. 
For example, consider the role of Manifest Destiny in influencing Americans 
and how they viewed slavery. Use historical reasoning  to understand how 
expansion affected those who wanted new land and the expansion of slavery as opposed to those who wanted to abolish slavery or to reserve western lands for White settlers as the nation extended its borders. For some on each side, this was a question supported by historical evidence  from many areas including 
economic, cultural (religious), and regional interests. 
The development of distinct views on slavery and the Civil War continued 
through Reconstruction. Presidents Lincoln and Johnson proposed quick reunification and forgiveness of the former Confederates. In contrast, Radical Republicans wanted to control the rebels and protect the rights of those formerly enslaved. What was the general reaction of the majority of Americans? Overall, the country supported equal rights as reflected in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, yet many people supported or at least accepted Black Codes and the idea of White supremacy. Reasoned comparison of the evidence is needed to understand American values during this period.
QUESTIONS ABOUT COMPARISON
Use the questions below to make a historically defensible claim.
1. Explain the extent to which people in the North and South held different views on Manifest Destiny. For example, compare how Northerners viewed expansion as new lands for immigrants and the market revolution while Southerners saw it as a way to spread slavery. 
2. Explain the extent of the impact on the country of parallel efforts by Northerners and Southerners to compromise over the issue of slavery in the 1840s and 1850s. For example, compare the acceptance by Northerners and Southerners of banning slave trading in Washington, D.C., but allowing ownership of enslaved people to continue. 
340 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONTHINK AS A HISTORIAN:  SUPPORT, MODIFY, AND REFUTE CLAIMS
An important part of the skill of argumentation is being able to respond to a 
claim or argument that a source makes. Y ou can usually respond in three ways:
• Support a claim: This means you provide reasons, quotations, facts, 
statistics, visuals, or other evidence to back up the claim. This evidence should be logical, relevant, and from a reliable source.
• Modify a claim: When you modify a claim, you provide evidence that 
part of it is true and part of it is false. Or perhaps part is relevant and part is not relevant, or part is accurate and part is exaggerated.
• Refute a claim: This means you provide evidence that the claim is not 
true. For instance, you might provide different statistics from a more reliable source, or an eyewitness account that contradicts the claim.
Consider how one argument might be supported, modified, or refuted. 
Argument: Abraham Lincoln’s performance in the Lincoln-Douglas debates 
made it a certainty that he would become president.
• Statement 1: After the debates, Lincoln lost the election to Douglas.
• Statement 2: Lincoln’s ideas and performance made him well-known.
• Statement 3: Although Lincoln won the Republican nomination in 1860, 
he had to run against candidates from three other parties.
Which statement supports the argument, which modifies it, and which 
refutes it? Take a few moments to decide before reading further.
Statement 1 refutes the argument by pointing out that Lincoln lost the 
election. Statement 2 supports the argument. If the debates had interested local voters only, then Lincoln would not have become well known nationally. Statement 3 qualifies the argument. People often assume that there have always been two parties in U.S. politics, but there have at times been more than that.
Read the argument and statements. Then answer the questions.
Argument: Lincoln’s handling of the crisis at Fort Sumter showed his 
willingness to plunge the country into civil war.
• Statement 1: Lincoln said, “The government will not assail you. Y ou can 
have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. ”
• Statement 2: Lincoln chose to resupply the fort even though it was 
unfinished and already obsolete. 
• Statement 3: Lincoln did not abandon the fort, but he did not send troops 
to it either. He merely sent supplies to the soldiers already there.
1. Which statement supports the claim? Explain your answer.
2. Which statement modifies the claim? Explain your answer.
3. Which statement refutes the claim? Explain your answer.

1844–1877
WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  DEVELOP A THESIS
The thesis statement must 1) assert a historically defensible claim, 2) lay out 
a line of reasoning, and 3) directly address the topic and focus of the task. 
Historically Defensible Claim A thesis, or claim, is a nonfactual 
statement asserted to be true. It is a statement about which people can disagree because it requires an explanation or evaluation. A historically defensible claim is one that can be supported with sound historical evidence. For example, a writer could claim that building railroads contributed to the Civil War. This is a defensible claim because it could point to how railroads connected the Northeast and Midwest more than they did the South. Others could disagree, noting that the South needed fewer railroads because it was linked to the Northeast through the cotton industry and the Midwest through trade on the Mississippi River.
Line of Reasoning A thesis or claim also conveys a line of reasoning for the 
argument that will be used to explain the relationships among pieces of evidence. In the thesis on railroads, for example, the line of reasoning uses comparison:  
the similarities and differences in regional ties. Other lines of reasoning include causation and continuity/change. Each line of reasoning needs to be embedded in a strong thesis statement.
Topic and Focus of Task A strong thesis or claim directly addresses 
the topic and focus of the task. It must be limited to the time and geography stated in the long essay question. Questions often ask the writer to “evaluate the extent” to which something happened. Which historical events or trends were the most important, significant, influential, long-lasting, or in other ways largest in scope? What evidence supports your evaluation? 
Application: Read the following long essay question and a thesis statement 
developed to address it. Evaluate the thesis statement on how well it 1) expresses 
a historically defensible claim, 2) embeds a line of reasoning, and 3) addresses the topic and task, including evaluating extent, and stays within the limitations of the question. Revise the thesis statement as appropriate so that it meets all three standards.
Long Essay Question: Evaluate the extent of the importance of the efforts of the 
Confederate states in gaining international support during the Civil War.
Thesis Statement : Between 1861 and 1865, Confederate failure to gain international 
support was a primary reason the Union won the Civil War.

A country has no right to adopt a policy, however gainful, which, as it may

When through the results of war, territory comes into the possession of the

Learning Objective 1 : Explain the historical context for the rise of industrial 
capitalism in the United States during the period from 1865 to 1898. 
Learning Objective 2 : Explain a historical context for the increased 
international and internal migration in the United States during the period 
from 1865 to 1898.
Between the end of the Civil War in 1865 and the start of the Spanish-
American War in 1898, the United States emerged as the world’s largest 
economy. Railroads expanded more than 45,000 miles a decade, faster than in others countries. During this “Gilded Age, ” the “captains of industry” controlled large corporations, created great fortunes, and lived in European-style palaces. The context for the rise of large-scale industries and capitalism involved a variety of economic, political, social, and cultural developments.
Economic Changes Large-scale industries, such as railroads, steel mills, 
and mining, were capital intensive. Europeans with surplus wealth joined well-
to-do Americans to fund stock and bond sales needed for expanding industries. Many businesses were based in New Y ork City, which was home to large banks, stock exchanges, and leaders of industry, such as the Astors and Vanderbilts.
The dynamic advances in technology  increased productivity of large-scale 
industries, such as the steel industry, which made steel cheaper and stronger. The 440,000 new patents from 1860 to 1890 sparked a “second” industrial revolution based on new electric- and oil-related technologies.
Industries depended on expanding markets  connected by railroads, 
steamships, and networks of telegraphs, cables, and later telephones. For example, the meatpacking houses of Chicago and the steel mills of Pittsburgh reached their customers in days instead of weeks. American industries also began to look for international markets in Europe, Latin America, and Asia.
Political Change American businesses also benefited from pro-growth 
government policies that protected property rights, refrained from regulating business operations, sheltered domestic manufacturers with high tariffs, and subsidized railroads with land grants and loans. However, federal, state, and local governments largely ignored the problems of workers, farmers, consumers, and growing cities. The lack of action in these areas generated debates over the UNIT 6 — Period 6: 1865–1898
347  TOPIC 6.1   C ONTE xTUALIz ING PERIOD 6proper role of government in the economy. During this period, the economy 
suffered panics and depressions, and large inequities in wealth distribution.
Migration and Urbanization Opportunities in growing industrial cities 
and westward expansion pulled many migrants  from rural areas within the 
country as well as from abroad. During the late 1800s, large waves of “new” immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and Asia entered the United States. Migration benefited economic growth and cultural diversity, but it also produced conflicts and threatened the very existence of Native Americans.
Industrialization also accelerated urban development . Unplanned and 
unregulated growth produced cities that lacked sanitary systems, degraded the environment, and had weak law enforcement. Low wages, lack of housing, and overcrowding resulted in squalid conditions for many migrant families. However, an expanding middle class enjoyed  more leisure time and developed  
an urban culture featuring new forms of sports, music, and theater.
The successes and failures of the period inspired new intellectual movements 
that both supported and challenged laissez-faire capitalism and the social order of the Gilded Age. Industrialization and urbanization stimulated new ideas about government, religion, education, architecture, literature, and the arts. 
Reform Efforts In response to these economic and cultural changes, 
reform movements arose. Workers, farmers, and the growing middle class began to demand changes in economic, political, and cultural institutions. Farm organizations protested against unfair railroad rates and banking practices, while industrial workers fought for higher wages and the right to organize. Women organized to gain voting rights and led the campaign for temperance. Many reform movements did not succeed at first, but they did provide the 20th century with the reform ideas and political organizations to implement them.

Walt Whitman, 1865
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the settlement  
of the West from 1877 to 1898.
The development of the western United States after 1865 differed from 
the settlement patterns of the colonial and early national frontiers because 
of industrialization. The most apparent difference was the building of transcontinental railroads across the Far West. 
Transcontinental Railroads 
The great age of railroad building coincided with the settlement of the last western frontiers. Railroads not only promoted settlement on the Great Plains, but they also linked the West with the East to create one great national market.
The First Route During the Civil War, Congress authorized land grants 
and loans for the building of the first transcontinental railroad to tie California to the rest of the Union. Two newly incorporated railroad companies divided the task. The Union Pacific (UP) started from Omaha, Nebraska, and built westward across the Great Plains. The UP employed thousands of war veterans and Irish immigrants under the direction of General Grenville Dodge. The Central Pacific started from Sacramento, California, and built eastward. Led by Charles Crocker, the workers, including as many as 20,000 Chinese immigrants, took on the great risks of laying track and blasting tunnels through the Sierra Nevada Mountains. 
The two railroads came together on May 10, 1869, at Promontory Point, 
Utah, where a golden spike was ceremoniously driven into the rail tie to mark the linking of the Atlantic and the Pacific states.
Four Additional Routes In 1883, three other transcontinental railroads 
were completed. The Southern Pacific tied New Orleans to Los Angeles. The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe linked Kansas City and Los Angeles. The Northern Pacific connected Duluth, Minnesota, with Seattle, Washington. In 
349  TOPIC 6.2   WESTWARD E xPANSION : ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  1893, the Great Northern finished the fifth transcontinental railroad, which ran 
from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Seattle. Companies built many other shortline and narrow-gauge railroads to open up the western interior to settlement by miners, ranchers, farmers, and business owners, leading to more towns and cities. 
Negative Effects Progress came with significant costs. The railroads 
helped to transform the West during this period, but many proved failures as businesses. They were built in areas with few customers and with little promise of returning a profit in the near term. The frenzied rush for the West’s natural resources seriously damaged the environment and nearly exterminated the buffalo. Most significantly, the American Indians who lived in the region paid a high human and cultural price. 
Settlement of the Last West
At first, the settlement and economic development of the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, and the Western Plateau did not seem promising. Before 1860, these lands between the Mississippi River and the Pacific Coast were known as “the Great American Desert” by pioneers passing through on the way to the green valleys of Oregon and the goldfields of California. The plains west of the 100th meridian had few trees and usually received less than 15 
inches of rainfall a year, which was not considered enough moisture to support farming. Winter blizzards and hot dry summers discouraged settlement.

350 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONHowever, after 1865 the Great Plains changed so dramatically that the 
former “frontier” largely vanished. By 1900, the great buffalo herds had been 
wiped out. The open western lands were fenced in by homesteads and ranches, 
crisscrossed by steel rails, and modernized by new towns. Ten new western states had been carved out of the last frontier. Only Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma remained as territories awaiting statehood at the end of the century.
The Mining Frontier
California’s great gold rush of 1849 set the pattern for other gold rushes. Individual prospectors poured into the region and used a method called placer mining to search for traces of gold in mountain streams. They needed only simple tools such as shovels and washing pans. Following these individuals came mining companies that could employ deep-shaft mining that required expensive equipment and the resources of wealthy investors. As the mines developed, companies employed experienced miners from Europe, Latin America, and China.
The California Gold Rush was only the first of a series of gold strikes and 
silver strikes in what became the states of South Dakota, Colorado, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona. These strikes kept a steady flow of hopeful prospectors pushing into the western mountains into the 1890s that helped settle the West. The discovery of gold near Pike’s Peak, Colorado, in 1859 brought nearly 100,000 miners to the area. In the same year, the discovery of the fabulous Comstock Lode (which produced more than $340 million in gold and silver by 1890) led to  Nevada entering the Union in 1864. Idaho and Montana also received early statehood, largely because of mining booms.
Rich strikes created boomtowns, overnight towns that became infamous 
for saloons, dance-hall girls, and vigilante justice. Many of these, however, became lonely ghost towns within a few years after the gold or silver ran out. The mining towns that endured and grew evolved more like industrial cities than the frontier towns depicted in western films. For example, Nevada’s Virginia City (created by the Comstock Lode), added theaters, churches, newspapers, schools, libraries, railroads, and police. Mark Twain started his career as a writer working on a Virginia City newspaper in the early 1860s. A few towns that served the mines, such as San Francisco, Sacramento, and Denver, expanded into prosperous cities.
The Cattle Frontier
The economic potential of the vast open grasslands that reached from Texas to Canada was realized by ranchers in the decades after the Civil War. Earlier, cattle had been raised and rounded up in Texas on a small scale by Mexican cowboys, or vaqueros . The traditions of the cattle business in the late 1800s, 
like the hardy “Texas” longhorn cattle, were borrowed from the Mexicans. By 
the 1860s, wild herds of about 5 million head of cattle roamed freely over the Texas grasslands. The Texas cattle business was easy to get into because both the cattle and the grass were free.
351  TOPIC 6.2   WESTWARD E xPANSION : ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  Railroads and Cattle The construction of railroads into Kansas after the 
war opened up eastern markets for the Texas cattle. Joseph G. McCoy built the 
first stockyards in the region, at Abilene, Kansas. Those stockyards held cattle that could be sold in Chicago for the high price of $30 to $50 per head. Dodge City and other cow towns sprang up along the railroads to handle the millions of cattle driven up the Chisholm, Goodnight-Loving, and other trails out of Texas during the 1860s and 1870s. The cowboys, many of whom were African Americans or Mexicans, received about a dollar a day for their dangerous work. 
Decline of the Cattle Drives The long cattle drives began to end in the 
1880s. Overgrazing destroyed the grass, and a winter blizzard and drought of 1885–1886 killed off 90 percent of the cattle. Another factor that closed down the cattle frontier was the arrival of homesteaders, who used barbed wire fencing to cut off access to the formerly open range. Wealthy cattle owners turned to developing huge ranches and using scientific ranching techniques. They raised new breeds of cattle that produced more tender beef by feeding the cattle hay and grains. 
The Wild West was largely tamed by the 1890s. However, in these few 
decades, Americans’ eating habits changed from pork to beef, and people created the enduring legend of the rugged, self-reliant American cowboy.
The Farming Frontier
The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged farming on the Great Plains by 
offering 160 acres of public land free to any family that settled on it for a period of five years. The promise of free land combined with the promotions of railroads and land speculators induced hundreds of thousands of native-born and immigrant families to attempt to farm the Great Plains between 1870 and 1900. About 500,000 families took advantage of the Homestead Act. However, five times that number had to purchase their land, because the best public lands often ended up in the possession of railroad companies and speculators.
Problems and Solutions  The first “sodbusters” on the dry and treeless 
plains often built their homes of sod bricks. Extremes of hot and cold weather, plagues of grasshoppers, and the lonesome life on the plains challenged even the most resourceful of the pioneer families. Water was scarce, and wood for fences was almost nonexistent. The invention of barbed wire by Joseph Glidden in 1874 helped farmers to fence in their lands on the lumber-scarce plains. Using mail-order windmills to drill deep wells provided some water. 
Even so, many homesteaders discovered too late that 160 acres was not 
adequate for farming the Great Plains. Long spells of severe weather, together with falling prices for their crops and the cost of new machinery, caused the failure of two-thirds of the homesteaders’ farms on the Great Plains by 1900. Western Kansas alone lost half of its population between 1888 and 1892.
352 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONSuccess on the Great Plains Those who managed to survive adopted 
“dry farming” and deep-plowing techniques to make the most of the moisture 
available. They also learned to plant hardy strains of Russian wheat that withstood the extreme weather. Ultimately, government programs to build dams and irrigation systems saved many western farmers, as humans reshaped the rivers and physical environment of the West to provide water for agriculture.
Farmers Organize 
By the end of the 1800s, farmers had become a minority within American society. While the number of U.S. farms more than doubled between 1865 and 1900, people working as farmers declined from 60 percent of the working population in 1860 to less than 37 percent in 1900. At the same time, farmers faced growing economic threats from railroads, banks, and global markets.
Changes in Agriculture
With every passing decade in the late 1800s, farming became increasingly commercialized—and also more specialized. Northern and western farmers of the late 19th century concentrated on raising single cash crops, such as corn or wheat, for both national and international markets. As consumers, farmers began to procure their food from the stores in town and their manufactured goods from the mail-order catalogs sent to them by Montgomery Ward and Sears Roebuck. As producers, farmers became more dependent on large and expensive machines, such as steam engines, seeders, and reaper-thresher combines. Larger farms were run like factories. Unable to afford the new equipment, small, marginal farms could not compete and, in many cases, were driven out of business. 
Falling Prices Increased production of crops such as wheat and corn in the 
United States as well as in Argentina, Russia, and Canada drove prices down for farmers around the world. In the United States, since the money supply was not growing as fast as the economy, each dollar became worth more. This put more downward pressure on prices, resulting in deflation . The data in the chart tell 
the depressing story for farmers.

As prices fell, farmers with mortgages faced both high interest rates and 
the need to grow more and more to pay off old debts. Of course, increased production only lowered prices. The predictable results of this vicious circle were more debts, foreclosures by banks, and more independent farmers forced to become tenants and sharecroppers.
353  TOPIC 6.2   WESTWARD E xPANSION : ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  Rising Costs Farmers felt victimized by impersonal forces of the larger 
national economy. Industrial corporations were able to keep prices high on 
manufactured goods by forming monopolistic trusts. Wholesalers and retailers (known as “the middlemen ”) took their cut before selling to farmers. Railroads, 
warehouses, and elevators took what little profit remained by charging high or discriminatory rates for the shipment and storage of grain. Railroads would often charge more for short hauls on lines with no competition than for long hauls on lines with competition.
Taxes also seemed unfair to farmers. Local and state governments taxed 
property and land heavily but did not tax income from stocks and bonds. The tariffs protecting various American industries were viewed as just another unfair tax paid by farmers and consumers for the benefit of the industrialists.
Fighting Back
A long tradition of independence and individualism restrained farmers from taking collective action. Finally, however, they began to organize for their common interests and protection.
National Grange Movement The National Grange of Patrons of 
Husbandry was organized in 1868 by Oliver H. Kelley primarily as a social and educational organization for farmers and their families. Within five years, chapters of the Grange existed in almost every state, with the most in the Midwest. As the National Grange Movement expanded, it became active in economics and politics to defend members against middlemen, trusts, and railroads. For example, Grangers established cooperatives —businesses 
owned and run by the farmers to save the costs charged by middlemen. In Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, the Grangers, with help from local businesses, successfully lobbied their state legislatures to pass laws regulating the rates charged by railroads and elevators. Other Granger laws  made it illegal 
for railroads to fix prices by means of pools and to give rebates to privileged customers. In the landmark case of Munn v. Illinois  (1877), the Supreme Court 
upheld the right of a state to regulate businesses of a public nature, such as railroads.
Farmers’ Alliances Farmers also expressed their discontent by forming 
state and regional groups known as farmers’ alliances. Like the Grange, the alliances taught about scientific farming methods. Unlike the Grange, alliances always had the goal of economic and political action. Hence, the alliance movement had serious potential for creating an independent national political party. By 1890, about 1 million farmers had joined farmers’ alliances. In the South, both poor White and Black farmers joined the movement.
Ocala Platform That potential nearly became reality in 1890 when a 
national organization of farmers—the National Alliance—met in Ocala, Florida, to address the problems of rural America. The Alliance attacked both major parties as subservient to Wall Street bankers and big business. Ocala delegates created the Ocala Platform that called for significant reforms:
354 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION• Direct election of U.S. senators (in the original U.S. Constitution, 
senators were selected by state legislatures)
• Lower tariff rates
• A graduated income tax (people with higher incomes would pay higher rates of tax)
• A new banking system regulated by the federal government
In addition, the Alliance platform demanded that Treasury notes and 
silver be used to increase the amount of money in circulation. Farmers wanted to increase the supply of money in order to create inflation, thereby raising crop prices. The platform also proposed federal storage for farmers’ crops and federal loans, freeing farmers from dependency on middlemen and creditors. 
The alliances stopped short of forming a political party. However, local 
and state candidates who supported alliance goals received decisive electoral support from farmers. Many of the reform ideas of the Grange and the farmers’ alliances would become part of the Populist movement, which would shake the foundations of the two-party system in the elections of 1892 and 1896.

357  TOPIC 6.3   WESTWARD E xPANSION :  SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
Topic 6.3
Westward Expansion:  
Social and Cultural Development
American social development has been continually beginning over  
again on the frontier. . . . The true point of view in the history of this  
nation is not the Atlantic coast, it is the Great West.
Frederick Jackson Turner, 1893
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the settlement of 
the West from 1877 to 1898.
The historical perspective on the social and cultural development of the West 
has changed since the 1890s. At first, the settlement of the Great Plains and Far 
West was recorded as another frontier to be conquered and settled by Europeans. However, Native Americans, Mexican Americans, Asian immigrants, and other migrants were also there to shape the culture and diversity of the region.
The Closing of the Frontier
The Oklahoma Territory, once set aside for the use of American Indians, was opened for settlement in 1889, and hundreds of homesteaders took part in the last great land rush in the West. In 1890 the U.S. Census Bureau declared that the entire frontier—except for a few pockets—had been settled.
Turner’s Frontier Thesis Three years after the Census Bureau declaration, 
historian Frederick Jackson Turner published a provocative, influential essay, 
“The Significance of the Frontier in American History. ” He presented the settling of the frontier as an evolutionary process of building civilization. Into an untamed wilderness came wave after wave of people. The first were hunters. Following them came cattle ranchers, miners, and farmers. Finally, people arrived who founded towns and cities. Turner argued that 300 years of frontier experience had shaped American culture, promoting independence, individualism, inventiveness, practical-mindedness, and democracy. But people also became wasteful of natural resources.
Role of Towns and Cities Historians have challenged Turner’s evolutionary 
view by arguing that frontier cities were not a late addition. Rather, they played an early and primary role in development of the frontier, For example, 19th century developers or “boosters” tried to create settlements on the frontier overnight in 
358 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONthe middle of nowhere. After laying out town plots on paper, boosters strove 
to establish their own town as a territory’s central hub of development by competing to capture the county seat or state capital, a state asylum, a railroad depot, or a college. 
Urban markets also made frontier development possible. The cattle 
ranchers’ frontier developed because it was linked by the railroads to Chicago and eastern markets. By integrating the history of the city and the settlement of the frontier, it becomes clear that the development of the frontier especially after 1865 was interdependence with the growth of towns and cities.
American Without a Frontier The closing of the frontier troubled Turner. 
He saw the frontier as a safety valve for releasing discontent in American society. The frontier had always held the promise of a fresh start. Once the frontier was gone, Turner wondered, would the United States be condemned to follow the patterns of class division and social conflict that troubled Europe?
While many debate the Turner thesis, historians acknowledge that by the 
1890s the largest movement of Americans was not from east to west, it was from rural communities to the cities. Migrants saw more opportunity in industry than in agriculture. Not only was the era of the western frontier coming to a close, but the dominance of rural America was also on a decline.
American Indians in the West
The American Indians who occupied the West in 1865 belonged to dozens of different cultural and tribal groups. In New Mexico and Arizona, Pueblo groups such as the Hopi and Zuni lived in permanent settlements raising corn and livestock. The Navajo and Apache peoples of the Southwest were nomadic hunter-gatherers who adopted a more settled way of life, not only raising crops and livestock but also producing arts and crafts. In the Paciﬁc Northwest (Washington and Oregon), the Chinook, Shasta, and other tribes developed complex communities based on abundant ﬁsh and game.
About two-thirds of the western tribal groups lived on the Great Plains. 
These nomadic tribes, such as the Sioux, Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Crow, and Comanche, had given up farming in colonial times after the introduction of the horse by the Spanish. By the 1700s, they had become skillful horse riders and developed a way of life centered on the hunting of buffalo. Although they belonged to tribes of several thousand, they lived in smaller bands of 300 to 500 members. In the late 19th century, their conﬂicts with the U.S. government were partly the result of White Americans having little understanding of the Plains peoples’ loose tribal organization and nomadic lifestyle.
Reservation Policy In the 1830s, President Andrew Jackson’s policy of 
moving eastern American Indians to the West was based on the belief that lands west of the Mississippi would permanently remain “Indian country. ” This expectation soon proved false, as wagon trains rolled westward on the Oregon Trail, and plans were made for building a transcontinental railroad. In 1851, in councils (negotiations) at Fort Laramie (Wyoming) and Fort Atkinson 
359  TOPIC 6.3   WESTWARD E xPANSION : SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT  (Wisconsin), the federal government began to assign the Plains tribes large 
tracts of land—or reservations—with definite boundaries. Most Plains tribes, however, refused to restrict their movements to the reservations and continued to follow the migrating buffalo wherever they roamed.
Indian Wars In the late 1800s, the settlement by miners, ranchers, and 
homesteaders on American Indian lands led to violence. Fighting between U.S. troops and Plains Indians was often brutal, with the U.S. Army responsible for several massacres. In 1866, during the Sioux War, the tables were turned when Sioux fighters wiped out an an army column under Captain William Fetterman. 
Following these wars, another round of treaties attempted to isolate 
the Plains Indians on smaller reservations with federal agents promising government support. However, gold miners refused to stay off American Indians’ lands if gold was found on them, as it was in the Dakotas’ Black Hills. Soon, minor chiefs not involved in the treaty-making and younger warriors denounced the treaties and tried to return to ancestral lands.

360 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONA new round of conflicts in the West began in the 1870s. The Indian 
Appropriation Act of 1871 ended recognition of tribes as independent nations 
by the federal government and ended negotiation of treaties to be approved by Congress. Conflicts included the Red River War against the Comanche in the southern plains and a second Sioux War led by Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse in the northern plains. Before the Sioux were defeated, they ambushed and destroyed Colonel George Custer’s command at Little Big Horn in 1876. Chief Joseph’s courageous effort to lead a band of the Nez Percé into Canada ended in defeat and surrender in 1877. 
The constant pressure of the U.S. Army forced tribe after tribe to comply 
with Washington’s terms, even after the government violated treaties. In addition, the slaughter of most of the buffalo by the early 1880s doomed the way of life of the Plains peoples. As they lost the buffalo, Plains Indians had to change their traditions as a nomadic hunting culture. 
Ghost Dancers and Wounded Knee The last effort of American Indians 
to resist U.S. government controls was the religiously inspired Ghost Dance movement . Leaders believed it could return prosperity to American Indians. 
In the government’s campaign to suppress the movement, the famous Sioux medicine man Sitting Bull was killed during his arrest. Then in December 1890, the U.S. Army gunned down more than 200 American Indian men, women, and children in the “battle” (massacre) of Wounded Knee in the Dakotas. This final tragedy marked the end of the Indian Wars on the blood-crimsoned prairie.
Assimilationists The injustices done to American Indians were chronicled 
in a best-selling book by Helen Hunt Jackson, A Century of Dishonor (1881). 
Although this book created sympathy for American Indians, especially in the eastern United States, it also generated support for ending Indian culture through assimilation. Reformers advocated formal education, job training, 
and conversion to Christianity. They set up boarding schools such as the Carlisle School in Pennsylvania to segregate American Indian children from their people and teach them White culture and farming and industrial skills.
Dawes Severalty Act (1887) A new phase in the relationship between the 
U.S. government and American Indians was incorporated in the Dawes Act of 1887. The Act was designed to break up tribal organizations, which many felt kept American Indians from becoming “civilized” and law-abiding citizens. The Dawes Act divided the tribal lands into plots of up to 160 acres, depending on family size. U.S. citizenship was granted to those who stayed on the land for 25 years and “adopted the habits of civilized life. ”
Under the Dawes Act, as intended, the federal government distributed 
47 million acres of land to American Indians. However, 90 million acres of former reservation land—often the best land—was sold over the years to White settlers by the government, speculators, or American Indians themselves. The new policy proved a failure. By the turn of the century, disease and poverty had reduced the American Indian population to just 200,000 persons, most of whom lived as wards of the federal government.
361  TOPIC 6.3   WESTWARD E xPANSION : SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT  Changes in the 20th and 21st Centuries In 1924, in partial recognition 
that forced assimilation had failed, the federal government granted U.S. 
citizenship to all American Indians, whether or not they had complied with the Dawes Act. As part of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal in the 1930s, Congress adopted the Indian Reorganization Act (1934), which promoted the reestablishment of tribal organization and culture. Since then, the number of people identifying as American Indians has increased. Today, more than  
3 million American Indians, belonging to 500 tribes, live in the United States.
Mexican Americans in the Southwest
Mexico’s independence from Spain in 1821 increased trade and cultural exchange with the United States. The Santa Fe Trail, a nearly 1,000-mile overland route between Santa Fe, New Mexico, and western Missouri linked the regions. This trail opened up the Spanish-speaking southwest to economic development and settlement. It was a vital link until a railroad was completed in 1880.
Mexican landowners in the Southwest and California were guaranteed their 
property rights and granted citizenship after the Mexican War. However, drawn-out legal proceedings often resulted in the sale or loss of lands to new Anglo arrivals. Hispanic culture was preserved in dominant Spanish-speaking areas, such as the New Mexico territories, the border towns, and the barrios of California.
During this period, Mexican Americans moved throughout the West to 
find work. Many found employment in the sugar beet fields and the mines of Colorado, and in building railroads throughout the region. Before 1917, the border with Mexico was open, and few records were kept for either seasonal workers or permanent settlers. Mexicans, like their European counterparts, were drawn by the explosive economic development of the region. Mexican Americans, Native Americans, and White settlers competed for land and resources during this period.
The Conservation Movement
The concerns over deforestation  sparked the conservation movement. The 
breathtaking paintings and photographs of western landscapes helped to push Congress to preserve such western icons as Y osemite  Valley as a California 
state park in 1864 (it became a national park in 1890) and to dedicate the Y ellowstone  area as the first national park in 1872. In the 1800s, Secretary of 
the Interior Carl Schurz advocated creation of forest reserves and a federal forest service to protect federal lands from exploitation. Presidents Benjamin Harrison and Grover Cleveland reserved 33 million acres of national timber. (For more on the conservation movement, see Topic 7.4.)
With the closing of the frontier era, Americans grew increasingly concerned 
about the loss of public lands and the natural treasures they contained. The Forest Reserve Act of 1891 and the Forest Management Act of 1897 withdrew federal timberlands from development and regulated their use. While most “conservationists” believed in scientific management and regulated use of

S. L. A. Marshall, historian, Crimsoned Prairie, 1972
“The grand irony of the Great Plains is that none of the tribes with which the army would clash were native to the lands they claimed. All had been caught up in a vast migration, precipitated by the white settlements in the East. As the dislocated Indians spilled onto the Plains, they jockeyed with native tribes for the choicest hunting grounds. In a real sense, then—and this cannot be over emphasized—the wars that were to come between the Indians and the government for the Great Plains would represent a clash of emigrant peoples. ”

365  TOPIC 6.4   THE “ NEW SOUTH ”
Topic 6.4
The “New South”
Legislation is powerless to eradicate racial instincts.
Supreme Court majority opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896  
Learning Objective : Explain how various factors contributed to 
continuity and change in the “New South” from 1877 to 1898.
W hile the West was being developed, the South was recovering from the 
devastation of the Civil War. Some Southerners promoted a vision for a “New 
South”  with a self-sufficient economy, built on modern capitalist values, 
industrial growth, modernized transportation, and improved race relations. However, its agricultural past and racial divisions provided more continuity than change.
Growth of Industry
Henry Grady, the editor of the Atlanta  Constitution, spread the gospel of the 
“New South” with editorials that argued for economic diversity and laissez-faire capitalism. To attract businesses, local governments offered tax exemptions to investors and the promise of low-wage labor. The growth of cities, the textile industry, and improved railroads symbolized efforts to create a “New South” in the late 19th century: 
• Birmingham, Alabama, developed into one of the nation’s leading steel producers.
• Memphis, Tennessee, prospered as a center for the South’s growing lumber  industry. 
• Richmond, Virginia, the former capital of the Confederacy, became the capital of the nation’s tobacco  industry. 
Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina overtook the New England 
states as the chief producers of textiles. By 1900, the South had 400 cotton mills employing almost 100,000 White workers. Southern railroad companies rapidly converted to the standard gauge rails used in the North and West, so the South was integrated into the national rail network. The South’s rate of postwar growth from 1865 to 1900 equaled or surpassed that of the rest of the country in population, industry, and railroads.
However, two factors slowed industrial growth. To a greater extent than 
before the Civil War, Northern financing dominated much of the Southern economy. Northern investors controlled three-quarters of the Southern 
366 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONrailroads and by 1900 had control of the South’s steel industry as well. A large 
share of the profits from the new industries went to Northern banks and financiers instead of recirculating and expanding the Southern economy.
In addition, economic growth in the South was hampered by the failure of 
state and local governments to expand public education. They did not invest in technical and engineering schools for White or Black residents as the North had done. As a result, few Southerners had the skills needed to foster industrial development. Without adequate education, the Southern workforce faced limited economic opportunities in the fast-changing world of the late 19th century. Southern industrial workers (94 percent of whom were White) earned half the national average and worked longer hours than did workers elsewhere.
Agriculture and Poverty
While industry did grow in the South, the region remained largely agricultural—and also the poorest part of the country. By 1900, more than half the region’s White farmers and three-quarters of the Black farmers were either tenant 
farmers who rented land or sharecroppers  who paid for the use of land with a 
share of the crop. Since people were poor and profits from industry flowed to the North, Southern banks had little money to lend to farmers. This shortage of credit forced farmers to borrow supplies from local merchants in the spring with a lien, or mortgage, on their crops to be paid at harvest. The combination of sharecropping and crop liens kept farmers as virtual serfs tied to the land by debt. These farmers barely got by from year to year. 
Cotton and Other Crops The South’s postwar economy remained tied 
mainly to growing cotton. Between 1870 and 1900, the number of acres planted in cotton more than doubled. Increased output, however, only added to the cotton farmer’s problems. The resulting glut of cotton on world markets caused cotton prices to decline by more than 50 percent by the 1890s. Per capita income in the South actually declined, and many farmers lost their farms. 
Some Southern farmers sought to diversify their farming to escape the 
trap of depending entirely on cotton. George Washington Carver, an African American scientist at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, promoted the growing of such crops as peanuts, sweet potatoes, and soybeans. His work played an important role in shifting southern agriculture toward a more diversified base.
Attempts to Organize Despite some diversification, most small farmers in 
the South remained in a cycle of debt and poverty. As in the North and the West, hard times produced a harvest of discontent. By 1890, the Farmers’ Southern Alliance claimed more than 1 million members. A separate organization for African Americans, the Colored Farmers’ National Alliance, had about 250,000 members. Both organizations rallied behind political reforms to solve the farmers’ economic problems. If poor Black and poor White farmers in the South could have united, they would have been a potent political force, but the economic interests of the upper class and the powerful racial attitudes of Whites stood in their way.
367  TOPIC 6.4   THE “ NEW SOUTH ”Segregation
When Reconstruction ended in 1877, the North withdrew protection of 
African Americans and left Southerners to solve their social and economic problems. Democratic politicians who came to power in the southern states after Reconstruction, known as redeemers, won support from the business community and White supremacists. The latter group favored treating African Americans as social inferiors by separating, or segregating, public facilities by race. The redeemers often used race as a rallying cry to deflect attention from the real concerns of tenant farmers and the working poor. They discovered that they could exert political power by playing on the racial fears of Whites.
Discrimination and the Supreme Court During Reconstruction, federal 
laws protected African Americans from discrimination by local and state governments. Starting in the late 1870s, however, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down these laws. In the Civil Rights Cases of 1883, the Court ruled that Congress could not ban racial discrimination practiced by private citizens and businesses, including railroads and hotels, used by the public. 
Then, in 1896, in the landmark case Plessy v. Ferguson, the Supreme Court 
upheld a Louisiana law requiring “separate but equal accommodations” for White and Black railroad passengers. The Court ruled that Louisiana’s law did not violate the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of “equal protection of the laws. ”
These federal court decisions supported a wave of segregation laws, 
commonly known as Jim Crow laws, that southern states adopted beginning in the 1870s. These laws required segregated washrooms, drinking fountains, park benches, and other facilities in virtually all public places. Only the use of streets and most stores was not restricted according to a person’s race. 
Loss of Civil Rights Other discriminatory laws resulted in the wholesale 
disenfranchisement of Black voters by 1900. In Louisiana, for example, 130,334 Black voters were registered in 1896 but only 1,342 in 1904—a 99 percent decline. Southern states invented various political and legal devices were to prevent African Americans from voting. Among the most common obstacles were literacy tests, poll taxes, and political party primaries for Whites only. 
Many Southern states adopted so-called grandfather clauses, which allowed a man to vote if his grandfather had voted in elections before Reconstruction. The Supreme Court again approved such laws in an 1898 case that upheld a state’s right to use literacy tests to determine citizens’ qualifications for voting. 
Discrimination took many forms. In southern courts, African Americans 
could not serve on juries. If convicted of crimes, they often received stiffer penalties than Whites. In some cases, African Americans accused of crimes did not receive the formality of a court-ordered sentence. Lynch mobs killed more than 1,400 Black men during the 1890s. Economic discrimination was also widespread, keeping most southern African Americans out of skilled trades and even factory jobs. Thus, while poor Whites and immigrants learned the industrial skills that would help them rise into the middle class, African Americans remained engaged in farming and low-paying domestic work.
368 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONResponding to Segregation
Segregation, disenfranchisement, and lynching left African Americans in the 
South oppressed but not powerless. Some responded with confrontation. Ida 
B. Wells, editor of the Memphis  Free Speech,  a Black newspaper, campaigned 
against lynching and the Jim Crow laws. Death threats and the destruction of her printing press forced Wells to carry on her work from the North. Other Black leaders advocated leaving the South. Bishop Henry Turner formed the International Migration Society in 1894 to help Blacks emigrate to Africa. Many African Americans moved to Kansas and Oklahoma. 
Booker T. Washington A third response to oppression, advocated by 
Booker T. Washington, was to accommodate it. Washington, who was born enslaved, had graduated from Hampton Institute in Virginia. In 1881, he established an industrial and agricultural school for African Americans in Tuskegee, Alabama. There, African Americans learned skilled trades while Washington preached the virtues of hard work, moderation, and economic self-help. Earning money, he said, was like having “a little green ballot” that would empower African Americans more effectively than a political ballot. 
Speaking at an exposition in Atlanta in 1895, Washington argued that “the 
agitation of the questions of social equality is the extremist folly. ” He supported what became known as the Atlanta Compromise, a belief that Black and White Southerners shared a responsibility for making their region prosper. He thought African Americans should focus on working hard at their jobs and not challenge segregation and discrimination. In return, Whites should support education and even some legal rights for African Americans. “In all things that are purely social, ” Washington said, “we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress. ”
In 1900, Washington organized the National Negro Business League, which 
established 320 chapters across the country to support businesses owned and operated by African Americans. Washington’s emphasis on racial harmony and economic cooperation  won praise from many Whites, including industrialist 
Andrew Carnegie and President Theodore Roosevelt.
Responses to Washington Later civil rights leaders had mixed reactions 
to Washington’s approach, especially his Atlanta speech. Some criticized him as too willing to accept discrimination. For example, after 1900, the younger African American leader W . E. B. Du Bois would demand an end to segregation 
and the granting of equal civil rights to all Americans. In contrast, other writers praised Washington for paving the way for Black self-reliance because of his emphasis on starting and supporting Black-owned businesses.
Change came slowly to a region that clung to its past. White supremacy and 
segregation would continue to dominate race relations in the South until the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The Southern economy would finally achieve the vision of the “New South” after World War II, as it shared in the prosperity of the postwar era.

371  TOPIC 6.5   TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION
Topic 6.5
Technological Innovation
Only an inventor knows how to borrow, and every man  
is or should be an inventor.
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Letter and Social Aims, 1876
Learning Objective : Explain the effects of technological advances in the 
development of the United States over time.
Vital to industrial development of the United States were new inventions. 
Communications, transportation, basic industries, electric power, and urban 
growth were all improved by technological innovations. 
Inventions
The first radical change in the speed of communications was the invention of a workable telegraph by Samuel F . B. Morse, initially demonstrated in 1844. By the time of the Civil War, electronic communication by telegraph and rapid transportation by railroad were already becoming standard parts of modern living, especially in the Northern states. 
After the war, Cyrus W . Field’s invention of an improved transatlantic cable  
in 1866 suddenly made it possible to send messages across the seas in minutes. By 1900, cables linked all inhabited continents of the world in an electronic network of nearly instantaneous, global communication. This communication revolution soon internationalized markets and prices for basic commodities, such as grains, coal, and steel, often placing local and smaller producers at the mercy of international forces.
Among the hundreds of noteworthy inventions of the late 19th century 
were the typewriter (1867), the telephone developed by Alexander Graham 
Bell (1876), the cash register (1879), the calculating machine (1887), and 
the adding machine (1888). These new products became essential tools for business. Products for the consumer that were in widespread use by the end of the century were George Eastman’s Kodak camera (1888), Lewis E. Waterman’s fountain pen (1884), and King Gillette’s safety razor and blade (1895).
The Steel Industry
The technological breakthrough that launched the rise of heavy industry was the discovery of a new process for making large quantities of steel, a more durable metal than iron. In the 1850s, both Henry Bessemer in England 
372 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONand William Kelly in the United States discovered that blasting air through 
molten iron produced high-quality steel. Because the Great Lakes region from Pennsylvania to Illinois had abundant coal reserves and access to the iron ore of Minnesota’s Mesabi Range, it emerged as the center of steel production. 
Edison and Westinghouse
Possibly the greatest inventor of the 19th century, Thomas Edison worked as a telegraph operator as a young man. In 1869, at age 22, he patented his first invention, a machine for recording votes. Income from his early inventions enabled Edison to establish a research laboratory in Menlo Park , New Jersey, in 1876. This was the 
world’s first modern research laboratory, which was Edison’s “invention factory. ” He declared that it would turn out “a minor invention every ten days and a big thing every six months or so. ” It ranks among Edison’s most important contributions to science and industry because it introduced the concept of mechanics and engineers working on a project as a team rather than independently.
Out of Edison’s lab came more than a thousand patented inventions, 
including the phonograph, the dynamo for generating electric power , the 
mimeograph machine, and the motion picture camera. Of all the inventions of the era, Edison’s improvements to the incandescent lamp in 1879 (the first practical electric lightbulb), was arguably the most significant. Electric light revolutionized life, especially in the cities, from the way people worked to the way they shopped. During his lifetime, Edison became a mythic figure, even though others inventors improved on his work.
Another remarkable inventor, George Westinghouse, held more than 400 
patents and was responsible for developing an air brake for railroads (1869) and a transformer for producing high-voltage alternating current (AC). The latter invention made possible the lighting of cities and the operation of electric streetcars, subways, and electrically powered machinery and appliances. Westinghouse and General Electric came to dominate electric technology with their AC power supply systems, which came to replace Edison’s direct current technology. By 1900, various electric trades employed nearly a million people, making electric light and power one of the nation’s largest and fastest growing industries.
Technology and Growth of Cities
Developments in how people moved from place to place and the kind of buildings they lived and worked in remade the urban landscape. Cities grew both outward and upward.
Changes in Transportation Improvements in urban transportation made 
the growth of cities possible. In the walking cities of the pre-Civil War era, people had little choice but to live within walking distance of their shops or jobs. Such cities gave way to streetcar cities, in which people lived in residences many miles from their jobs and commuted to work on horse-drawn streetcars. By the 1890s, both horse-drawn cars and cable cars were being replaced by electric trolleys, elevated railroads, and subways , which could transport people

of massive steel suspension bridges such as New Y ork’s Brooklyn Bridge (1883) also made possible longer commutes between residential areas and city centers.  
Skyscrapers As cities expanded outward, they also soared upward, since 
increasing land values in the central business district made the construction of taller and taller buildings profitable. In 1885, Chicago became the home of the first true skyscraper with a steel skeleton, a ten-story building designed by William Le Baron Jenny. Structures of this size were made possible by such innovations as the Otis elevator and the central steam-heating system with 
radiators in every room. By 1900, steel-framed skyscrapers for offices of industry 
had replaced church spires as the dominant feature of American urban skylines.
Marketing Consumer Goods
The increased output of U.S. factories and the invention of new consumer products enabled businesses to sell merchandise to a large public. R. H. Macy in New Y ork and Marshall Field in Chicago made the large department store popular in urban centers. Frank Woolworth’s five-and-dime stores brought nationwide chain stores to towns and urban neighborhoods. Two large mail-order companies, Sears, Roebuck and Co., and Montgomery Ward, used the 
improved rail system to ship to rural customers everything from hats to houses that people ordered from each company’s thick catalog. The Sears catalog became famous as the “wish book. ”
Packaged foods under such brand names as Kellogg and Post became 
common items in American homes. Refrigerated railroad cars and canning enabled Gustavus Swift and other packers to change the eating habits of 
Americans with mass-produced meat and vegetable products. Advertising and new marketing techniques not only promoted a consumer economy but also created a consumer culture in which shopping became a favorite pastime.

375  TOPIC 6.6   THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISM
Topic 6.6
The Rise of Industrial Capitalism
Then, again, the ability to organize and conduct industrial, commercial, 
or financial enterprises is rare; the great captains of industry are 
as rare as great generals.
William Graham Sumner, “What Social Classes Owe to Each Other, ” 1903
Learning Objective : Explain the socioeconomic continuities and changes 
associated with the growth of industrial capitalism from 1865 to 1898.
W hile new technologies played a key role in the economic growth after 1865, 
in many ways the more important “inventions” were the management and 
financial structures that helped to create the large-scale industries that came to dominate the era. The continued quest for increased profits inspired a variety of approaches to the consolidation of businesses and wealth. 
The Business of Railroads
The dynamic combination of business leadership, capital, technology, markets, labor, and government support was especially evident in the development of the nation’s first big business—railroads. After the Civil War, railroad mileage 
increased more than fivefold in a 35-year period (from 35,000 miles in 1865 to 193,000 miles in 1900). The federal government subsidized this growth by providing companies low-interest loans and millions of acres of public lands. Railroads created a market for goods that was national in scale and by so doing encouraged mass production, mass consumption, and economic specialization. The resources used in railroad building promoted the growth of other industries, especially coal and steel. 
Railroads also affected the routines of daily life. Prior to 1883, each 
community or region could determine when noon was for itself based on when the sun was directly overhead. In effect, the country had 144 different time zones. In 1883 that ended. The American Railroad Association divided the country into four time zones. Railroad time became standard time for all Americans. 
Maybe the most important innovation of the railroads was the creation of the 
modern stockholder corporation. Railroads required so much investment that they needed to develop complex structures in finance, business management, and the regulation of competition.
376 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONCompetition and Consolidation
In the early decades of railroading (1830–1860), the building of dozens of 
separate local lines had resulted in different gauges (distance between tracks) and incompatible equipment. These inefficiencies were reduced after the Civil War through the consolidation  of competing railroads into integrated trunk 
lines. A trunk line was the major route between large cities; smaller branch lines connected the trunk line with outlying towns. “Commodore” Cornelius Vanderbilt  used his millions earned from a steamboat business to merge local 
railroads into the New Y ork Central Railroad (1867), which ran from New Y ork City to Chicago. It operated more than 4,500 miles of track. Other trunk lines, such as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad, connected eastern seaports with Chicago and other Midwestern cities and set standards of excellence and efficiency for the rest of the industry. 
Problems and Corruption However, railroads were not always efficient. 
As has been the case with other forms of new technology throught history, investors overbuilt in the 1870s and 1880s. Some companies suffered from mismanagement and outright fraud. Speculators such as Jay Gould  entered 
the railroad business for quick profits and made their millions by selling off  assets and watering stock (inflating the value of a corporation’s assets and profits before selling its stock to the public). In a ruthless scramble to survive, railroads competed by offering rebates  (discounts) and kickbacks to favored 
shippers while charging exorbitant freight rates to smaller customers such as farmers. Railroads also attempted to increase profits by forming pools , in 
which competing companies agreed secretly to fix rates and share traffic.
Concentration of Railroad Ownership A financial panic in 1893 forced 
one-quarter of all railroads into bankruptcy . Bankers led by J. Pierpont 
Morgan  quickly moved in to take control of the bankrupt railroads and 
consolidate them. With competition eliminated, they could stabilize rates and reduce debts. By 1900, seven giant systems controlled nearly two-thirds of the nation’s railroads. The consolidation made the rail system more efficient. However, the system was controlled by a few powerful men such as Morgan, who dominated the boards of competing railroad corporations through interlocking directorates (the same directors ran competing companies). In effect, they created regional railroad monopolies.
Railroad Power Railroads captured the imagination of late-19th century 
America, as the public, local communities, states, and federal government invested in their development. At the same time, however, customers and small investors often felt that they were the victims of slick financial schemes and ruthless practices. Early attempts to regulate the railroads by law did little good. Granger laws passed by Midwestern states in the 1870s were overturned by the Supreme Court, and the federal Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 was at first ineffective (see Topic 6.12). Not until the Progressive era in the early 20th century did Congress expand the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission to protect the public interest.
377  TOPIC 6.6   THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISMIndustrial Empires
The late 19th century witnessed a major shift in the nature of industrial 
production. Early factories had concentrated on producing textiles, clothing, and leather products. After the Civil War, a “second Industrial Revolution” resulted in the growth of large-scale industry and the production of steel, petroleum, electric power, and the industrial machinery to produce other goods.
Andrew Carnegie and the Steel Industry Leadership of the fast-growing 
steel industry passed to a shrewd business genius, Andrew Carnegie. Born in 1835 in Scotland, Carnegie immigrated to the United States and worked his way up from poverty to become the superintendent of a Pennsylvania railroad. In the 1870s, he started manufacturing steel in Pittsburgh and soon outdistanced his competitors by a combination of salesmanship and the use of the latest technology. Carnegie employed a business strategy known as vertical integration , in which a company would control every stage of the industrial 
process, from mining the raw materials to transporting the finished product. By 1900, Carnegie Steel employed 20,000 workers and produced more steel than all the mills in Britain.TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROADS, 1865-1900

378 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONDeciding to retire from business to devote himself to philanthropy, 
Carnegie sold his company in 1900 for more than $400 million to a new steel 
combination headed by Morgan. The new corporation, United States Steel, was the first billion-dollar company. It was also the largest enterprise in the world, employing 168,000 people and controlling more than three-fifths of the nation’s steel business.
Rockefeller and the Oil Industry The first U.S. oil well was drilled by Edwin 
Drake in 1859 in Pennsylvania. Only four years later, in 1863, a young John D. Rockefeller  founded a company that would quickly eliminate its competition 
and take control of most of the nation’s oil refineries. By 1881, his company—by then known as the Standard Oil Trust—controlled 90 percent of the oil refinery business. It had become a monopoly, a company that dominates a market so 
much that it faces little or no competition from other companies. By controlling the supply and prices of oil, Standard Oil’s profits soared and so did Rockefeller’s fortune. When he retired, his fortune was worth about $900 million.
In part, Standard Oil grew because Rockefeller applied new technology and 
efficient management practices. Sometimes this kept prices low for consumers. However, as the company grew, it became very powerful. Rockefeller was able to extort rebates from railroad companies and temporarily cut prices in order to force rival companies to sell out. 
Controversy over Corporate Power  Emulating the success of Rockefeller, 
Carnegie, and Morgan, leaders in the meat, sugar, tobacco, and other industries also formed dominant companies to gain control of the markets. These companies were organized in various ways:
• A trust  is an organization or board that manages the assets of other 
companies. Under Rockefeller, Standard Oil became a trust in which one board of trustees managed a combination of once-competing oil companies. (“Trust” added other meanings in later years.)
• Horizontal integration is a process through which one company takes control of all its former competitors in a specific industry, such as oil refining or coal mining. 
• Vertical integration  is a process through which one company takes 
control of all stages of making a product. For example, Carnegie Steel controlled coal mines, the ore ships, steel mills, and distribution systems for the steel company to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and increase profits. 
• A holding company is one created to own and control diverse companies. Banker J. Pierpont Morgan managed a holding company that orchestrated the management of the companies it had acquired in various industries, such as banking, rail transportation, and steel. 
Critics of these giant corporations charged that they were bad for the 
economy. By creating monopolies, they subverted competition in open and free markets. According to the critics, monopolies slowed innovation, overcharged 
379  TOPIC 6.6   THE RISE OF INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISMconsumers, and developed excessive political influence. The word “monopoly” 
came to stand for a company that was so large and powerful that it threatened the public interest. 
Laissez-Faire Capitalism
Federal, state, and local government all supported businesses and economic growth with actions such as passing high tariffs, building infrastructure, and operating public schools and universities. However, the prevailing economic, scientific, and religious beliefs of the late 19th century led people to reject government regulation of business. The economic expression of these beliefs was summed up in the phrase “laissez-faire.”
Conservative Economics
In 1776, economist Adam Smith had argued in The Wealth of Nations that mercantilism, which included extensive regulation of trade by government, was less efficient than allowing businesses to be guided by the “invisible hand” (impersonal economic forces) of the law of supply and demand. While Smith supported some government regulations, he believed that in general, unregulated businesses would be motivated by their own self-interest to offer improved goods and services at low prices. 
In the 19th century, American industrialists appealed to laissez-faire theory 
to justify their methods of doing business. The rise of monopolistic trusts in the 1880s seemed to undercut the very competition needed for natural regulation. Even so, among conservatives and business leaders, laissez-faire theory was constantly invoked in legislative halls and lobbies to ward off any threat of government regulation.
Social Darwinism Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection in biology 
offended the beliefs of many religious conservatives, but it bolstered the views of economic conservatives. Led by English social philosopher Herbert Spencer, some people argued for Social Darwinism, the belief that Darwin’s 
ideas of natural selection and survival of the fittest should be applied to the marketplace. Spencer believed that concentrating wealth in the hands of the “fit” benefited everyone. 
A student of Spencer’s beliefs, Professor William Graham Sumner of 
Y ale University, introduced the principles of Social Darwinism to the study of sociology in the United States. He argued that helping the poor was misguided because it interfered with the laws of nature and would only weaken the evolution of the species by preserving the unfit. The teachings of respected scholars such as Sumner provided a “scientific” sanction for racial intolerance. Race theories about the superiority of one group over others would continue into the 20th century.
Protestant Work Ethic A number of Americans found religion more 
convincing than Social Darwinism in justifying the wealth of successful industrialists and bankers. John D. Rockefeller diligently applied the Protestant 
380 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONwork ethic (that material success was a sign of God’s favor and a just reward for 
hard work) to both his business and personal life. Because of this, he concluded that “God gave me my riches. ” In a popular lecture, “ Acres of Diamonds, ” the Reverend Russell Conwell preached that everyone had a duty to become rich. 
The Concentration of Wealth
By the 1890s, the richest 10 percent of the U.S. population controlled 90 percent of the nation’s wealth. Industrialization created a new class of millionaires, some of whom flaunted their wealth by living in ostentatious mansions, sailing enormous yachts, and throwing lavish parties. The Vanderbilts graced the waterfront of Newport, Rhode Island, with summer homes that rivaled the villas of European royalty. Guests at one of their dinner parties were invited to hunt for their party favors by using small silver shovels to seek out the precious gems hidden in sand on long silver trays.
Many Americans ignored the widening gap between the rich and the poor. 
They found hope in the examples of “self-made men” in business such as Andrew Carnegie and Thomas Edison and novels by Horatio Alger Jr. Every Alger novel portrayed a young man of modest means who becomes wealthy through honesty, hard work, and a little luck. In reality, opportunities for upward mobility (movement into a higher economic bracket) did exist, but the rags-to-riches career of an Andrew Carnegie was unusual. Statistical studies demonstrate that the typical wealthy businessperson of the day was a White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant male who came from an upper- or middle-class background and whose father was in business or banking.
Business Influence Outside the United States
Corporations in the late 19th century increasingly desired to do business in Latin America and Asia. Industries wanted the raw materials they could process into finished goods. Around 1900, imports from Cuba, Brazil, and Asia of products such as sugar and rubber accounted for about 30 percent of U.S. imports. Businesses also wanted to sell manufactured goods and agricultural products abroad. Around 1900, the United States included about 5 percent of the world population but accounted for about 15 percent of world exports.

“Competition therefore is the law of nature. Nature is entirely neutral; she 
submits to him who most energetically and resolutely assails her. She grants her rewards to the fittest; therefore, without regard to other considerations of any kind. . . . Such is the system of nature. If we do not like it and if we try to amend it, there is one way in which we can do it. We take from the better and give to the worse. . . . Let it be understood that we cannot go outside this alternative: liberty, inequality, survival of the fittest; not-liberty, equality, survival of the unfittest. The former carries society forward and favors all its best members; the latter carries society downward and favors all its worst members. ”

Topic 6.7
Labor in the Gilded Age
We have been brought to the ragged edge of anarchy.
Richard Olney, U.S. Attorney General on the  
Pullman Strike, July 4, 1894
Learning Objective : Explain the socioeconomic continuities and 
changes associated with the growth of industrial capitalism from 1865 
to 1898.
The expression Gilded Age , first used by Mark Twain in 1873 as the title of 
a book, referred to the superficial glitter of the new wealth so prominently 
displayed in the late 19th century. The characterization of the period from 1865 to 1898 as the Gilded Age has proved a useful label for an era in which the “captains of industry” controlled large corporations, created great fortunes, and dominated politics. At the same time, the problems faced by workers, farmers, and burgeoning cities festered under the surface of the new wealth.
Challenges for Wage Earners
The growth of industry was based on hard physical labor in mines and factories. However, for the people doing these jobs, life was hard.
Wages By 1900, two-thirds of all employed Americans worked for wages, 
usually at jobs that required them to labor ten hours a day, six days a week. Wages were determined by the laws of supply and demand. Because there was usually a large supply of immigrants competing for factory jobs, wages were barely above the level needed for bare subsistence. Low wages were justified by David Ricardo (1772–1823), whose famous “iron law of wages” argued that raising wages would only increase the working population, and the availability of more workers would in turn cause wages to fall, thus creating a cycle of misery and starvation. 
Real wages (income adjusted for inflation or deflation) rose steadily in the 
late 19th century, but even so most wage earners could not support a family decently on one income. Therefore, working-class families depended on the income of women and children. In 1870, about 12 percent of children were employed outside the home. By 1900, that number had increased to about 20 percent. In 1890, 11 million of the 12.5 million families in the United States averaged less than $380 a year in income.
384 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONLabor Discontent Before the Industrial Revolution, workers labored 
in small workplaces that valued an artisan’s skills. People often felt a sense 
of accomplishment in creating a product from start to finish. Factory work was radically different. Industrial workers were often assigned just one step in the manufacturing of a product, performing semiskilled tasks monotonously. Both immigrants from abroad and migrants from rural America had to learn to work under the tyranny of the clock. In many industries, such as railroads and mining, working conditions were dangerous. Many workers were exposed to chemicals and pollutants that only later were discovered to cause chronic illness and early death.
Industrial workers rebelled against intolerable working conditions by 
missing work or quitting. They changed jobs on the average of every three years. About 20 percent of those who worked in factories eventually dropped out of the industrial workplace rather than continuing. This was a far higher percentage than those who protested by joining labor unions.
The Struggles of Organized Labor
The late 19th century witnessed the most deadly—and frequent—labor conflicts in the nation’s history. Many feared the country was heading toward open warfare between capital and labor.
Industrial Warfare
With a surplus of low-cost labor, management held most of the power in its struggles with organized labor. Strikers could easily be replaced by bringing in strikebreakers, or scabs—unemployed persons desperate for jobs. Employers used several tactics for defeating unions:
• Lockout:  the act of closing a factory to break a labor movement before it 
could get organized
• Blacklist:  a roster of the names of pro-union workers that employers 
circulated so that these people could not find work
• Yellow-dog contract: a contract that included as a condition of employment that workers could not join a union
• Private guards  and state militia:  forces used by employers to put down 
strikes
• Court injunction:  judicial action used by an employer to prevent or end 
a strike
Moreover, management fostered public fear of unions as anarchistic and 
un-American. Before 1900, management won most of its battles with organized labor because, if violence developed, employers could almost always count on the support of the federal and state governments.
Tactics by Labor Workers were divided on the best methods for defending 
themselves against management. Some union leaders advocated political 
385  TOPIC 6.7   L ABOR IN THE GILDED AGEaction. Others favored direct confrontation: strikes, picketing, boycotts, and 
slowdowns to achieve union recognition and collective bargaining, the ability of workers to negotiate as a group with an employer over wages and working conditions.
Great Railroad Strike of 1877 One of the worst outbreaks of labor 
violence in the century erupted in 1877. During an economic depression, the railroad companies cut wages in order to reduce costs. A strike on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad quickly spread across 11 states and shut down two-thirds of the country’s rail lines. Railroad workers were joined by 500,000 workers from other industries in an escalating strike that quickly became national in scale. For the first time since the 1830s, a president (Rutherford B. Hayes) used federal troops to end a labor dispute. The strike and the violence finally ended, but not before more than 100 people had been killed. After the strike, some employers addressed the workers’ grievances by improving wages and working conditions, while others took a harder line by busting workers’ organizations.
Attempts to Organize National Unions
Before the 1860s, unions had been organized as local associations in one city or region. They were usually craft unions, ones focused on one type of work.
National Labor Union The first attempt to organize all workers in all 
states—skilled and unskilled, agricultural and industrial—was the National Labor Union . Founded in 1866, it had some 640,000 members by 1868. 
Besides championing the goals of higher wages and the eight-hour day, it also had a broad social program: equal rights for women and African Americans, monetary reform, and worker cooperatives. Its chief victory was winning the eight-hour day for federal government workers. It lost support, however, after a depression began in 1873 and after the unsuccessful strikes of 1877.
Knights of Labor A second national labor union, the Knights of Labor, 
began in 1869 as a secret society in order to avoid detection by employers. Under the leadership of Terence V . Powderly, the union went public in 1881, opening its membership to all workers, including African Americans and women. Powderly advocated a variety of reforms: (1) forming worker cooperatives “to make each man his own employer, ” (2) abolishing child labor, (3) abolishing trusts and monopolies, and (4) settling labor disputes by arbitration rather than strikes. Because the Knights were loosely organized, however, Powderly could not control local units that decided to strike. 
The Knights of Labor grew rapidly, attaining a peak membership of 730,000 
workers in 1886. However, it also declined rapidly after the violence of the Haymarket riot in Chicago in 1886 turned public opinion against the union.
Haymarket Bombing Chicago, with about 80,000 Knights in 1886, was 
the site of the first May Day labor movement. Also living in Chicago were about 200 anarchists who advocated the violent overthrow of all government. In response to the May Day movement calling for a general strike to achieve an eight-hour day, labor violence broke out at Chicago’s McCormick Harvester 
386 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONplant. On May 4, workers held a public meeting in Haymarket Square, and 
as police attempted to break up the meeting, someone threw a bomb, which killed seven police officers. The bomb thrower was never found. Even so, eight anarchist leaders were tried for the crime, and seven were sentenced to death. Horrified by the bomb incident, many Americans concluded that the union movement was radical and violent. The Knights of Labor, as the most visible union at the time, lost popularity and membership.
American Federation of Labor Unlike the reform-minded Knights of 
Labor, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) concentrated on “bread-and-butter unonism, ” attaining narrower economic goals. Founded in 1886 as an association of 25  craft unions of skilled workers, and led by Samuel Gompers  
until 1924, the AF of L focused on just higher wages and improved working conditions. Gompers directed his local unions to walk out until the employer agreed to negotiate a new contract through collective bargaining. By 1901, the AF of L was by far the nation’s largest labor organization, with 1 million members. Even this union, however, would not achieve major successes until the early decades of the 20th century.
Strikes and Strikebreaking in the 1890s
Two massive strikes in the last decade of the 19th century demonstrated both the growing discontent of labor and the continued power of management to prevail in industrial disputes.
Homestead Strike Henry Clay Frick, the manager of Andrew Carnegie’s 
Homestead Steel plant near Pittsburgh, precipitated a strike in 1892 by cutting wages by nearly 20 percent. Frick used the weapons of the lockout, private guards, and strikebreakers to defeat the steelworkers’ walkout after five months. Sixteen people, mostly steelworkers, died in the conflict. The failure of the Homestead strike set back the union movement in the steel industry until 
the New Deal in the 1930s.
Pullman Strike Even more alarming to conservatives was a strike started 
by workers living in George Pullman’s company town near Chicago. The  Pullman Palace Car Company manufactured widely used railroad sleeping cars. In 1894, Pullman announced a general cut in wages and fired the leaders of the workers’ delegation who came to bargain with him. The workers at Pullman laid down their tools and appealed for help from the American Railroad Union. The ARU’s leader, Eugene V . Debs, directed railroad workers not to handle any trains with Pullman cars. The union’s boycott tied up rail transportation across the country.
Railroad owners supported Pullman by linking Pullman cars to mail trains. 
They then appealed to President Grover Cleveland, persuading him to use the army to keep the mail trains running. A federal court issued an injunction forbidding interference with the operation of the mail and ordering railroad workers to abandon the boycott and the strike. For failing to respond to this injunction, Debs and other union leaders were arrested and jailed. The jailing 
387  TOPIC 6.7   L ABOR IN THE GILDED AGEof Debs and others effectively ended the strike. In the case of In re Debs (1895), 
the Supreme Court approved the use of court injunctions against strikes, which gave employers a very powerful legal weapon to break unions.
After serving a six-month jail sentence, Debs concluded that more radical 
solutions were needed to cure labor’s problems. He turned to socialism and the American Socialist Party, which he helped to found in 1900.
Conditions in 1900 
By 1900, only 3 percent of American workers belonged to unions. Management held the upper hand in labor disputes, with government generally taking its side. However, people were beginning to recognize the need for a better balance between the demands of employers and employees to avoid the numerous strikes and violence that characterized the late 19th century.
During the Gilded Age, industrial growth was concentrated in the Northeast 
and Midwest regions, the parts of the country with the largest populations, the most capital, and the best transportation. As industries grew, these regions developed more cities and attracted more immigrants from overseas and migrants from rural areas.

Topic 6.8
Immigration and Migration  
in the Gilded Age
Give me your tired, your poor, 
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, 
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore, 
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me: 
I lift my lamp beside the golden door.
Emma Lazarus, “The New Colossus, ” 1883, later inscribed  
on the Statue of Liberty
Learning Objective : Explain how cultural and economic factors affected 
migration patterns over time.
In 1893, more than 12 million people attended a world’s fair in Chicago 
known as the World’s Columbian Exposition. In just six decades, Chicago’s 
population had grown from a small town of fewer than 4,000 people to the country’s second largest city with more than a million residents, the fastest growing city in the nation, if not the world. However, visitors complained of the confusion of tongues, “worse than the tower of Babel, ” for in 1893 Chicago was a city of immigrants. More than three-fourths of its population were either foreign-born or the children of the foreign-born.
Growth of Immigration
The growing connections between the United States and the world are evident during this period, especially in the area of immigration. In the last half of the 19th century, the U.S. population more than tripled, from about 23.2 million in 1850 to 76.2 million in 1900. The arrival of 16.2 million immigrants fueled the growth. An additional 8.8 million more arrived during the peak years of immigration, 1901–1910. 
Push and Pull Factors An increased combination of “pushes” (negative 
factors from which people are fleeing) and “pulls”  (positive attractions of the 
adopted country) increased migrations around the world. Several negative forces drove Europeans to emigrate:
• The poverty of displaced farmworkers driven from the land by political turmoil and the mechanization of farm work
390 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION• Overcrowding and joblessness in European cities as a result of 
population growth
• Religious persecution, particularly against Jews in eastern Europe
Positive reasons for moving to the United States included the country’s 
reputation for political and religious freedom and the economic opportunities afforded by the settling of the West and the abundance of industrial jobs in U.S. cities. Economic opportunity fluctuated with the economy. The years of prosperity attracted more immigrants than did the years of depression. Furthermore, the introduction of large steamships and the relatively inexpensive one-way passage in the ships’ steerage” made it possible for millions of poor people to emigrate.
“Old” Immigrants from Europe Through the 1880s, the vast majority 
of immigrants came from northern and western Europe: the British Isles, Germany, and Scandinavia. Most of these “old” immigrants were Protestants, Their language (mostly English-speaking) and high level of literacy and occupational skills made it relatively easy for these immigrants to blend into a mostly rural American society in the early decades of the 19th century. However, Irish and German Roman Catholics faced significant discrimination.
“New” Immigrants from Europe Beginning in the 1890s and continuing 
to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the national origins of most immigrants changed. The “new” immigrants came from southern and eastern Europe. They were Italians, Greeks, Croats, Slovaks, Poles, and Russians. Many were poor and illiterate peasants who had left autocratic countries and therefore were unaccustomed to democratic traditions. Unlike the earlier groups of Protestant immigrants, the newcomers were largely Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, or Jewish. On arrival, most new immigrants crowded into poor ethnic neighborhoods in New Y ork, Chicago, and other major U.S. cities. An estimated 25 percent of them were “birds of passage, ” young men contracted for unskilled factory, mining, and construction jobs, who would return to their native lands once they had saved a fair sum of money to bring back to their families.
Immigrants from Asia The first large migration of Asians to the United 
States came from China after gold was discovered in California in 1848. Passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 ended the immigration of people from China (see Topic 6.9). However, Japanese, Korean, and Filipino immigrants found work in Hawaii, and some settled in California and other states. The first immigrants from South Asia arrived in the early 1900s. However, in response to anti-Asia feelings, Congress passed immigration restrictions in 1917 and 1924 that almost completely stopped immigration from the entire continent. Only Filipinos, because the United States took possession of the Philippines in 1898, could immigrate (see Topic 7.3).
Immigration and Growth of Cities
Urbanization and industrialization developed together. Cities provided both laborers for factories and a market for factory-made goods. The shift  
391  TOPIC 6.8   I MMIGRATION AND MIGRATION IN THE GILDED AGE  in population from rural to urban became more obvious with each passing 
decade. By 1900, almost 40 percent of Americans lived in towns or cities. By 1920, for the first time, more Americans lived in urban areas—then defined as places with 2,500 people or more—than in rural areas.
People moving into the cities included both immigrants and internal 
migrants born in the rural United States. In the late 19th century, millions of young Americans from rural areas decided to seek new economic opportunities in the cities. They left the farms for industrial and commercial jobs, and few of them returned. Among those who joined the movement from farms to cities were African Americans from the South. Between 1897 and 1930, nearly 1 million Black Southerners resettled in northern and western cities.
Patterns of Urban Development Cities of the late 19th century underwent 
significant developments. Not only did they grow in size, but also their internal structure and design changed.
Mass transportation had the effect of segregating urban workers by income. 
The upper and middle classes moved to streetcar suburbs (communities the grew along transit routes leading to an urban center) to escape the pollution, poverty , and crime of the city. The exodus of higher-income residents left older 
sections of the city to the working poor, many of whom were immigrants. The residential areas of the cities and suburbs both reflected and contributed to the class, race, ethnic, and cultural divisions in American society.
Ethnic Neighborhoods As affluent citizens moved out of residences near 
the business districts, the poor moved into them. To increase their profits, landlords divided up inner-city housing into small, windowless rooms. The resulting slums and tenement apartments  could cram more than 4,000 people 
into one city block. In an attempt to correct unlivable conditions, New Y ork City passed a law in 1879 that required each bedroom to have a window. The cheapest way for landlords to respond to the law was to build the so-called dumbbell tenements , buildings constructed with open ventilation shafts in the 
center to provide windows for each room. However, overcrowding and filth in new tenements continued to promote the spread of deadly diseases, such as cholera, typhoid, and tuberculosis. 
In their crowded tenement quarters, immigrant groups created distinct 
ethnic neighborhoods where each group could maintain its own language, culture, church or temple, and social club. Many groups even supported their own newspapers and schools. While often crowded, unhealthy, and crime-ridden, these neighborhoods (sometimes called “ghettos”) often served as springboards for ambitious and hardworking immigrants and their children to achieve their version of the American Dream.
This explosive growth of immigrants to the United States after 1865 renewed 
populist protests to keep down the number of immigrants, especially ones who differed by ethnicity, languages, and religions from the “old” immigrants. The efforts to discourage or restrict “new” immigrants drew upon earlier opposition to Irish, Italian, and Chinese immigration.

Responses to Immigration  
in the Gilded Age
Wide open and unguarded stand our gates, 
And through them presses a wild, motley throng . . . 
O liberty, white Goddess: Is it well 
To leave the gates unguarded?
Thomas Bailey Aldrich, “The Unguarded Gates?, ” 1892
Learning Objective : Explain the various responses to immigration in  
the period over time.
In the 1870s, when the French sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi began work 
on the Statue of Liberty, few laws restricted immigration to the United States. 
The only large restriction banned Chinese immigrants. By 1886, however—the year that the great welcoming statue was placed on its pedestal in New Y ork Harbor—Congress had passed a number of new laws restricting immigration. 
Opposition to Immigration
Several groups supported efforts to restrict immigration in the period from 1865 to 1898. Each focused on its own reasons, though often these reasons overlapped.
• Labor union members were motivated by economic concerns. They resented that employers used immigrants to depress wages and break strikes. 
• Employers benefitted from competition among workers for jobs, but they feared that immigrants would advocate radical reforms. Business owners often blamed strikes and the labor movement on foreign agitators. 
• Nativists felt alarmed that immigrants would not only take their jobs but would also weaken the culture of the Anglo majority. Often, nativists were Protestants who were openly prejudiced against Roman Catholics. The largest anti-Catholic organization of the 1890s was the American Protective Association.
• Social Darwinists believed that southern and eastern Europeans and all non-Europeans were biologically inferior to people of English and Germanic heritage. This idea was supported by many of the leading biologists of the 19th century before it was completely discredited.
395  TOPIC 6.9   R ESPONSES TO IMMIGRATION IN THE GILDED AGE  Restrictions on Chinese and Other Immigrants The first major laws 
limiting immigration based on race and nationality targeted the Chinese. This 
hostility toward the Chinese mainly came from the western states. In many mining towns, half the population was foreign-born, and often most of these were Chinese immigrants. In response to pressure from native-born miners, California passed a Miner’s Tax of $20 a month on all foreign-born miners. Then, in 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned all new immigration from China. The restrictions were not fully lifted until 1965.
Restrictions also came in 1882 on the immigration of “undesirable” 
persons, such as paupers, criminals, convicts, and those diagnosed as mentally incompetent. The Contract Labor Law of 1885 restricted temporary workers, 
an effort to protect American workers from competition. A literacy test for immigrants was vetoed by President Cleveland but passed in 1917. Soon after the opening of Ellis Island in New Y ork harbor as an immigration center in 1892, new arrivals had to pass more rigorous medical examinations and pay a tax before entering the United States. During a severe depression in the 1890s, nativist sentiment increased, as some jobless workers and employers used foreign-born residents as a convenient scapegoat for economic problems.
The Impact of Restrictions However, anti-immigrant feelings and early 
restrictions did not stop the flow of newcomers. Between 1860 and 1920, the foreign-born population numbered consistently between 13 and 15 percent of the population. The Statue of Liberty remained a beacon of hope for the poor and the oppressed of southern and eastern Europe until the Quota Acts of the 1920s almost closed Liberty’s golden door (see Topic 7.8).
Boss and Machine Politics
In many cities, politicians welcomed newly arrived immigrants to gain their loyalty in future elections. These tightly organized groups of politicians became known as political machines. Each machine had its “boss, ” the top 
politician who gave orders to the rank and file and doled out government jobs to loyal supporters. Several political machines, such as Tammany Hall in New Y ork City, started as social clubs and later developed into power centers to coordinate the needs of businesses, immigrants, and the underprivileged. In return, machines asked for people’s votes on election day.
Successful party bosses knew how to manage the competing social, ethnic, 
and economic groups in the city. Political machines often brought modern services to the city, including a crude form of welfare for urban newcomers. The political organization would find jobs and apartments for recently arrived immigrants and show up at a poor family’s door with baskets of food during hard times. 
But the political machines could be greedy as well as generous and often 
stole millions from the taxpayers in the form of graft and fraud. In New Y ork City in the 1860s, for example, an estimated 65 percent of public building funds ended up in the pockets of Tammany Hall’s “Boss” Tweed and his cronies.
396 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONSettlement Houses 
Concerned about the lives of the poor and new immigrants, a number of 
young, well-educated, middle-class women and men settled into immigrant neighborhoods to learn about the problems of immigrant families firsthand. Living and working in places called settlement houses, the young reformers 
hoped to relieve the effects of poverty by providing social services for people in the neighborhood. The most famous such experiment was Hull House in Chicago, which was started by Jane Addams and a college classmate in 1889. Settlement houses taught English to immigrants, pioneered early-childhood education, taught industrial arts, and established neighborhood theaters and music schools. By 1910, there were more than 400 settlement houses in America’s largest cities.
Although many immigrants remained in low paying jobs and lived in 
relative poverty in tenements, their children who took advantage of public education and the many opportunities of the industrial economy did join the growing middle class of this period.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WAS THE UNITED STATES A MELTING POT?
Politicians in the United States often claim that the country is a land of immigrants. To what extent did immigrants give up their heritage to become Americanized, or fully assimilated, into the existing culture? 
The Melting Pot Idea The prevailing view in the 19th and early 20th 
centuries was that the United States was a melting pot, in which immigrant groups quickly shed old-world characteristics in order to become successful citizens of their adopted country. This view was expressed as early as 1782 by a naturalized Frenchman, J. Hector St. John Crèvecoeur. In his Letters From 
an American Farmer, Crèvecoeur described how the American experience “melted” European immigrants “into a new race of men. ” The term “melting pot” became firmly associated with immigration in a popular play by that name: Israel Zangwill’s The Melting Pot  (1908). One line of this drama described “how 
the great Alchemist melts and fuses them [immigrants] with purging flames!”
The Salad Bowl Comparison In recent decades, the melting pot concept 
has come under intense scrutiny and has been challenged by modern historians. Carl N. Degler, for example, has argued that a more accurate metaphor would be the salad bowl, in which each ingredient (ethnic culture) remains intact. To support this view, Degler points to the diversity of religions in the United States. Neither immigrants nor their descendants gave up their religions for the Protestantism of the American majority.
Alienation In his groundbreaking study of immigration, The Uprooted  
(1952), Oscar Handlin observed that newcomers to a strange land often became alienated from both their native culture and the culture of their new country. According to Handlin, first-generation immigrants remained alienated and did not lose their cultural identity in the melting pot. Only the immigrants’ children 

397  TOPIC 6.9   R ESPONSES TO IMMIGRATION IN THE GILDED AGE  and children’s children became fully assimilated into mainstream culture. 
Many historians agree with Handlin that, after two or three generations, the melting pot, or assimilation, process reduced the cultural differences among most ethnic groups. 
African Americans However, certain groups have had a different 
experience. Historian Richard C. Wade has observed that African Americans who migrated to northern cities faced the special problem of racism, which has created seemingly permanent ghettos with “a growingly alienated and embittered group. ”
Ongoing Debate Historians remain divided in their analyses of the melting 
pot. Those who accept the concept see people of diverse ethnic backgrounds coming together to build a common culture. Others see American urban history characterized by intergroup hostility, alienation, crime, and corruption. The questions about past immigration shape current views of ethnic tensions in contemporary society. Is there a process, common to all groups, in which initial prejudice against the most recent immigrants fades after two or three generations?

400 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION
Topic 6.10
Development of the Middle Class
It is the tendency of all social burdens to crush out the middle class,  
and to force the society into an organization of only two classes, 
one at each social extreme.
William Graham Sumner, “What Makes the  
Rich Richer and the Poor Poorer?” 1887
Learning Objective : Explain the causes of increased economic 
opportunity and its effects on society.
The inequality and widening gap between the nation’s wealthy and the 
working class during the Gilded Age should not obscure the development 
of the American middle class. The industrialization also created many better paying jobs. Cities needed more professionals and specialists, and changes in American education also created more opportunities for both men and women. The growing middle class had more leisure time, which contributed to the development of the popular culture.
The Expanding Middle Class
Since colonial times, self-employed doctors, lawyers, merchants, and artisans had formed a middle class between the small wealthy elite and the numerous small farmers and farm laborers. The growth of large industries and corporations created new jobs for millions of white-collar workers (salaried employees whose jobs generally do not involve manual labor). Middle management was needed to coordinate the operations between the chief executives and the factories. Advanced technologies needed scientists and engineers. Sales and marketing departments required salespersons, accountants, and clerical workers. In turn, these middle-class employees increased the demand for services from other middle-class workers: professionals (doctors and lawyers), public employees, and storekeepers. The number of white-collar and salaried jobs increased to more than a fourth of all nonagricultural employees by 1910. 
The Gospel of Wealth
The role wealthy and upper-income Americans played in the late 19th century went beyond starting businesses and creating jobs. Many business leaders joined civic organizations and charitable institutions to address problems related to rapid urbanization. Andrew Carnegie’s “Gospel of Wealth” argued 
401  TOPIC 6.10   DEVELOPMENT OF THE MIDDLE CLASSthat the wealthy had a moral responsibility to carry out projects of civic 
philanthropy  to help other members of society to better themselves and in 
turn improve society. Carnegie defended unregulated capitalism, arguing that though it might be “hard for the individual” it was “best for the race. ”
However, he also believed that the wealthy had a duty to use their wealth 
wisely to improve the community. Practicing what he preached, Carnegie distributed more than $350 million of his fortune to fund libraries, universities, concert halls, and other public institutions. Critics attack his philosophy as paternalistic and based on the bogus racial science of his times.
Working Women
One adult woman out of every five in 1900 was in the labor force working for wages. Most were young and single—only 5 percent of married women worked outside the home. In 1900, men and women alike believed that, if a family could afford it, a woman’s proper role was in the home raising children. However, some women with access to higher education broke into professions  as doctors, 
lawyers, and college professors. As the demand for clerical workers increased, women moved into formerly male occupations as secretaries, bookkeepers, typists, and telephone operators. Occupations or professions, such as nursing and teaching, that became feminized (women becoming the majority) usually lost status and received lower wages and salaries. Factory work for women was usually in industries that people perceived as an extension of the home, such as the textile, garment, and food-processing businesses. 
Impact of Income on Urban Development
Cities of the late 19th century underwent significant changes not only in their size but also in their internal structure and design. The residential pattern in the United States contrasted with that in Europe, where higher-income people remained near the business districts of modern cities and lower-income people lived in the outlying areas. In the United States the wealthy and middle class migrated to the “healthier” suburbs to escape the problems of the cities.
Growth of Suburbs Middle-class families moved out of large cities to 
create suburbs for several reasons: 
• Low-cost, abundant land reduced the price of buying a home.
• The inexpensive transportation by rail made commuting to work easy.
• The spread of new construction methods such as the building of wooden, balloon-frame houses reduced the cost of building homes.
• Some people wanted to live in an all-White community because of their ethnic and racial prejudice.
• Many people enjoyed having grass, privacy, and detached individual houses.
402 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONLandscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed New Y ork’s 
Central Park in the 1860s, went on to design suburban communities with 
graceful curved roads and open spaces—“a village in the park. ” By 1900, suburbs had grown up around every major U.S. city. Owning a single-family home surrounded by an ornamental lawn soon became the American ideal of comfortable living and a hallmark of middle-class status. Thus began the world’s first suburban nation.
Private City Versus Public City At first, city residents tried to carry on 
life in large cities much as they had in small villages. Private enterprise shaped the development of American cities and provided services such as streetcars and utilities for a profit. Over time, increasing disease, crime, waste, water pollution, and air pollution slowly convinced reform-minded citizens and city governments of the need for municipal water purification, sewerage systems, waste disposal, street lighting, police departments, and zoning laws to regulate urban development. In the 1890s, the “City Beautiful” movement advanced grand plans to remake American cities with tree-lined boulevards, public parks, and public cultural attractions. The debate between the private good and the public good in urban growth and development has continued as an open issue.
Changes in Education
The growth of the middle class, industry, and knowledge in the physical and social sciences raised challenging questions about what schools should teach. 
Public Schools Elementary schools after 1865 continued to emphasize 
the “3 Rs” ( reading, writing, arithmetic). They taught traditional moral values 
through texts such as McGuffey’s readers that had been used in schools since the 1840s. New compulsory education laws that required children to attend school dramatically increased the number of students enrolled. As a result, the literacy rate rose to 90 percent of the population by 1900. The practice of sending children to kindergarten  (a concept borrowed from Germany) became 
popular and reflected the growing interest in early-childhood education.
Perhaps even more significant than lower-grade schools was the growing 
support for tax-supported public high schools. At first these schools followed the college preparatory curriculum of private academies, but soon the public high schools became more comprehensive. They began to provide vocational and citizenship education for a changing urban society.
Higher Education The growing demand for white-collar workers 
prompted a sharp increase in number and size of U.S. colleges in the late 1800s. Funding for these schools came from several sources: 
• The federal Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890 provided land grants to states to establish colleges. While earlier schools prepared students to be clergy or lawyers, land-grant schools focused on careers in agriculture, mining, engineering, science, and industry. These state-run colleges were also more affordable for the middle class, and they became valuable research centers that created new products and techniques.
403  TOPIC 6.10   DEVELOPMENT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS• Wealthy philanthropists founded new colleges or helped existing ones 
grow. For example, John D. Rockefeller provided the money to start the University of Chicago. 
• Advocates of education for females founded new colleges for women, such as Smith, Bryn Mawr, and Mount Holyoke. By 1900, 71 percent of colleges admitted women, and they made up more than one-third of all students.
• Supporters of education for African Americans founded more than 50 private and public colleges and universities, including Fisk, Howard, Morehouse, and Meharry Medical College.
The availability of an affordable college education encouraged a boost in 
enrollment, from 50,000 students nationwide in 1870 to more than 600,000 students by 1920.
The college curriculum also changed greatly in the late 19th century. 
Soon after becoming president of Harvard in 1869, Charles W . Eliot reduced the number of required courses and introduced electives  (courses chosen by 
students) to accommodate the teaching of modern languages and the sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, and geology. Johns Hopkins University was founded in Baltimore in 1876 as the first American institution to specialize in advanced graduate studies. Following the model of German universities, Johns Hopkins emphasized research and free inquiry. As a result of such innovations in curriculum, the United States produced its first generation of scholars who could compete with the intellectual achievements of Europeans. As the curriculum was changing, colleges added social activities, fraternities, and intercollegiate sports, additions that soon dominated the college experience for many students.
Social Sciences The application of the scientific method and the theory of 
evolution to the study of human affairs revolutionized how scholars analyzed human society in the late 19th century. New fields, known as the social sciences, emerged, such as psychology, sociology, anthropology, and political science, which focused on using data to address social issues. For example, Richard T. Ely of Johns Hopkins studied labor unions, trusts, and other existing economic institutions not only to understand them but also to suggest remedies for economic problems of the day. Based on his research, he attacked laissez-faire economic thought as dogmatic and outdated. Evolutionary theory influenced leading sociologists (Lester F . Ward), political scientists (Woodrow Wilson), and historians (Frederick Jackson Turner) to study the dynamic process of actual human behavior instead of logical, unchanging abstractions.
One social scientist who used new statistical methods to study crime in 
urban neighborhoods was W . E. B. Du Bois. The first African American to receive a doctorate from Harvard, Du Bois was the leading Black intellectual of the era. He advocated for racial equality, integrated schools, and equal access to higher education for the “talented tenth” of African Americans.
404 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Professions Scientific theory and methodology also influenced 
the work of doctors, educators, social workers, and lawyers. Oliver Wendell 
Holmes Jr. argued that the law should evolve with the times in response to 
changing needs and not remain restricted by legal precedents and judicial decisions of the past. Clarence Darrow , a famous lawyer, argued that criminal 
behavior could be caused by a person’s environment of poverty, neglect, and abuse. Darrow’s view challenged the traditional belief that people were born as criminals or consciously chose to become lawbreakers. These changes in the professions, along with changes in the universities, would provide a boost to progressive legislation and liberal reform in the 20th century.
Growth of Popular Culture
The growth of leisure time, especially for the expanding middle class, became 
a big business in the late 19th century. In addition to higher incomes, other factors also promoted the growth of leisure-time activities: (1) a gradual reduction in the hours people worked, (2) improved transportation, (3) promotional billboards and advertising, and (4) the decline of restrictive Puritan and Victorian values that discouraged “wasting” time on play.
Popular Press Mass-circulation newspapers had been around since the 
1830s, but the first newspaper to exceed a million in circulation was Joseph Pulitzer’s New York World , around 1890. Pulitzer filled his daily paper with 
both sensational stories of crimes and disasters and crusading feature stories about political and economic corruption. Another New Y ork publisher, William Randolph Hearst, pushed scandal and sensationalism to new heights (or lows).
Mass-circulation magazines also became common in the 1880s. Advertising 
revenues and new printing technologies made it possible for the Ladies’ Home Journal  and similar magazines to sell for as little as 10 cents a copy.
Amusements Theaters that presented comedies and dramas flourished 
in most large cities, but vaudeville, with its variety of acts, drew the largest audiences. Traveling circuses such as ones operated by the Ringling Brothers and by Barnum and Bailey (“The Greatest Show on Earth”) used the new railroad network to move a huge number of acts and animals from town to town. Also immensely popular was the Wild West show brought to urban audiences by William F . Cody (“Buffalo Bill”) and headlining such personalities as Sitting Bull and the markswoman Annie Oakley.
Commuter streetcar and railroad companies also promoted weekend 
recreation in order to keep their cars running on Sundays and holidays. They created parks in the countryside near the end of the line so that urban families could enjoy picnics and outdoor recreation.
Music With the growth of cities came increasing demand for musical 
performances appealing to a variety of tastes. By 1900, most large cities had an orchestra, an opera house, or both. In smaller towns, outdoor bandstands were the setting for the playing of popular marches by John Philip Sousa.
405  TOPIC 6.10   DEVELOPMENT OF THE MIDDLE CLASSAmong the greatest innovators of the era were African Americans in New 
Orleans. Jelly Roll Morton and Buddy Bolden expanded the audience for jazz, 
a musical form that combined African rhythms with European instruments, 
and mixed improvisation with a structured format. The remarkable Black composer and performer Scott Joplin sold nearly a million copies of sheet music of his “Maple Leaf Rag” (1899). Also from the South came blues  music 
that expressed the pain of the Black experience. Jazz, ragtime, and blues music gained popularity during the early 20th century as New Orleans performers headed north into the urban centers of Memphis, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Chicago.
Spectator Sports  Professional spectator sports originated in the late 
19th century. Baseball, while it recalled a rural past of green fields and fences, was very much an urban game that demanded the teamwork needed for an industrial age. Owners organized teams into leagues, much as trusts of the day were organized. In 1909, when President William Howard Taft started the tradition of the president throwing out the first ball of the season, baseball was the national pastime. However, Jim Crow laws and customs prevented Black players from joining all-White big-league baseball teams between the 1890s and 1947. 
Football  developed out of earlier games, primarily as a college activity. The 
first game was played in 1869 beween two New Jersey colleges, Rutgers and Princeton. In the 1920s professional football teams and leagues were organized. Basketball was invented in 1891 at Springfield College, in Massachusetts. Within a few years, high schools and colleges across the nation had teams. The first professional basketball league was organized in 1898. It took years for some spectator sports, such as football, to gain middle-class respectability.
Amateur Sports The value of sports as healthy exercise for the body 
gained acceptance by the middle and upper classes in the late 19th century. Women were considered unfit for most competitive sports, but they engaged in such recreational activities as croquet and bicycling. Sports such as golf and tennis grew, but mostly among the prosperous members of athletic clubs. 
The very rich pursued the expensive sports of polo  and yachting. Private clubs 
generally discriminated against Jews, Catholics, and African Americans. 
During the Gilded Age of industrialization, urban development and 
immigration created both problems and opportunities for the nation. The next topic will explore how the expanding middle class, along with intellectuals, religious leaders, artists, and others promoted a wide spectrum of reforms of American economic, political, social, and cultural institutions.

Topic 6.11
Reform in the Gilded Age
For every wrong there must be a remedy. But the remedy  
can be nothing less than the abolition of the wrong.
Henry George, Social Problems, 1884
Learning Objective : Explain how different reform movements responded 
to the rise of industrial capitalism in the Gilded Age.
Early efforts by farmers to regulate railroads (see Topic 6.2) and by workers 
to establish labor unions (see Topic 6.6) largely failed during the Gilded 
Age. However, many reform ideas and movements gained strength with the development of an educated middle class who also had the time to create and join organizations to bring about change. Literature, the arts, and architecture also responded in new ways to the challenge of industrialization and urbanization.
Awakening of Reform
Urban problems, including the desperate poverty of working-class families, inspired a new social consciousness among the middle class. Reform movements begun in earlier decades increased strength in the 1880s and 1890s.
Books of Social Criticism A San Francisco journalist, Henry George, 
published a provocative book in 1879 that became an instant bestseller and jolted readers to look more critically at the effects of laissez-faire economics. George called attention to the alarming inequalities in wealth caused by industrialization. In his book Progress and Poverty, George proposed an innovative solution to poverty: replacing all taxes with a single tax on land. 
Another popular book of social criticism, Looking Backward, 2000–1887, 
was written by Edward Bellamy in 1888. It envisioned life in the year 2000, when a cooperative society had eliminated poverty, greed, and crime. 
George and Bellamy shared some similarities. Both were criticized as 
utopians. Both inspired enthusiastic followers who supported other reform movements. Both encouraged a shift in American public opinion away from laissez-faire and toward greater government regulation. Because of their criticisms of the economic system of their time, George and Bellamy were sometime categorized as socialists. 
Religion and Society All religions adapted to the stresses and challenges 
of modern urban living. Roman Catholicism grew rapidly in the United States 
409  TOPIC 6.11   R EFORM IN THE GILDED AGEfrom the influx of new immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and eastern Europe. 
Catholic leaders such as Cardinal James Gibbons of Baltimore inspired the devoted support of old and new immigrants by defending the Knights of Labor and the cause of organized labor. 
Among Protestants, Dwight Moody, who founded the Moody Bible 
Institute in Chicago in 1889, would help generations of urban evangelists to adapt traditional Christianity to city life. The Salvation Army, imported from England in 1879, provided basic necessities to the homeless and the poor while preaching the Christian gospel.
The Social Gospel Movement In the 1880s and 1890s, a number of 
Protestant clergy espoused the cause of social justice for the poor—especially the urban poor. They preached what they called the Social Gospel, or the 
importance of applying Christian principles to social problems by improving housing, raising wages, and supporting public health measures. They believed that addressing issues of poverty would enable people to find individual salvation. This was a contrast with the beliefs of many traditional Christians, who argued that focusing on individual salvation would lead to a society with fewer problems. 
Leading the Social Gospel movement in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries was a Baptist minister from New Y ork, Walter Rauschenbusch. He 
worked in the poverty-stricken neighborhood of New Y ork City called Hell’s Kitchen and wrote several books urging organized religions to take up the cause of social justice. His Social Gospel preaching linked Christianity with the Progressive reform movement and encouraged many middle-class Protestants to attack urban problems (see Topic 7.4).
Social Workers Settlement workers, such as Jane Addams of Hull House 
in Chicago, were civic-minded volunteers who created the foundation for the later job of social worker. Many were also political activists who crusaded for child-labor laws, housing reform, and women’s rights. Two settlement workers, Frances Perkins and Harry Hopkins, went on to leadership roles in President Franklin Roosevelt’s reform program, the New Deal, in the 1930s.
Families in Urban Society Urban life placed severe strains on parents and 
their children by isolating them from the extended family (relatives beyond the family nucleus of parents and children) and village support. Divorce rates increased to 1 in 12 marriages by 1900, partly because a number of state legislatures had expanded the grounds for divorce to include cruelty and desertion. Another consequence of the shift from rural to urban living was a reduction in family size. Children were an economic asset on the farm, where their labor was needed at an early age. In the city, however, they were more of an economic liability. Therefore, in the last decades of the 19th century, the national average for birthrates and family size continued to drop.

class women. In 1890, two of the pioneer feminists of the 1840s, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony of New Y ork, helped found the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA ) to secure the vote for 
women. A western state, Wyoming, was the first to grant full suffrage to women, in 1869. By 1900, some states allowed women to vote in local elections, and most allowed women to own and control property after marriage.
Temperance Movement  Another cause that attracted the attention of 
urban reformers was temperance. Excessive drinking of alcohol by male factory workers was one cause of poverty for immigrant and working-class families. The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was formed in 1874. Advocating total abstinence from alcohol, the WCTU, under the leadership of Frances E. Willard of Evanston, Illinois, had 500,000 members by 1898. The Anti-Saloon League, founded in 1893, became a powerful political force and by 1916 had persuaded 21 states to close down all saloons and bars. Unwilling to wait for the laws to change, Carry A. Nation of Kansas created a sensation by raiding saloons and smashing barrels of beer with a hatchet.
Urban Reforms Across the country, grassroots efforts arose to combat 
corruption in city governments. In New Y ork, a reformer named Theodore Roosevelt tried to clean up the New Y ork City Police Department. As a result of his efforts, he became a vice-presidential nominee in 1896 and later the president (see Topic 7.4). However, many of the reformers of the Gilded Age would not see their efforts reach fruition or have a national impact until the early 20th century.
Literature and the Arts 
American writers and artists responded in diverse ways to industrialization and urban problems. In general, the work of the best-known innovators of the era reflected a new realism and an attempt to express an authentic American style.
411  TOPIC 6.11   R EFORM IN THE GILDED AGERealism and Naturalism Many of the popular works of literature of the 
post-Civil War years were romantic novels that depicted ideal heroes and 
heroines. Breaking with this genteel literary tradition were regionalist writers such as Bret Harte, who depicted life in the rough mining camps of the West. Mark Twain (the pen name for Samuel L. Clemens) became the first great realist author. His classic work, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  (1884), 
revealed the greed, violence, and racism in American society. 
A younger generation of authors who emerged in the 1890s became known 
for their naturalism, which focused on how emotions and experience shaped human experience. In his naturalistic novel Maggie: A Girl of the Streets (1893), Stephen Crane told how a brutal urban environment could destroy the lives of young people. Crane also wrote the popular The Red Badge of Courage about fear and human nature on the Civil War battlefield before dying himself of tuberculosis at only 29. Jack London, a young California writer and adventurer, portrayed the conflict between nature and civilization in novels such as The Call of the Wild (1903). A naturalistic book that caused a sensation and shocked the moral sensibilities of the time was Theodore Dreiser’s novel about a poor working girl in Chicago, Sister Carrie  (1900).
Painting Some American painters continued to cater to the popular 
taste for romantic subjects, but others responded to the new emphasis on realism. Winslow Homer, the foremost American painter of seascapes and 
watercolors, often rendered scenes of nature in a matter-of-fact way. Thomas Eakins’s realism included paintings of surgical scenes and the everyday lives of working-class men and women. He also used the new technology of serial-action photographs to study human anatomy and paint it more realistically.
James McNeill Whistler was born in Massachusetts but spent most of his 
life in Paris and London. His most famous painting, Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 1 (popularly known as “Whistler’s Mother”), hangs in the Louvre. This study of color, rather than subject matter, influenced the development of modern art. A distinguished portrait painter, Mary Cassatt, also spent much of her life in France, where she learned the techniques of impressionism, especially in her use of pastel colors. As the 19th century ended, a group of social realists, such as George Bellows of the Ashcan School, painted scenes of 
everyday life in poor urban neighborhoods.
Upsetting to romanticists and realists alike were abstract, nonrepresentational 
paintings that some artists were experimenting with. A large exhibit of these works, the Armory Show in New Y ork City in 1913, sent shocks through the artistic community. Art of this kind would be rejected by most Americans until the 1950s, when it finally achieved respect among collectors of fine art.
Architecture In the 1870s, Henry Hobson Richardson changed the 
direction of American architecture. While earlier architects found inspiration in classical Greek and Roman styles, his designs were often based on the medieval Romanesque style of massive stone walls and rounded arches. 
Richardson gave a gravity and stateliness to functional commercial buildings. Louis Sullivan of Chicago went a step further by rejecting historical styles in 
412 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONhis quest for a suitable style for the tall, steel-framed office buildings of the 
1880s and 1890s. Sullivan’s buildings achieved a much-admired aesthetic unity, in which the form of a building flowed from its function—a hallmark of the Chicago School of architecture. 
Source: Frank Lloyd Wright, Robie House, Chicago, 1909. Library of Congress
Frank Lloyd Wright, an employee of Sullivan’s in the 1890s, developed an 
“organic” style of architecture that was in harmony with its natural surroundings. Wright’s vision is exemplified in the long, horizontal lines of his prairie-style houses. Wright became the most famous American architect of the 20th century. Some architects, such as Daniel H. Burnham, who revived classical Greek and Roman architecture in his designs for the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893, continued to explore historical styles.
One of the most influential urbanists, Frederick Law Olmsted specialized 
in the planning of city parks and scenic boulevards, including Central Park in New Y ork City and the grounds of the U.S. Capitol in Washington. As the originator of landscape architecture, Olmsted not only designed parks, parkways, campuses, and suburbs but also established the basis for later urban landscaping.
Preparation for Change While laissez-faire policies still dominated 
business and politics in the Gilded Age, the foundations for cultural change and reforms that would come about in the early 20th century had been established during the 1880s and 1890s. Critics and artists informed the expanding middle class on alternative visions for the economy and society.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Questions 1–3 refer to the following excerpt.
“I stand before you tonight under indictment for the alleged crime of 
having voted at the last presidential election, without having a lawful right to vote. It shall be my work this evening to prove to you that in thus voting, I not only committed no crime, but, instead, simply exercised my citizen’s rights, guaranteed to me and all United States citizens by the National Constitution, beyond the power of any state to deny. . . . Are women persons? And I hardly believe any of our opponents will have the hardihood to say they are not. Being persons, then, women are citizens; and no state has a right to make any law, or to enforce any old law, that shall abridge their privileges or immunities. Hence, every discrimination against women in the constitutions and laws of the several states is today null and void, precisely as is every one against Negroes. ”

415  TOPIC 6.12   ROLE OF GOVERNMENT  IN THE GILDED AGE
Topic 6.12
Role of Government  
in the Gilded Age
To explain the causes which keep much of the ﬁnest intellect of  
the country away from national business is one thing; to deny the 
unfortunate results would be quite another.
James Bryce, The American Commonwealth, 1891
Learning Objective : Explain the continuities and changes in the role of 
the government in the U.S. economy.
The “do-little” governments of this period were in tune with two popular 
ideas of the time: laissez-faire economics and Social Darwinism (see Topic 6.6). 
The laissez-faire views of the business leaders and their political supporters opposed most government actions to regulate businesses, levy taxes, or take steps to counter serious economic downturn or depressions. Supporters argued that the economy would grow most quickly if allowed to work without government intervention, even during economic downturns. The federal courts generally supported these views. Decisions narrowly interpreted the government’s powers to regulate business, which limited the impact of the few regulatory laws that Congress did pass. 
However, the federal government was involved in the economy to promote 
business growth. It provided land grants to railroads at the expense of taxpayers, passed high tariffs to protect industries but cost consumers, and followed hard money policies that aided banks but hurt farmers.
Government Actions
Government was less active in the economy than it would be in later periods. However, it did take some steps to promote growth and competition.
Federal Land Grants Even though governments were reluctant to regulate 
businesses, they were willing to subsidize them. The federal government provided railroad companies with huge subsidies in the form of loans and land 
grants to promote progress. The government gave 80 railroad companies more 
than 170 million acres of public land, a total area larger than the state of Texas. The land was given in alternate mile-square sections in a checkerboard pattern along the proposed route of the railroad. The government expected that the railroad would sell the land to new settlers to finance construction. Furthermore, 
416 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONthe completed railroad might both increase the value of government lands and 
provide preferred rates for carrying the mail and transporting troops.
The subsidies carried some negative consequences. The land grants and 
cash loans promoted hasty and poor construction and led to corruption  in all 
levels of government. Insiders used construction companies, like the notorious Crédit Mobilier, to bribe government officials and pocket huge profits. Protests against the land grants mounted in the 1880s when citizens discovered that the railroads controlled half of the land in some western states.
Interstate Commerce Act (1887) State laws passed earlier to regulate 
railroad rates (see Topic 6.2) ran into numerous legal problems. The Supreme Court ruled in the case of Wabash v. Illinois (1886) that individual states could not regulate interstate commerce. In effect, the Court’s decision nullified many of the state regulations achieved by the Grangers. Congress responded to the outcry of farmers and shippers by passing the first federal effort to regulate the railroads. The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 required railroad rates to be “reasonable 
and just. ” It also set up the first federal regulatory agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which had the power to investigate pools, rebates, and other discriminatory practices and prosecute companies participating in them.
Ironically, the first U.S. regulatory commission helped the railroads more 
than the farmers. The new commission lost most of its cases in the federal courts in the 1890s. On the other hand, the ICC helped railroads by stabilizing rates and curtailing destructive competition, providing little help to farmers and other shippers until the law was strengthened in the 20th century.
Antitrust Movement  The corporate trusts, such as the Standard Oil Trust, 
came under widespread scrutiny and attack in the 1880s. Middle-class citizens feared the trusts’ unchecked concentration of power, and urban elites (old wealth) resented the increasing influence of the new rich. After failing to curb trusts on the state level, reformers finally moved Congress to pass the Sherman 
Antitrust Act  of 1890, which prohibited any “contract, combination, in the 
form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce. ”
Although a federal law against monopolies was now on the books, it 
was too vaguely worded to stop the development of trusts in the 1890s. Furthermore, the Supreme Court in United States v. E. C. Knight Co. (1895) 
ruled that the Sherman Antitrust Act could be applied only to commerce, not to manufacturing. As a result, the U.S. Department of Justice secured few convictions until the law was strengthened during the Progressive Era.
Foreign Policy and the Economy The government also used its foreign 
policy to shape economic changes. For example, the United States purchased Alaska from Russia and annexed the Hawaii Islands to promote trade with Asia and became more involved in Latin American affairs (see Topic 7.2).
Political Issues: Civil Service, Currency, and Tariffs
During the 1870s and 1880s, the Congresses in Washington were chiefly concerned with such issues as patronage, the money supply, and the tariff issue. 
417  TOPIC 6.12   ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN THE GILDED AGE  They left the states and local governments to deal with the growing problems 
related to urbanization and industrialization. 
Civil Service Reform Public outrage over the assassination of President 
Garfield  in 1881 by a deranged office seeker pushed Congress to remove 
certain government jobs from the control of party patronage. The Pendleton Act of 1881 set up the Civil Service Commission and created a system by which applicants for classified federal jobs would be selected on the basis of their scores on a competitive examination. The law also prohibited civil servants from making political contributions. At first, the law applied to only 10 percent of federal employees, but in later decades, the system was expanded until most federal jobs were classified (that is, taken out of the hands of politicians).
Politicians adapted to the reform by depending less on their armies of 
party workers and more on the rich to fund their campaigns. People still debate which approach is more harmful to democratic government.
Money Question The most hotly debated issue of the Gilded Age was 
how much to expand the money supply. For the economy to grow soundly, it needed more money in circulation. However, the money question reflected the growing tension in the era between the “haves” and the “have-nots. ”
Debtors , farmers, and start-up businesses wanted more “easy” or “soft” 
money in circulation, since this would enable them to (1) borrow money at lower interest rates and (2) pay off their loans more easily with inflated dollars. After the Panic of 1873, many Americans blamed the gold standard for restricting the money supply and causing the depression. To expand the supply of U.S. currency, easy-money advocates campaigned first for more paper money (greenbacks) and then for the unlimited minting of silver coins.
On the opposite side of the question, bankers, creditors, investors, and 
established businesses stood firm for “sound” or “hard” money—meaning 
currency backed by gold stored in government vaults. Supporters of hard money argued that dollars backed by gold would hold their value against inflation. Holders of money understood that as the U.S. economy and population grew faster than the number of gold-backed dollars, each dollar would gain in value. As predicted, the dollar did increase in value by as much as 300 percent between 1865 and 1895. 
Greenback Party  Paper money not backed by specie (gold or silver) had 
been issued by the federal government in the 1860s as an emergency measure for financing the Civil War. Northern farmers, who received high prices during the war, prospered from the use of “greenbacks. ” On the other hand, creditors and investors attacked the use of unbacked paper money as a violation of natural law. In 1875, Congress sided with the creditors and passed the Specie Resumption Act, which withdrew all greenbacks from circulation. 
Supporters of paper money formed a new political party, the Greenback 
Party. In the congressional election of 1878, Greenback candidates received 
418 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONnearly 1 million votes, and 14 members were elected to Congress, including 
James B. Weaver of Iowa (a future leader of the Populist Party). When the hard times of the 1870s ended, the Greenback Party died out, but the goal of increasing the amount of money in circulation did not.
Demands for Silver Money In addition to removing greenbacks, 
Congress in the 1870s also stopped the coining of silver. Critics call this action the “Crime of 1873. ” Then silver discoveries in Nevada revived demands for 
the use of silver to expand the money supply. A compromise law, the Bland-Allison Act, was passed. It allowed only a limited coinage of between $2 million and $4 million in silver each month at the standard silver-to-gold ratio of 16 to 1. Not satisfied, farmers, debtors, and western miners continued to press for the unlimited coinage of silver.
Tariff Issue During the Civil War, the Republican Congress had raised 
tariffs to protect U.S. industry and also fund the Union government. After the war, southern Democrats and some northern Democrats objected to high tariffs because these taxes raised prices for consumers. Protective tariffs also 
caused other nations to retaliate by placing taxes of their own on U.S. farm products. American farmers lost some overseas sales, contributing to surpluses of corn and wheat and resulting in lower farm prices and profits. From a farmer’s point of view, industry seemed to be growing rich at the expense of rural America.

The politics of stalemate and complacency would begin to lose their 
hold on the voters by the late 1880s. Protests over government corruption, 
the money issue, tariffs, railroads, and monopolistic trusts were growing. In response, politicians began to take small steps to respond to public concerns, but it would take a third party (the Populists) and a major depression in 1893 to shake the Democrats and the Republicans from their lethargy.

Topic 6.13
Politics in the Gilded Age
My country, ’tis of thee, Once land of liberty, Of thee I sing.  
Land of the millionaire; Farmers with pockets bare; 
Caused by the cursed snare—The Money Ring.
Alliance Songster, 1890
Learning Objective : Explain the similarities and differences between  
the political parties during the Gilded Age.
Congress had enacted an ambitious reform program during the 1860s and 
1870s—the era of Civil War and Reconstruction. After the Compromise of 
1877, the national government settled into an era of stalemate and comparative inactivity. It was an era of “forgettable” presidents, none of whom served two consecutive terms, and of politicians who largely ignored problems arising from the growth of industry and cities. Both major parties avoided taking stands on controversial issues. They rarely debated political ideology.
Political Stalemate
Several factors accounted for the complacency and conservatism of the era:  
(1) the way parties conducted campaigns, (2) the importance of party patronage, and (3) the beliefs about political strategy.
Popular Politics Election campaigns of the time were characterized by 
brass bands, flags, campaign buttons, picnics, free beer, and crowd-pleasing oratory. Both parties had strong organizations, the Republicans more on the state level and the Democrats more in the cities. Nearly 80 percent of the eligible voters voted in presidential elections, much higher than elections in later periods. The high turnout was a function of strong party identification and loyalty, often connected with the regional, religious, and ethnic ties of voters.
Party Patronage Since neither party had an active legislative agenda, 
politics in this era was chiefly a game of winning elections, holding office, and providing government jobs to the party faithful. Who got the patronage jobs within the party became a more important issue than any policy. Reform- minded politicians who did not play the patronage game were ridiculed as “Mugwumps” for sitting on the fence—their “mugs” on one side of the fence and “wumps” on the other. Because politicians failed to address pressing policy issues, historians generally consider this era a low point in American politics.
422 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONRepublicans  In the North, Republican politicians kept memories of the 
Civil War alive during the Gilded Age by figuratively waving the “bloody 
shirt. ” This meant reminding the millions of veterans of the Union army that 
their wounds had been caused by (southern) Democrats and that Abraham Lincoln had been murdered by a Democrat. The party of Lincoln, because of its antislavery past, kept the votes of reformers and African Americans. The core of Republican strength came from men in business and from middle-class, Anglo-Saxon Protestants , many of whom supported temperance  or 
prohibition. Republicans followed the Hamiltonian tradition and Whig past, 
supporting a pro-business economic program of high protective tariffs.
Democrats After 1877, Democrats could count upon winning every 
election in the “solid South, ” the former states of the Confederacy, until the mid-20th century. In the North, Democratic strength came from big-city political machines and immigrant voters. Democrats were often Catholics, Lutherans, and Jews who objected to temperance and prohibition crusades conducted by Protestant (and largely Republican) groups. Gilded Age Democrats, following in the Jeffersonian tradition  argued for states’ rights 
and limited federal power.
Campaign Strategy  The closeness of elections between 1876 and 1892 
was one reason that Republicans and Democrats alike avoided taking strong positions on the issues. The Democrats won only two presidential contests in the Electoral College (but four in the popular vote). They nevertheless controlled the House of Representatives after eight of the ten general elections. The result was divided government in Washington. With elections so evenly matched, the main objective for many politicians was to hold on to office by offering patronage jobs and government contracts to help their supporters. 
Rise of the Populists
Politics as usual was disrupted in the 1890s by growing agrarian discontent in the West and the South. Members of the Farmers’ Alliances elected U.S. senators and representatives, the governors of several states, and majorities in four state legislatures in the West.
Omaha Platform The Alliance movement provided the foundation of a 
new political party—the People’s, or Populist, Party. Delegates from different states met in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1892 to draft a political platform and nominate candidates for president and vice president for the new party. Populists were determined to do something about the concentration of economic power held by trusts and bankers, and they saw the government as the tool they needed.
Their Omaha Platform called for both political and economic reforms. 
Politically, it demanded an increase in the power of common voters through (1) direct popular election of U.S. senators (instead of indirect election by state legislatures) and (2) the use of initiatives and referendums, procedures that allowed citizens to vote directly on proposed laws. Economically, the Populist platform was even more ambitious. Populists advocated (1) unlimited coinage 
423  TOPIC 6.13   P OLITICS IN THE GILDED AGEof silver to increase the money supply; (2) a graduated income tax—the greater 
a person’s income, the higher the percentage of the tax on his or her income; (3) government ownership of railroads, telegraph lines, and the telephone 
systems; (4) loans and federal warehouses for farmers to enable them to stabilize prices for their crops; and (5) an eight-hour day for industrial workers.
The Populist movement seemed revolutionary both for its attack on 
laissez-faire capitalism and its attempt to unite White and Black poor people politically. In the South, Thomas Watson of Georgia appealed to poor farmers of both races who shared economic grievances to join the People’s Party.
The Election of 1892 In 1892, James Weaver of Iowa, the Populist 
candidate for president, won more than 1 million votes and 22 electoral votes, making him one of the few third-party candidates to win votes in the Electoral College. Nevertheless, the Populist demand that government regulate the economic system more strongly did not overcome other concerns. The ticket failed to attract urban workers in the North. It lost badly in the South, where the fear of Populists uniting all poor people drove conservative Democrats to use every technique to disfranchise African Americans (see Topic 6.4).
The two major parties provided a rematch between President Harrison 
and former president Grover Cleveland . This time, Cleveland won a solid 
victory in both the popular and electoral vote. He won in part because of the unpopularity of the high-tax McKinley Tariff. Cleveland became the first and only former president thus far to return to the White House after having left it.
Depression Politics
Cleveland took office in March 1893. Almost immediately, the country entered into one of the worst and longest depressions in its history. 
Panic of 1893 In the spring and summer of 1893, the stock market crashed 
as a result of overspeculation, and dozens of railroads went into bankruptcy as a result of overbuilding. The depression continued for almost four years. Farm foreclosures reached new highs, and the unemployed reached 20 percent of the workforce. Many people ended up relying on soup kitchens and riding the rails as hoboes. President Cleveland, more conservative than he had been in the 1880s, dealt with the crisis by championing the gold standard and otherwise adopting a hands-off policy toward the economy.
Gold Reserve and the Pullman Strike A decline in silver prices encouraged 
investors to trade their silver dollars for gold dollars. The gold reserve (bars of gold bullion stored by the U.S. Treasury) fell to a dangerously low level, and Cleveland decided to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890. This action, however, failed to stop the gold drain. The president then turned to the Wall Street banker J. Pierpont Morgan to borrow $65 million in gold to support the dollar and the gold standard. This deal convinced many Americans that the government in Washington was only a tool of rich eastern bankers. Workers became further disenchanted with Cleveland when he used court injunctions and federal troops to crush the Pullman strike in 1894 (see Topic 6.7).
424 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONTariff Reform and an Income Tax The Democrats did enact one measure 
that was somewhat more popular. Congress passed the Wilson-Gorman 
Tariff in 1894, which (1) provided a moderate reduction in tariff rates and (2) included a 2 percent income tax on incomes of more than $2,000. Since the average American income at this time was less than $500, only those with higher incomes would be subject to the income tax. Within a year after the passage of the law, however, the conservative Supreme Court declared an income tax unconstitutional. (Ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913 made an income tax constitutional.)
Jobless on the March As the depression worsened and the numbers of 
jobless people grew, conservatives feared class war between capital and labor. They were especially alarmed by the spread of the Pullman strike across the nation (see Topic 6.7) and the march to Washington in 1894 by thousands of the unemployed led by Populist Jacob S. Coxey of Ohio. “Coxey’s Army” 
demanded that the federal government spend $500 million on public works programs to create jobs. Coxey and other protest leaders were arrested for trespassing, and the dejected marchers returned home.
Also in 1894, a little book by William H. Harvey presenting lessons in 
economics seemed to offer easy answers for ending the depression. Illustrated with cartoons, Coin’s Financial School  taught millions of discontented 
Americans that their troubles were caused by a conspiracy of rich bankers and that prosperity would return if the government coined silver in unlimited quantities.
Turning Point in American Politics: 1896
National politics was in transition. The repeal of the Silver Purchase Act and Cleveland’s handling of the depression thoroughly discredited the conservative leadership of the Democratic Party. The Democrats were buried in the congressional elections of 1894 by the Republicans. At the same time, the Populists continued to gain both votes and legislative seats. The stage was set for a major reshaping of party politics in 1896.
The 1896 Presidential Race
The election of 1896 was one of the most emotional in U.S. history. The party alignments still reflected the Civil War, with Republicans strong in the North and Midwest and the Democrats strong in the South. The issues remained similar to those of the previous 20 years. Republicans advocated for high tariffs and against silver coinage, with Democrats calling for lower tariffs and divided on currency issues. Both parties claimed to oppose corruption. Democrats attacked the Republicans for their ties to trusts and big-money interests. Republicans attacked Democrats for representing urban party bosses (see Topic 6.9). However, 1896 also marked the beginning of a new era in American politics. 
425  TOPIC 6.13   P OLITICS IN THE GILDED AGEBryan, Democrats, and Populists Democrats were divided in 1896 
between “gold” Democrats loyal to Cleveland and pro-silver Democrats 
looking for a leader. Their national convention in Chicago in the summer of 1896 was dominated by the pro-silver forces. Addressing the convention, William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska captured the hearts of the delegates with a speech that ended with the words “We will answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to them: ‘Y ou shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold. ’” So powerful was Bryan’s “Cross of Gold” speech that it made him instantly the Democratic nominee for president. Bryan was only 36 years old.
The Democratic 
platform favored the unlimited coinage of silver  at the traditional, 
but inflationary, ratio of 16 ounces of silver to one ounce of gold. (The market price then was about 32 to 1.) Thus, the Democrats had taken over the leading issue of the Populist platform. Given little choice, the Populist convention in 1896 also nominated Bryan and conducted a “fused” campaign for “free silver. ” Unhappy with Bryan and free silver, the conservative faction of “Gold Bug” Democrats, including Cleveland, either formed the separate National Democratic Party or voted Republican.
McKinley, Hanna, and Republicans For their presidential nominee, 
the Republicans nominated William McKinley of Ohio, best known for his support of a high protective tariff but also considered a friend of labor. Marcus (Mark) Hanna, who had made a fortune in business, was the financial power behind McKinley’s nomination as well as the subsequent campaign for president. After blaming the Democrats for the Panic of 1893, the Republicans offered the American people the promise of a strong and prosperous industrial nation. The Republican platform proposed a high tariff to protect industry and upheld the gold standard against unlimited coinage of silver.
The Campaign The defection of Gold Bug Democrats over the silver 
issue gave the Republicans an early advantage. Bryan countered by turning the Democratic-Populist campaign into a nationwide crusade. Traveling by train from one end of the country to the other, the young candidate covered 18,000 miles and gave more than 600 speeches. His energy, positive attitude, and rousing oratory convinced millions of farmers and debtors that the unlimited coinage of silver was their salvation.

Caption: Bryan’s “Cross 
of Gold” speech was so famous that he reprinted it on a campaign poster.
426 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONMark Hanna meanwhile did most of the work of campaigning for McKinley. 
He raised millions of dollars for the Republican ticket from business leaders 
who feared that “silver lunacy” would lead to runaway inflation. Hanna used the money to sell McKinley through the mass media (newspapers, magazines), while the Republican candidate stayed home and conducted a safe, front-porch campaign, greeting delegations of supporters.
In the campaign’s last weeks, Bryan was hurt by a rise in wheat prices, which 
made farmers less desperate, and threats by employers telling their workers that factories would shut down if Bryan won. In a decisive victory, McKinley carried all of the Northeast and the upper Midwest, winning both the popular vote (7.1 million to 6.5 million) and the electoral vote (271 to 176).
McKinley’s Presidency
McKinley was lucky to take office just as the economy began to revive. Gold discoveries in Alaska in 1897 increased the money supply under the gold standard, which resulted in the inflation that the silverites had wanted. Farm prices rose, factory production increased, and the stock market climbed. The Republicans honored their platform by enacting the Dingley Tariff of 1897 that increased the tariff to more than 46 percent and, in 1900, made gold the official standard of the U.S. currency. McKinley was a well-liked, well-traveled president who tried to bring conflicting interests together. As leader during the war with Spain in 1898, he helped to make the United States a world power.
Significance of the Election of 1896
The election of 1896 had significant short-term and long-term consequences on American politics. It marked the end of the stalemate and stagnation that had characterized politics in the Gilded Age. 
Populist Demise The Populist Party declined after 1896 and soon ceased 
to be a national party. In the South, Thomas Watson and other Populist leaders gave up trying to unite White and Black people, having discovered the hard lesson that racism was stronger than common economic interests. Ironically, in defeat, much of the Populist reform agenda, such as the graduated income tax and popular election of senators, was adopted by both the Democrats and reform-minded Republicans during the Progressive Era (1900–1917).
Beginning of Modern Politics The defeat of Bryan and the Populist free-
silver movement initiated an era of Republican dominance of the presidency, electing six of the next seven presidents, and controlling both houses of Congress for 17 of the next 20 sessions. Once the party of “free soil, free labor, and free men, ” the Republicans had become the party of business and industry, though it continued to advocate for a strong national government. Mark Hanna, the master of high-finance politics, created a model for organizing and financing a successful campaign. Campaigns focused on winning favorable publicity in the dominant mass media of the day: print newspapers. 
427  TOPIC 6.13   P OLITICS IN THE GILDED AGEUrban Dominance The election of 1896 was a clear victory for big 
business, urban centers, conservative economics, and moderate, middle-class 
values. It proved to be the last hope of rural America to reclaim its former dominance in American politics. Some historians see the election marking the triumph of the values of modern industrial and urban America over the rural ideals of the America of Jefferson and Jackson.
President McKinley emerged as the first modern president, an active 
leader who took the United States from being relatively isolated to becoming a major player in international affairs during the 20th century. During the Gilded Age, the United States had developed into a leading industrial nation, but its role on the world stage had been of secondary importance. That would soon change with the Spanish-American War (see Topic 7.3).

Questions 1–3 refer to the following excerpt.
“My Dear Nephew,
“Never allow yourself to lose sight of that fact that politics, and not poker, 
is our great American game. If this could be beaten into the heads of some presumably well-meaning but glaringly unpractical people, we should hear less idiotic talk about reform in connection with politics. Nobody ever dreams of organizing a reform movement in poker. . . . 
Mr. Lincoln, a very estimable and justly popular, but in some respects an 
impracticable man, formulated another widely different error in regard to politics. He held that ours is a government of the people, by the people, for the people. I maintain, on the contrary, that it is government of politicians, by politicians, for politicians. If your political career is to be a success, you must understand and respect this distinction with a difference. ”

Topic 6.14
Continuity and Change Period 6
Learning Objective : Explain the extent to which industrialization 
brought changes from 1865 to 1898.
You can use the reasoning process of continuity and change to consider the 
many aspects of industrialization from 1865 to 1898. On the AP® exam, a 
question might focus on one factor such as markets, technological innovation, government policies, migration, or urban development. In an effort to “Explain the extent to which large-scale industries changed markets in the United States from 1865 to 1898, ” one could make the argument that larger, more efficient manufacturers such as Carnegie Steel demonstrated a continuation of long-term trends. This argument could be made more complex in multiple ways:
• One could corroborate  the argument with examples from other 
industries. For example, Rockefeller’s Standard Oil business improved efficiency and bought up competitors to dominate the oil industry.
• One could qualify the argument by pointing out changes introduced by industry. For example, Carnegie used vertical integration.
• One could modify the argument by explaining that some markets continued to be dominated by regional businesses such as local railroads and breweries.  
The ability to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument using diverse 
evidence is one way to develop a complex argument in an essay.
QUESTIONS ABOUT CONTINUITY AND CHANGE
1. Explain the extent to which industrialization led to continuity or change in migration patterns to and within the United States from 1865 to 1898. For example, the main argument might be that jobs created by industrialization greatly increased migration to Northeastern and Midwestern cities, 
2. Explain the extent to which industrialization led to changes in American culture from 1865 to 1898. For example, the main argument might be that industrialization helped to expand the middle class in the United States, which influenced changes in reform movements, education, and literature. 
431  TOPIC 6.14   C ONTINUITY AND CHANGE PERIOD 6THINK AS A HISTORIAN:  CONTEXTUALIZATION
In everyday language, context means the words or conditions around 
something. The context for this passage is that it is part of a book about U.S. history. The context in which are reading it is a class. To a historian, context includes a broader historical picture. Contextualization involves two skills:
• Identify a context: This means the test makers present you with a specific 
example of a person, event, object, or location. Then you identify or describe the context—the broader historical picture in which it took place.
• Explain specifics: This mean the test makers provide you with a historical 
context. Then you list or describe one or more people, events, objects, or locations that were affected by that context.
For example, an item on the AP® exam might name a specific invention, 
such as barbed wire. The test makers might ask you to identify a context related to that invention. In the case of barbed wire, you could identify the context of the rise of the cattle-ranching industry in some western states. Or you could identify the pushing of Native Americans off their lands, the closing of the American frontier, or the establishment of the cattle frontier.
What about explaining specifics related to a larger historical context? For 
instance, an item on the exam might mention the labor movement and ask you to name a specific example related to that context. In this case, you might mention the names of specific labor leaders or business owners. Y ou might also name a specific strike or describe one aspect of industrial warfare (such as blacklists).
Items related to contextualization may appear anywhere on the AP® exam. 
The easiest way to understand this skill is to practice it. 
Read each example below. For each one, write a sentence or two that identifies 
its context.  
1. The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 
2. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 
3. Hull House being established in Chicago in 1889
4. The opening of an immigrant processing facility on Ellis Island in 1892
5. W . E. B. Du Bois receiving a doctorate from Harvard in 1895
Read each context below. For each one, identify one specific example that was shaped by that context.  
6. Growth of the popular press
7. The rise of spectator sports
8. Women’s suffrage
9. The conservation movement
10. Technology in cities

UNIT 6 — Period 6 Review :  
1865–1898
WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  WRITE THE INTRODUCTION
After you analyze the task, gather and organize evidence, and develop an 
effective thesis statement, much of the hard work in writing a long essay is behind you. The most challenging task still remaining is to write an introduction that 1) serves as a blueprint for the rest of the essay and 2) casts the topic in a broader historical perspective.
The Introduction as Blueprint A good introduction conveys the 
framework or limits of the topic as well as a clear debatable and defensible claim. The claim should be expressed in one or more sentences in the same location—ideally the introduction. The introduction also suggests the organizational pattern and reasoning process that will unfold in the rest of the essay. In other words, it conveys (without saying), “Here’s what I’m going to argue. Here’s the reasoning process I am going to use to convince you. Here’s the order I will use to present my ideas. ” The reasoning process may be causation, continuity and change, or comparison.  
Historical Perspective A good introduction also demonstrates 
contextualization by relating the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occur before or during or that continue after the time frame of the question. The introduction is a good place to state the historical perspective, but it will need further development. 
Application: Find both the blueprint and historical perspective in the following 
introduction. How does the introduction answer these questions:
• What is the author’s argument? 
• What reasoning process will the author use? 
• What order will the author likely use? 
• How does the topic relate to broader historical events, developments, or 
processes?
The rise of industrial capitalism in the United States between 1865 and 1898 
marked a dramatic break with the economic values that guided Americans before 1865. The beliefs of the Puritans toward work, the individualism represented by Benajmin Franklin, and the pragmatic use of government in Henry Clay’s American Plan were left behind as the country developed new ways to think about the economy. This change was part of a larger shift in the culture away from individualism that was reflected in politics and the arts.

Q: How is the freight and passenger pool working?
W .V .: Very satisfactorily. I don’t like that expression “pool, ” however, that’s a com-mon construction applied by the people to a combination which the leading roads have entered into to keep rates at a point where they will pay dividends to the stockholders. The railroads are not run for the beneﬁt of the “dear public”—that cry is all nonsense—they are built by men who invest their money and expect to get a fair percentage on the same.
Q: Does your limited express pay?
W .V .: No; not a bit of it. We only run it because we are forced to do so by the action of the Pennsylvania road. It doesn’t pay expenses. We would abandon it if it was not for our competitor keeping its train on.
Q: But don’t you run it for the public beneﬁt?
W .V .: The public be damned. What does the public care for the railroads except to get as much out of them for as small consideration as possible? I don’t take any stock in this silly nonsense about working for anybody’s good but our own.

UNIT 7 — Period 7: 1890–1945
Topic 7.1 
Contextualizing Period 7
Learning Objective : Explain the context in which America grew into the 
role as a world power.
In the 55 years from 1890 to 1945, Americans went from horses and buggies 
to automobiles and airplanes. Within these decades, the United States fought 
in two horrific world wars, experienced the worst depression in its history, and emerged a world leader. Altogether, this period brought dramatic changes to how Americans lived and the role of their government.
By 1890 the United States had surpassed Great Britain as the leading 
industrial power in the world, and it would increase that economic leadership through World War II. A strong economy also provided the foundation for America’s expanding role in international affairs and its emergence in 1945 as the world’s leading political and military power. Industrialization, urbanization, and immigration continued to shape events during these years.  
Economic Growth U.S. economic expansion  continued during this period 
as the nation continued the transition from a rural, agricultural economy to an urban, industrial one. This development included the growth of large corporations  and the repetition of earlier cycles of economic booms and busts, 
culminating in severe hardship during the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
Stability and Democracy Economic changes along with political and social 
issues resulted in two significant reform periods , the time of the Progressives  and 
the New Deal. Progressives in the first two decades of the 20th century turned to government action to address economic instability  through the creation of 
the Federal Reserve to regulate banking and the business cycle. Progressives also responded to political corruption  by reforming election practices, such as 
instituting the direct elections of U.S. senators by voters. Social reforms included a constitutional amendment that gave women the right to vote, a landmark in the struggle for gender equality that would continue into the present.
Responding to an Economic Crisis The economic collapse and mass 
unemployment of the Great Depression  challenged the laissez-faire  economic 
policies of the 1920s. In response, the Democrats’ New Deal  created a limited 
welfare state  to address mass unemployment, to reduce poverty among the 
elderly, and to help others experiencing economic hardships. Congress 
439  TOPIC 7.1    C ONTE xTUALIz ING PERIOD 7passed laws regulating banks and the stock market, guaranteeing a minimum 
wage, creating Social Security and protecting workers in labor unions. The increasing role and size of government to meet problems caused by industrialization fostered the emerging ideology of American liberalism. 
Conflicts in Culture and Society Popular culture  grew dramatically with 
the introduction of new mass media , such as radio and motion pictures. Changes 
in popular culture sparked value conflicts  over morals, education, religion and 
science. Some churches objected to the science of evolution being taught in public schools. Reactions to the growth of immigration and internal migration resulted in debates over national identity  and the passage of federal restrictions 
on immigration  based on one’s ethnicity or national origin. A resurgent Ku 
Klux Klan attacked, both politically and physically, African Americans, Roman Catholics, Jews, and immigrants.
Shifts in Foreign Relations The conflicts over imperialism and two world 
wars renewed debate over America’s role in the world . The acquisition of new 
territories after the Spanish-American War caused some people to question its commitment to traditional national values  of freedom, independence, and self-
government. In World War I, Americans disagreed over the degree of American interests in the conflict and the best approach to insure national security. After 
the war, Congress and voters rejected membership in the League of Nations.
However, World War II thrust the United States, with its unrivaled 
economic, political, and military power, into a leadership role  in the world. In 
1945, the United States embraced the concept of collective security and played a leading role in creating the United Nations. Decisions made after the war, such as the nation’s close alliance with western Europe and its commitment to anti-communism, shaped American foreign policy through the end of the century.

Imperialism: Debates
Our form of government, our traditions, our present interests, and our 
future welfare, all forbid our entering upon a career of conquest.
William Jennings Bryan, December 13, 1898
Learning Objective : Explain the similarities and differences in attitudes 
about the nation’s proper role in the world.
After the 1790s, U.S. foreign policy had centered on expanding westward, 
protecting U.S. interests abroad, and limiting foreign influences in the Americas. 
After the Civil War, with a booming industrial economy, the United States showed increasing interest not only in overseas trade, but also in establishing bases and territories in the Caribbean Sea and across the Pacific Ocean. After 1890, the nation carried on a growing debate over whether it should join the competition for overseas territories with imperialist nations of the world or remain true to its anti-colonial traditions.
Expansion after the Civil War 
William H. Seward of New Y ork served as secretary of state (1861–1869) under both Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. Seward was the most influential secretary of state since John Quincy Adams (who formulated the Monroe Doctrine in 1823). During the Civil War, Seward helped prevent Great Britain and France from entering the war on the side of the Confederacy. He led the drive to annex Midway Island in the Pacific, gained rights to build a canal in Nicaragua, and purchased the vast territory of Alaska. Despite his powerful advocacy for expansionism, Seward failed to convince Congress to annex Hawaii and to purchase the Danish West Indies.
The Purchase of Alaska For decades, Russia and Great Britain both 
claimed the vast territory of Alaska. Russia finally assumed control and established a small colony for seal hunting, but the territory soon became an economic burden because of the threat of a British takeover. Seeking buyers, Russia found Seward to be an enthusiastic champion of the idea of the United States purchasing Alaska. As a result of Seward’s lobbying, and also in appreciation of Russian support during the Civil War, Congress in 1867 agreed to buy Alaska for $7.2 million. However, for many years Americans saw no value in Alaska and referred to it derisively as “Seward’s Folly” or “Seward’s Icebox” and ignored its development.
441  TOPIC 7.2   I MPERIALISM: DEBATESHawaiian Islands Since the mid-1800s, American missionaries and 
entrepreneurs had settled in the Pacific islands of Hawaii. Later, a U.S. 
commission explored the use of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, or the Sandwich Islands, which lay astride the sea-lanes from California to China. In 1870, Ulysses S. Grant sought control of Pearl Harbor on Oahu and new trade treaties with the native kingdom. Hawaiians agreed to a treaty in 1875 giving the United States exclusive rights to Hawaiian sugar. In 1893, American settlers aided in the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarch, Queen Liliuokalani  and 
then petitioned for annexation by the United States. If Hawaii became part of the United States, Hawaiian sugar would not be subject to the high U.S. tariffs on imports. However, President Grover Cleveland  opposed imperialism and 
blocked Republican efforts to annex Hawaii. 
The Era of “New Imperialism” 
The conquest and division of many parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands by more industrialized nations during the 19th century marked a renewed interest in imperialism. Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Japan, and other nations, some as small as Belgium, gained control by arms or by economic dominance. The United States also participated in this contest. Most U.S. advocates of expansionism hoped to succeed through economic and diplomatic means, without resorting to military action. Expansion into new territories continued a long pattern in U.S. history, but adding land overseas was a change from the past. People supported expansion for different combinations of reasons. 
Economic Interests The country’s growing industries were strong 
supporters of expanding U.S. economic interests around the world. Foreign countries offered both valuable raw materials, including minerals, oil, and rubber, and provided markets for products. Many in the Republican Party were closely allied with business leaders and therefore generally endorsed an imperialist foreign policy. Like industrialists, farmers were eager to sell overseas. They saw the growing populations of cities, both in the United States and internationally, as potential markets for wheat, corn, and livestock.
Political and Military Power Some people believed that the United States 
needed to compete with the imperialistic nations or it would be sidelined as a second-class power in world affairs. Chief among these was U.S. Navy Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan. He shaped the debate over the need for naval bases with his book The Influence of Sea Power Upon History (1890). He argued that a strong navy was crucial to a country’s ambitions of securing foreign markets and becoming a world power. Mahan’s book was widely read by prominent American citizens as well as by political leaders in Europe and Japan. 
Using arguments in Mahan’s book, U.S. naval strategists persuaded 
Congress to finance the construction of modern steel ships and encouraged the acquisition of overseas islands. Among these islands were Samoa and others in the Pacific Ocean that provided coaling and supply stations so that the new fleet could project power globally. By 1900, the U.S. Navy was the third largest in the world. Among politicians, Assistant Secretary of the Navy and 
442 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONlater President Theodore Roosevelt and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge were the 
leading proponents of expanding U.S. naval power and influence in the world.
Social Fears The Panic of 1893, the violence of labor-management 
conflicts, and the perception that the country no longer had a frontier in the 1890s caused fear of increasing social turmoil. Overseas territories and adventures offered the country a possible safety valve for dissatisfied urban workers and farmers. 
Darwinism and Religion Some saw expansion into the Caribbean, 
Central America, and the Pacific Ocean as an extension of the idea of Manifest Destiny that had long fostered westward expansion. In addition, they applied Darwin’s concept of the survival of the fittest not only to competition in business but also to competition among countries. Therefore, to demonstrate strength in the international arena, expansionists wanted to acquire territories overseas. In his book Our Country: Its Possible Future and Present Crisis (1885), the Reverend Josiah Strong  wrote that people of Anglo-Saxon stock were “the 
fittest to survive. ” He believed that Protestant Americans had a religious duty to colonize other lands in order to spread Christianity and the benefits of their “superior” civilization (medicine, science, and technology) to “less fortunate” peoples of the world. Many missionaries who traveled to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands believed in the racial superiority of White people, although some went more for humanitarian reasons. To support these missionaries, many Americans called for active U.S. government involvement in foreign affairs.
Popular Press  Newspaper and magazine editors found that they could 
increase circulation by printing adventure stories about distant places exotic to their readers. Stories in the popular press increased public interest and stimulated demands for a larger U.S. role in world affairs.
Opposition to Imperialism
Many people in the United States strongly opposed imperialism. They did so for a combination of reasons:
• They believed in self-determination. One of the founding principles of the United States was that people should govern themselves. They believed that this principle applied to people everywhere, not just in the United States. They felt that imperialism was morally wrong.
• They rejected imperialist racial theories. Some denied that Whites were biologically superior to people of Asia or Africa, and so Whites had no right to rule others. However, many Americans feared adding nonwhite people to the country.
• They supported isolationism. George Washington had advised the country to avoid involvement in foreign affairs. Anti-imperialists argued that this was still good advice.
• They opposed the expense of imperialism. Building a large navy and controlling foreign territories would cost more than they were worth.
443  TOPIC 7.2   I MPERIALISM: DEBATESLatin America
Beginning with the Monroe Doctrine in the 1820s, the United States had taken 
a special interest in problems of the Western Hemisphere and had assumed the role of protector of Latin America from European ambitions. Benjamin Harrison’s Secretary of State James G. Blaine of Maine played a principal role in extending this tradition.
Pan-American Diplomacy Blaine’s repeated efforts to establish closer 
ties between the United States and its southern neighbors bore fruit in 1889 with the meeting of the first Pan-American Conference in Washington. Representatives from various nations of the Western Hemisphere decided to create a permanent organization to promote cooperation on trade and other issues. Blaine had hoped to reduce tariff rates. Although this goal was not achieved, the foundation was established for the larger goal of hemispheric cooperation on both economic and political issues. The Pan-American Union continues today as part of the Organization of American States, which was established in 1948.
Cleveland, Olney, and the Monroe Doctrine One of the most important 
uses of the Monroe Doctrine in the late 19th century concerned a boundary dispute between Venezuela and its neighbor—the British colony of Guiana. In 1895 and 1896, President Cleveland and Secretary of State Richard Olney insisted that Great Britain agree to arbitrate the dispute. The British initially said the matter was not the business of the United States. However, the United States argued that the Monroe Doctrine applied to the situation. If the British did not arbitrate, the United States would back up its argument with military force.
Deciding that U.S. friendship was more important to its long-term interests 
than a boundary dispute in South America, the British agreed to U.S. demands. As it turned out, the arbitrators ruled mainly in favor of Britain, not Venezuela. Even so, Latin American nations appreciated U.S. efforts to protect them from European domination. The Venezuela boundary dispute marked a turning point in U.S.–British relations. From 1895 on, the two countries cultivated a friendship rather than continuing their former rivalry. The friendship would prove vital for both nations in the 20th century.
Growing Conflict over Imperialism The precedent of the Monroe 
Doctrine provided expansionists an open invitation to interfere in the other nations of the Americas. This was the beginning of a fierce political battle over the future of the country. One side represented the anti-colonial and self-government traditions of the nation rooted in the struggle for independence against Great Britain. The other side expressed the interests of those committed to economic and global power. The conflict between imperialists and anti-imperialists over controlling overseas territories intensified in the debate over the Spanish-American War and the colonization of the Philippines (see Topic 7.3).

The Spanish-American War and  
 U.S. Foreign Policy to 1917
We are Anglo-Saxons, and must obey our blood and  
occupy new markets, and, if necessary, new lands. 
Senator Albert Beveridge, April 27, 1898
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the Spanish-
American War.
The first targets of American imperialism were nearby Caribbean islands. 
Expansionists from the South had coveted Cuba as early as the 1850s. Now, 
in the 1890s, large American investments in Cuban sugar, Spanish misrule of Cuba, and the Monroe Doctrine all provided reasons for U.S. intervention in the Caribbean’s largest island. Connected to U.S. involvement on Cuba, an island only 90 miles south of mainland United States, came involvement in the Philippines, islands over 7,000 miles to the west.
Spanish-American War
In the 1890s, American public opinion was being swept by a growing wave of jingoism—an intense form of nationalism calling for an aggressive foreign 
policy. Expansionists demanded that the United States take its place with the imperialist nations of Europe as a world power. Not everyone favored such a policy. Presidents Cleveland and McKinley were among many who thought military action abroad was both morally wrong and economically unsound. Nevertheless, specific events combined with background pressures led to overwhelming popular demand for war against Spain.
Causes of the War
A combination of jingoism, economic interests, and moral concerns made the United States more willing to go to war than it had been. These factors came together in 1898. 
Cuban Revolt  Cuban nationalists fought but failed to overthrow Spanish 
colonial rule between 1868 and 1878. They renewed the struggle in 1895. Through sabotage and attacks on Cuban plantations, they hoped to either push Spain out or pull the United States in as an ally. In response, Spain sent 
447  TOPIC 7.3   THE SPANISH -AMERICAN WAR AND U .S. F OREIGN POLICY TO 1917 autocratic General Valeriano Weyler and 100,000 troops to crush the revolt. 
Weyler forced civilians into camps, where tens of thousands died of starvation and disease. This action gained him the title of “the Butcher” in the U.S. press.
Y ellow Press Actively promoting war fever in the United States was 
“yellow journalism, ” sensationalistic reporting that featured bold and lurid headlines of crime, disaster, and scandal. Among the most sensationalistic newspapers were Joseph Pulitzer’s Ne w York  World  and William Randolph 
Hearst’s Ne w York  Journal.  These papers printed exaggerated and false 
accounts of Spanish atrocities in Cuba. Believing what they read daily in their newspapers, many Americans urged Congress and the president to intervene in Cuba for humanitarian reasons and put a stop to the atrocities and suffering.
De Lôme Letter (1898) One story that caused a storm of outrage was a 
Spanish diplomat’s letter that was leaked to the press and printed on the front page of Hearst’s Journal.  Written by the Spanish minister to the United States, 
Dupuy de Lôme, the letter was highly critical of President McKinley. Many considered it an official Spanish insult against the U.S. national honor.
Sinking of the Maine  Less than one week after the de Lôme letter made 
headlines, a far more shocking event occurred. On February 15, 1898, the U.S. battleship USS Maine  was at anchor in the harbor of Havana, Cuba, when it 
suddenly exploded, killing 260 Americans on board. The yellow press accused Spain of deliberately blowing up the ship. However, experts later concluded that the explosion was probably an accident.
McKinley’s War Message Following the sinking of the USS Maine,  
President McKinley issued an ultimatum to Spain demanding that it agree to a ceasefire in Cuba. Spain agreed to this demand, but U.S. newspapers and a majority in Congress kept clamoring for war. McKinley yielded to the public pressure in April by sending a war message to Congress. He offered four reasons why the United States should support the Cuban rebels:
1. “Put an end to the barbarities, bloodshed, starvation, and horrible miseries” in Cuba
2. Protect the lives and property of U.S. citizens living in Cuba
3. End “the very serious injury to the commerce, trade, and business of our people”
4. End “the constant menace to our peace” arising from disorder in Cuba
Teller Amendment Responding to the president’s message, Congress 
passed a joint resolution on April 20, 1898, authorizing war. Part of the resolution, the Teller Amendment, declared that the United States had no intention of taking political control of Cuba and that, once peace was restored to the island, the Cuban people would control their own government.
448 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONFighting the War
The first shots of the Spanish-American War were fired in Manila Bay in the 
Philippines, over 9,000 miles from Cuba. The last shots were fired only a few months later in August. So swift was the U.S. victory that Secretary of State John Hay called it “a splendid little war. ”
The Philippines Theodore Roosevelt, McKinley’s assistant secretary of 
the navy, was an expansionist eager to show off the power of his country’s new, all-steel navy. Anticipating war, and recognizing the strategic value of Spain’s territories in the Pacific, Roosevelt had ordered a fleet commanded by Commodore George Dewey to go to the Philippines. This large group of islands had been under Spanish control ever since the 1500s.
On May 1, shortly after war was declared, Commodore Dewey’s fleet 
fired on Spanish ships in Manila Bay. The Spanish fleet was soon pounded into submission by U.S. naval guns. The fight on land took longer. Allied with Filipino rebels, U.S. troops captured the city of Manila on August 13.
Invasion of Cuba More difficult than the Philippines was Cuba. An ill-
prepared, largely volunteer U.S. force landed in Cuba in June. The most lethal foe proved to be not Spanish bullets but tropical diseases. Fewer than 500 U.S. soldiers died in battle, but at least 5,000 died of malaria, typhoid, and dysentery. 
Attacks by both American and Cuban forces succeeded in defeating the 
much larger, but poorly led, Spanish army. Next to Dewey’s victory in Manila Bay, the most celebrated event of the war was a cavalry charge up San Juan Hill in Cuba by the Rough Riders, a regiment of volunteers led by Theodore Roosevelt, who had resigned his navy post to take part in the war. Roosevelt’s volunteers were aided in victory by veteran regiments of African Americans. Less dramatic but more important than the taking of San Juan Hill was the success of the U.S. Navy in destroying the Spanish fleet at Santiago Bay on July 3. Without a navy, Spain realized that it could not continue fighting, and in early August 1898 asked the U.S. for terms of peace.
Annexation of Hawaii
The outbreak of war in the Philippines gave Congress and President McKinley the pretext to complete the annexation of Hawaii in July 1898. The Hawaiian Islands became a U.S. territory in 1900 and the fiftieth state in the Union in August 1959 (Topic 7.2).
Controversy over the Treaty of Peace
More controversial than the war itself was the peace treaty signed in Paris on December 10, 1898. It provided for (1) recognition of Cuban independence, (2) U.S. acquisition of two Spanish islands—Puerto Rico in the Caribbean and Guam  in the Pacific, and (3) U.S. control of the Philippines in return for a $20 
million payment to Spain. Since the avowed purpose of the U.S. war effort was to liberate Cuba, Americans accepted this provision of the treaty. However, many opposed taking over the Philippines, a large island nation, as a colony.
449  TOPIC 7.3   THE SPANISH -AMERICAN WAR AND U .S. F OREIGN POLICY TO 1917 The Philippine Question Controversy over the Philippine question took 
many months longer to resolve than the brief war with Spain. Opinion both 
in Congress and with the public at large became sharply divided between imperialists who favored annexing the Philippines and anti-imperialists who opposed it. In the Senate, where a two-thirds vote was required to ratify the Treaty of Paris, anti-imperialists were determined to defeat the treaty because of its provision for acquiring the Philippines. Anti-imperialists argued that the United States would be taking possession of a heavily populated territory whose people were of a different race and culture. Such action, they thought, violated the principles of the Declaration of Independence by depriving Filipinos of the right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ” Further, annexation would entangle the United States in the political conflicts of Asia.
On February 6, 1899, the Treaty of Paris (including Philippine annexation) 
came to a vote in Congress. The treaty was approved 57 to 27, just one vote more than the two-thirds majority required by the Constitution for ratification. The anti-imperialists fell just two votes short of defeating the treaty.
The people of the Philippines were outraged that their hopes for national 
independence from Spain were now being denied by the United States. Filipino nationalist leader Emilio Aguinaldo had fought alongside U.S. troops during the Spanish-American War. Now he led bands of guerrilla fighters in a war against U.S. control. It took U.S. troops three years to defeat the insurrection. The conflict resulted in the deaths of about 5,000 people from the United States and several hundred thousand Filipinos—mostly civilians who died from diseases.
Other Results of the War
Imperialism remained a major issue in the United States even after ratification of the Treaty of Paris. The American Anti-Imperialist League led by William Jennings Bryan rallied opposition to further acts of expansion in the Pacific.
Insular Cases One question concerned the constitutional rights of the 
Philippine people: Did the Constitution follow the flag? In other words, did the provisions of the U.S. Constitution apply to whatever territories fell under U.S. control, including the Philippines and Puerto Rico? Bryan and other anti-imperialists argued in the affirmative, while leading imperialists argued in the negative. The issue was resolved in favor of the imperialists in a series of Supreme Court cases (1901–1903) known as the Insular (island) Cases. The Court ruled that constitutional rights were not automatically extended to territorial possessions and that the power to decide whether or not to grant such rights belonged to Congress.
Cuba and the Platt Amendment (1901) Previously, the Teller Amendment 
to the war resolution of 1898 had guaranteed U.S. respect for Cuba’s sovereignty as an independent nation. Nevertheless, U.S. troops remained in Cuba from 1898 until 1901. In the latter year, Congress made withdrawal of troops conditional upon Cuba’s acceptance of terms included in an amendment to an 
450 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONarmy appropriations bill—the Platt Amendment. Bitterly resented by Cuban 
nationalists, the Platt Amendment required Cuba to agree (1) to never sign a treaty with a foreign power that impaired its independence, (2) to permit the United States to intervene in Cuba’s affairs to preserve its independence and maintain law and order, and (3) to allow the U.S. to maintain naval bases in Cuba, including one permanent base at Guantanamo Bay.
A Cuban convention reluctantly accepted these terms, adding them to 
its country’s new constitution. In effect, the Platt Amendment made Cuba a U.S. protectorate. As a result, Cuba’s foreign policy would, for many years, be subject to U.S. oversight and control.
Election of 1900 The Republicans re-nominated President McKinley, 
along with war hero and New Y ork Governor Theodore Roosevelt for vice president. The Democrats, as in 1896, nominated William Jennings Bryan. He again argued for free silver and vigorously attacked American imperialism. However, most voters accepted the recently enacted gold standard and the acquisition of new territory, including the Philippines, and felt the economy was recovering. McKinley won by a larger margin of victory than in 1896.

451  TOPIC 7.3   THE SPANISH -AMERICAN WAR AND U .S. F OREIGN POLICY TO 1917 Recognition of U.S. Power One consequence of the Spanish-American 
War was its effect on how Americans and Europeans thought about U.S. power. 
The decisive U.S. victory in the war filled Americans with national pride. Southerners shared in this pride and became more attached to the Union after their bitter experience in the 1860s. At the same time, France, Great Britain, and other European nations recognized that the United States was a first-class power with a strong navy and a new willingness to act in international affairs.
Open Door Policy in China
Europeans were further impressed by U.S. involvement in global politics as a result of John Hay’s policies toward China. As McKinley’s secretary of state, Hay was alarmed that the Chinese empire, weakened by political corruption and failure to modernize, was falling under the control of various outside powers. In the 1890s, Russia, Japan, Great Britain, France, and Germany had all established spheres of influence in China, meaning that they could dominate 
trade and investment within their sphere (a particular port or region of China) and shut out competitors. 
To prevent the United States from losing access to the lucrative China trade, 
Hay dispatched a diplomatic note in 1899 to nations controlling spheres of influence. He asked them to accept the concept of an Open Door, by which all nations would have equal trading privileges in China. The replies to Hay’s note were evasive. However, because no nation rejected the concept, Hay declared that all had accepted the Open Door policy. The press hailed Hay’s initiative as a diplomatic triumph.
Boxer Rebellion (1900) As the 19th century ended, nationalism and 
xenophobia  (hatred and fear of foreigners) were on the rise in China. In 
1900, a secret society of Chinese nationalists—the Society of Harmonious Fists, or Boxers—attacked foreign settlements and murdered dozens of Christian missionaries. To protect American lives and property, U.S. troops participated in an international force that marched into Peking (Beijing) and quickly crushed the rebellion of the Boxers. The countries forced China to pay a huge indemnity, which further weakened the imperial regime.
Hay’s Second Round of Notes Hay feared that the expeditionary force in 
China might attempt to occupy the country and destroy its independence. In 1900, therefore, he wrote a second note to the imperialistic powers stating U.S. commitment to (1) preserve China’s territorial integrity as well as (2) safeguard “equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese empire. ” Hay’s first and second notes set U.S. policy on China not only for the administrations of McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt but also for future presidents. In the 1930s, this Open Door policy for China would strongly influence U.S. relations with Japan.
Hay’s notes in themselves did not deter other nations from exploiting the 
situation in China. For the moment, European powers were kept from grabbing larger pieces of China by the political rivalries among themselves.
452 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONTheodore Roosevelt’s “Big Stick” Policy
In 1901, only a few months after being inaugurated president for a second 
time, McKinley was fatally shot by an anarchist (a person who opposes all government). Succeeding him in office was the Republican vice president—the young expansionist and hero of the Spanish-American War, Theodore Roosevelt . Describing his foreign policy, the new president had once said 
that it was his motto to “speak softly and carry a big stick. ” The press therefore applied the label “big stick” to Roosevelt’s aggressive foreign policy. By acting boldly and decisively in a number of situations, Roosevelt attempted to build the reputation of the United States as a world power. Imperialists applauded his every move, but critics disliked breaking the tradition of nonentanglement in global politics.
The Panama Canal
As a result of the Spanish-American War, the new American empire stretched from Puerto Rico in the Caribbean to the Philippines in the Pacific. As a strategic necessity for holding on to these far-flung islands, the United States desired a canal through Central America to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. However, building a canal would be difficult. The French had already failed to complete a canal through the tropic jungles. And before the United States could even try, it needed to negotiate an agreement with the British to abrogate (cancel) the 1850 Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, which stated that any canal in Central America was to be under joint British-U.S. control. This new agreement, called the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, was signed in 1901. With the British agreement to let the United States build a canal alone, the young and activist President Roosevelt took charge.
Revolution in Panama  Roosevelt was eager to begin the construction of 
a canal through the narrow but rugged terrain of the isthmus of Panama. He was frustrated, however, by Colombia’s control of this isthmus and its refusal to agree to U.S. terms for digging the canal through its territory. Losing patience with Colombia’s demands of more money and sovereignty over the canal, Roosevelt orchestrated a revolt for Panama’s independence in 1903. With the support of the U.S. Navy, the rebellion succeeded immediately and almost without bloodshed. However, the new government of an independent Panama had to sign the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903 granting the United States all rights over the 51-mile-long and 10-mile-wide Canal Zone as “if it were sovereign . . . in perpetuity” to keep U.S. protection. Y ears later, Roosevelt boasted, “I took the Canal Zone and let Congress debate. ” 
Building the Canal Started in 1904, the Panama Canal was completed 
in 1914. Hundreds of laborers lost their lives in the effort. The work was completed thanks in great measure to the skills of two Army colonels—George Goethals, the chief engineer of the canal, and Dr. William Gorgas, whose efforts eliminated the mosquitoes that spread deadly yellow fever.
453  TOPIC 7.3   THE SPANISH -AMERICAN WAR AND U .S. F OREIGN POLICY TO 1917 Most Americans approved of Roosevelt’s determination to build the canal, 
but many were unhappy with his high-handed tactics to secure the Canal 
Zone. Latin Americans were especially resentful. To compensate, Congress finally voted in 1921 to pay Colombia an indemnity of $25 million for its loss of Panama. In 1999, the United States returned the Canal Zone to the Republic of Panama to end the bitterness over the original treaty.
The Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine 
Another application of Roosevelt’s big stick diplomacy involved Latin American nations that were in deep financial trouble and could not pay their debts to European creditors. For example, in 1902, the British dispatched warships to Venezuela to force that country to pay its debts. 
In 1904, it appeared that European powers stood ready to intervene in 
Santo Domingo (the Dominican Republic) for the same reason. Rather than let Europeans intervene in Latin America—a blatant violation of the Monroe Doctrine—Roosevelt declared in December 1904 that the United States would intervene instead, whenever necessary. This policy became known as the Roosevelt Corollary  to the Monroe Doctrine. It meant, for example, that 
the United States would send gunboats to a Latin American country that was delinquent in paying its debts. U.S. sailors and marines would then occupy the country’s major ports to manage the collection of customs taxes until European debts were satisfied.
Over the next 20 years, U.S. presidents used the Roosevelt Corollary to 
justify sending U.S. forces into Haiti, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua. One long-term result of such interventions was poor U.S. relations with the entire region of Latin America. 
Roosevelt and Asia
As the 20th century began, Japan and the United States were both relatively new imperialist powers in East Asia. Their relationship during Theodore Roosevelt’s presidency, though at first friendly, grew increasingly competitive.
Russo-Japanese War Imperialist rivalry between Russia and Japan led to 
war in 1904, a war Japan was winning. To end the conflict, Roosevelt arranged a diplomatic conference between the two foes at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1905. Although both Japan and Russia agreed to the Treaty of Portsmouth, Japanese nationalists blamed the United States for not giving their country all that they believed they deserved from Russia.
“Gentlemen’s Agreement”  A major cause of friction between Japan and 
the United States were laws in California that discriminated against Japanese Americans. San Francisco’s practice of requiring Japanese American children to attend segregated schools was considered a national insult in Japan. In 1908, President Roosevelt arranged a compromise by means of an informal understanding, or “gentlemen’s agreement. ” The Japanese government secretly 
454 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONagreed to restrict the emigration of Japanese workers to the United States in 
return for Roosevelt persuading California to repeal its discriminatory laws.
Great White Fleet  To demonstrate U.S. naval power to Japan and other 
nations, Roosevelt sent a fleet of battleships on an around-the-world cruise (1907–1909). The great white ships made an impressive sight, and the Japanese government warmly welcomed their arrival in Tokyo Bay.
Root-Takahira Agreement (1908) The  United States and Japan concluded 
an important executive agreement in 1908. Secretary of State Elihu Root and Japanese Ambassador Takahira pledged mutual respect for each nation’s Pacific possessions and support for the Open Door policy in China.
Peace Efforts Roosevelt saw his big stick policies as a way to promote 
peaceful solutions to international disputes. For his work in settling the Russo-Japanese War, Roosevelt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906. In the same year, he helped arrange the Algeciras Conference in Spain, which succeeded in settling a conflict between France and Germany over claims to Morocco. The president also directed U.S. participation at the Second International Peace Conference at The Hague in 1907, which discussed rules for limiting warfare. As an expansionist, an interventionist, and finally as an internationalist, Theodore Roosevelt embodied the vigor of a youthful nation arriving on the world stage. 
William Howard Taft and Dollar Diplomacy
Roosevelt’s successor, William Howard Taft (1909–1913), did not carry the 
same “big stick. ” He adopted a foreign policy that was mildly expansionist but depended more on investors’ dollars than on the navy’s battleships. His policy of promoting U.S. trade by supporting American enterprises abroad was known as “dollar diplomacy. ”
American Investors Taft believed that private American financial 
investment in China and Central America would lead to greater stability there, while at the same time promoting U.S. business interests. His policy, however, was thwarted by one major obstacle: growing anti-imperialism both in the United States and overseas.
Railroads in China Taft first tested his policy in China. Wanting U.S. 
bankers to be included in a British, French, and German plan to invest in railroads in China, Taft succeeded in securing American participation in an agreement signed in 1911. In China’s northern province of Manchuria, however, the United States was excluded from an agreement between Russia and Japan to build railroads. In defiance of the U.S. Open Door policy, Russia and Japan agreed to treat Manchuria as a jointly held sphere of influence.
Intervention in Nicaragua  To protect American investments, the United 
States intervened in Nicaragua’s financial affairs in 1911 and sent in marines when a civil war broke out in 1912. The marines remained, except for a short period, until 1933.
455  TOPIC 7.3   THE SPANISH -AMERICAN WAR AND U .S. F OREIGN POLICY TO 1917 Woodrow Wilson and Foreign Affairs
In his campaign for president in 1912, the Democratic candidate Woodrow 
Wilson  promised a New Freedom  for the country, part of which was a moral 
approach to foreign affairs. Wilson said he opposed imperialism and the big stick and dollar diplomacy policies of his Republican predecessors.
Wilson’s Moral Diplomacy
In his first term as president (1913–1917), Wilson had limited success applying a high moral standard to foreign relations. He and Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan attempted to show that the United States respected other nations’ rights and supported the spread of democracy. Hoping to demonstrate that his presidency was opposed to self-interested imperialism, Wilson took steps to correct what he viewed as wrongful policies of the past. 
The Philippines Wilson won passage of the Jones Act of 1916, which 
(1) granted full territorial status to the Philippines, (2) guaranteed a bill of rights and universal male suffrage to Filipino citizens, and (3) promised independence for the Philippines as soon as a stable government was established. Philippine independence was delayed by the events surrounding World War II until July 4, 1946.

456 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Panama Canal Wilson persuaded Congress in 1914 to repeal an 
act that had granted U.S. ships an exemption from paying the standard canal 
tolls charged other nations. Wilson’s policy on Panama Canal tolls angered American nationalists such as Roosevelt and Lodge but pleased the British, who had strongly objected to the U.S. exemption.
Conciliation Treaties Wilson’s commitment to the ideals of democracy 
and peace was fully shared by his famous secretary of state, William Jennings Bryan. Bryan’s pet project was to negotiate treaties in which nations pledged to (1) submit disputes to international commissions and (2) observe a one-year cooling-off period before taking military action. Bryan arranged, with Wilson’s approval, 30 such conciliation treaties.
Military Intervention Under Wilson
Wilson’s commitment to democracy and anti-colonialism had a blind spot with respect to Mexico and countries of Central America and the Caribbean. He went far beyond both Roosevelt and Taft in his use of U.S. marines in response to financial and political troubles in the region. He kept marines in Nicaragua and ordered U.S. troops into Haiti in 1915 and the Dominican Republic in 1916. He argued that such intervention was necessary to maintain stability in the region and protect the Panama Canal.
Wilson’s moral approach to foreign affairs was severely tested by a 
revolution and civil war in Mexico. As a supporter of democracy, Wilson refused to recognize the military dictatorship of General Victoriano Huerta, who had seized power in 1913 after having the democratically elected president killed.
Tampico Incident To aid revolutionaries fighting Huerta, Wilson called 
for an arms embargo against the Mexican government and sent a fleet to blockade the port of Vera Cruz. In 1914, several U.S. sailors went ashore at Tampico where they were arrested by Mexican authorities. They were soon released. However, Huerta refused to apologize as demanded by a U.S. naval officer. Wilson retaliated by ordering the U.S. Navy to occupy Veracruz. War seemed imminent. It was averted, however, when South America’s ABC powers—Argentina, Brazil, and Chile—offered to mediate the dispute. This was the first dispute in the Americas to be settled through joint mediation.
Pancho Villa and the U.S. Expeditionary Force Huerta fell from power 
in late 1914. Replacing him was a more democratic regime led by Venustiano Carranza. Almost immediately, the new government was challenged by a band of rebels loyal to Pancho Villa. Hoping to destabilize his opponent’s government, Villa led raids across the U.S.–Mexican border and murdered several people in Texas and New Mexico. In March 1916, President Wilson ordered General John J. Pershing and an “ expeditionary force” to pursue 
Villa into northern Mexico. They failed to capture Villa. President Carranza protested the U.S. presence in Mexico. In January 1917, the growing possibility of U.S. entry into World War I caused Wilson to withdraw Pershing’s troops.
457  TOPIC 7.3   THE SPANISH -AMERICAN WAR AND U .S. F OREIGN POLICY TO 1917 Uncertain Rise to Power The Spanish-American War debuted the United 
States as a rising power in the international arena. However, most Americans 
were more concerned with domestic matters than foreign affairs during the Progressive era from 1900 to 1917 (Topic 7.4). American reluctance to get involved in World War I and to take a leadership role after the war reflected a long held and deep concern over the dangers of entanglement in overseas conflicts (Topic 7.5).

He is far better known for his efforts at peacemaking than at warmaking. And, what is more, he deserved this acclaim. ”
Thomas B. Bailey, A Diplomatic History of the American 
People, 1974
“[Theodore Roosevelt was] a person of his times. . . . He hailed the advance of Western and especially Anglo-Saxon civilization as a world movement, the key to peace and progress. . . . He viewed “barbaric” people as the major threat to civilization and had no difficulty rationalizing the use of force to keep them in line. . . . He was less clear how to keep peace among the so-called civilized nations. ”

461  TOPIC 7.4   THE PROGRESSIVES
Topic 7.4
The Progressives
I am, therefore, a Progressive because we have not kept up with our own 
changes of conditions, either in the economic field or in the political field. 
Woodrow Wilson, campaign speech, 1912
Learning Objective : Compare the goals and effects of the Progressive 
reform movement.
Like the Gilded Age reformers, those of the Progressive period in the early 
20th century advocated for a larger role for government and greater democracy. 
Unlike the earlier reformers, though, the Progressives were more successful. The four constitutional amendments passed during this era illustrate its range and complexity: a graduated income tax that first affected the wealthy, direct election of senators to reform Congress, the right to vote for women, and an effort to improve society through the prohibition of alcohol. The Progressive movement’s successes and failures remain controversial, but its lasting impact on American politics is undisputed. 
Origins of Progressivism 
As America entered the 20th century, the rapid and transforming changes of industrialization were unsettling for many. For decades, middle-class Americans had been alarmed by the power of big business, the uncertainties of business cycles, the increasing gap between rich and poor, the violent conflict between labor and capital, and the dominance of corrupt political machines in cities. Most disturbing to minorities were the racist Jim Crow laws in the South that relegated African Americans to the status of second-class citizens. Crusaders for women’s suffrage added their voices to the call for greater democracy. 
The Progressive movement built on the work of populist reformers and 
union activists of the Gilded Age. However, it acquired additional national momentum with the unexpected swearing into office of a young president, Theodore Roosevelt, in 1901. The Progressive era lasted through the presidencies of Republicans Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909) and William Howard Taft  (1909–1913) and the first term of the Democrat Woodrow Wilson (1913–1917). U.S. entry into World War I in 1917 diverted public attention away from domestic issues and brought the era to an end. By then, though, Congress and state legislatures had enacted major regulatory laws.
462 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONWho Were the Progressives? 
A diverse group of reformers were loosely united in the Progressive movement. 
Protestant church leaders, African Americans, union leaders, and feminists each lobbied for different specific reforms. However, they shared some basic beliefs:
• Society badly needed changes to limit the power of big business, improve democracy, and strengthen social justice.
• Government, whether at the local, state, or federal level, was the proper agency for making these changes.
• Moderate reforms were usually better than radical ones.
Urban Middle Class Unlike the Populists of the 1890s, whose strength 
came from rural America, most Progressives were middle-class men and women who lived in cities. The urban middle class had steadily grown in the final decades of the 19th century. In addition to doctors, lawyers, ministers, and storekeepers (who were once the heart of the middle class), the economy now employed an increasing number of white-collar office workers and middle managers employed in banks, manufacturing firms, and other businesses.
Professional Class Members of this business and professional middle 
class took their civic responsibilities seriously. Some were versed in scientific and statistical methods and the findings of the new social sciences. They belonged to the hundreds of national business and professional associations that provided platforms to address corrupt business and government practices and urban social and economic problems. 
Religion A missionary spirit inspired some middle-class reformers. 
Protestant churches preached against vice and taught a code of social responsibility, which emphasized caring for the less fortunate and promoting honesty in public life. The Social Gospel popularized by Walter Rauschenbusch (see Topic 6.11) was an important element in Protestant Christians’ response to the problem of urban poverty. Most of these Protestants  were native-born and 
older stock Americans, often from families of older elites who felt that their central role in society had been replaced by wealthy industrialists and urban political machines.
Leadership Without strong leadership, the diverse forces of reform 
could not have overcome conservatives’ resistance to change. Fortunately for the Progressives, a number of dedicated and able leaders entered politics at the turn of the century to challenge the status quo. Theodore Roosevelt and Robert La Follette in the Republican Party and William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson in the Democratic Party demonstrated vigorous political leadership that had been lacking in national politics during the Gilded Age. 
The Progressives’ Philosophy The reform impulse was hardly new. In 
fact, many historians see progressivism as just one more phase in a reform tradition going back to the Jeffersonians in the early 1800s, the Jacksonians 
463  TOPIC 7.4   THE PROGRESSIVESin the 1830s, and the Populists in the 1890s. The Progressives—like American 
reformers before them—were committed to democratic values and shared in the belief that honest government and just laws could improve peoples’ lives. 
Pragmatism A revolution in thinking occurred at the same time as the 
Industrial Revolution. Charles Darwin, in his On the Origin of Species (1859), presented the concept of evolution by natural selection. Though Darwin was writing about the natural world, others applied his concepts to human society  to justify accumulating great wealth and laissez-faire capitalism (Topic 6.6). 
Others challenged the prevailing philosophy of romantic transcendentalism 
with what became called pragmatism. In the early 20th century, William James and John Dewey, two leading American advocates of this new philosophy, 
argued that “truth” should be able to pass the public test of observable results in an open, democratic society. In a democracy, citizens and institutions should experiment with ideas and laws and test them in action until they found something that would produce a well-functioning democratic society. 
Progressive thinkers adopted the new philosophy of pragmatism because 
it enabled them to challenge fixed ideas and beliefs that stood in the way of reform. For example, they rejected the laissez-faire theory as impractical. The old standard of rugged individualism no longer seemed viable in a modern society dominated by complex business organizations. 
Scientific Management Another idea that gained widespread acceptance 
among Progressives came from the practical studies of Frederick W . Taylor. By using a stopwatch to time the tasks performed by factory workers, Taylor discovered ways of organizing people in the most efficient manner—the scientific management system, also known as Taylorism. Many Progressives believed that government too could be made more efficient if placed in the hands of experts and scientific managers. They objected to the corruption of political bosses partly because it was antidemocratic and partly because it was an inefficient way to run things. 
The Muckrakers 
Before the public could be roused to action, it first had to be well-informed about the scandalous realities of politics, factories, and slums. Publishers found that their middle-class readers were attracted to reports about corruption in business and politics. Investigative journalists created in-depth articles about child labor, corrupt political bosses and monopolistic business practices. President Theodore Roosevelt criticized writers who focused on negative stories as “muckrakers. ” The term caught on.
Origins One of the earliest muckrakers was Chicago reporter Henry 
Demarest Lloyd , who in 1881 wrote a series of articles for the Atlantic Monthly  
attacking the practices of the Standard Oil Company and the railroads. Published in book form in 1894, Lloyd’s Wealth Against Commonwealth fully exposed the corruption and greed of the oil monopoly but failed to suggest how to control it. 
464 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONMagazines An Irish immigrant, Samuel Sidney McClure, founded 
McClure’s Magazine in 1893, which became a major success by running a series 
of muckraking articles by Lincoln Steffens ( Tweed Days in St. Louis, 1902) and 
another series by Ida Tarbell ( The History of the Standard Oil Company, also 
in 1902). Combining careful research with sensationalism, these articles set a standard for the deluge of muckraking that followed. Popular 10- and 15-cent magazines such as McClure’s, Collier’s, and Cosmopolitan  competed fiercely 
to outdo their rivals with shocking exposés of political and economic corruption. 
Books  The most popular 
series of muckraking articles were usually collected and published as best-selling books. Articles on tenement life by Jacob Riis, one of the first photojournalists, were published as How the Other Half Lives (1890). Lincoln Steffens’ The Shame of the Cities  
(1904) also caused a sensation by describing in detail the corrupt deals that characterized big-city politics from Philadelphia to Minneapolis. 
Several muckraking books 
were novels. Two of Theodore Dreiser ’s novels, The Financier  
and The Titan, portrayed the 
avarice and ruthlessness of an industrialist. Fictional accounts such as Frank Norris’ The Octopus  (about the tyrannical 
power of railroad companies) and The Pit  (about the impact 
of grain speculation) stirrred up public demands for government regulations. One of the most powerful novels that portrayed the difficult life of immigrants and horrendous sanitary conditions of the meat packing industry was The Jungle  by Upton Sinclair (see more later in this topic). These novels were more 
influential than many journalistic accounts.
Decline of Muckraking The popularity of muckraking books and 
magazine articles began to decline after 1910 for several reasons:
After Ida Tarbell published her account of the rise 
of the Standard Oil Company in magazine articles, she turned it into a best-selling book.
Source: Library of Congress.

465  TOPIC 7.4   THE PROGRESSIVES• Writers found it more and more difficult to top the sensationalism of 
the last story. 
• Publishers were expanding and faced economic pressures from banks and advertisers to tone down their treatment of business. 
• By 1910, corporations were becoming more aware of their public image and developing a new specialty: the field of public relations. 
Nevertheless, muckraking had a lasting effect on the Progressive era. It exposed inequities, educated the public about corruption in high places, and prepared the way for corrective action. 
Political Reforms in Cities and States 
A cornerstone of Progressive ideology was faith in efficient government. However, Progressives expressed this ideology differently. Some looked to professional and technical experts for objective, pragmatic advice. Often, these Progressives distrusted the urban political machines that relied on immigrants for support, so they supported restrictions on immigration.
Other Progressives placed more trust in common people. They opposed 
immigration restrictions, in part because they believed that, given a chance, the majority of voters would elect honest officials. Progressives advocated a number of reforms for increasing the participation of the average citizen in political decision-making. 
Australian, or Secret, Ballot Political parties could manipulate and 
intimidate voters by printing lists (or “tickets”) of party candidates and watching voters drop them into the ballot box on election day. In 1888, Massachusetts was the first state to adopt a system successfully tried in Australia of issuing ballots printed by the state and requiring voters to mark their choices secretly within a private booth. By 1910, all states had adopted the secret ballot . 
Direct Primaries In the late 19th century, Republicans and Democrats 
commonly nominated candidates for state and federal offices in state conventions controlled by party bosses. In 1903, the Progressive governor of Wisconsin, Robert La Follette, introduced a new system for bypassing politicians and placing the nominating process directly in the hands of the voters—the direct primary. By 1915, some form of the direct primary was 
used in every state. The system’s effectiveness in overthrowing boss rule was limited, as politicians devised ways of confusing the voters and splitting the anti-political machine vote. Since primaries were run for the parties rather than for the general population, some Southern states used White-only primaries to exclude African Americans from voting.
Direct Election of U.S. Senators Under the original Constitution, U.S. 
senators had been chosen by the state legislatures rather than by direct vote of the people. Progressives believed this was a principal reason that the Senate had become a millionaires’ club dominated by big business. Nevada in 1899 was the first state to give the voters the opportunity to elect U.S. senators directly. By 
466 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION1912, a total of 30 states had adopted this reform, and in 1913, ratification of 
the 17th Amendment required that all U.S. senators be elected by popular vote. 
Initiative, Referendum, and Recall If politicians in the state legislatures 
balked at obeying the “will of the people, ” then Progressives proposed two methods for forcing them to act. Amendments to state constitutions offered voters (1) the initiative —a method by which voters could compel the legislature 
to consider a bill and (2) the referendum—a method that allowed citizens to vote on proposed laws printed on their ballots. A third Progressive measure, the recall,  enabled voters to remove a corrupt or unsatisfactory politician from 
office by majority vote before that official’s term had expired. 
Municipal Reforms 
City bosses and their corrupt alliances with local businesses (trolley lines and utility companies, for example) were among the first targets of Progressive leaders. In Toledo, Ohio, in 1897, a self-made millionaire with strong memories of his origins as a workingman became the Republican mayor. Adopting “golden rule” as both his policy and his middle name, Mayor Samuel M. “Golden Rule” Jones delighted Toledo’s citizens by introducing a comprehensive program of municipal reform, including free kindergartens, night schools, and public playgrounds. Another Ohioan, Tom L. Johnson, devoted himself to tax reform and three-cent trolley fares for the people of Cleveland. As Cleveland’s mayor from 1901 to 1909, Johnson fought hard—but without success—for public ownership and operation of the city’s public utilities and services (water, electricity, and trolleys). 
Controlling Public Utilities Reform leaders arose in other cities 
throughout the nation seeking to break the power of the city bosses and take utilities out of the hands of private companies. By 1915, fully two-thirds of the nation’s cities owned their own water systems. As a result of the Progressives’ efforts, many cities also came to own and operate gas lines, electric power plants, and urban transportation systems. 
Commissions and City Managers New types of municipal government 
were another Progressive innovation. In 1900, Galveston, Texas, was the first city to adopt a commission plan of government, in which voters elected the heads of city departments (fire, police, and sanitation), not just the mayor. Ultimately proving itself more effective than the commission plan was a system first tried in Dayton, Ohio, in 1913. An elected city council there hired an expert manager to direct the work of the various departments of city government. By 1923, more than 300 cities had adopted the manager-council plan of municipal government. 
State Reforms 
At the state level, reform governors battled corporate interests and championed such measures as the initiative, the referendum, and the direct primary to give common people control of their own government. In New Y ork, Charles Evans 
467  TOPIC 7.4   THE PROGRESSIVESHughes battled fraudulent insurance companies. In California, Hiram Johnson 
successfully fought against the economic and political power of the Southern Pacific Railroad. In Wisconsin, Robert La Follette established a strong personal following as the governor (1900–1904) who won passage of the “Wisconsin Idea” —a series of Progressive measures that included a direct primary law, tax 
reform, and state regulatory commissions to monitor railroads, utilities, 
and businesses such as insurance. 
Temperance and Prohibition  Whether or not to shut down saloons 
and prohibit the drinking of alcohol sharply divided reformers. While urban Progressives recognized that saloons were often the neighborhood headquarters of political machines, they generally had little sympathy for the temperance movement. Rural reformers, on the other hand, thought they could clean up morals and politics in one stroke by abolishing liquor. The drys (prohibitionists) were determined and well-organized. Among their leaders was Carrie Nation, whose blunt language and attack on taverns with a hatchet made her famous. By 1915, the drys had persuaded the legislatures of two-thirds of the states to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages. 
Social Welfare Urban life in the Progressive era was improved not only 
by political reformers but also by the efforts of settlement house workers and other civic-minded volunteers. Jane Addams, Florence Kelley, and other leaders of the social justice movement found that they needed political support in the state legislatures for meeting the needs of immigrants and the working class (see Topic 6.9). They lobbied vigorously and with considerable success for better schools, juvenile courts, liberalized divorce laws, and safety regulations for tenements and factories. Believing that criminals could learn to become effective citizens, reformers fought for such measures as a system of parole, separate reformatories for juveniles, and limits on the death penalty.
Child and Women Labor Progressives were most outraged by the 
treatment of children by industry. The National Child Labor Committee 
proposed model state child labor laws that were passed by two-thirds of the states by 1907. Ultimately, state compulsory school attendance laws proved most effective in keeping children out of the mines and factories. 
Florence Kelley and the National Consumers’ League organized to pass 
state laws to protect women from long working hours. In Lochner v. New Y ork (1905) the Supreme Court ruled against a state law limiting workers to a ten-hour workday. However, in Muller v. Oregon (1908) the high court ruled that the health of women needed special protection from long hours. The Triangle Shirtwaist fire (1911) in a New Y ork City high-rise garment factory took 146 lives, mostly women. The tragedy sparked greater women’s activism and pushed states to pass laws to improve safety and working conditions in factories. 
One consequence of efforts to protect women in the workplace was that 
the legislation kept women out of physically demanding but higher paying jobs in industry and mining. Later, many in the women’s movement wanted these restrictions lifted so that women could compete as equals with men. 
468 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONPolitical Reform in the Nation 
While Progressive governors and mayors were battling conservative forces in 
the state houses and city halls, three presidents—Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson—sought broad reforms and regulations at the national level. 
Theodore Roosevelt’s Square Deal 
Following President McKinley’s assassination in September 1901, Theodore Roosevelt became, at the age of 42, the youngest president in U.S. history. He was also one of the most athletic. He was unusual not simply because of his age and vigor but also because he believed that the president should do much more than lead the executive departments. He thought it was the president’s job to set the legislative agenda for Congress as well. Thus, by the accident of McKinley’s death, the Progressive movement suddenly shot into high gear under the dynamic leadership of a reform-minded president. 
“Square Deal” for Labor Presidents in the 19th century had consistently 
taken the side of owners in conflicts with labor (most notably Hayes in the railroad strike of 1877 and Cleveland in the Pullman strike of 1894). 
However, in the first economic crisis in his presidency, Roosevelt quickly 
demonstrated that he favored neither business nor labor but insisted on a “Square Deal ” for both. Pennsylvania coal miners had been on strike through 
much of 1902. If the strike continued, many Americans feared that,  without coal, they would freeze to death in winter. Roosevelt took the unusual step of trying to mediate the labor dispute by calling a union leader and mine owners to the White House. The owners’ stubborn refusal to compromise angered the president. To ensure the delivery of coal to consumers, he threatened to take over the mines with federal troops. The owners finally agreed to accept the findings of a commission: a 10  percent wage increase and a nine-hour workday. However, the owners did not have to recognize the union.
Voters seemed to approve of Roosevelt and his Square Deal. They elected 
him by a landslide in 1904. 
Trust-Busting Roosevelt further increased his popularity by being the first 
president since the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 to enforce that poorly written law. The trust that he most wanted to bust was a combination of railroads known as the Northern Securities Company. Reversing its position in earlier cases, the Supreme Court in 1904 upheld Roosevelt’s action in breaking up the railroad monopoly. Roosevelt later directed his attorney general to take antitrust action against Standard Oil and more than 40 other large corporations. Roosevelt did make a distinction between breaking up “bad trusts, ” which harmed the public and stifled competition, and regulating “good trusts, ” which 
through efficiency and low prices dominated a market. 
Railroad Regulation President Roosevelt also took the initiative in 
persuading a Republican majority in Congress to pass two laws that significantly strengthened the regulatory powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). Under the Elkins Act (1903), the ICC had greater authority to stop 
469  TOPIC 7.4   THE PROGRESSIVESrailroads from granting rebates to favored customers. Under the Hepburn Act 
(1906), the commission could fix “just and reasonable” rates for railroads. 
Consumer Protection The Jungle , a muckraking book by Upton Sinclair, 
described in horrifying detail the conditions in the Chicago stockyards and meatpacking industry. The public outcry following the publication of Sinclair’s novel caused Congress to enact two regulatory laws in 1906: first, the Pure Food and Drug Act forbade the manufacture, sale, and transportation of adulterated or mislabeled foods and drugs, and then the Meat Inspection Act provided that federal inspectors visit meatpacking plants to ensure that they met minimum standards of sanitation. 
Conservation  As a lover of the wilderness and outdoor life, Roosevelt 
enthusiastically championed the cause of conservation. In fact, Roosevelt’s most original and lasting contribution in domestic policy may have been his efforts to protect the nation’s natural resources. Three actions were particularly important: 
1. Roosevelt made repeated use of the Forest Reserve Act of 1891 to set 
aside 150 million acres of federal land as national reserves that could not be sold to private interests. 
2. In 1902, Roosevelt won passage of the Newlands Reclamation Act, a law providing money from the sale of public land for irrigation projects in western states. 
3. In 1908, the president publicized the need for conservation by hosting a White House Conference of Governors to promote coordinated conservation planning by federal and state governments. Following this conference, a National Conservation Commission was established under Gifford Pinchot of Pennsylvania, whom Roosevelt had earlier appointed to be the first director of the U.S. Forest Service. 
Taft’s Presidency 
The good-natured William Howard Taft had served in Roosevelt’s cabinet as 
secretary of war. Honoring the two-term tradition, Roosevelt refused to seek reelection and picked Taft to be his successor. The Republican Party readily endorsed Taft as its nominee for president in 1908 and, as expected, defeated for a third time the Democrats’ campaigner, William Jennings Bryan. 
Progressive Economic Policies Taft built on many of Roosevelt’s 
accomplishments. As a trust-buster, Taft ordered the prosecution of almost twice the number of antitrust cases as his predecessor. However, among these cases was one against U.S. Steel, which included a merger approved by then-President Theodore Roosevelt. An angry Roosevelt viewed Taft’s action as a personal attack on his integrity.
Two other Progressive measures were at least equal in importance to 
legislation enacted under Roosevelt. The Mann-Elkins Act of 1910 gave the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to suspend new railroad rates and 
470 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONto oversee telephone and telegraph companies. The 16th Amendment, ratified 
by the states in 1913, authorized the U.S. government to collect an income tax. Progressives heartily approved the new tax, which applied only to the wealthy. 
Controversy over Conservation   Like Roosevelt, Taft sided more with 
the conservationists than the preservationists in the debate over using natural resources that began in the 1890s (see Topic 6.3). Taft established the Bureau of Mines, added large tracts in the Appalachians to the national forest reserves, and set aside federal oil lands (the first president to do so). However, when Roosevelt ally Gifford Pinchot criticized a Taft cabinet member for opening public lands in Alaska for development, Taft supported firing Pinchot.
Split in the Republican Party The firing of Pinchot was just one reason 
some Progressives accused Taft of betraying their cause and joining the conservative wing of the party. Taft had promised to lower the tariff. Instead, he signed the conservative Payne-Aldrich Tariff in 1909, which raised the tariff  on most imports. In the mid-term elections of 1910, Taft openly supported conservative candidates for Congress. Progressive Republicans from the Midwest easily defeated the candidates endorsed by Taft. After this election, the Republican Party split wide open between a conservative faction loyal to Taft and a Progressive faction who hoped Theodore Roosevelt would run again in 1912. 
Rise of the Socialist Party 
A third party, the Socialists, emerged in the early 1900s to advocate for the working class. Unlike the Progressives, who called for moderate regulation, the Socialists called for public ownership of the railroads, utilities, and major industries such as oil and steel. One of the party’s founders, Eugene V . Debs, a former railway union leader, became a socialist while in jail for supporting the Pullman strike. Debs was the party’s candidate for president in five elections from 1900 to 1920 and gained up to a million votes in those campaigns. Eventually, some ideas championed by Debs and the Socialists were accepted: public ownership of utilities, worker’s compensation insurance, minimum wage laws, the eight-hour workday, and pensions for employees. 
The Election of 1912 
President Taft was nominated by the Republicans after his supporters excluded Theodore Roosevelt’s delegates from the party’s convention. Progressive Republicans met and nominated Roosevelt. Their party became known as the Bull Moose Party after one of Roosevelt’s nicknames. After lengthy balloting, Democrats united behind Woodrow Wilson, a political newcomer who had first been elected to office in 1910 as governor of New Jersey. 
Campaign  The election came down to a battle between Theodore 
Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt’s plan, called New Nationalism, included more government regulation of business and unions, more social welfare programs, and women’s suffrage. Wilson’s plan, called New Freedom , 
471  TOPIC 7.4   THE PROGRESSIVESwould limit both big business and big government, bring about reform by 
ending corruption, and revive competition by supporting small business. 
Wilson won less than a majority of the popular vote, but with the 
Republicans split, he won a landslide in the Electoral College, and the Democrats gained control of Congress. The overwhelming support for two Progressive presidential candidates proved that reformers had strong support. Roosevelt lost, but his New Nationalism had a lasting influence on later Democratic Party reforms such as the New Deal of the 1930s.
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, 1912

Woodrow Wilson’s Progressive Program 
Wilson, who grew up in Virginia during the Civil War, was only the second Democrat elected president since the war (Cleveland was the other). He was the first southerner to occupy the White House since Zachary Taylor (1849–1850). Wilson was idealistic, intellectual, righteous, and inflexible. Like Roosevelt, he believed that a president should actively lead Congress and, as necessary, appeal directly to the people to rally support for his legislative program. 
In his inaugural address in 1913, the Democratic president pledged again 
his commitment to a New Freedom. To bring back conditions of free and fair competition in the economy, Wilson attacked “the triple wall of privilege”: tariffs, banking, and trusts. 
Tariff Reduction  Wasting no time to fulfill a campaign pledge, Wilson 
on the first day of his presidency called a special session of Congress to lower the tariff. Past presidents had always sent written messages to Congress, but Wilson broke this longstanding tradition by addressing Congress in person about the need for lower tariff rates to bring consumer prices down. Passage of the Underwood Tariff in 1913 substantially lowered tariffs for the first time in 
over 50 years. To compensate for the reduced tariff revenues, the Underwood bill included a graduated income tax with rates from 1 to 6 percent. Popular Vote Electoral Vote

472 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONBanking Reform Wilson then focused on the banking system and the 
money supply. He was persuaded that the gold standard was inflexible and 
that banks, rather than serving the public interest, were too much influenced by stock speculators on Wall Street. He proposed a national banking system with 12 district banks supervised by a Federal Reserve Board  appointed by 
the president. Congress approved his idea and passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1914. The Federal Reserve was designed to provide stability and flexibility to the U.S. financial system by regulating interest rates and the capital reserves required of banks.
Additional Economic Reforms Wilson initially was opposed to any 
legislation that seemed to favor special interests, such as farmers or unions. However, he shifted his position to support a variety of laws and new agencies:
• The Federal Trade Commission was to protect consumers by investigating and taking action against any “unfair trade practice” in any industry except banking and transportation. (Those two industries were already regulated by other agencies.) 
• The Clayton Antitrust Act  strengthened the Sherman Antitrust Act’s 
power to break up monopolies. Most important for organized labor, the new law contained a clause exempting unions from being prosecuted as trusts. 
• The Federal Farm Loan Act created 12 regional federal farm loan banks established to provide farm loans at low interest rates. 
• The Child Labor Act, long favored by settlement house workers and labor unions alike, was enacted in 1916. It prohibited the shipment in interstate commerce of products manufactured by children under 14 years old. However, a conservative Supreme Court found this act to be unconstitutional.
African Americans in the Progressive Era 
Racial equality was, for the most part, ignored by Progressive leaders and politicians. Some Progressives actively supported the tradition of segregation in the South. Others simply ignored its existence. For example, President Wilson, with a strong southern heritage and many of the racist attitudes of the times, agreed with the segregation of federal workers and buildings. 
The status of African Americans had declined steadily since Reconstruction. 
With the Supreme Court’s “separate but equal” decision in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), racial segregation had been the rule in the South and, unofficially, 
in much of the North. Ironically and tragically, the Progressive era coincided with years when thousands of Black men and women were lynched by racist mobs. Few White Progressives did anything about segregation, and lynchings continued at an average rate of almost two per week between 1900 and 1914. Activist Ida B. Wells led the battle to end lynching (see Topic 6.4).
473  TOPIC 7.4   THE PROGRESSIVESTwo Approaches: Washington and Du Bois 
Though lacking widespread White support, African Americans took action to 
alleviate poverty and discrimination. Economic deprivation and exploitation were one problem; denial of civil rights was another. Which of these problems should take precedence became the focus of a debate between two African American leaders: Booker T. Washington and W . E. B. Du Bois. 
Washington’s Stress on Economics Washington, the leader of the 
Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, argued that Black youths’ needs for education and economic progress were of foremost importance, and that they should concentrate on learning industrial skills for better wages. Only after establishing a secure economic base, said Washington, could African Americans hope to realize their other goals of political and social equality (Topic 6.4).
Du Bois’s Stress on Civil Rights Unlike Washington, who had been 
born into an enslaved family on a southern plantation, W . E. B. Du Bois was a northerner from a free family. He was the first African American to earn a doctorate from Harvard University and became a distinguished scholar and writer. In his book The Souls of Black Folk (1903), Du Bois criticized Booker T. Washington’s approach and demanded equal rights for African Americans. He argued that political and social rights were a prerequisite for economic independence. 
In their public statements, Washington’s focus on economic advancement 
and accommodation to White racism contrasted with Du Bois’s more confrontational demands for equal civil rights. Their two approaches framed a debate in the African American community that continued throughout the 20th century. Behind the scenes, though, their differences were less dramatic. Washington quietly helped pay legal fees for court cases challenging segregation. 
New Civil Rights Organizations 
Racial discrimination prompted Black leaders to found three powerful civil rights organizations in just six years. In 1905, W . E. B. Du Bois met with a group of Black intellectuals in Niagara Falls, Canada, to discuss a program of protest and action aimed at securing equal rights for African Americans. They and others who later joined them became known as the Niagara Movement. 
On Lincoln’s birthday in 1908, Du Bois, other members of the Niagara 
Movement, and a group of White Progressives founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Their mission was no less than to abolish all forms of segregation and to increase educational opportunities for African American children. By 1920, the NAACP was the nation’s largest civil rights organization, with over 100,000 members. 
Another organization, the National Urban League, was formed in 1911 to 
help people migrating from the South to adjust to northern cities. The league’s motto, “Not Alms But Opportunity, ” reflected its emphasis on self-reliance and economic advancement. 
474 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONWomen and the Progressive Movement
The Progressive era was a time of increased activism and optimism for a new 
generation of feminists. By 1900, the older generation of suffrage crusaders led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton had passed the torch to younger women. The new leaders sought allies among male Progressives, but not always with success. For example, President Wilson refused to support the suffragists’ call for a national amendment until late in his presidency. 
The Campaign for Women’s Suffrage 
Carrie Chapman Catt, an energetic reformer from Iowa, became the new president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) in 1900. Catt argued for the vote as a broadening of democracy that would empower women, thus enabling them to more actively care for their families in an industrial society. At first, Catt continued NAWSA ’s drive to win votes for women at the state level before changing strategies and seeking a suffrage amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
Militant Suffragists A more assertive approach to gaining the vote was 
adopted by some women, who took to the streets with mass pickets, parades, and hunger strikes. Their leader, Alice Paul of New Jersey, broke from NAWSA in 1916 to form the National Woman’s Party. From the beginning, Paul focused on winning the support of Congress and the president for an amendment to the Constitution. 
Nineteenth Amendment (1920) The dedicated efforts of women on 
the home front in World War I finally persuaded a two-thirds majority in Congress to support a women’s suffrage amendment. Its ratification as the 19th Amendment in 1920 guaranteed women’s right to vote in all elections at the local, state, and national levels. Following the victory of her cause, Carrie Chapman Catt organized the League of Women Voters, a civic organization dedicated to keeping voters informed about candidates and issues. 
Other Issues  In addition to winning the right to vote, Progressive women 
worked on other issues. Margaret Sanger  advocated birth control education, 
especially among the poor. Over time, the movement developed into the Planned Parenthood organization. Women made progress in securing educational equality, liberalizing marriage and divorce laws, reducing discrimination in business and the professions, and recognizing women’s rights to own property.

Question 1 is based on the excerpts below.
1. “ According to the liberal view of the Progressive Era, the major political 
innovations of reform involved the equalization of political power through the primary, the direct election of public officials, and the initiative, referendum, and recall. . . . But they provided at best only an occasional and often incidental process of decision-making. Far more important in continuous, sustained, day-to-day processes of government were those innovations which centralized decision-making in the hands of fewer and fewer people. ”

World War I:  
Military and Diplomacy
It breaks his heart that kings must murder still,  
That all his hours of travail here for men 
Seem yet in vain. And who will bring white peace  
That he may sleep upon his hill again?
Vachel Lindsay, “Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight, ” 1914
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and consequences of U.S. 
involvement in World War I. 
W orld War I broke out with stunning rapidity after a Serbian nationalist 
assassinated Austrian Archduke Francis Ferdinand, the heir to the throne of 
the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and his wife. Within a week, before calm minds could prevail, Austria-Hungary and Germany were in a full-scale war against Russia, France, and Great Britain. The assassination of the archduke sparked the war, but the underlying causes were (1) nationalism, (2) imperialism, (3) militarism, and (4) a combination of public and secret alliances. It was a tragedy that haunted generations of future leaders and that motivated President Woodrow Wilson to search for a lasting peace.
Neutrality
President Wilson’s first response to the outbreak of the European war was a declaration of U.S. neutrality , in the tradition of noninvolvement started by 
Washington and Jefferson. He called upon the American people to support his policy by not taking sides. However, Wilson found it difficult—if not impossible—to both steer a neutral course that favored neither the Allied powers  (Great Britain, France, and Russia) nor the Central powers  (Germany, 
Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire of Turkey) and still protected U.S. trading rights. During a relatively short period (1914–1919), the United States and its people rapidly moved through a wide range of roles: first as a contented neutral country, next as a country waging a war for peace, then as a victorious world power, and finally as an alienated and isolationist nation.
Freedom of the Seas In World War I (as in the War of 1812), the trouble 
for the United States arose as belligerent powers tried to stop supplies from reaching a foe. Having the stronger navy, Great Britain was the first to declare 
479  TOPIC 7.5   W ORLD WAR I : MILITARY AND DIPLOMACY  a naval blockade against Germany. Britain mined the North Sea and seized 
ships—including U.S. ships—attempting to run the blockade. Wilson protested British seizure of U.S. ships as violating a neutral nation’s right to freedom of the seas.
Submarine Warfare Germany’s one hope for challenging British power at 
sea lay with a new naval weapon, the submarine. In February 1915, Germany answered the British blockade by announcing a blockade of its own and warned that ships attempting to enter the “war zone” (waters near the British Isles) risked being sunk on sight by German submarines.
Lusitania  Crisis The first major crisis challenging U.S. neutrality occurred 
on May 7, 1915, when German torpedoes hit and sank a British passenger liner, the Lusitania . Most of the passengers drowned, including 128 Americans. In 
response, Wilson sent Germany a strongly worded diplomatic message warning that Germany would be held to “strict accountability” if it continued its policy of sinking unarmed ships. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan objected to this message as too warlike and resigned from the president’s cabinet.
Other Sinkings In August 1915, two more Americans lost their lives at 
sea as the result of a German submarine attack on another passenger ship, the Arabic . This time, Wilson’s note of protest prevailed upon the German 
government to pledge that no unarmed passenger ships would be sunk without warning, which would allow time for passengers to get into lifeboats.
Germany kept its word until March 1916, when a German torpedo struck 
an unarmed merchant ship, the Sussex, injuring several American passengers. 
Wilson threatened to cut off U.S. diplomatic relations with Germany—a step preparatory to war. Once again, rather than risk U.S. entry into the war on the British side, Germany backed down. Its reply to the president, known as the Sussex pledge, promised not to sink merchant or passenger ships without 
giving due warning. For the remainder of 1916, Germany was true to its word.
Economic Links with Britain and France
Even though the United States was officially a neutral nation, its economy became closely tied to those of the Allied powers of Great Britain and France. In early 1914, before the war began, the United States had been in an economic recession. Soon after the outbreak of war, the economy rebounded in part because of orders for war supplies from the British and the French. By 1915, U.S. businesses had never been so prosperous.
In theory, U.S. manufacturers could have shipped supplies to Germany 
as well, but the British blockade effectively prevented such trade. Wilson’s policy did not deliberately favor the Allied powers. Nevertheless, because the president more or less tolerated the British blockade while restricting Germany’s submarine blockade, U.S. economic support was going to one side (Britain and France) and not the other. Between 1914 and 1917, U.S. trade with the Allies quadrupled while its trade with Germany dwindled to the vanishing point.
480 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONLoans  When the Allies could not purchase everything they needed, the 
U.S. government permitted U.S. bankers (particularly the bank of J. Pierpont 
Morgan) to extend as much as $3 billion in credit to Britain and France. These loans promoted U.S. prosperity as they sustained the Allies’ war effort.

Public Opinion
If Wilson’s policies favored Britain, so did the attitudes of most Americans. In August 1914, as Americans read in their newspapers about German armies marching ruthlessly through Belgium, they perceived Germany as a cruel bully whose armies were commanded by a mean-spirited autocrat, Kaiser Wilhelm. The sinking of the Lusitania  reinforced this negative view of Germany. 
Ethnic Influences In 1914, first- and second-generation citizens made up 
more than 30 percent of the U.S. population. They were glad to be out of the fighting and strongly supported neutrality. Even so, their sympathies reflected their ancestries. For example, German Americans strongly identified with the struggles of their “homeland. ” And many Irish Americans, who hated Britain because of its oppressive rule of Ireland, openly backed the Central powers. On the other hand, when Italy joined the Allies in 1915, Italian Americans began cheering on the Allies in their desperate struggle to fend off German assaults on the Western Front (entrenched positions in France).
481  TOPIC 7.5   W ORLD WAR I : MILITARY AND DIPLOMACY  Overall, though, most native-born Americans supported the Allies. Positive 
U.S. relations with France since the Revolutionary War bolstered public support 
for the French. Americans also tended to sympathize with Britain and France because of their democratic governments. President Wilson himself, a person of Scottish-English descent, had long admired the British political system.
British War Propaganda Not only did Britain command the seas, it 
also commanded the war news that was cabled daily to U.S. newspapers and magazines. Fully recognizing the importance of influencing U.S. public opinion, the British government made sure the American press was well supplied with stories of German soldiers committing atrocities in Belgium and the German-occupied part of eastern France.
The War Debate
After the Lusitania  crisis, a small but vocal minority of influential Republicans 
from the East—including Theodore Roosevelt—argued for U.S. entry into the war against Germany. Foreign policy realists believed that a German victory would change the balance of power and that the United States needed a strong British navy to protect the status quo. However, the majority of Americans remained thankful for a booming economy and peace.
Preparedness Eastern Republicans such as Roosevelt were the first to 
recognize that the U.S. military was hopelessly unprepared for a major war. They clamored for “preparedness” (greater defense expenditures) soon after the European war broke out. 
At first, President Wilson opposed the call for preparedness, but in late 
1915 he changed his policy. Wilson urged Congress to approve an ambitious expansion of the armed forces. The president’s proposal provoked a storm of controversy, especially among Democrats, who until then were largely opposed to military increases. After a nationwide speaking tour on behalf of preparedness, Wilson finally convinced Congress to pass the National Defense Act in June 1916, which increased the regular army to a force of nearly 175,000. A month later, Congress approved the construction of more than 50 warships (battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines) in just one year.
Opposition to War  Many Americans, especially in the Midwest and 
West, were adamantly opposed to preparedness, fearing that it would soon lead to U.S. involvement in the war. The antiwar activists included Populists, Progressives, and Socialists. Leaders among the peace-minded Progressives were William Jennings Bryan, Jane Addams, and Jeannette Rankin—the 
latter the first woman to be elected to Congress. Women suffragists actively campaigned against any military buildup (although after the U.S. declaration of war in 1917, they supported the war effort).
The Election of 1916
President Wilson was well aware that, as a Democrat, he had won election to the presidency in 1912 only because of the split in Republican ranks between Taft  
482 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONconservatives and Roosevelt Progressives. Despite his own Progressive record, 
Wilson’s chances for reelection did not seem strong after Theodore Roosevelt declined the Progressive Party’s nomination for president in 1916 and rejoined the Republicans. (Roosevelt’s decision virtually destroyed any chance of the Progressive Party surviving.) Charles Evans Hughes, a Supreme Court justice and former governor of New Y ork, became the presidential candidate of a reunited Republican Party.
“He Kept Us Out of War” The Democrats adopted as their campaign slogan 
“He kept us out of war. ” The peace sentiment in the country, Wilson’s record of Progressive leadership, and Hughes’ weakness as a candidate combined to give the president the victory in an extremely close election. Democratic strength in the South and West overcame Republican power in the East.
Peace Efforts
Wilson made repeated efforts to fulfill his party’s campaign promise to keep out of the war. Before the election, in 1915, he had sent his chief foreign policy adviser, Colonel Edward House of Texas, to London, Paris, and Berlin to negotiate a peace settlement. This mission, however, had been unsuccessful. Other efforts at mediation also were turned aside by both the Allies and the Central powers. Finally, in January 1917, Wilson made a speech to the Senate declaring U.S. commitment to his idealistic hope for “peace without victory. ”
Decision for War
In April 1917, only one month after being sworn into office a second time, President Wilson went before Congress to ask for a declaration of war against Germany. What had happened to change his policy from neutrality to war?
Unrestricted Submarine Warfare
Most important in the U.S. decision for war was a sudden change in German military strategy. The German high command had decided in early January 1917 to resume unrestricted submarine warfare. Germany recognized the risk of the United States entering the war but believed that, by cutting off supplies to the Allies, they could win the war before Americans could react. Germany communicated its decision to the U.S. government on January 31. A few days later, Wilson broke off U.S. diplomatic relations with Germany.
Immediate Causes
Wilson still hesitated, but a series of events in March 1917, as well as the president’s hopes for arranging a permanent peace in Europe, convinced him that U.S. participation in the war was now unavoidable.
Zimmermann Telegram On March 1, U.S. newspapers carried the 
shocking news of a secret offer made by Germany to Mexico. Intercepted by British intelligence, a telegram to Mexico from the German foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann, proposed that Mexico ally itself with Germany in 
483  TOPIC 7.5   W ORLD WAR I : MILITARY AND DIPLOMACY  return for Germany’s pledge to help Mexico recover lost territories: Texas, New 
Mexico, and Arizona. Mexico never considered accepting the offer. However, the Zimmermann Telegram aroused the nationalist anger of the American people and convinced Wilson that Germany fully expected a war with the United States.
Russian Revolution  Applying the principle of moral diplomacy, Wilson 
wanted the war to be fought for a worthy purpose: the triumph of democracy. It bothered him that one of the Allies was Russia, a nation governed by an autocratic czar. This barrier to U.S. participation was suddenly removed on March 15, when Russian revolutionaries overthrew the czar’s government and proclaimed a republic. (Only later, in November, would the revolutionary government be taken over by Communists.)
Renewed Submarine Attacks In the first weeks of March, German 
submarines sank five unarmed U.S. merchant ships. Wilson was ready for war.
Declaration of War
On April 2, 1917, President Wilson stood before a special session of senators and representatives and called upon them to defend humanitarian and democratic principles. Wilson solemnly asked Congress to recognize that a state of war existed between Germany and the United States. His speech condemned Germany’s submarine policy as “warfare against mankind” and declared that “The world must be made safe for democracy. ” On April 6, an overwhelming majority in Congress voted for a declaration of war, although a few pacifists, including Robert La Follette and Jeanette Rankin, defiantly voted no.
Fighting the War
By the time the first U.S. troops shipped overseas in late 1917, millions of European soldiers on both sides had already died in three years of fighting. The Allies hoped that fresh troops would be enough to bring victory. The conflict’s trench warfare was made more deadly in the industrial age by heavy artillery, machine guns, poison gas, tanks, and airplanes. A second revolution in Russia by Bolsheviks (or Communists) took that nation out of the war. With no 
Eastern Front to divide its forces, Germany concentrated on one all-out push to break through Allied lines in France.
Naval Operations
Germany’s policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was having its intended effect. Merchant ships bound for Britain were being sunk at a staggering rate: 900,000 tons of shipping were lost in just one month (April 1917). U.S. response to this Allied emergency was to undertake a record-setting program of ship construction. The U.S. Navy also implemented a convoy system of armed escorts for groups of merchant ships. By the end of 1917, the system was working well enough to ensure that Britain and France would not be starved into submission.
484 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONAmerican Expeditionary Force
Unable to imagine the grim realities of trench warfare, U.S. troops were eager 
for action. The idealism of both the troops and the public is reflected in the popular song of George M. Cohan that many were singing:
Over there, over there, 
Send the word, send the word over there  
That the Y anks are coming, 
The Y anks are coming, 
The drums rum-tumming ev’ry where—
The American Expeditionary Force (AEF) was commanded by General 
John J. Pershing. The first U.S. troops to see action were used to plug weaknesses in the French and British lines. But by the summer of 1918, as American forces arrived by the hundreds of thousands, the AEF assumed independent responsibility for one segment of the Western Front.
Last German Offensive Enough U.S. troops were in place in spring 1918 
to hold the line against the last ferocious assault by German forces. At Château-Thierry on the Marne River, Americans stopped the German advance (June 1918) and struck back with a successful counterattack at Belleau Wood.
Drive to Victory In August, September, and October, an Allied offensive 
along the Meuse River and through the Argonne Forest (the Meuse–Argonne offensive) succeeded in driving an exhausted German army backward toward the German border. U.S. troops participated in this drive at St. Mihiel—the southern sector of the Allied line. On November 11, 1918, the Germans signed an armistice in which they agreed to surrender their arms, give up much of their navy, and evacuate occupied territory.
U.S. Casualties After only a few months of fighting, U.S. combat deaths 
totaled nearly 49,000. Many more thousands died of disease, including a flu epidemic in the training camps, bringing total U.S. fatalities in World War I to 112,432. Total deaths in the war were around 20 million people, most of whom were civilians.
Making the Peace
During the war, Woodrow Wilson never lost sight of his ambition to shape the peace settlement when the war ended. In January 1917, he had said that the United States would insist on “peace without victory. ” A year later he presented to Congress a detailed list of war aims, known as the Fourteen Points, designed to address the causes of World War I and prevent another world war.
The Fourteen Points
Several of the president’s Fourteen Points related to specific territorial questions. For example, Wilson called on Germany to return the regions of Alsace and Lorraine to France and to evacuate Belgium in the west and Romania 
485  TOPIC 7.5   W ORLD WAR I : MILITARY AND DIPLOMACY  and Serbia in the east. Of greater significance were the broad principles for 
securing a lasting peace:
• Recognition of freedom of the seas
• An end to the practice of making secret treaties
• Reduction of national armaments
• An “impartial adjustment of all colonial claims”
• Self-determination for the various nationalities
• Removal of trade barriers
• “ A general association of nations . . . for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike”
The last point was the one that Wilson valued the most. The international peace association that he envisioned would soon be named the League of Nations.
The Treaty of Versailles
The peace conference following the armistice took place in the Palace of Versailles outside Paris, beginning in January 1919. Every nation that had fought on the Allied side in the war was represented. No U.S. president had ever traveled abroad to attend a diplomatic conference, but President Wilson decided that his personal participation at Versailles was vital to defending his Fourteen Points. Republicans criticized him for being accompanied to Paris by several Democrats but only one Republican, whose advice was never sought.
The Big Four Other heads of state at Versailles made it clear that their 
nations wanted both revenge against Germany and compensation in the form of indemnities and territory. They did not share Wilson’s idealism, which called for peace without victory. David Lloyd George of Great Britain, Georges Clemenceau of France, and Vittorio Orlando of Italy met with Wilson almost daily as the Big Four. After months of argument, the president reluctantly agreed to compromise on most of his Fourteen Points. He insisted, however, that the other delegations accept his plan for a League of Nations.
Peace Terms When the peace conference adjourned in June 1919, the 
Treaty of Versailles included the following terms:
1. To punish Germany, Germany was disarmed and stripped of its colonies in Asia and Africa. It was also forced to admit guilt for the war, accept French occupation of the Rhineland for 15 years, and pay a huge sum of money in reparations to Great Britain and France.
2. To apply the principle of self-determination, territories once controlled by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia were taken by the Allies; independence was granted to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, and Poland; and the new nations of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were established.
486 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION3. To maintain peace, signers of the treaty joined an international 
peacekeeping organization, the League of Nations. Article X of the covenant (charter) of the League called on each member nation to stand ready to protect the independence and territorial integrity of other nations.

The Battle for Ratification
Returning to the United States, President Wilson had to win approval of two-
thirds of the Senate for all parts of the Treaty of Versailles, including the League of Nations covenant. Republican senators raised objections to the League, especially to Article X. They argued that U.S. membership in such a body might interfere with U.S. sovereignty and might also cause European nations to interfere in the Western Hemisphere (a violation of the Monroe Doctrine).
Increased Partisanship After the War Wilson made winning Senate 
ratification difficult. In October 1918, he had asked voters to support Democrats in the midterm elections as an act of patriotism. This appeal had backfired badly. In the 1918 election, Republicans had won a solid majority in the House and a majority of two in the Senate. In 1919, Wilson needed Republican votes in the Senate to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. Instead, he faced the determined hostility of a leading Senate Republican, Henry Cabot Lodge.
487  TOPIC 7.5   W ORLD WAR I : MILITARY AND DIPLOMACY  Opponents: Irreconcilables and Reservationists Senators opposed to 
the Treaty of Versailles formed two groups. The Irreconcilable faction could 
not accept U.S. membership in the League, no matter how the covenant was worded. The Reservationist faction, a larger group led by Senator Lodge, said 
it could accept the League if certain reservations were added to the covenant. Wilson had the option of either accepting Lodge’s reservations or fighting for the treaty as it stood. He chose to fight.
Wilson’s Western Tour and Breakdown Wilson believed he could 
personally rally enough public support to prevail and push ratification of the League through Congress. With confidence, he undertook an arduous speaking tour by train of the West. On September 25, 1919, he collapsed after a speech in Colorado. He returned to Washington. A few days later he suffered a massive stroke from which he never fully recovered.
Rejection of the Treaty The Senate defeated the treaty without reservations. 
When it came up with reservations, the ailing Wilson directed his Senate allies to reject the compromise, and they joined with the Irreconcilables in defeating the treaty a second time. After Wilson left office in 1921, the United States officially made peace with Germany. However, it never ratified the Versailles Treaty nor joined the League of Nations.

“The United States would never ratify the treaty and would never join the League of Nations. Many newspapers and commentators expressed regret at the outcome, and most laid the blame on Wilson—properly so.

will not be endured as long as men fight.
Supreme Court, Schenck v. United States, 1919
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of international and

Mobilization
U.S. mobilization for war in 1917 was a race against time. Germany was 
preparing to deliver a knockout blow to end the war on German terms. Could the United States mobilize its vast economic resources fast enough to make a difference? That was the question Wilson and his advisers confronted in the critical early months of U.S. involvement in the war.
Industry and Labor The Wilson administration, with Progressive efficiency, 
created hundreds of temporary wartime agencies and commissions staffed by experts from business and government. The legacy of this mobilization of the domestic economy under governmental leadership proved significant in the New Deal programs enacted during Great Depression in the 1930s. For example:
• Bernard Baruch, a Wall Street broker, volunteered to use his extensive contacts in industry to help win the war. Under his direction, the War Industries Board set production priorities and established centralized control over raw materials and prices.
• Herbert Hoover, a distinguished engineer, took charge of the Food Administration, which encouraged American households to eat less meat and bread so that more food could be shipped abroad for the French and British troops. The conservation drive paid off. In two years, U.S. shipment of food overseas tripled.
• Harry Garfield volunteered to head the Fuel Administration, which directed efforts to save coal. Nonessential factories were closed, and daylight saving time went into effect for the first time.
• Treasury Secretary William McAdoo headed the Railroad Administration which took public control of the railroads to coordinate traffic and promote standardized railroad equipment.
492 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION• Former President William Howard Taft helped arbitrate disputes 
between workers and employers as head of the National War Labor Board . Labor won concessions during the war that had earlier been 
denied. Wages rose, the eight-hour work day became more common, and union membership increased.
Finance Paying for the costly war presented a huge challenge. Wilson’s war 
government managed to raise $33 billion in two years through a combination of loans and taxes. It conducted four massive drives to convince Americans to put their savings into federal government Liberty Bonds. Congress also increased personal income and corporate taxes, and placed a new tax on luxury goods.
Public Opinion
The U.S. government used techniques of both patriotic persuasion and legal intimidation to ensure public support for the war effort. Journalist George Creel  took charge of a propaganda agency called the Committee on Public 
Information, which enlisted the voluntary services of artists, writers, vaudeville performers, and movie stars to depict the heroism of the “boys” (U.S. soldiers) and the villainy of the kaiser. They created films, posters, and pamphlets and organized volunteer speakers—all urging Americans to watch out for German spies and to “do your bit” for the war.

493  TOPIC 7.6   W ORLD WAR I : HOME FRONTCivil Liberties
War hysteria and patriotic enthusiasm provided an excuse for nativist groups 
to express their prejudices by charging minorities with disloyalty. One such group, the American Protective League, mounted “Hate the Hun” campaigns and used vigilante actions to attack all things German—from performing Beethoven’s music to cooking sauerkraut. Under the order of the U.S. Secretary of Labor, manufacturers of war materials could refuse to hire and could fire American citizens of German extraction. 
Limits on Immigration More generally, the Barred Zone Act (the 
Immigration Act of 1917) prohibited anyone residing in a region from the Middle East to southeast Asia from entering the United States. It also included a literacy test designed to prevent immigration from southern and eastern Europe. This act set the stage for sharp restrictions on immigration in the 1920s.
Espionage and Sedition Acts A number of socialists and pacifists bravely 
criticized the government’s war policy even as Congress passed laws restricting free speech. The Espionage Act (1917) provided for imprisonment of up to 20 years for persons who tried to incite rebellion in the armed forces or obstructed the draft. The Sedition Act  (1918) went much further by prohibiting anyone 
from making “disloyal” or “abusive” remarks about the U.S. government. Approximately 2,000 people were prosecuted under these laws, half of whom were convicted and jailed. Among them was the Socialist leader Eugene Debs, who was sentenced to ten years in federal prison for speaking against the war.
Schenck v. United States (1919) The Supreme Court upheld the 
constitutionality of the Espionage Act in a case involving a man who had been imprisoned for distributing pamphlets against the draft. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes concluded that the right to free speech could be limited when it represented a “clear and present danger” to public safety.
Armed Forces
As soon as war was declared, thousands of young men voluntarily enlisted for military service. Still, the military thought it needed more soldiers and sailors. 
Selective Service Act (1917) To meet this need, Secretary of War Newton 
D. Baker devised a “selective service” system to conscript (draft) men into the military. He wanted a democratic method run by local boards for ensuring that all groups in the population would be called into service. The government required all men between 21 and 30 (and later between 18 and 45) to register for possible induction into the military. Under the Selective Service Act , about 
2.8 million men were eventually called by lottery, in addition to the almost 2 million who volunteered to serve. About half of all those in uniform made it to the Western Front.
African Americans Racial segregation applied to the army as it did 
to civilian life. Almost 400,000 African Americans served in World War I in segregated units. Only a few were permitted to be officers, and all were 
494 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONbarred from the Marine Corps. Nevertheless, W . E. B. Du Bois believed that 
the record of service by African Americans, fighting to “make the world safe for democracy, ” would earn them equal rights at home when the war ended. However, he would be bitterly disappointed.
Effects on American Society
All groups in American society—business and labor, women and men, immigrants and native-born—had to adjust to the realities of a wartime economy. As factories needed workers to replace those in the military and to increase production of war goods, people moved from rural areas across the country to urban areas to take jobs.
More Jobs for Women As men were drafted into the military, the jobs they 
vacated were often taken by women, thousands of whom entered the workforce for the first time. Women’s contributions to the war effort, both as volunteers and wage earners, finally convinced Wilson and Congress to support the 19th Amendment, which protected the right of women to vote.
Migration of Mexicans Job opportunities in wartime America, together 
with the upheavals of a revolution in Mexico, caused thousands of Mexicans to cross the border to work in agriculture and mining. Most were employed in the Southwest, but a significant number also traveled to the Midwest for factory jobs. 
The Great Migration The largest movement of people consisted of 
African Americans who migrated north in the Great Migration (a term also 
used for 17th century movement of Puritans). At the close of the 19th century, about 90 percent of African Americans lived in southern states. This internal migration began in earnest between 1910 and 1930 when about 1 million people traveled north to seek jobs in the cities. Motivating their decision to leave the south were (1) deteriorating race relations marked by segregation and racial violence, (2) destruction of their cotton crops by the boll weevil, and (3) limited economic opportunities. In the face of these problems, job in northern factories were a tremendous attraction. 
Migration slowed down in the 1930s because of the economic collapse 
known as the Great Depression, but it resumed during World War II (1941–1945). Between 1940 and 1970, over 4 million African Americans moved north. Although many succeeded in improving their economic conditions, the newcomers to northern cities also faced racial tension and discrimination.

495  TOPIC 7.6   W ORLD WAR I : HOME FRONTPostwar Problems
Americans had trouble adjusting from the patriotic fervor of wartime to the 
economic and social stresses of postwar uncertainties. America’s postwar recovery was troubled by a series of social and economic upheavals. 
1918 Pandemic The same year that World War I ended, the most severe 
influenza outbreak of the 20th century started. It infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide and claimed an estimated 50 million lives. In the United States, it was first discovered in crowded military camps in the spring of 1918. Surprisingly, the pandemic had some of the highest mortality rates among 20 to 40 year olds. At the time there were no effective drugs to treat the virus, which killed 500,000 to 675,000 Americans. The rapid spread of the pandemic was underreported by the limited media coverage and government efforts to keep up morale during wartime.
Demobilization During the war, 4 million American men had been taken 
from civilian life and the domestic economy. Not all the returning soldiers could find jobs right away, but many who did took employment from the women and African Americans who, for a short time, had thrived on war work. The business boom of wartime also went flat, as factory orders for military products fell off. With European farm products back on the market, farm prices fell, which hurt U.S. farmers. In the cities, consumers went on a buying spree, leading to inflation and a short boom in 1920. The spree did not last. In 1921, the economy plunged into a recession, and 10 percent of the American workforce was unemployed.
The Red Scare In 1919, the country suffered from a volatile combination 
of unhappiness with the peace process, fears of communism fueled by the Communist takeover in Russia, and worries about labor unrest at home. The anti-German hysteria of the war years turned quickly into anti-Communist hysteria  known as the Red Scare. These anti-Communist fears also fueled 
xenophobia that resulted in restrictions on immigration in the 1920s.
Palmer Raids A series of unexplained bombings caused Attorney General 
A. Mitchell Palmer to establish a special office under J. Edgar Hoover to gather information on radicals. Palmer also ordered mass arrests of anarchists, socialists, and labor agitators. From November 1919 through January 1920, more than 6,000 people were arrested based on limited criminal evidence. Most of the suspects were foreign born, and 500 of them, including the outspoken radical Emma Goldman, were deported. The scare faded almost as quickly as it arose. Palmer warned of huge riots on May Day, 1920, but they never took place. His loss of credibility, coupled with rising concerns about civil liberties, caused the hysteria to recede.
Labor Conflict In a nation that valued free enterprise and rugged 
individualism, a large part of the American public regarded unions with distrust. Antiunion attitudes had softened during the Progressive Era. Factory workers and their unions were offered a “Square Deal” under Theodore Roosevelt and 
496 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONprotection from lawsuits under the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914. During the 
war, unions made important gains. Afterwards, however, a series of strikes in 1919 as well as fear of revolution turned public opinion against unions.
Strikes of 1919 The first major strike of 1919 was in Seattle in February. 
Some 60,000 unionists joined shipyard workers in a peaceful strike for higher pay. Troops were called out, but there was no violence. In September, Boston police went on strike to protest the firing of a few officers who tried to unionize. Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge sent in the National Guard to break the strike. Also in September, workers for the U.S. Steel Corporation struck. State and federal troops were called out, and after considerable violence and the death of 18 workers, the strike was broken in January 1920.
Racial Violence The decades after 1900 saw acute racial tension over the 
Jim Crow oppression in the South, the rapid growth of the Ku Klux Klan, the continued lynching of African Americans, and the Great Migration to northern cities. Whites resented the increased competition for jobs and housing. During the war, race riots had erupted, the largest in East St. Louis, Illinois, in 1917. In 1919, racial tensions led to violence in many cities. In Chicago, 40 people were killed and 500 were injured in a riot that started over the use of a beach.
What has been called “the single worst incident of racial violence in 
American history” happened in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921. The Tulsa Race Massacre began after African Americans thwarted the lynching of a Black man. White mobs destroyed more than 1,000 Black-owned homes and businesses in the neighborhood known for its prosperity as the Black Wall Street and killed 50 to 300 people The man whose lynching was prevented was later exonerated. 
Confederate Monuments Another part of the resurgence of Southern 
White pride and racial tensions was the spike in building public monuments between 1900 and the 1920s to honor Jefferson Davis and top Confederate generals throughout the South. Many African American and human rights reformers believe that, unlike earlier memorials in cemeteries to veterans, these were built to glorify the traditions of the “Lost Cause” interpretation of the Confederacy, which included defending White supremacy and slavery.
Decline of the Progressive Impulse America’s sacrifices and causalities 
suffered during World War I drained the last of the Progressive idealism in the crusade “to make the world safe for democracy. ” Instead, the majority of the nation wanted to return to a less complicated period, or what the next, more conservative president called “normalcy. ” The 1920s provided prosperity, automobiles, radio, jazz, and movie and sport heroes along with reactionary efforts to stop change by restricting immigration, denying science, and retreating from international commitments.

Topic 7.7 
1920s: Innovations in 
Communication and Technology
Why does this magnificent applied science which saves work  
and makes life easier bring us so little happiness?
Albert Einstein, address to California Institute of Technology, 1931
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the innovations in 
communications and technology in the United States over time.
Politics took a backseat in the 1920s as Americans adapted to economic growth 
and social change. The decade began with a brief postwar recession (1921), 
included a lengthy period of economic prosperity (1922–1928), and ended in economic disaster (October 1929) with the nation’s worst stock market crash to that time. During the boom years, unemployment was usually below 4 percent. The standard of living for most Americans improved significantly. Indoor 
plumbing and central heating became commonplace. By 1930, two-thirds of all homes had electricity. Real income for both the middle class and the working class increased substantially.
The prosperity, however, was far from universal. In fact, during the 1920s, 
as many as 40 percent of U.S. families in both rural and urban areas had incomes in the poverty range—they struggled to live on less than $1,500 a year. Farmers in particular did not share in the booming economy.
Causes of Economic Prosperity
The economic boom—led by a spectacular rise of 64 percent in manufacturing output between 1919 and 1929—resulted from several factors.
Increased Productivity Companies made greater use of research, 
expanding their use of Frederick W . Taylor’s time-and-motion studies and principles of scientific management. The manufacturing process was made more efficient by the adoption of improved methods of mass production. In 1914, Henry Ford had perfected a system for manufacturing automobiles by 
means of an assembly line. Instead of losing time moving around a factory as 
in the past, Ford’s workers remained at one place all day and performed the same simple operation over and over again at rapid speed. In the 1920s, most major industries adopted the assembly line and realized major gains in worker productivity.
500 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONEnergy Technologies Another cause of economic growth was the 
increased use of oil and electricity, although coal was still used for railroads 
and to heat homes. Increasingly, oil was used to power factories and to provide gasoline for the rapidly increasing numbers of automobiles. By 1930, oil would account for 23 percent of U.S. energy consumption (up from 3 percent in 1900). Electric motors in factories and new appliances at home increased electrical generation more than 300 percent during the decade.
Government Policy Government at all levels in the 1920s favored 
the growth of big business by offering corporate tax cuts and doing almost nothing to enforce the antitrust laws of the Progressive Era. Large tax cuts for higher-income Americans also contributed to the imbalance in incomes and increased speculation in markets. The Federal Reserve contributed to the overheated economic boom through low interest rates and relaxed regulation of banks. Then, it began tightening the money supply as the economy began to decline—precisely the wrong time, according to economists today.
Consumer Economy Adding electricity in their homes enabled millions 
of Americans to purchase the new consumer appliances of the decade—refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and washing machines. Automobiles became more affordable and sold by the millions, making the horse-and-buggy era a thing of the past. Advertising expanded as businesses found that they could increase consumers’ demand for new products by appealing to desires for status and popularity. Stores increased sales of the new appliances and automobiles by allowing customers to buy on credit. Later, as consumers faced more “easy monthly payments” than they could afford, they curtailed buying, contributing to the collapse of the economic boom. Chain stores, such as Woolworth’s and A & P , proliferated. Their greater variety of products were attractively displayed and often priced lower than the neighborhood stores, which they threatened to displace. 
Impact of the Automobile More than any other new technology, 
the automobile changed society. In 1913, Americans owned 1.2 million automobiles. In 1929, that number reached 26.5 million, an average of almost one per family. Auto production replaced the railroad industry as the key promoter of economic growth. Other industries—steel, glass, rubber, gasoline, and highway construction—depended on automobile sales. 
In social terms, the automobile affected all that Americans did: commuting 
to work, traveling for pleasure, shopping, even dating. Some changes were negative, such as traffic jams in cities and injuries and deaths on roads. Many people disliked the independence cars gave young people. They blamed the automobile, “a bordello on wheels, ” for a breakdown of morals. 
Farm Problems
Many farmers did not share in the prosperity of the 1920s. Their best years had been 1916–1918, when crop prices had been kept high by (1) wartime demand in Europe and (2) the U.S. government’s wartime policy of 
501  TOPIC 7.7    1920S: INNOVATIONS IN COMMUNICATION AND TECHNOLOGYguaranteeing a minimum price for wheat and corn. When the war ended, so 
did farm prosperity. Farmers who had borrowed heavily to expand during the war were left with a heavy burden of debt. New technologies (such as chemical fertilizers and gasoline tractors) helped farmers increase their production in the 1920s but did not solve their problems. Increased productivity only added to the financial problems of farmers, as the resulting surpluses produced falling prices.
Labor Unions Struggle
Wages rose during the 1920s, but membership in unions declined 20 percent, partly because most companies insisted on an “open shop”  (keeping jobs 
open to nonunion workers). Some companies also began to practice welfare capitalism—voluntarily offering their employees improved benefits and higher wages in order to reduce their interest in organizing unions. In the South, companies used police, state militia, and local mobs to violently resist efforts to unionize the textile industry.
In an era that so strongly favored business, strikes usually failed. The United 
Mine Workers, led by John L. Lewis, suffered setbacks in a series of violent and ultimately unsuccessful strikes in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky. Conservative courts routinely issued injunctions against strikes and nullified labor laws aimed at protecting workers’ welfare.
Technology and Culture
The Census of 1920 reported that, for the first time, more than half of the American population lived in urban areas, defined as communities of 2,500 people or more. Many city residents had tastes, morals, and habits of mass consumption that were increasingly at odds with the religious and moral codes of many rural Americans. 
Architecture and Industrial Design  
The fusion of art and technology during the 1920s and 1930s created a new profession of industrial designers. Influenced by Art Deco and streamlining styles, they created functional products from toasters to locomotives that had aesthetic appeal. Many skyscrapers, such as the Chrysler and Empire State buildings in New Y ork, were built in the Art Deco  style, which 
captured modernist simplification of forms while using machine age materials.

502 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONMass Media Newspapers had once been the only medium of mass 
communication and entertainment. In the 1920s, a new medium—the radio—
suddenly appeared. The first commercial radio station went on the air in 1920 and broadcast music to just a few thousand listeners. By 1930, there were more than 800 stations broadcasting to 10 million radios—about a third of all U.S. homes. The organization of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in 1924 and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) in 1927 provided networks of radio stations that enabled people from coast to coast to listen to the same programs: news broadcasts, sporting events, soap operas, quiz shows, and comedies. They also provided national exposure to regional cultures. For example, the National Barn Dance show, later renamed the Grand Ole Opry, featured music from the southeastern United States, a style that evolved into today’s country music.   
Movie Business The movie industry centered in Hollywood , California, 
became big business in the 1920s. Going to the movies became a national habit in cities, suburbs, and small towns. Glamorous movie stars such as Greta Garbo and Rudolf Valentino were idolized by millions. Elaborate movie theater “palaces” were built for the general public. With the introduction of talking (sound) pictures in 1927, the movie industry reached new heights. By 1929, more than 80 million tickets to Hollywood movies were sold weekly.
Popular Music  High school and college youth rebelled against their 
elders’ culture by dancing to jazz music. Brought north by African American musicians, jazz became a symbol of the “new” and “modern” culture of cities. Like radio, phonographs made this new style of music available to a huge (and youthful) public. Other forms of music that spread in popularity were blues, classical, and “ American standards” by composers such as Irving Berlin. 
Aviation  The improving technology of airplanes in the 1920s created 
the opportunity for aviators to set and break speed  and distance records. Crowds would greet pilots after epic flights, and communities would hold huge street parades to honor them. The most celebrated hero was Charles Lindbergh, a young aviator who thrilled the entire world by flying nonstop across the Atlantic from Long Island to Paris in 1927. Americans listened to the radio for news of his flight and welcomed his return to the United States with ticker tape parades larger than the welcome given to the returning soldiers of World War I.
Popular Heroes  In an earlier era, people admired politicians such as 
William Jennings Bryan, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson as heroic figures. In the new age of radio and movies, Americans radically shifted their viewpoint and adopted as role models the larger-than-life personalities celebrated on the sports page and the movie screen. Every sport had its superstars who were nationally known. In the 1920s, people followed the knockouts of heavyweight boxer Jack Dempsey, the swimming records of Gertrude Ederle, the touchdowns scored by Jim Thorpe, the home runs hit by Babe Ruth, and the golf tournaments won by Bobby Jones.

Learning Objective 1 : Explain the causes and effects of international  
and internal migration patterns over time. 
Learning Objective 2 : Explain the causes and effects of the 
developments in popular culture in America.
The dominant social and political issues of the 1920s expressed sharp 
divisions in U.S. society between the young and the old, religious modernists 
and religious fundamentalists, prohibitionists and anti-prohibitionists, and nativists and the foreign born. Because of the steady flow in previous decades of people from rural to urban areas in search of jobs, by 1920 most people lived in urban areas, then defined as places with more than 2,500 residents. 
Religion, Science, and Politics
Divisions among Protestants reflected the tensions in society between the traditional values of rural areas and the modernizing forces of the cities.
Modernism A range of influences, including the changing role of women, 
the Social Gospel movement, and scientific knowledge, caused large numbers of Protestants to define their faith in new ways. Modernists took a historical and critical view of certain passages in the Bible and believed they could accept Darwin’s theory of evolution without abandoning their religious faith.
Fundamentalism Protestant preachers, mostly in rural areas, condemned 
the modernists and taught that every word in the Bible was true literally. A key fundamentalist doctrine was that creationism (the belief that God had created the universe in seven days, as stated in the Bible) explained the origin of all life. Fundamentalists blamed modernists for causing a decline in morals.
506 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONRevivalists on the Radio Ever since the Great Awakening of the early 
1700s, religious revivals periodically swept through America. Revivalists of 
the 1920s preached a fundamentalist message but did so for the first time making full use of the new tool of mass communication, the radio. One leading radio evangelist was Billy Sunday, who drew large crowds as he attacked drinking, gambling, and dancing. Another was Aimee Semple McPherson, who condemned the twin evils of communism and jazz music from her pulpit in Los Angeles.
Fundamentalism and Science
More than any other single event, a much-publicized trial in Tennessee focused the debate between religious fundamentalists in the rural South and modernists of the northern cities. Tennessee, like several other southern states, outlawed the teaching of Darwin’s theory of evolution in public schools. To challenge the constitutionality of these laws, the American Civil Liberties Union persuaded a Tennessee biology teacher, John Scopes, to teach the theory of evolution to his high school class. For doing so, Scopes was arrested and tried in 1925.
The Trial The entire nation followed the Scopes trial both in newspapers 
and by radio. Defending Scopes was a famous lawyer from Chicago, Clarence Darrow . Representing the fundamentalists was three-time Democratic 
candidate for president William Jennings Bryan, who testified as an expert on the Bible. The courtroom clash between Darrow and Bryan dramatized that the debate on evolution symbolized a battle between two opposing views of the world.
Aftermath As expected, Scopes was convicted, but the conviction was later 
overturned on a technicality. Laws banning the teaching of evolution remained on the books for years, although they were rarely enforced. The northern press asserted that Darrow and the modernists had thoroughly discredited fundamentalism. However, to this day, questions about the relationship between religion and public schools remain controversial and unresolved.
Prohibition
Another controversy that helped define the 1920s concerned people’s conflicting attitudes toward the 18th Amendment. Wartime concerns to conserve grain and maintain a sober workforce moved Congress to pass this amendment, which strictly prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages, including liquors, wines, and beers. It was ratified in 1919. The adoption of the Prohibition amendment and a federal law enforcing it (the Volstead Act, 1919) were the culmination of many decades of crusading by temperance forces.
Defying the Law Prohibition did not stop people from drinking alcohol 
either in public places or at home. Especially in the cities, it became fashionable to defy the law by going to clubs or bars known as speakeasies, where bootleg (smuggled) liquor was sold. City police and judges were paid to look the other way. Even elected officials such as President Harding served alcoholic drinks to 
507  TOPIC 7.8    1920S: CULTURAL AND POLITICAL CONTROVERSIES  guests. Liquors, beers, and wines were readily available from bootleggers who 
smuggled them from Canada or made them in their garages or basements.
Rival groups of gangsters, including a Chicago gang headed by Al Capone, 
fought for control of the lucrative bootlegging trade. Organized crime became big business. The millions made from the sale of illegal booze allowed the gangs to expand other illegal activities: prostitution, gambling, and narcotics.
Political Discord and Repeal Most Republicans publicly supported 
the “noble experiment” of Prohibition (although in private, many politicians drank). Democrats were divided on the issue, with southerners supporting it and northern city politicians calling for repeal. Supporters of the 18th Amendment pointed to declines in alcoholism and alcohol-related deaths. However, support weakened in the face of growing public resentment and clear evidence of increased criminal activity. With the coming of the Great Depression, economic arguments for repeal were added to the others. In 1933, the 21st Amendment, which repealed the 18th Amendment, was ratified, and 
millions celebrated the new year by toasting the end of Prohibition.
Opposition to Immigration
The world war had interrupted the flow of immigrants to the United States, but as soon as the war ended, immigration shot upward. More than a million foreigners entered the country between 1919 and 1921. Like the immigrants of the prewar period, the new arrivals were mainly Catholics and Jews from eastern and southern Europe. Once again, nativist prejudices of native-born Protestants were aroused. Workers feared competition for jobs. Isolationists wanted minimal contact with Europe and feared that immigrants might foment revolution. In response to public demands for restrictive legislation, Congress acted quickly. 
Quota Laws Congress passed two laws that severely limited immigration 
by setting quotas based on nationality. The first quota act of 1921 limited immigration to 3 percent of the number of foreign-born persons from a given nation counted in the 1910 Census (a maximum of 357,000). To reduce the number of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, Congress passed a second quota act in 1924 that set quotas of 2 percent based on the Census of 1890 (before the arrival of most of the “new” immigrants). Although there were quotas for all European and Asian nationalities, the law chiefly restricted those groups considered “undesirable” by the nativists. By 1927, the quotas for all Asians and eastern and southern Europeans had been limited to 150,000, with all Japanese immigrants barred. With these acts, the traditional United States policy of unlimited immigration ended.
Canadians and Latin Americans were exempt from restrictions. Almost 
500,000 Mexicans migrated legally to the Southwest during the 1920s.
Case of Sacco and Vanzetti Although liberal American artists and 
intellectuals were few in number, they loudly protested against racist and nativist prejudices. They rallied to the support of two Italian immigrants, 
508 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONNicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who in 1921 had been convicted in 
a Massachusetts court of committing robbery and murder. Liberals protested that the two men had not received a fair trial and that they had been accused, convicted, and sentenced to die simply because they were poor Italians and anarchists (who rejected all government). After six years of appeals and national and international debates over the conduct of their trial, Sacco and Vanzetti were executed in 1927.
Nearly 30,000 Klan members gathered for a rally in Chicago around 1920.
Source: Library of Congress.
Ku Klux Klan
The most extreme expression of nativism in the 1920s was the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan. Unlike the original Klan of the 1860s and 1870s, the new 
Klan founded in 1915 was as strong in the Midwest as in the South. The Klan attracted new members because of the popular silent film Birth of a Nation, 
which portrayed the KKK during Reconstruction as the heroes, and the White backlash to the race riots of 1919. The new Klan used modern advertising techniques to grow to 5 million members by 1925. It drew most of its support from lower-middle-class White Protestants in small cities and towns. This revival of the KKK directed hostility not only against African Americans but also against Catholics, Jews, foreigners, and suspected Communists.
Tactics The Klan employed various methods for terrorizing and 
intimidating anyone targeted as “un-American. ” Dressed in white hoods to disguise their identity, Klan members would burn crosses and apply vigilante justice, punishing their victims with whips, tar and feathers, and lynching. The overwhelming number of those killed were African American men. In its heyday in the early 1920s, the Klan developed strong political influence. In Indiana and Texas, its support became crucial for candidates hoping to win elections to state and local offices.
509  TOPIC 7.8    1920S: CULTURAL AND POLITICAL CONTROVERSIES  Decline At first, the majority of native-born White Americans appeared 
to tolerate the Klan because it vowed to uphold high standards of Christian 
morality and drive out bootleggers, gamblers, and adulterers. Beginning in 1923, however, investigative reports in the northern press revealed that fraud and corruption in the KKK were rife. In 1925, the leader of Indiana’s Klan, Grand Dragon David Stephenson, was convicted of murder. After that, the Klan’s influence and membership declined rapidly. Nevertheless, it and other White nationalist groups continued to exist and advocate for White supremacy into the 21st century.
Arts and Literature
Scorning religion as hypocritical and bitterly condemning the sacrifices of wartime as fraud perpetrated by money interests were two dominant themes of the leading writers of the postwar decade. This disillusionment caused the writer Gertrude Stein  to call these writers a “lost generation. ” The novels 
of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Sinclair Lewis; the poems 
of Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot; and the plays of Eugene O’Neill expressed 
disillusionment with the ideals of an earlier time and with the materialism of a business-oriented culture. Fitzgerald and O’Neill took to a life of drinking, while Eliot and Hemingway expressed their unhappiness by moving into exile in Europe.
Painters such as Edward Hopper  were inspired by the architecture of 
American cities to explore loneliness and isolation of urban life. Regional artists  such as Grant Wood  and Thomas Hart Benton celebrated the rural 
people and scenes of the heartland of America. 
Musical theater changed in the 1920s with the Broadway premiere of 
Show Boat. It proved a radical departure in musical storytelling with a serious treatment of prejudice and race. Jewish immigrants played a major role in the development of the American musical theatre during this era. For example, composer George Gershwin, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, blended 
jazz and classical music in his symphonic Rhapsody in Blue  and the folk opera 
Porgy and Bess.
Women, Family, and Education
Ratification of the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote, but it did not change either women’s lives or U.S. politics as much as reformers had hoped. Voting patterns in the election of 1920 showed that women did not vote as a bloc but usually shared the party preferences of their husbands or fathers. 
Women at Home The traditional separation of labor between men and 
women continued into the 1920s. Most middle-class women expected to spend their lives as homemakers and mothers. The introduction into the home of such labor-saving devices as the washing machine and vacuum cleaner eased but did not substantially change the daily routines of the homemaker.
510 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONWomen in the Labor Force Participation of women in the workforce 
remained about the same as before the war. Employed women usually lived in 
the cities; were limited to certain categories of jobs as clerks, nurses, teachers, and domestics; and received lower wages than men.
Revolution in Morals Probably the most significant change in the lives 
of young men and women of the 1920s was their revolt against sexual taboos. Some were influenced by the writings of the Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud , who stressed the role of sexual repression in mental illness. Others, 
who perhaps had never heard of Freud, took to premarital sex as if it were—like radio and jazz music—one of the inventions of the modern age. Movies, novels, automobiles, and new dance steps (the foxtrot and the Charleston) also encouraged greater promiscuity. The use of contraceptives for birth control was still against the law in almost every state. Even so, because of the work of Margaret Sanger  and other advocates of birth control, it achieved growing 
acceptance in the 1920s.
A special fashion that set young people apart from older generations was 
the flapper look. Influenced by movie actresses as well as their own desires for independence, young women shocked their elders by wearing dresses hemmed at the knee (instead of the ankle), “bobbing” (cutting short) their hair, smoking cigarettes, and driving cars. High school and college graduates also took office jobs until they married. Then, as married women, they were expected to abandon the flapper look, quit their jobs, and settle down as wives and mothers.
Divorce As a result of women’s suffrage, state lawmakers were now forced 
to listen to feminists, who demanded changes in the divorce laws to permit women to escape abusive and incompatible husbands. Liberalized divorce laws were one reason that one in six marriages ended in divorce by 1930—a significant increase over the one-in-eight ratio of 1920.
Education  Widespread belief in the value of education, together with 
economic prosperity, stimulated more state governments to enact compulsory school laws. Universal high school education became the new American goal. By the end of the 1920s, the proportion of high school graduates had doubled to over 25 percent of school-age young adults.
African American Cultural Renaissance
By 1930, almost 20 percent of African Americans lived in the North, as migration from the South continued. In the North, African Americans 
still faced discrimination in housing and jobs, but they found at least some improvement in their earnings and material standard of living. The largest African American community developed in the Harlem section of New Y ork City. With a population of almost 200,000 by 1930, Harlem became famous in the 1920s for its concentration of talented actors, artists, musicians, and 
511  TOPIC 7.8    1920S: CULTURAL AND POLITICAL CONTROVERSIES  writers. Because of their artistic achievements, this period is known as the 
“Harlem Renaissance. ”
Poets and Musicians The leading Harlem poets included Countee 
Cullen , Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson, and Claude McKay. 
Commenting on African American heritage, their poems expressed a range of emotions, from bitterness and resentment to joy and hope.
African American jazz musicians such as Duke Ellington and Louis 
Armstrong  were so popular among people of all races that the 1920s is often 
called the Jazz Age. Other great performers included blues singer Bessie Smith and the multitalented singer and actor Paul Robeson. While these artists sometimes performed before integrated audiences in Harlem, they often found themselves and their audiences segregated in much of the rest of the nation.
Marcus Garvey  In 1916, the United Negro Improvement Association 
(UNIA) was brought to Harlem from Jamaica by a charismatic immigrant, Marcus Garvey . Garvey advocated individual and racial pride for African 
Americans and developed political ideas of Black nationalism. Building on W . E. B. Du Bois’s pride in Black culture, Garvey established an organization for Black separatism, economic self-sufficiency, and a back-to-Africa movement. Garvey’s sale of stock in the Black Star Steamship line led to federal charges of fraud. In 1925, he was tried, convicted, and jailed. Later, he was deported to Jamaica, and his movement collapsed.
W . E. B. Du Bois and other African American leaders disagreed with 
Garvey’s back-to-Africa idea but endorsed his emphasis on racial pride and self-respect. In the 1960s, Garvey’s thinking helped to inspire a later generation to embrace the cause of Black pride and nationalism.

Through the 1920s, three Republican presidents would control the executive branch. Congress was also solidly Republican through a decade in which U.S. business boomed.
The great leader of the progressive wing of the Republican Party, Theodore 
Roosevelt, died in 1919. This loss, combined with public disillusionment over the war, allowed the return of the old-guard (conservative) Republicans. Unlike the Republicans of the Gilded Age, however, Republican leadership in the 1920s did not preach laissez-faire economics. Instead, Republicans accepted the idea of limited government regulation as an aid to stabilizing business. The regulatory commissions established in the Progressive Era were now administered by appointees who were more sympathetic to business than to the general public. The prevailing idea of the Republican Party was that the nation would benefit if business and the pursuit of profits took the lead in developing the economy.
512 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Presidency of Warren Harding
Warren Harding had been a newspaper publisher in Ohio before entering 
politics. He was handsome and well liked among the Republican political cronies with whom he regularly played poker. His abilities as a leader, however, were less than presidential. When the Republican National Convention of 1920 deadlocked, the party bosses decided “in a smoke-filled room” to deliver the nomination to Harding as a compromise choice.
A Few Good Choices Harding recognized his limitations and hoped 
to make up for them by appointing able men to his cabinet. He appointed the former presidential candidate and Supreme Court justice Charles Evans Hughes to be secretary of state, the greatly admired former mining engineer and Food Administration leader Herbert Hoover to be secretary of commerce, and the Pittsburgh industrialist and millionaire Andrew Mellon to be secretary of the treasury. When the Chief Justice’s seat on the Supreme Court became vacant, Harding filled it by appointing former President William Howard Taft.
Domestic Policy Harding did little more than sign into law the measures 
adopted by the Republican Congress. He approved (1) a reduction in the income tax, (2) an increase in tariff rates under the Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act of 1922, and (3) the establishment of the Bureau of the Budget, with procedures 
for all government expenditures to be placed in a single budget for Congress to review and vote on. 
Harding did surprise many people, particularly his conservative allies, by 
pardoning and releasing from federal prison Socialist leader Eugene Debs. Debs had been convicted of violating the Espionage Act during World War I. While imprisoned, Debs received 920,000 votes in the 1920 presidential election. Harding’s decision to pardon Debs was prompted by the president’s generous spirit.
Scandals and Death Harding’s postwar presidency was marked by 
scandals and corruption similar to those that had occurred under an earlier postwar president, Ulysses S. Grant. Having appointed some excellent officials, Harding also selected a number of incompetent and dishonest men to fill important positions, including Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall and Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty. In 1924, Congress discovered that Fall had accepted bribes for granting oil leases near Teapot Dome, Wyoming. Daugherty also took bribes for agreeing not to prosecute certain criminal suspects.
However, in August 1923, shortly before these scandals were uncovered 
publicly, Harding died of a heart attack in California after traveling to Alaska. He was never implicated in any of the scandals.
The Presidency of Calvin Coolidge
Harding’s vice president and successor, Calvin Coolidge, had won popularity in 1919 as the Massachusetts governor who broke the Boston police strike. 
513  TOPIC 7.8    1920S: CULTURAL AND POLITICAL CONTROVERSIES  He was a man of few words who richly deserved the nickname “Silent Cal. ” 
Coolidge once explained why silence was good politics. “If you don’t say anything, ” he said, “you won’t be called on to repeat it. ” Also unanswerable was the president’s sage comment “When more and more people are thrown out of work, unemployment results. ” Coolidge summarized both his presidency and his era in the phrase “The business of America is business. ”
The Election of 1924 After less than a year in office, Coolidge was the 
overwhelming choice of the Republican Party as their presidential nominee in 1924. The Democrats nominated a conservative lawyer from West Virginia, John W . Davis, and tried to make an issue of the Teapot Dome scandal. Unhappy with conservative dominance of both parties, liberals formed a new Progressive Party led by its presidential candidate, Robert La Follette of Wisconsin. Coolidge won the election easily, but the Progressive ticket did extremely well for a third party in a conservative era. La Follette received nearly 5 million votes, chiefly from discontented farmers and laborers.
Vetoes and Inaction Coolidge believed in limited government that 
stood aside while business conducted its own affairs. Little was accomplished in the White House except keeping a close watch on the budget. Cutting spending to the bone, Coolidge vetoed even the acts of the Republican majority in Congress. He would not allow bonuses for World War I veterans and vetoed a bill (the McNary-Haugen Bill of 1928) to help farmers as crop prices fell.
Hoover, Smith, and the Election of 1928
Coolidge declined to run for the presidency a second time. The Republicans therefore turned to an able leader with a spotless reputation, self-made millionaire and Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover . Hoover had served 
three presidents (Wilson, Harding, and Coolidge) in administrative roles but had never before campaigned for elective office. Nevertheless, in 1928, he was made the Republican nominee for president.
Hoover’s Democratic opponent was the governor of New Y ork, Alfred E. 
Smith. As a Roman Catholic and an opponent of Prohibition, Smith appealed to many immigrant voters in the cities. Many Protestants, however, were openly prejudiced against Smith.
Republicans boasted of “Coolidge prosperity, ” which Hoover promised 
to extend. He even suggested that poverty would soon be ended altogether. Hoover won in a landslide and even took a large number of the electoral votes in the South. In several southern states—including Texas, Florida, and Virginia—the taste of prosperity and general dislike for Smith’s religion outweighed the voters’ usual allegiance to the Democratic Party.
Hoover’s dreams to end poverty quickly proved bitterly ironic. The 
prosperity of the 1920s turned into a deep economic depression starting in the fall of 1929. Topic 7.9 explores its causes and its chilling impact on the lives of all classes of Americans.
514 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONHISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  HOW CONSERVATIVE WERE THE 1920S?
By the 1930s, the 1920s seemed to be a unique decade. It looked like a period 
of social fun and booming business wedged between the calamities of military conflict (World War I) and economic crisis (the Great Depression). 
Conservative Ideas In his popular history Only Yesterday  (1931), 
Frederick Lewis Allen gave support to the ideas of the leading social critics of the 1920s, H. L. Mencken and Sinclair Lewis. He portrayed the period as one of narrow-minded materialism in which the middle class abandoned Progressive reforms, embraced conservative Republican policies, and either supported or condoned nativism, racism, and fundamentalism. Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. generally accepted this view of the twenties, seeing it within the framework of his cyclical view of history. He argued that the politics of the decade represented a conservative reaction to the liberal reforms of the Progressive Era.
Dissenting Views Revisionist historians of the 1950s questioned whether 
the 1920s truly broke with the Progressive past. They argued that the period continued earlier protest movements such as Populism. Richard Hofstadter and other “consensus” writers distinguished between two middle classes: a new urban group with modern values and an older middle class with traditional values. William Leuchtenburg in The Perils of Prosperity (1958) portrayed the traditionalists as threatened by cultural pluralism and modern ideas.
Local Power  A third assessment took a more positive view of the 
traditionalists. Some historians, including Alan Brinkley in the 1980s, argued that people in the “old” middle class, including fundamentalists and nativists, were understandably trying to protect their own economic and social self-interests. At the same time, they were seeking to preserve individual and community freedom in face of the modernist movement toward centralized bureaucratic and national control. This effort to maintain local control and independence from big government is seen as continuing from the 1920s to the present.
Importance of Materialism Given the extreme and deeply felt differences 
between the modernists and the traditionalists, some historians have wondered why there was not more conflict in the twenties. One explanation is the importance of the consumer culture. Some historians have shown how the influence of growing materialism and prosperity caused people to accept increased corporate and bureaucratic control of their lives. Others have placed varying emphasis on the ways in which material affluence, consumer goods, advertising, and a homogeneous mass culture redefined U.S. social and political values. In one way, by focusing on materialism and consumption, historians have returned to the views of Mencken, Lewis, and Allen.

Brick and rivet and lime, 
Once I built a tower, 
Now it’s done, 
Brother, can you spare a dime?
E. Y. Harburg and Jay Gorney, “Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?” 1932
Learning Objective : Explain the causes of the Great Depression and its 
effects on the economy.
The natural rhythm of the business cycle in a free market economy includes 
periods of growth, recession, and depression that typically last only a few years. 
However, the depressions beginning in 1837, 1873, and 1893 were unusual. Each included widespread bank failures and the collapse of investment and credit systems. The result was a depression that was severe and extended several years. 
Causes of the 1929 Crash
This depression of the 1930s was even worse than the preceding ones. It lasted far longer, caused more business failures and unemployment, and affected more people—both middle class and working class—than any preceding period of hard times. This was in fact not just an ordinary depression, but the Great Depression . Before it was over, two presidents—Herbert Hoover  and 
Franklin Roosevelt—would devote 12 years to seeking the elusive path toward recovery. What caused the spectacular business boom of the 1920s to collapse dramatically in October 1929?
Wall Street Crash The ever-rising stock prices had become both a symbol 
and a source of wealth during the prosperous 1920s. A “boom” was in full force both in the United States and in the world economy in the late 1920s. On the stock exchange on Wall Street in New Y ork City, stock prices had kept going up and up for 18 months, from March 1928 to September 1929. On September 3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of major stocks had reached an all-time high of 381. An average investor who bought $1,000 worth of such stocks at the time of Hoover’s election (November 1928) would have doubled his or her money in less than a year. Millions of people did invest in the boom market of 1928—and millions lost their money in October 1929, when it collapsed.
519  TOPIC 7.9   THE GREAT DEPRESSIONBlack Thursday and Black Tuesday Although stock prices had fluctuated 
greatly for several weeks preceding the crash, the true panic did not begin until 
a Thursday in late October. On this Black Thursday—October 24, 1929—there was an unprecedented volume of selling on Wall Street, and stock prices plunged. The next day, hoping to stave off disaster by stabilizing prices, a group of bankers bought millions of dollars of stocks. The strategy worked for only one business day, Friday. The selling frenzy resumed on Monday. On Black Tuesday, October 29, the bottom fell out, as millions of panicky investors ordered their brokers to sell —but almost no buyers could be found.
Prices on Wall Street steadily decreased. By late November, the Dow Jones 
index had fallen from its September high of 381 to 198. Three years later, stock prices would finally hit bottom at 41, less than one-ninth of their peak value.
Underlying Causes of the Great Depression
While the collapse of the stock market in 1929 may have triggered economic turmoil, it alone was not responsible for the Great Depression. The depression throughout the nation and the world was the result of a combination of factors.
Uneven Distribution of Income Wages had risen little compared to the 
large increases in productivity and corporate profits. Economic success was not shared by all, as the top 5 percent of the richest Americans received over 33 percent of all income. Once demand for their products declined, businesses laid off workers, contributing to a downward spiral in demand and more layoffs.
Stock Market Speculation Many people in all economic classes believed 
that they could get rich by “playing the market. ” Instead of investing money in order to share in the earnings of a company, people were speculating that the price of a stock would go up and that they could sell it for a quick profit. Buying on margin allowed people to borrow most of the cost of the stock, making down payments as low as 10 percent. Investors depended on the price of the stock increasing so that they could repay the loan. When stock prices dropped, the market collapsed, and many lost everything they had borrowed and invested.
Excessive Use of Credit Low interest rates and a belief of both consumers 
and business that the economic boom was permanent led to increased borrowing and installment buying. This over-indebtedness would result in defaults on loans and bank failures.
Overproduction of Consumer Goods Business growth, aided by increased 
productivity and use of credit, had produced a volume of goods that workers with stagnant wages could not continue to purchase. 
Weak Farm Economy The prosperity of the 1920s never reached farmers, 
who had suffered from overproduction, high debt, and low prices since the end of World War I. As the depression continued through the 1930s, severe weather and a long drought added to farmers’ difficulties.
Government Policies During the 1920s, the government had complete 
faith in business and did little to control or regulate it. Congress enacted high tariffs that protected U.S. industries but hurt farmers and international trade. 
520 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONSome economists have concentrated blame on the Federal Reserve  for its 
tight money policies, as hundreds of banks failed. Instead of trying to stabilize 
banks, the money supply, and prices, the Federal Reserve tried to preserve the gold standard. Without depositors’ insurance, people panicked and sought to get their money out of the banks, which caused more bank failures.
Global Economic Problems Nations had become more interdependent 
because of international banking, manufacturing, and trade. Europe had never recovered from World War I, but the United States failed to recognize Europe’s postwar problems. Instead, U.S. insistence on loan repayment in full and high tariff policies weakened Europe and contributed to the worldwide depression.
Effects of the Great Depression
The pervasive impact of the Great Depression is evident in several statistics:
• The U.S. gross national product—the value of all the goods and services produced by the nation in one year—dropped from $104 billion to $56 billion in just four years (1929 to 1932).
• The nation’s income declined by over 50 percent. 
• Approximately 20 percent of all banks closed, wiping out 10 million savings accounts. 
• The money supply contracted by 30 percent. 
• By 1933, the number of unemployed had reached 13 million people, or 25 percent of the workforce, not including farmers.

521  TOPIC 7.9   THE GREAT DEPRESSIONSocial Effects The social effects of the depression were felt by all classes. 
Those who had never fully shared in the prosperity of the 1920s, such as 
farmers and African Americans, had increased difficulties. Poverty and homelessness increased, as did the stress on families, as people searched for work. People continued to move from rural to urban areas, hoping that jobs would be more plentiful in cities. Mortgage foreclosures and evictions became commonplace. The homeless traveled in box cars and lived in shantytowns, named “Hoovervilles, ” in mock honor of their president.
President Hoover’s Policies
At the time of the stock market crash, nobody could foresee how long the downward slide would last. President Hoover was wrong—but hardly alone—in thinking that prosperity would soon return. The president believed the nation could get through the difficult times if the people took his advice about exercising voluntary action and restraint. Hoover urged businesses not to cut wages, unions not to strike, and private charities to increase their efforts for the needy and the jobless. Until the summer of 1930, he hesitated to ask Congress for legislative action on the economy, afraid that government assistance to individuals would destroy their self-reliance. 
Gradually, President Hoover came to recognize the need for more direct 
government action. However, he took the traditional view that public relief should come from state and local governments, not the federal government.
Responding to a Worldwide Depression
Repercussions from the crash on Wall Street were soon felt in the financial centers of Europe. Through trade and the Dawes Plan for the repayment of war debts, European prosperity was closely tied to that of the United States. Hoover’s first major decision concerning the international situation was one of the worst mistakes of his presidency.
Hawley-Smoot Tariff (1930) In June 1930, the president signed into law a 
schedule of tariff rates that was the highest in history. The Hawley-Smoot Tariff (or Smoot-Hawley Tariff) passed by the Republican Congress set tax increases ranging from 31 percent to 49 percent on foreign imports. In retaliation for the U.S. tariff, European countries enacted higher tariffs of their own against U.S. goods. International trade was already declining because economic activity was slowing down in most countries, and the higher tariffs made the decline even sharper. Economies around the world sank further into depression.
Debt Moratorium By 1931, conditions became so bad both in Europe 
and the United States that the Dawes Plan for collecting war debts could no longer continue. Hoover therefore proposed a moratorium (suspension) on the payment of international debts. Britain and Germany readily accepted, but France balked. The international economy suffered from massive loan defaults, and banks on both sides of the Atlantic scrambled to meet the demands of the many depositors withdrawing their money. 
522 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONDomestic Programs: Too Little, Too Late
By 1931, Hoover was convinced that some federal action was needed to pull the 
U.S. economy out of its doldrums. He therefore supported and signed into law programs that offered assistance to indebted farmers and struggling businesses.
Federal Farm Board  The Farm Board  was actually created in 1929, before 
the stock market crash, but its powers were later enlarged to meet the economic crisis. The board was authorized to help farmers stabilize prices by temporarily holding surplus grain and cotton in storage. The program, however, was far too modest to handle the continued overproduction of farm goods.
Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) This federally funded, 
government-owned corporation was created by Congress early in 1932 as a measure for propping up faltering railroads, banks, life insurance companies, and other financial institutions. It marked an attempt by the federal government to become more active in financial markets. The president reasoned that emergency loans from the RFC would help to stabilize these key businesses. The benefits would then “trickle down” to smaller businesses and ultimately bring recovery. Democrats scoffed at this measure, saying it would help only the rich.
Despair and Protest
By 1932, millions of unemployed workers and impoverished farmers were bordering on desperation. Some decided to take direct action to battle the forces that seemed to be crushing them.
Unrest on the Farms In many communities, farmers banded together 
to stop banks from foreclosing on farms and evicting people from their homes. Farmers in the Midwest formed the Farm Holiday Association, which attempted to reverse the drop in prices by stopping the entire 1932 grain crop from reaching the market. The effort collapsed after some violence.
Bonus March  Also in the desperate summer of 1932, a thousand 
unemployed World War I veterans marched to Washington, D.C., to demand immediate payment of the bonuses promised them at a later date (1945). They were eventually joined by thousands of other veterans who brought their wives and children and camped in improvised shacks near the Capitol. Congress failed to pass the bonus bill they sought. After two veterans were killed in a clash with police, General Douglas MacArthur, the army’s chief of staff, used tanks and tear gas to destroy the shantytown and drive the veterans from Washington. The incident caused many Americans to regard Hoover as heartless and uncaring.
Changing Directions
In retrospect, the economic decline reached bottom in the winter of 1932–1933, although full recovery occurred only with the beginning of another world war, in 1939. The enduring crisis of the Great Depression had long-term influence

Topic 7.10
The New Deal
Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is  
fear itself—namely, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses 
needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, First Inaugural Address, March 1933 
Learning Objective : Explain how the Great Depression and the New 
Deal impacted American political, social, and economic life over time.
W hen the new Democratic president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, said in his 1933 
inaugural address, “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself, ” he struck a 
note that the millions who listened to him on the radio could well understand. In 1933, after having experienced nearly four years of the worst economic depression in U.S. history, Americans were gripped by fear for their survival.
The Election of 1932
The depression’s worst year, 1932, happened to be a presidential election year. The disheartened Republicans renominated Hoover, who warned that a Democratic victory would only result in worse economic problems.
Democrats At their convention, the Democrats nominated New Y ork 
Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt for president and Speaker of the House John 
Nance Garner of Texas for vice president. As a candidate, Roosevelt pledged a “new deal” for the American people, the repeal of Prohibition, aid for the unemployed, and cuts in government spending.
Results In voters’ minds, the only real issue was the depression, and 
whether Hoover or Roosevelt could do a better job of ending the hard times. Almost 60 percent of them concluded that it was time for a change. The Roosevelt-Garner ticket carried all but six states, Republican strongholds in the Northeast. Desperate for change, many Socialists deserted their candidate, Norman Thomas, to support Roosevelt. Not only was the new president a Democrat but both houses of Congress had large Democratic majorities.
Hoover as “Lame-Duck” President For the four months between 
Roosevelt’s election and his inauguration in March 1933, Hoover was still president. However, he was a “lame duck, ” a person holding a position during the period when a successor had been elected but not yet taken office. Hoover was powerless to cope with the depression, which continued to get worse. He 
526 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONoffered to work with the president-elect through the long period, but Roosevelt 
declined, not wanting to be tied to any of the Republican president’s ideas. The 20th Amendment (known as the lame-duck amendment), passed in February 1933 and ratified by October 1933, shortened the period between presidential election and inauguration. The amendment set the start of each president’s term for January 20.
Franklin D. Roosevelt as President
The new president was a distant cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt and was married to Theodore’s niece, Eleanor. More than any other president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt—popularly known by his initials, FDR—expanded the size of the federal government, altered its scope of operations, and greatly enlarged presidential powers. He would dominate the nation and the government for an unprecedented stretch of time, 12 years and two months. FDR became one of the most influential world leaders of the 20th century.
FDR: The Man 
Franklin Roosevelt was the only child of a wealthy New Y ork family. He personally admired cousin Theodore and followed in his footsteps as a New Y ork state legislator and then as U.S. assistant secretary of the navy. Unlike Republican Theodore, however, Franklin was a Democrat. In 1920, he was the Democratic nominee for vice president. He and James Cox, the presidential candidate, lost badly in Warren G. Harding’s landslide victory.
Disability In the midst of a promising career, Roosevelt was paralyzed by 
polio in 1921. Although he was wealthy enough to retire, he labored instead to resume his career in politics and eventually regained the full power of his upper body, even though he could never again walk unaided and required the assistance of crutches, braces, and a wheelchair. Roosevelt’s greatest strengths were his warm personality, his gifts as a speaker, and his ability to work with and inspire people. In 1928, campaigning from a car and in a wheelchair, FDR was elected governor of New Y ork. In this office, he instituted a number of welfare and relief programs to help the jobless.
Eleanor Roosevelt Roosevelt’s wife, Eleanor, emerged as a leader in her 
own right. She became the most active first lady in history, writing a newspaper column, giving speeches, and traveling the country. Though their personal relationship was strained, Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt had a strong mutual respect. She served as the president’s social conscience and influenced him to support minorities and the less fortunate.
The New Deal Philosophy
In his campaign for president in 1932, Roosevelt offered vague promises but no concrete programs. He did not have a detailed plan for ending the depression, but he was committed to action and willing to experiment with political solutions to economic problems.
527  TOPIC 7.10   THE NEW DEALThe Three R’s In his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention 
in 1932, Roosevelt had said: “I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for 
the American people. ” He had further promised in his campaign to help the “forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid. ” During the early years of his presidency, it became clear that his New Deal  programs were to serve 
three R’s: relief  for people out of work, recovery  for business and the economy 
as a whole, and reform  of American economic institutions.
Brain Trust and Other Advisers In giving shape to his New Deal, 
President Roosevelt relied on a group of advisers who had assisted him while he was governor of New Y ork. Louis Howe was to be his chief political adviser. For advice on economic matters, Roosevelt turned to a group of university professors, known as the Brain Trust.
The people that Roosevelt appointed to high administrative positions were 
the most diverse in U.S. history to that time, with a record number of African Americans, Catholics, Jews, and women. For example, his secretary of labor was Frances Perkins, the first woman ever to serve in a president’s cabinet.
The First Hundred Days
With the nation desperate and close to the brink of panic, the Democratic Congress looked to the new president for leadership, which Roosevelt was eager to provide. Immediately after being sworn into office on March 4, 1933, Roosevelt called Congress into a hundred-day-long special session. During this brief period, Congress passed into law every request of President Roosevelt, enacting more major legislation than any single Congress in history. Most of the new laws and agencies were commonly referred to by their initials: WPA, AAA, CCC, NRA.
Bank Holiday In early 1933, banks were failing at a frightening rate, as 
depositors flocked to withdraw funds. As many banks failed in 1933 (over 5,000) as had failed in all the previous years of the depression. To restore confidence in those banks that were still solvent, the president ordered the banks closed for a bank holiday on March 6, 1933. He went on the radio to explain that the banks would be reopened after allowing enough time for the government to reorganize them on a sound basis. Congress passed the Emergency Banking Act on March 9, and the banks reopened on March 13.
Repeal of Prohibition  The new president kept a campaign promise to 
repeal Prohibition. He first had Congress pass the Beer-Wine Revenue Act, which legalized the sale of beer and wine, as a means of raising needed tax money. Later in 1933, the ratification of the 21st Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment, bringing Prohibition to an end.
Fireside Chats Roosevelt went on the radio on March 12, 1933, to present 
the first of many fireside chats to the American people. The president assured his listeners that the banks which reopened after the bank holiday were safe. The public responded as hoped, and the money deposited in the reopened banks exceeded the money withdrawn.
528 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONRelief for the Unemployed A number of programs created during the 
Hundred Days addressed the needs of the millions of unemployed workers. 
These plans created jobs with government stimulus dollars to provide both relief and to create more demand for goods and services. Roosevelt hoped that this would create more jobs in the private sector.
• The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) offered outright grants of federal money to states and local governments that were operating soup kitchens and other forms of relief for the jobless and homeless. The director of FERA was Harry Hopkins, one of the president’s closest friends and advisers.
• The Public Works Administration (PW A), directed by Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, allotted money to state and local governments for building roads, bridges, dams, and other public works. Such construction projects were a source of thousands of jobs.
• The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) employed young men on projects on federal lands and paid their families small monthly sums.
• The Tennessee Valley Authority (TV A) was a huge experiment 
in regional development and public planning. As a government corporation, it hired thousands of people in one of the nation’s poorest regions, the Tennessee Valley, to build dams, operate electric power plants, control flooding and erosion, and manufacture fertilizer. The TV A sold electricity to residents of the region at rates well below those previously charged by a private power company.
Financial Recovery and Reform Programs As the financial part of his 
New Deal, FDR persuaded Congress to enact the following measures:
• The Emergency Banking Relief Act authorized the government to examine the finances of banks closed during the bank holiday and reopen those judged to be sound.
• The Glass-Steagall Act increased regulation of the banks and limited how banks could invest customers’ money. 
• The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) guaranteed individual bank deposits. 
• The gold standard was restricted to international transactions, and Americans could no longer exchange their dollars for gold.
• The Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) provided refinancing of small homes to prevent foreclosures.
• The Farm Credit Administration provided low-interest loans and mortgages to prevent foreclosures on the property of farmers.
Industrial Recovery Program The key measure in 1933 to combine 
immediate relief and long-term reform was the National Recovery 
529  TOPIC 7.10   THE NEW DEALAdministration (NRA). Directed by Hugh Johnson, the NRA was an attempt 
to guarantee reasonable profits for business and fair wages and hours for labor. With the antitrust laws temporarily suspended, the NRA could help each industry (such as steel, oil, and paper) set codes for wages, hours of work, levels of production, and prices of finished goods. The law creating the NRA also gave workers the right to organize and bargain collectively. The complex program operated with limited success for two years before the Supreme Court declared the NRA unconstitutional (Schechter v. U.S.) in 1935.
Farm Production Control Program  Farmers were offered a program 
similar in concept to what the NRA did for industry. The Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) encouraged farmers to reduce production (and thereby boost prices) by offering to pay government subsidies for every acre they plowed under. The AAA met the same fate as the NRA. It was declared unconstitutional in a 1935 Supreme Court decision.
Other Programs of the First New Deal
Congress adjourned briefly after its extraordinary legislative record in the first Hundred Days of the New Deal. Roosevelt, however, was not finished devising new remedies for the nation’s ills. In late 1933 and through much of 1934, the Democratic Congress was easily persuaded to enact the following:
• The Civil Works Administration (CW A) was added to the PW A and other programs for creating jobs. This agency hired laborers for temporary construction projects sponsored by the federal government.
• The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was created to regulate the stock market and to place strict limits on the kind of speculative practices that had led to the Wall Street crash in 1929. The SEC also required full audits of, and financial disclosure by, corporations to protect investors from fraud and insider trading.
• The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) gave both the building industry and homeowners a boost by insuring bank loans for building, repairing, and purchasing houses. It provided many families their first chance to buy a home and build wealth that they could pass on to their children. However, the FHA used “redlining” to define neighborhoods where African Americans lived, and did not make loans in those areas. Nearly all FHA loans made during the first thirty years of the program went to White applicants.
• A new law took the United States off the gold standard in an effort to halt deflation (falling prices). The value of the dollar was set at $35 per ounce of gold, but paper dollars were no longer redeemable in gold.
The Second New Deal
Roosevelt’s first two years in office were largely focused on achieving one of the three R’s: recovery. Democratic victories in the congressional elections of 1934 
530 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONgave the president the popular mandate he needed to seek another round of 
laws and programs. In the summer of 1935, he launched the second New Deal, which concentrated on the other two R’s: relief and reform. Harry Hopkins became even more prominent in Roosevelt’s administration with the creation in 1935 of a new and larger relief agency. 
Works Progress Administration (WP A) Much bigger than the relief 
agencies of the first New Deal, the WPA spent billions of dollars between 1935 and 1940 to provide people with jobs. After its first year of operation under Hopkins, it employed 3.4 million men and women who had formerly been on the relief rolls of state and local governments. It paid them double the relief rate but less than the going wage for regular workers. Most WPA workers were put to work constructing new bridges, roads, airports, and public buildings. Unemployed artists, writers, actors, and photographers were paid by the WPA to paint murals, write histories, and perform in plays.
One part of the WPA, the National Y outh Administration (NYA), provided 
part-time jobs to help young people stay in high school and college or until they could get a job with a private employer.
Resettlement Administration (RA) Placed under the direction of one of 
the Brain Trust, Rexford Tugwell, the Resettlement Administration provided loans to sharecroppers, tenants, and small farmers. It also established federal camps where migrant workers could find decent housing.

Reforms The reform legislation of the second New Deal reflected 
Roosevelt’s belief that industrial workers and farmers needed to receive more government help than members of the business and privileged classes.
National Labor Relations (Wagner) Act (1935) This major labor law of 
1935 replaced the labor provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act, after that law was declared unconstitutional. The Wagner Act guaranteed a worker’s right to join a union and a union’s right to bargain collectively. It also outlawed business practices that were unfair to labor. A new agency, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), was empowered to enforce the law and make sure that workers’ rights were protected.
531  TOPIC 7.10   THE NEW DEALRural Electrification Administration (REA) This new agency provided 
loans for electrical cooperatives to supply power in rural areas.
Federal Taxes A revenue act of 1935 sharply increased the tax on incomes 
of the wealthy few. It also increased the tax on large gifts from parent to child 
and on capital gains (profits from the sale of stocks or other properties).
The Social Security Act
The reform that, for generations afterward, would affect the lives of nearly all Americans was the passage in 1935 of the Social Security Act. It created a federal insurance program based upon the automatic collection of payments from employees and employers throughout people’s working careers. The Social Security trust fund would then be used to make monthly payments to retired persons over the age of 65. Also receiving benefits under this law were workers who lost their jobs (unemployment compensation), persons who were blind or otherwise disabled, and dependent children and their mothers.
Evaluating Roosevelt’s First Term
In response to public demands for government action, the New Deal transformed  the role of the federal government. Since the days of Alexander Hamilton, and under presidents as different as Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson, the federal government often intervened in the economy to promote growth. In addition, though, the government under Roosevelt created a limited welfare state , a government that regulated economic activity and aided the poor 
and unemployed in order to provide economic security for everyone. This view of government became the basis for modern American liberalism.
The Election of 1936
The economy was improving but was still weak and unstable in 1936 when the Democrats nominated Roosevelt for a second term. Because of his New Deal programs and active style of personal leadership, the president had become enormously popular among workers and small farmers. Business, however, generally disliked and even hated him because of his regulatory programs and pro-union measures such as the Wagner Act.
Alf Landon Challenging Roosevelt was the Republican nominee for 
president, Alfred (Alf) Landon, the progressive-minded governor of Kansas. Landon criticized the Democrats for spending too much money but in general accepted most of the New Deal legislation.
Political Realignment and the New Deal Coalition Roosevelt 
swamped Landon, winning every state except Maine and Vermont and more than 60 percent of the popular vote. Behind their president’s New Deal, the Democratic Party could now count on the votes of a new coalition of popular support. Through the 1930s and into the 1960s, the Democratic or New Deal coalition would consist of the Solid South, White ethnic 
532 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONgroups in the cities, Midwestern farmers, labor unions, and liberals. In 
addition, new support for the Democrats came from African Americans, mainly in northern cities, who left the Republican Party of Lincoln because of Roosevelt’s New Deal.
Opponents of the New Deal
Opinion polls and election results showed that a large majority of Americans supported Roosevelt. Nevertheless, his New Deal programs were extremely controversial and became the target of vitriolic attacks by liberals, conservatives, and demagogues.
Critics from the Left Socialists, some unions, and more liberal members 
of the Democratic Party criticized the New Deal (especially the first New Deal of 1933–1934) for doing too much for business and too little for the unemployed and the working poor. They charged that the president failed to address the problems of ethnic minorities, women, and the elderly. The more radical of these critics charged that the New Deal was a way to save capitalism from a revolution. Roosevelt agreed with this view, although he did not consider it a criticism. He wanted to reform the system, not replace it.
Critics from the Right More numerous were conservatives in Congress 
and on the Supreme Court. Many Republicans and some Democrats attacked the New Deal for giving the federal government too much power. These critics charged that relief programs such as the WPA and labor laws such as the Wagner Act bordered on socialism or even communism. Business leaders were alarmed by (1) increased regulations, (2) the second New Deal’s pro-union stance, and (3) the financing of government programs by means of borrowed money—a practice known as deficit financing. 
Conservative Democrats, including former presidential candidates Alfred 
E. (Al) Smith and John W . Davis, joined with leading Republicans in 1934 to form an anti-New Deal organization called the American Liberty League. Its avowed purpose was to stop the New Deal from “subverting” the U.S. economic and political system.
Demagogues
Several critics played upon the American people’s desperate need for immediate solutions to their problems. Using the radio to reach a mass audience, they proposed simplistic schemes for ending “evil conspiracies” (Father Coughlin), guaranteeing economic security for the elderly (Dr. Townsend), and redistributing wealth (Huey Long).
Father Charles E. Coughlin This Catholic priest attracted a huge popular 
following in the early 1930s through his weekly radio broadcasts. Father Coughlin founded the National Union for Social Justice, which called for issuing an inflated currency and nationalizing all banks. His attacks on the New Deal became increasingly anti-Semitic and fascist until his superiors in the Catholic Church ordered him to stop his broadcasts.
533  TOPIC 7.10   THE NEW DEALDr. Francis E. Townsend Before the passage of the Social Security Act, 
a retired physician from Long Beach, California, became an instant hero to 
millions of senior citizens by proposing a simple plan for guaranteeing a secure income. Dr. Francis E. Townsend proposed that a 2 percent federal sales tax be used to create a special fund, from which every retired person over 60 years old would receive $200 a month. By spending their money promptly, Townsend argued, recipients would stimulate the economy and soon bring the depression to an end. The popularity of the Townsend Plan persuaded Roosevelt to substitute a more moderate plan of his own, which became the Social Security system.
Huey Long  From Roosevelt’s point of view, the most dangerous of the 
depression demagogues was the “Kingfish” from Louisiana, Senator Huey Long. Immensely popular in his own state, Long became a prominent national figure by proposing a “Share Our Wealth” program that promised a minimum annual income of $5,000 for every American family, to be paid for by taxing the wealthy. In 1935, Huey Long challenged Roosevelt’s leadership of the Democratic Party by announcing his candidacy for president. Both his candidacy and his populist appeal were abruptly ended when he was assassinated by a local political rival.
The Supreme Court
Of all the challenges to Roosevelt’s leadership in his first term in office, the conservative decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court proved the most frustrating. In two cases in 1935, the Supreme Court effectively killed both the NRA for business recovery and the AAA for agricultural recovery by deciding that the laws creating them were unconstitutional. Roosevelt interpreted his landslide reelection in 1936 as a mandate to end the obstacles posed by the Court.
Court Reorganization Plan President Roosevelt did not have an 
opportunity to appoint any justices to the Supreme Court during his first term. He hoped to remove the Court as an obstacle to the New Deal by proposing a judicial-reorganization bill in 1937. It proposed that the president be authorized to appoint to the Supreme Court an additional justice for each current justice who was older than a certain age (70 ½ years). In effect, the bill would have allowed Roosevelt to add up to six more justices to the Court—all of them presumably of liberal persuasion. Critics called it a “Court-packing” bill.
Reaction  Republicans and many Democrats were outraged by what 
they saw as an attempt to tamper with the system of checks and balances. They accused the president of wanting to give himself the powers of a dictator. Roosevelt did not back down—and neither did the congressional opposition. For the first time in Roosevelt’s presidency, a major bill that he proposed went down to decisive defeat by a defiant Congress. Even a majority of Democratic senators refused to support him on this controversial measure.
534 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONAftermath Ironically, while Roosevelt was fighting to “pack” the Court, 
the justices were already backing off their former resistance to his program. 
In 1937, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of several major New Deal laws, including the Wagner (Labor) Act and the Social Security Act. Also, as it happened, several justices retired during Roosevelt’s second term, enabling him to appoint new justices who were more sympathetic to his reforms.
Labor Unions and Workers’ Rights
Two New Deal measures—the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 and the Wagner Act of 1935—caused a lasting change in labor-management relations by legalizing labor unions. Union membership, which had slumped badly under the hostile policies of the 1920s, shot upward. It went from less than 3 million in the early 1930s to over 10 million (more than one out of four nonfarm workers) by 1941.
Formation of the CIO. As unions grew in size, so did tensions among 
them. The many different unions that made up the American Federation of Labor (AFL) were dominated by skilled White male workers and were organized according to crafts. A group of unions within the AFL wanted union membership to be extended to all workers in an industry regardless of their race and sex, including those who were unskilled. In 1935, the industrial unions, as they were called, joined together as the Committee of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Their leader was John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers union. In 1936, the AFL suspended the CIO unions. Renamed the Congress  of Industrial Organizations, the CIO. broke away from the AFL 
and became its chief rival. It concentrated on organizing unskilled workers in the automobile, steel, and southern textile industries.
Automobile Strikes Even though collective bargaining was now 
protected by federal law, many companies still resisted union demands. Strikes were therefore a frequent occurrence in the depression decade. At the huge General Motors plant in Flint, Michigan, in 1937, the workers insisted on their right to join a union by participating in a sit-down strike (literally sitting down at the assembly line and refusing to work or even leave the factory). Neither the president nor Michigan’s governor agreed to the company’s request to intervene with troops. Finally, the company yielded to striker demands by recognizing the United Auto Workers union (UAW). Union organizers at the Ford plant in Michigan, however, were beaten and driven away.
Steel Strikes In the steel industry, the giant U.S. Steel Corporation voluntarily 
recognized one of the CIO unions, but smaller companies resisted. On Memorial Day, 1937, a demonstration by union picketers at Republic Steel in Chicago ended in four deaths, as the police fired into the crowd. However, eventually almost all the smaller steel companies agreed to deal with the CIO by 1941.
535  TOPIC 7.10   THE NEW DEAL

not be replced by strike-breakers.

Fair Labor Standards Act
A final political victory for organized labor in the 1930s was also the last major 
reform of the New Deal. In 1938, Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established several regulations on businesses in interstate commerce:
• A minimum wage, initially fixed at 40 cents an hour
• A maximum standard workweek of 40 hours, with extra pay (“time-and-a-half ”) for overtime
• Child labor restrictions on hiring people under 16 years old
Previously, the Supreme Court had declared unconstitutional a 1916 law 
prohibiting child labor. However, in the 1941 case of United States v. Darby Lumber Co., the Supreme Court reversed its earlier ruling, upholding the child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Passage of this act was not only the last but also the only major reform of Roosevelt’s second term. The New Deal lost momentum in the late 1930s for both economic and political reasons.
Recession, 1937–1938 
From 1933 to 1937 (Roosevelt’s first term), the economy showed signs of gradually pulling out of its nosedive. Banks were stabilizing, business earnings were increasing, and unemployment, though still high at 15 percent, had declined from the 25 percent figure in 1933. In the winter of 1937, however, the economy once again had a backward slide and entered into a recessionary period.
536 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONCauses Government policy was at least partly to blame. The new Social 
Security tax reduced consumer spending at the same time that Roosevelt was 
curtailing expenditures for relief and public works. In reducing spending for relief, the president hoped to balance the budget and reduce the national debt.
Keynesian Economics The writings of the British economist John 
Maynard Keynes taught Roosevelt that he had made a mistake in attempting to balance the budget. According to Keynesian theory, deficit spending was helpful in difficult times because the government needed to spend well above its tax revenues in order to initiate economic growth. Deficit spending “primed the pump” to increase investment and create jobs. Roosevelt’s economic advisers adopted this theory in 1938 with positive results. As federal spending on public works and relief went up, so too did employment and industrial production.
Weakened New Deal Although the economy improved, there was no 
boom, and problems remained. After the Court-packing fight of 1937, the people and Congress no longer automatically followed FDR, and the 1938 elections brought a reduced Democratic majority in Congress. A coalition  of 
Republicans and conservative Democrats blocked further New Deal reform legislation. Also, beginning in 1938, fears about the aggressive acts of Nazi Germany diverted attention from domestic concerns toward foreign affairs.
Life During the Depression
Millions of people who lived through the Great Depression and the hard times of the 1930s never got over it. They developed a “depression mentality”—an attitude of insecurity and economic concern that would always remain, even in times of prosperity.
Dust Bowl Farmers As if farmers did not already have enough problems, 
a severe drought  in the early 1930s ruined crops in the Great Plains. This 
region became a dust bowl , as poor farming practices coupled with high winds 
blew away millions of tons of dried topsoil. With their farms turned to dust, and their health often compromised, thousands of “Okies”  from Oklahoma 
and surrounding states migrated westward to California in search of farm or factory work that often could not be found. The novelist John Steinbeck wrote about their hardships in his classic study of economic heartbreak, The Grapes of Wrath  (1939).
In response to one of the worst ecological disasters in American history, the 
federal government created the Soil Conservation Service in 1935. It taught the plains farmers who remained on their land to rotate crops, terrace fields, use contour plowing, and plant trees to stop soil erosion and conserve water. With the help of federal subsidies, the region recovered, but environmental issues remained.
Women  The Great Depression increased pressures on many families in 
which an unemployed father searched for work while the mother struggled to feed and clothe the children on a reduced income. To supplement the family income, more women sought work, and their percentage of the total labor force 
537  TOPIC 7.10   THE NEW DEALincreased. Critics accused women of taking jobs from men. However, women 
did not get factory jobs, and most men did not seek the types of jobs available to women. Even with Eleanor Roosevelt championing women’s equality, many New Deal programs allowed women to receive lower pay than men.
African Americans Racial discrimination continued in the 1930s with 
devastating effects on African Americans, who were the last hired, first fired. Their unemployment rate was higher than the national average. Black sharecroppers were forced off the land in the South because of cutbacks in farm production. Often, despite their extreme poverty, jobless African Americans were excluded from state and local relief programs. Hard times increased racial tensions, particularly in the South where lynchings continued, though less frequently than in the 1890s. Civil rights leaders could get little support from President Roosevelt, who feared the loss of White southern Democratic votes.
Some New Deal programs, such as the WPA and the CCC did provide low-
paying jobs for African Americans, though these jobs were often segregated. African Americans also received moral support from Eleanor Roosevelt and Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes in a famous incident in 1939. The distinguished African American singer Marian Anderson had been refused the use of Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., by the all-White Daughters of the American Revolution. Eleanor Roosevelt and Ickes promptly arranged for Anderson to give a special concert at the Lincoln Memorial.
Over one hundred African Americans were appointed to middle-level 
positions in federal departments by President Roosevelt. One of them, Mary McLeod Bethune, had been a longtime leader of efforts for improving education and economic opportunities for women. Invited to Washington to direct a division of the National Y outh Administration, she established the Federal Council on Negro Affairs for the purpose of increasing African American involvement in the New Deal.
An executive order in 1941 set up a Fair Employment Practices Committee 
to assist minorities in gaining jobs in defense industries. President Roosevelt took this action only after A. Philip Randolph, head of the Railroad Porters Union, threatened a march on Washington to demand equal job opportunities for African Americans.
American Indians John Collier, a long-time advocate of American Indian 
rights, was appointed commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1933. He established conservation and CCC projects on reservations and gained American Indian involvement in the WPA and other New Deal programs.
In 1934, the Indian Reorganization (Wheeler-Howard) Act dramatically 
changed federal policies toward Native Americans. Congress first repealed the Dawes Act of 1887, which had encouraged American Indians to be independent farmers, and replaced it with a new act that returned former reservation lands to the control of tribes. The act also encouraged tribal organization and supported preservation of Native American cultures. Despite this major reform, critics later accused the New Deal of being paternalistic and withholding control from American Indians.
538 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONMexican Americans In California and the Southwest, Mexican Americans 
had been an important source of agricultural labor in the 1920s. In response to 
difficult working conditions, many attempted to form unions to improve their situation. However, during the depression, high unemployment and drought in the Plains and the Midwest caused a dramatic growth in White migrant workers who pushed west in search of work. These White migrants made it easy for growers to replace their Mexican American workers.
In addition, President Hoover’s administration, with the strong support 
of state and local governments, increased border patrols and began mass deportations of Mexican Americans. These repatriation efforts reflected the desire of many Americans for jobs to go to White workers, a sign of the long-standing prejudice against people of Mexican ancestry. The government forced at least 400,000 people, including many naturalized and native-born U.S. citizens, to move to Mexico in the 1930s

Questions 1–3 refer to the following excerpt.
“Illumined by the stern-lantern of history, the New Deal can be seen 
to have left in place a set of institutional arrangement that constituted a more coherent pattern than is dreamt of in many philosophies. That pattern can be summarized in a single word: security—security for vulnerable individuals, to be sure, as Roosevelt famously urged in his campaign for the Social Security Act of 1935, but security for capitalists and consumers, for workers and builders as well. Job-security, life-cycle security, financial security, market security—however it might be defined, achieving security was the leitmotif of virtually everything the New Deal attempted. ”
David M. Kennedy, historian, Freedom From Fear,  1999
1. Which of the following groups would most likely oppose the philosophy of the New Deal as explained in this excerpt?
(A) Economists who wanted unregulated markets and balanced budgets 
(B) Social scientists who wanted to use data to support a public policy
(C) Critics who wanted the New Deal to go farther to address poverty 
and inequality
(D) Consumers who wanted greater confidence in the banking system and the stock markets
2. Which of the following New Deal policies most directly addressed

1. “When the New Deal was over, capitalism remained intact. The rich still 
controlled the nation’s wealth, as well as its laws, courts, police, newspapers, churches, colleges. Enough help had been given to enough people to make Roosevelt a hero to millions, but the same system that had brought depression and crisis—the system of waste, of inequality, of concern for profit over human need—remained. ”

Topic 7.11
Interwar Foreign Policy
Only one thing holds this country from war today; that is the 
rising opposition of the American people. Our system of democracy . . . 
 is on test today as it has been never before.
Charles Lindbergh, Des Moines, Iowa, September 1, 1941
Learning Objective : Explain the similarities and differences in attitudes 
about the nation’s proper role in the world.
During the 1920s and 1930s, widespread disillusionment with World War I, 
Europe’s postwar problems, and communism in the Soviet Union (as Russia 
was renamed) made Americans fearful of being pulled into another European conflict. Hence, Congress refused to join the League of Nations, marking a retreat into a type of isolationism. However, the country did not return to the policies of the Gilded Age. Instead, the United States followed a policy of unilateralism, in which the United States often acted on its own through military interventions, private investment overseas, and occasionally signing a treaty. Ultimately, though, the efforts to remain out of another world war failed. 
Post-World War I Agreements
The Republican presidents of the 1920s tried to promote peace and also scale back expenditures on defense by arranging treaties of disarmament. The most successful disarmament conference—and the greatest achievement of Harding’s presidency—was held in Washington, D.C., in 1921.
Washington Conference (1921) Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes 
initiated talks on naval disarmament, hoping to stabilize the size of the U.S. Navy relative to that of other powers and to resolve conflicts in the Pacific. Representatives to the Washington Conference came from Belgium, China, 
France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Three agreements to relieve tensions resulted from the discussions:
• Five-Power Treaty  Nations with the five largest navies agreed to 
maintain the following ratio with respect to their largest warships, or battleships: the United States, 5; Great Britain, 5; Japan, 3; France, 1.67; Italy, 1.67. Britain and the United States also agreed not to fortify their possessions in the Pacific, while no limit was placed on the Japanese.
• Four-Power Treaty  The United States, France, Great Britain, and Japan 
agreed to respect one another’s territory in the Pacific.
542 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION• Nine-Power Treaty All nine nations represented at the conference 
agreed to respect the Open Door policy by guaranteeing the territorial 
integrity of China.
Kellogg-Briand Pact American women took the lead in a peace movement 
committed to outlawing future wars. (For her efforts on behalf of peace, Jane Addams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.) The movement achieved its greatest success in 1928 with the signing of a treaty arranged by U.S. Secretary of State Frank Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand. Almost all the nations of the world signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which renounced the aggressive use of force to achieve national ends. This international agreement would prove ineffective, however, since it (1) permitted defensive wars and (2) failed to provide for taking action against violators of the agreement.
Business and Diplomacy
Republican presidents believed that pro-business policies brought prosperity at home and at the same time strengthened U.S. dealings with other nations. Thus, they found it natural to use diplomacy to advance American business interests in Latin America and other regions.
Latin America Mexico’s constitution of 1917 mandated government 
ownership of all that nation’s mineral and oil resources. U.S. investors in Mexico feared that the government might confiscate their properties. A peaceful resolution protecting their interests was negotiated by Coolidge’s ambassador to Mexico, Dwight Morrow, in 1927.
Elsewhere in Latin America, Coolidge kept U.S. troops in Nicaragua 
and Haiti but withdrew them from the Dominican Republic in 1924. While American military influence declined, American economic impact increased. U.S. investments in Latin America doubled between 1919 and 1929.
Middle East The oil reserves in the Middle East were becoming recognized 
as a major source of potential wealth. British oil companies had a large head start in the region, but Secretary of State Hughes succeeded in winning oil-drilling rights for U.S. companies.
Tariffs  Passed by Congress in 1922, the Fordney-McCumber Tariff  
increased the duties on foreign manufactured goods by 25 percent. It was protective of U.S. business interests in the short run but destructive in the long run. Because of it, European nations were slow to recover from the war and had difficulty repaying their war debts to the United States. They responded to the high U.S. tariffs by imposing tariffs of their own on American imports. Ultimately, these obstacles to international trade weakened the world economy and were one reason for the Great Depression of the 1930s.
War Debts and Reparations
Before World War I, the United States had been a debtor nation, importing more than it exported. It emerged from the war as a creditor nation, having 
543  TOPIC 7.11   I NTERWAR FOREIGN POLICYlent more than $10 billion to the Allies. Harding and Coolidge insisted that 
Britain and France pay back every penny of their war debts. The British and French objected. They pointed out that they suffered much worse losses than the Americans during the war, that the borrowed money had been spent in the United States, and that high U.S. tariffs made it more difficult to pay the debts. To be sure, the Treaty of Versailles required Germany to pay $30 billion in reparations  to the Allies. But how were Britain and France to collect this 
money? Germany was bankrupt, had soaring inflation, and was near anarchy.
Dawes Plan Charles Dawes, an American banker who would become 
Coolidge’s vice president, negotiated a compromise that was accepted by all sides in 1924. The Dawes Plan established a cycle of payments flowing from the United States to Germany and from Germany to the Allies. U.S. banks would lend Germany huge sums to rebuild its economy and pay reparations to Britain and France. In turn, Britain and France would use the reparations money to pay their war debts to the United States. This cycle helped to ease financial problems on both sides of the Atlantic. After the stock market crash of 1929, however, U.S. bank loans stopped and the prosperity propped up by the Dawes Plan collapsed.
Legacy Ultimately, Finland was the only nation to repay its war debts in 
full. The unpaid debts of the other nations left bad feelings on all sides. Many Europeans resented what they saw as American greed, while Americans saw new reasons to follow an isolationist path in the 1930s.
Herbert Hoover’s Foreign Policy
Hoover concurred with the prevailing opinion of the American people that the United States should not enter into firm commitments to preserve the security of other nations. Such an opinion, in the 1930s, would be labeled “isolationism. ” 
Latin America Hoover actively pursued friendly relations with the 
countries of Latin America. In 1929, even before being inaugurated, the president-elect went on a goodwill tour of the region. As president, he ended the interventionist policies of Taft and Wilson by (1) arranging for U.S. troops to leave Nicaragua by 1933 and (2) negotiating a treaty with Haiti to remove all U.S. troops by 1934.
Japanese Aggression in Manchuria In the early 1930s, Japan posed the 
greatest threat to world peace. Defying both the Open Door policy and the covenant of the League of Nations, Japanese troops marched into Manchuria, a region of northeastern China, in September 1931. They renamed the territory Manchukuo and established a puppet government. This was part of a series of conflicts between Japan and China that began in the late 1800s.
Despite its commitment to resist blatant aggression, the League of Nations 
did nothing except to pass a resolution condemning Japan for invading Manchuria. The Japanese delegation then walked out of the League, never to 
544 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONreturn. In the Manchuria crisis, the League showed it was too weak to maintain 
peace. Its warnings would never be taken seriously by potential aggressors.
Stimson Doctrine U.S. response to Japan’s violation of the Open Door 
policy was somewhat stronger than the League’s response—but no more effective in deterring further aggression. Secretary of State Henry Stimson declared in 1932 that the United States would honor its treaty obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty (1922) by refusing to recognize the legitimacy of any regime like “Manchukuo” that had been established by force. The League of Nations readily endorsed the Stimson Doctrine and issued a similar declaration.

545  TOPIC 7.11   I NTERWAR FOREIGN POLICYFranklin Roosevelt’s Policies, 1933–1939
In his first term, Roosevelt concentrated on the economic crisis at home and 
gave little thought to foreign policy. He did, however, extend Hoover’s efforts to improve U.S.-Latin America relations by initiating a good-neighbor policy.
Good-Neighbor Policy
In his first inaugural address in 1933, Roosevelt promised a “policy of the good neighbor” toward other nations of the Western Hemisphere. First, interventionism in support of dollar diplomacy no longer made economic sense, because U.S. businesses during the depression lacked the resources to invest in foreign operations. Second, the rise of militarist regimes in Germany and Italy prompted Roosevelt to seek Latin America’s cooperation in defending the region from potential danger. 
Pan-American Conferences At Roosevelt’s direction, the U.S. delegation at 
the Seventh Pan-American Conference in Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1933, pledged never again to intervene in the internal affairs of a Latin American country. In effect, Franklin Roosevelt repudiated the policy of his older cousin, Theodore, who had justified intervention as a corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. Another Pan-American conference was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1936. Roosevelt himself attended the conference. He personally pledged to submit future disputes to arbitration and warned that if a European power such as Germany attempted “to commit acts of aggression against us, ” it would find “a hemisphere wholly prepared to consult together for our mutual safety and our mutual good. ”
Cuba  Cubans had long resented the Platt Amendment, which had made 
their country’s foreign policy subject to U.S. approval. In 1934, President Roosevelt persuaded Congress to nullify the Platt Amendment, retaining only the U.S. right to keep its naval base at Guantanamo Bay.
Mexico  In 1938, Mexico tested U.S. patience and commitment to 
the good-neighbor policy when its president, Lázaro Cárdenas, seized oil properties owned by U.S. corporations. Roosevelt rejected corporate demands to intervene and encouraged American companies to negotiate a settlement.
Depression Diplomacy
Helping the U.S. economy was the chief motivation for Roosevelt’s policies toward other foreign policy issues in his first term.
Recognition of the Soviet Union The Republican presidents of the 1920s 
had refused to grant diplomatic recognition to the Communist regime that ruled the Soviet Union. Roosevelt promptly changed this policy by granting recognition in 1933. His reason for doing so, he said, was to increase U.S. trade and thereby boost the economy.
Philippines Governing the Philippines cost money. As an economic 
measure, Roosevelt persuaded Congress to pass the Tydings-McDuffie Act in 
546 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION1934, which provided for the independence of the Philippines by 1946 and 
the gradual removal of U.S. military presence from the islands. 
Reciprocal Trade Agreements Acting in the tradition of Progressive 
Democrats such as William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson, President Roosevelt favored lower tariffs as a means of increasing international trade. In 1934, Congress enacted a plan suggested by Secretary of State Cordell Hull that gave the president power to reduce U.S. tariffs up to 50 percent for nations that reciprocated with comparable reductions for U.S. imports.
The Rise of Fascism and Militarism
The worldwide depression soon proved to have alarming repercussions for world politics. Combined with nationalist resentments after World War I, economic hardships gave rise to dictatorships in Italy in the 1920s and Japan and Germany in the 1930s. Eventually, in 1940, Japan, Italy, and Germany signed a treaty of alliance. Together, they became known as the Axis powers.
Italy A new regime seized power in Italy in 1922. Benito Mussolini led 
Italy’s Fascist Party, which attracted dissatisfied war veterans, nationalists, 
and those afraid of rising communism. Dressed in black shirts, the Fascists marched on Rome and installed Mussolini in power as “Il Duce” (the Leader). Fascism—the idea that people should glorify their nation and their 
race through aggressive shows of force—became the dominant ideology in European dictatorships in the 1930s.
Germany  The Nazi Party was the German equivalent of Italy’s Fascist 
Party. It arose in the 1920s in reaction to deplorable economic conditions after the war and national resentments over the Treaty of Versailles. The Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler, used bullying tactics against Jews as well as Fascist ideology to increase his popularity with disgruntled, unemployed German workers. Hitler seized the opportunity presented by the depression to play upon anti-Semitic hatreds. With his personal army of “brown shirts, ” Hitler gained control of the German legislature in early 1933.
Japan  Nationalists and militarists in Japan increased their power in the 
1920s and 1930s. As economic conditions worsened, they persuaded Japan’s nominal ruler, the emperor, that the country needed to invade China and Southeast Asia to seize raw materials (oil, tin, and iron). Doing so would give Japan control over what their leaders called the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Full-scale war erupted when Japan invaded China on July 7, 1937. In this conflict, called the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese committed atrocities included the Nanjing Massacre in 1937, in which they killed around 300,000 Chinese residents. The eight-year war resulted in millions of deaths.
American Isolationists
Public opinion in the United States was also nationalistic but expressed itself in an opposite way from fascism and militarism. Disillusioned with the results 
547  TOPIC 7.11   I NTERWAR FOREIGN POLICYof World War I, American isolationists wanted to make sure that the United 
States would never again be drawn into a foreign war. Japanese aggression in Manchuria and the rise of fascism in Italy and Germany only increased the determination of isolationists to avoid war at all costs. Isolationist sentiment was strongest in the Midwest and among Republicans.
The Lesson of World War I In the early 1930s, Americans commonly felt 
that U.S. entry into World War I had been a terrible mistake. An investigating committee led by Senator Gerald Nye  of North Dakota bolstered this view 
when it concluded in 1934 that the main reason for U.S. participation in the world war was to serve the greed of bankers and arms manufacturers. This committee’s work influenced isolationist legislation in the following years.
Neutrality Acts  Isolationist senators and representatives in both parties 
held a majority in Congress through 1938. To ensure that U.S. policy would be strictly neutral if war broke out in Europe, Congress adopted a series of neutrality acts, which Roosevelt signed with some reluctance. Each law applied to belligerent nations, ones that the president proclaimed to be at war.
• The Neutrality Act of 1935 authorized the president to prohibit all arms shipments and to forbid U.S. citizens from travel on the ships of belligerents.
• The Neutrality Act of 1936 forbade the extension of loans and credits to belligerents.
• The Neutrality Act of 1937 forbade the shipment of arms to the opposing 
sides in the civil war in Spain.
Spanish Civil War The outbreak of civil war in Spain in 1936 was viewed 
in Europe and the United States as an ideological struggle between the forces of fascism, led by General Francisco Franco, and the forces of republicanism, called Loyalists. Roosevelt and most Americans sympathized with the Loyalists but, because of the Neutrality Acts, could not aid them. Ultimately, in 1939, Franco’s Fascists prevailed and established a military dictatorship.
America First Committee In 1940, after World War II had begun in Asia 
and Europe, isolationists became alarmed by Roosevelt’s pro-British policies. To mobilize American public opinion against war, they formed the America 
First Committee and engaged speakers such as Charles Lindbergh to travel the country warning against reengaging in Europe’s troubles.
Prelude to Another War
In the years 1935 to 1938, a series of aggressive actions by the Fascist dictatorships made democratic governments in Britain and France extremely nervous. It was known that Hitler was creating an air force more powerful than anything they could match. Hoping to avoid open conflict with Germany, the democracies adopted a policy of appeasement—allowing Hitler to get away with relatively small acts of aggression and expansion. The United States went along with 
548 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONthe British and French policy. Events in Africa, Europe, and Asia showed how 
unwilling western democracies were to challenge Fascist aggression.
• Ethiopia, 1935 In a bid to prove fascism’s military might, Mussolini 
ordered Italian troops to invade Ethiopia . The League of Nations and 
the United States objected but did nothing to stop the Italian aggressor, who succeeded in conquering the African country after a year of bitter fighting.
• Rhineland, 1936 This region in western Germany was supposed to be 
permanently demilitarized, according to the Versailles Treaty. Hitler openly defied the treaty by ordering German troops to march into the Rhineland.
• China, 1937 Full-scale war between Japan and China erupted in 
1937 as Japan’s troops invaded its weaker neighbor. A U.S. gunboat in China, the Panay, was bombed and sunk by Japanese planes. The U.S. government quickly accepted Japan’s apology for the sinking.
• Sudetenland, 1938 In Europe, Hitler insisted that Germany had a 
right to take over a strip of land in Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland , 
where most people were German-speaking. To maintain peace, the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, and the French president, Édouard Daladier, with Roosevelt’s support, met with Hitler and Mussolini in Munich. At this conference in September 1938, the British and French leaders agreed to allow Hitler to take the Sudetenland unopposed. The word Munich  has since become synonymous with 
appeasement .
Quarantine Speech Roosevelt recognized the dangers of Fascist aggression 
but was limited by the isolationist feelings of the majority of Americans. When Japan invaded China in 1937, he tested public opinion by making a speech proposing that the democracies act together to “quarantine” the aggressor. Public reaction to the speech was overwhelmingly negative, and Roosevelt dropped the quarantine idea as politically unwise.
Preparedness Like Wilson in 1916, Roosevelt argued for neutrality and 
an arms buildup at the same time. Congress went along with his request in late 1938 by increasing the military and naval budgets by nearly two-thirds. Some isolationists accepted the increased defense spending, thinking it would be used only to protect against possible invasion of the Western Hemisphere.
Outbreak of World War II in Europe
In March 1939, Hitler broke the Munich agreement by sending troops to occupy all of Czechoslovakia. After this, it became clear that Hitler’s ambitions had no limit and that war was probably unavoidable.
Recognizing the failure of appeasement, Britain and France pledged to 
fight if Poland was attacked. They had always assumed that they could count on the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, to oppose Hitler, since communism and 
549  TOPIC 7.11   I NTERWAR FOREIGN POLICYfascism were ideological enemies. The democracies were therefore shocked in 
August 1939 when Stalin and Hitler signed a nonaggression pact. Secretly, the Soviet and German dictators agreed to divide Poland between them.
Invasion of Poland On September 1, 1939, German tanks and planes 
began a full-scale invasion of Poland . Keeping their pledge, Britain and France 
declared war against Germany—and soon afterward, they were also at war with its Axis allies, Italy and Japan. World War II in Europe had begun.
Poland was the first to fall to Germany’s blitzkrieg (lightning war), an 
overwhelming use of air power and fast-moving tanks. After a relatively inactive winter, the war was resumed in the spring of 1940 with Germany attacking its Scandinavian neighbors to the north and its chief enemy, France, to the west. Denmark and Norway surrendered in a few days, France in only a week. By June 1940, the only ally that remained free of German troops was Great Britain.

550 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONRoosevelt Changes Policies
President Roosevelt countered isolationism in the United States by gradually 
giving aid to the Allies, especially Great Britain. Now that war had actually begun, most Americans were alarmed by news of Nazi tanks, planes, and troops conquering one country after another. They were strongly opposed to Hitler but still hoped to keep their country out of the war. President Roosevelt believed that British survival was crucial to U.S. security. The relationship that was built over the coming years between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and FDR proved one of the keys to Allied success in the war. The president chipped away at the restrictive neutrality laws until practically nothing remained to prevent him from giving massive aid to Britain. After the surrender of France to the Germans in 1940, most Americans accepted the need to strengthen U.S. defenses, but giving direct aid to Britain was controversial.
“Cash and Carry” The British navy still controlled the seas. Therefore, 
if the United States ended its arms embargo, it would help only Britain, not Germany. Roosevelt persuaded Congress in 1939 to adopt a less restrictive Neutrality Act, which provided that a belligerent could buy U.S. arms if it used its own ships and paid cash. Technically, “cash and carry” was neutral, but in practice, it strongly favored Britain.
Selective Service Act (1940) Without actually naming Germany as the 
potential enemy, Roosevelt pushed neutrality back one more step by persuading Congress to enact a law for compulsory military service. The Selective Training and Service Act of September 1940 provided for the registration of all American men between the ages of 21 and 35 and for the training of 1.2 million troops in just one year. There had been a military draft in the Civil War and World War I but only when the United States was officially at war. Isolationists strenuously opposed the peacetime draft, but they were now outnumbered as public opinion shifted away from strict neutrality.
Destroyers-for-Bases Deal In September 1940, Britain was under constant 
assault by German bombing raids. German submarine attacks threatened British control of the Atlantic. Roosevelt knew that selling U.S. destroyers to the British outright would outrage the isolationists. He therefore cleverly arranged a trade. Britain received 50 older but still serviceable U.S. destroyers and gave the United States the right to build military bases on British islands in the Caribbean.
The Election of 1940
Adding to suspense over the war was uncertainty over a presidential election. Might Franklin Roosevelt be the first president to break the two-term tradition and seek election to a third term? For months, the president gave an ambiguous reply, causing frenzied speculation in the press. At last, he announced that, in those critical times, he would not turn down the Democratic nomination if it were offered. Most Democrats were delighted to renominate their most effective 
551  TOPIC 7.11   I NTERWAR FOREIGN POLICYcampaigner. During the campaign, Roosevelt made the rash pronouncement: 
“Y our boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars. ”
Wendell Willkie  The Republicans had a number of veteran politicians 
who were eager to challenge the president. Instead, they chose a newcomer to public office: Wendell Willkie , a lawyer and utility executive with a magnetic 
personality. Although he criticized the New Deal, Willkie largely agreed with Roosevelt on preparedness and giving aid to Britain short of actually entering the war. His strongest criticism of Roosevelt was the president’s decision to break the two-term tradition established by George Washington.
Results Roosevelt won with 54 percent of the popular vote—a smaller 
margin than in 1932 and 1936. Important factors in the president’s reelection were (1) a strong economic recovery enhanced by defense purchases and (2) fear of war, which caused voters to stay with the more experienced leader.
Arsenal of Democracy
Roosevelt viewed Germany’s conquest of most of Europe as a direct threat both to U.S. security and to the future of democratic governments everywhere. After his reelection, he believed that he was in a stronger position to end the appearance of U.S. neutrality and give material aid to Britain. In a December 1940 fireside chat to the American people, he explained his thinking and concluded: “We must be the great arsenal of democracy. ”
Four Freedoms Addressing Congress on January 6, 1941, the president 
delivered a speech that proposed lending money to Britain for the purchase of U.S. war materials. He justified such a policy by arguing that the United States must help other nations defend “four freedoms”: freedom of speech, freedom 
of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.
Lend-Lease Act Roosevelt proposed ending the cash-and-carry requirement 
of the Neutrality Act and permitting Britain to obtain all the U.S. arms it needed on credit. The president said it would be like lending a neighbor a garden hose to put out a fire. Isolationists in the America First Committee campaigned vigorously against the lend-lease bill. By now, however, majority opinion had shifted toward aiding Britain, and the Lend-Lease Act was signed into law in March 1941.
Atlantic Charter  With the United States actively aiding Britain, Roosevelt 
knew that the United States might soon enter the war. He arranged for a secret meeting in August 1941 with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill aboard a ship off the coast of Newfoundland. The two leaders drew up a document known as the Atlantic Charter  that affirmed that the general principles for a 
sound peace after the war would include self-determination for all people, no territorial expansion, and free trade.
Shoot-on-Sight In July 1941, the president extended U.S. support 
for Britain even further by protecting its ships from submarine attack. He ordered the U.S. Navy to escort British ships carrying lend-lease materials 
552 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONfrom U.S. shores as far as Iceland. On September 4, the American destroyer 
Greer  was attacked by a German submarine it had been hunting. In response, 
Roosevelt ordered the navy to attack all German ships on sight. In effect, the United States was now fighting an undeclared naval war against Germany.
Disputes with Japan
Meanwhile, through 1940 and 1941, U.S. relations with Japan were becoming increasingly strained as a result of Japan’s invasion of China and ambitions to extend its conquests to Southeast Asia. Beginning in 1940, Japan was allied with Germany and Italy as one of the Axis powers. Hitler’s success in Europe enabled Japanese expansion into the Dutch East Indies, British Burma, and French Indochina—territories still held as European colonies.
U.S. Economic Action When Japan joined the Axis powers in September 
1940, Roosevelt responded by prohibiting the export of steel and scrap iron to all countries except Britain and the nations of the Western Hemisphere. His action was aimed at Japan, which protested that it was an “unfriendly act. ” In July 1941, Japanese troops occupied French Indochina. Roosevelt then froze all Japanese credits in the United States and also cut off Japanese access to vital materials, including U.S. oil.
Negotiations  Both sides realized that Japan needed oil to fuel its navy 
and air force. If the U.S. embargo on oil did not end, Japan would likely seize the oil resources in the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, Japan’s invasion of China was a blatant violation of the Open Door policy, to which the United States was still committed. Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull insisted that Japan pull its troops out of China, which Japan refused to do. The Japanese ambassador to the United States tried to negotiate a change in U.S. policy on oil. Agreement, however, seemed most unlikely. In October, a new Japanese government headed by General Hideki Tojo made a final attempt at negotiating an agreement. Neither side, however, changed its position.
U.S. military leaders hoped to delay armed confrontation with Japan until 
U.S. armed forces in the Pacific were strengthened. Japan, on the other hand, believed that quick action was necessary because of its limited oil supplies.
Pearl Harbor The U.S. fleet in the Pacific was anchored at Pearl Harbor, 
Hawaii. On Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, while most American sailors were still asleep in their bunks, Japanese planes from aircraft carriers flew over Pearl Harbor bombing every ship in sight. The surprise attack lasted less than two hours. In that time, Japan killed 2,400 Americans (including over 1,100 when the battleship Arizona  sank), wounded almost 1,200 people, sank or 
severely damaged 20 warships, and destroyed approximately 150 airplanes.
Partial Surprise The American people were stunned by the attack on Pearl 
Harbor. High government officials, however, knew that an attack somewhere in the Pacific was imminent because they had broken the Japanese codes. They did not know the exact target and date for the attack, which many felt would be in the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, or Malaya.

The War in Europe in 1941–1942
By the time the United States entered the war in December 1941, Europeans had been fighting for two years. On June 22, 1941, Hitler had broken his nonaggression pact with Stalin and ordered his troops to invade the Soviet Union. This shifted the main battlefront in Europe from the west to the east. The principal Allies fighting Nazi Germany from 1942 to 1945, then, were Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The three Allied leaders—Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin—agreed that they should concentrate on the European war against the aggressive militarism and fascism of the Nazis before shifting their resources to counter Japanese advances in the Pacific.

World War II Mobilization
There is one front and one battle where everyone in the United States—
every man, woman, and child—is in action, and will be privileged to 
remain in action throughout this war. That front is right here at home,  
in our daily lives, and in our daily tasks.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, April 28th, 1942
Learning Objective : Explain how and why U.S. participation in World 
War II transformed American society. 
The success of U.S. and Allied armed forces depended on mobilizing 
America’s people, industries, and creative and scientific communities. The role 
of the federal government expanded well beyond anything in World War I or the New Deal.
The Federal Government Takes Action 
As in World War I, the U.S. government organized a number of special agencies to mobilize U.S. economic and military resources for the wartime crisis. Early in 1942, the War Production Board  (WPB) was established to manage war 
industries. Later, the Office of War Mobilization (OWM) set production priorities and controlled raw materials. The government used a cost-plus system, in which it paid war contractors the costs of production plus a certain percentage for profit. One federal agency, the Office of Price Administration (OPA), regulated almost every aspect of civilians’ lives by freezing prices, wages, and rents, and by rationing such commodities as meat, sugar, gasoline, and auto tires, primarily to fight wartime inflation. However, rationing led to a black market, where people bought and sold these items illegally.
Deficit spending during the depression was dwarfed by the deficits incurred 
during the war. Federal spending increased 1,000 percent between 1939 and 1945. As a result, the gross national product grew by 15 percent or more a year. World War II proved what the New Deal did not, that the government could spend its way out of a depression. By war’s end, the national total accumulated 
debt  had reached the then staggering figure of $250 billion, five times what 
it had been in 1941. This was 120 percent of the total economic output of the country for 1946. 
Business and Industry Stimulated by wartime demand and government 
contracts, U.S. industries did a booming business, far exceeding their 
557  TOPIC 7.12   W ORLD WAR II MOBILIz ATIONproduction and profits of the 1920s. The depression was over, vanquished at 
last by the coming of war. By 1944, unemployment had practically disappeared.
War-related industrial output in the United States was astonishing. By 
1944, it was twice that of all the Axis powers combined. Instead of automobiles, tanks and fighter planes rolled off the assembly lines. American factories produced over 300,000 planes, 100,000 tanks, and ships with a total capacity of 53 million tons. So efficient were production methods that Henry Kaiser’s giant shipyard in California could turn out a new ship in just 14 days. The war concentrated production in the largest corporations, as smaller businesses lost out on government contracts to larger businesses with more capacity. The 100 largest corporations accounted for up to 70 percent of wartime manufacturing. 
Research and Development Government worked closely not only with 
industries, but also universities and research labs to create and improve technologies that could be used to defeat the enemy. The Office of Research and Development was established to contract scientists and universities to help in the development of electronics such as radar and sonar, medicines such as penicillin, and military goods such as jet engines and rockets. It also ran the top-secret Manhattan Project, which produced the first atomic weapons. Ironically, many of the European scientists who fled Fascist persecution would contribute to fascism’s defeat through their work in United States.
Workers and Unions Labor unions and large corporations agreed that 
while the war lasted, there would be no strikes. Workers became disgruntled, however, as their wages were frozen while corporations made large profits. John L. Lewis, therefore, called a few strikes by coal miner unions. The Smith-Connally Anti-Strike Act of 1943, passed over Roosevelt’s veto, empowered the government to take over war-related businesses whose operations were threatened by a strike. In 1944, Roosevelt had occasion to use this law when he ordered the army to operate the nation’s railroads for a brief period.
Financing the War The government paid for its huge increase in spending 
($100 billion spent on the war in 1945 alone) by (1) increasing the income tax and (2) selling war bonds. For the first time, most Americans were required to pay an income tax, and in 1944, the practice was begun of automatically deducting a withholding tax from paychecks. Borrowing money by selling $135 billion in war bonds supplemented the tax increase. In addition, the shortage of consumer goods made it easier for Americans to save.
Wartime Propaganda Few people opposed the war, so the government’s 
propaganda campaign of posters, songs, and news bulletins was primarily to maintain public morale, to encourage people to conserve resources, and to increase war production. The Office of War Information controlled news about troop movements and battles. Movies, radio, and popular music all supported and reflected a cheerful, patriotic view of the war. For example, Norman Rockwell’s popular illustrations of the “Four Freedoms” captured the liberties and values at stake in the war. The unity of Americans behind the war’s democratic ideals helped that generation remember it as “the Good War. ”

The War’s Impact on Society
Every group in the U.S. population adjusted to the unique circumstances of 
wartime. The increase in factory jobs caused millions to leave rural areas for industrial jobs in the Midwest and on the Pacific Coast, especially California. Entirely new communities arose around the construction of new factories and military bases. Many of the new defense installations were located in the South because of that region’s warm climate and low labor costs. The wartime expansion set the stage for a postwar migration to the Sunbelt.
African Americans Attracted by jobs in the North and West, over 1.5 
million African Americans left the South. In addition, a million young men left home to serve in the armed forces. During World War II, African Americans for the first time served as aviators in combat.
However, whether as soldiers or civilians, African Americans faced 
continued discrimination and segregation at home and in the armed forces. Dozens died in race riots in New Y ork and Detroit during the summer of 1943 resulting from White resentment of Black families moving into their cities. Civil rights leaders encouraged African Americans to adopt the “Double V”  
slogan—victory over fascism abroad and the victory of equality at home.
Membership in the NAACP increased during the war, which continued to 
challenge unjust laws in court and advocate for civil rights legislation. Another civil rights organization, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), was formed in 1942 to work more militantly for African American interests. After Black leaders threatened a protest march on Washington, the Roosevelt administration issued an executive order to prohibit discrimination in government and in 
businesses that received federal contracts. One judicial victory was won in the Supreme Court case of Smith v. Allwright (1944). The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to deny membership in political parties to African Americans as a way of excluding them from voting in primaries.
559  TOPIC 7.12   W ORLD WAR II MOBILIz ATIONMexican Americans Over 300,000 Mexican Americans served in the 
military and many others worked in defense industries. A 1942 agreement 
with Mexico allowed Mexican farmworkers, known as braceros , to enter the 
United States in the harvest season without going through formal immigration procedures. Braceros entered as temporary residents. They were not welcomed 
to stay permanently. The sudden influx of Mexican immigrants into Los Angeles stirred White resentment and led to the so-called zoot suit riots in the summer of 1943, in which Whites and Mexican Americans battled on the streets.
American Indians American Indians contributed to the war effort as 
both soldiers and workers. Approximately 25,000 served in the military, and thousands more worked in defense industries. Having discovered the opportunities off their reservations, more than half never returned.
Japanese Americans More than any ethnic group, Japanese Americans 
suffered special discrimination because of the war. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, many people suspected that Japanese Americans were spies or saboteurs and that Japan would soon invade the West Coast. In 1942, these irrational fears, as well as racism, prompted the U.S. government to order more than 100,000 Japanese Americans on the West Coast to leave their homes and move to internment camps. The order did not apply to Japanese Americans living in Hawaii and other parts of the United States. In the case of Korematsu v. U.S. (1944), the Supreme Court upheld the government’s internment policy 
as justified in wartime. Despite this discriminatory treatment, almost 20,000 Japanese Americans served in the military. In 1988, the federal government agreed the ruling was unjust and awarded financial compensation to those still alive who had been interned.
Women  The war also changed the lives of women. Over 200,000 women 
served in uniform in the army, navy, and marines, but in noncombat roles. As in World War I, an acute labor shortage caused women to take jobs vacated by men in uniform. Almost 5 million women entered the workforce, many of them working in industrial jobs in the shipyards and defense plants. The number of married women in the workforce increased to 24 percent. A song about “Rosie the Riveter” was used to encourage women to take defense jobs. However, they received pay well below that of male factory workers. Women also became more independent as heads of the households and chief income earners while men served overseas.
Wartime Solidarity The New Deal helped immigrant groups feel more 
included, and serving together as “bands of brothers” in combat or working together for a common cause in defense plants helped to reduce prejudices based on nationality, ethnicity, and religion. The wartime migrations also helped to soften regional differences and open the eyes of many Americans to the injustice of racial discrimination.

World War II: Military
We knew the world would not be the same. . . . I remembered the line from 
the Hindu scripture, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” 
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another. 
J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientist upon seeing the first  
 atomic weapons explosion, from a 1965 interview
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the victory of the 
United States and its allies over the Axis powers.
The fighting of World War II was waged on two fronts, or “theaters of 
operation. ” In the Pacific, Japanese forces reached the height of their power 
in 1942, occupying islands throughout the western Pacific Ocean. In Europe, much of the fighting in the first year of war was between the Germans and the Soviets, as the latter fought desperately to prevent the conquest of Russia.
Fighting Germany
The high tide of the German advance ended in 1942, partly as a result of U.S. entry into the war but mainly because of a Soviet victory at Stalingrad in the winter of that year.
Defense at Sea, Attacks by Air Coordinating their military strategy, the 
British and Americans concentrated on two objectives in 1942: (1) overcoming the menace of German submarines in the Atlantic and (2) beginning bombing raids on German cities. The protracted naval war to control the shipping lanes was known as the Battle of the Atlantic. German submarines sank over 500 Allied ships in 1942. Gradually, however, the Allies developed ways of containing the submarine menace through the use of radar, sonar, and the bombing of German naval bases. The U.S. bombers carried out daylight “strategic bombing”  raids on military targets in Europe, while the Germans 
and Britain attacked population centers. The lines between military and civilian targets became blurred as the war carried on, especially in Japan, when the United States started to fire bomb sections of large cities.
From North Africa to Italy The Allies had the daunting task of driving 
German occupying forces out of their advance positions in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They began their North Africa campaign, Operation Torch, in November 1942. Led by U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower and British 
563  TOPIC 7.13   W ORLD WAR II : MILITARYGeneral Bernard Montgomery, Allied forces succeeded in taking North Africa 
from the Germans by May 1943.
The next U.S.–British target was the Mediterranean island of Sicily, which 
they occupied in the summer of 1943, preparatory to an invasion of Italy. Mussolini fell from power during the summer, but Hitler’s forces rescued him and gave him nominal control of northern Italy. In fact, German troops controlled much of Italy at the time that the Allies invaded the peninsula in September 1943. The Germans put up a determined resistance to the Allied offensive, holding much of northern Italy until their final surrender in May 1945.
From D-Day to Victory in Europe The Allied drive to liberate France 
began on June 6, 1944, with the largest invasion by sea in history. On D-Day, 
as the invasion date was called, British, Canadian, and U.S. forces under the command of General Eisenhower secured several beachheads on the Normandy coast. After this bloody but successful attack, the Allied offensive moved rapidly to roll back German occupying forces. By the end of August, Paris was liberated. By September, Allied troops had crossed the German border for a final push toward Berlin. The Germans launched a desperate counterattack in Belgium in December 1944 in the Battle of the Bulge. After this setback, however, Americans reorganized and resumed their advance.
German Surrender and Discovery of the Holocaust Since 1942, Allied 
bombing raids over Germany had reduced that nation’s industrial capacity and ability to continue fighting. Recognizing that the end was near, as the Russian army closed in on Berlin, Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945. The unconditional surrender of the Nazi armies took place a week later, on May 7.
As U.S. troops advanced through Germany, they came upon German 
concentration camps and witnessed the horrifying extent of the Nazis’ program of genocide against the Jews and others. Americans and the world were shocked to learn that 6 million Jewish civilians and several million non-Jews had been systematically murdered by Nazi Germany.
Fighting Japan
In Europe, British, Soviet, and U.S. forces were jointly responsible for defeating Germany, but in the Pacific, it was largely the U.S. armed forces that challenged the Japanese. After the Pearl Harbor attack, Japan seized control of much of East Asia and Southeast Asia. By early 1942, Japanese troops occupied Korea, eastern China, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), British Burma and Malaya, French Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos), and most of the Pacific Islands west of Midway Island.
Turning Point, 1942 The war in the Pacific was dominated by naval forces 
battling over a vast area. Intercepting and decoding Japanese messages enabled U.S. forces to destroy four Japanese carriers and 300 planes in the decisive Battle of Midway on June 4–7. This battle ended Japanese expansion.
564 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONIsland Hopping  After the victory at Midway, the United States began a 
long campaign to get within striking distance of Japan’s home islands by seizing 
strategic locations in the Pacific. Using a strategy called island hopping, 
commanders bypassed strongly held Japanese posts and isolated them with naval and air power. Allied forces moved steadily toward Japan.
Major Battles Early in 1942, the Japanese had conquered the Philippines. 
When General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of army units in the Southern Pacific, was driven from the islands, he famously vowed, “I shall return. ” The conflict that prepared the way for U.S. reoccupation of the Philippines was the largest naval battle in history. At the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, the Japanese navy was virtually destroyed. For the first time in the war, the Japanese used kamikaze pilots to make suicide attacks on U.S. ships. Kamikazes also inflicted major damage in the colossal Battle of Okinawa (April to June 1945). Before finally succeeding in taking this island near Japan, U.S. forces suffered 50,000 casualties and killed 100,000 Japanese.
Atomic Bombs After Okinawa, a huge invasion force stood ready to attack 
Japan. Extremely heavy casualties were feared. By this time, however, the United States had developed a frightfully destructive new weapon. The top-secret Manhattan Project under General Leslie Groves employed over 100,000 people and spent $2 billion to develop a weapon whose power came from the splitting of the atom. J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, 
New Mexico, successfully tested the first atomic bomb  on July 16, 1945. 
The new president, Harry Truman, and his wartime allies called on Japan 
to surrender unconditionally or face “utter destruction. ” When Japan gave an unsatisfactory reply, Truman consulted with his advisers and decided to use the new weapon on two Japanese cities. On August 6, an A-bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and on August 9, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. 
About 250,000 Japanese died, either immediately or after a prolonged period of suffering, as a result of the two nuclear bombs. 
War and Morality Nuclear weapons, by design, destroyed a much larger 
area than conventional weapons. When used on population centers, the new technology would cause tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths and injuries from the blast and radiation. The moral issue of killing civilians was raised in World War I by the German use of submarines against passenger ships. In World War II, the Germans and British bombed each other’s cities based on the rationale that it would force the other side to sue for peace. Instead, research after the war concluded it did not have the desired effect. In fact, industrial output often went up because the bombing of urban centers released workers from their commercial jobs to work in well-hidden war plants. 
Some would argue that in modern industrialized societies, civilians were 
part of the war effort and therefore legitimate targets. The United States in World War II first used “strategic bombing” of only military targets; however, it began to cross the line with the fire-bombing of Japanese cities, which caused 
565  TOPIC 7.13   W ORLD WAR II : MILITARYthousands of civilian deaths. Today, people recognize that large-scale nuclear 
warfare could end most human life, if not most life of all kinds, on Earth.
Japan Surrenders Within a week after the second atomic bomb fell, 
Japan agreed to surrender if the Allies would allow the emperor to remain as a titular (powerless) head of state. General MacArthur received Japan’s formal surrender on September 2, 1945, in Tokyo’s harbor aboard the battleship USS Missouri . The diplomacy that led to the end of the war set the stage for the 
efforts to construct a more lasting peace (see Topic 7.14).

Great Britain and France that were trying to hold on to their colonial empires. Allied victory in World War II and the death of President Roosevelt exposed the contradictions in the Grand Alliance, and both caused and foreshadowed the conflicts of postwar diplomacy. 
American Leadership
In 1944, President Roosevelt won the Democratic nomination for the fourth time. The Democrats made an important change, however, in their choice of a vice presidential running mate. Party leaders felt that Roosevelt’s third-term vice president, Henry Wallace, was considered too radical and unmanageable. With Roosevelt’s agreement, they replaced Wallace with Harry S. Truman, a Missouri senator with a national reputation for having conducted a much-publicized investigation of war spending. The Democrats won 53 percent of the popular vote and an overwhelming 432–99 victory in the Electoral College. 
Although Roosevelt publicly denied medical problems, those near him 
recognized his poor health. As fate had it, FDR would live for less than three months after his inauguration. Harry Truman, who would serve the rest of the term, rarely met with Roosevelt. For example, Truman was told of the secret development of the atomic bomb only after Roosevelt’s death. In retrospect, critics questioned the impact of Roosevelt’s poor health and the changes in the administration on American diplomacy, especially with the Soviet Union.
568 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONWartime Conferences
During the war, the Big Three—U.S. President Roosevelt, British Prime 
Minister Churchill, and Soviet Premier Stalin—arranged to confer secretly to coordinate military strategy and to lay the foundation for peace terms and postwar policies.
Casablanca The first conference, in January 1943,  involved only Roosevelt 
and Churchill. They met in the North African city of Casablanca. They agreed on a grand strategy to win the war, including to invade Sicily and Italy and to demand “unconditional surrender” from the Axis powers.
Tehr an  The Big Three met for the first time in the Iranian city of Tehran in 
November 1943. They agreed that the British and Americans would begin their drive to liberate France in the spring of 1944 and that the Soviets would invade Germany and eventually join the war against Japan.
Ya l t a  In February 1945, the Big Three conferred again at Y alta, a resort 
town on the Black Sea coast of the Soviet Union. Their agreement at Y alta would prove the most historic of the three meetings. They agreed on several policies to guide them after victory in Europe:
• The Allies would divide Germany into occupation zones. Germany would lose about 1/4 of its territories to Poland and the Soviet Union as their boundaries were moved westward.
• The liberated countries of Eastern Europe would hold free elections , 
even though Soviet troops controlled this territory.
• The Soviets would enter the war against Japan, which they did on August 8, 1945.
• The Soviets would control the southern half of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands in the Pacific and have special concessions in Manchuria.
• Countries would hold a conference in San Francisco to form a new world peace organization (the future United Nations).
The Y alta Conference was the most important conference of the war because it largely determined the future map of Europe. After the war, President Roosevelt was criticized for “giving away” Eastern Europe to the Soviets. However, neither he nor the other Allies were in a position to stop the Soviet army from taking possession of these nations. At the time, before the successful test of the atomic bomb, Roosevelt also wanted Soviet help to defeat Japan.
Death of President Roosevelt When the president returned from Y alta 
and informed Congress of his agreement with Churchill and Stalin, people could see that his health had deteriorated. On April 12, 1945, while resting in a vacation home in Georgia, an exhausted Roosevelt died suddenly. News of his death shocked the nation almost as much as Pearl Harbor. Harry S. Truman entered the presidency unexpectedly to assume enormous responsibilities as commander in chief of a war effort that had not yet been won.

Potsdam  In late July, after Germany’s surrender, only Stalin remained 
as one of the Big Three. Truman was the new U.S. president, and Clement 
Attlee had just been elected the new British prime minister to replace Winston Churchill. The three leaders met in Potsdam, Germany (July 17–August 2, 1945) and agreed (1) to demand that Japan surrender unconditionally, and (2) Germany and Berlin would be divided into four zones of occupation. However, cracks in the Grand Alliance became more evident after the conference. Stalin wanted a harsher treatment of Germany and interpreted the use of the atomic bomb against Japan as a threat to the Soviet Union. Moreover, Truman wanted to get “tough” with the Soviets, especially for the takeover of Eastern Europe by Communist governments that proved to be puppets of the Soviet Union.
The War’s Legacy
The most destructive war in the history of the world had profound effects on all nations, including the United States.
Human and Economic Costs The deadliest war ever conducted resulted 
in the deaths of 70 million to 80 million military personnel and civilians worldwide. About one-third of those were Soviet citizens. Fifteen million Americans served in uniform and approximately 400,000 Americans lost their lives and 800,000 others were wounded. Excluding the Civil War, more Americans died in World War II than in all other U.S. wars combined. 
The war left the United States with a huge national debt. But while Europe 
and Japan lay in ruins, the United States had suffered no damage to its cities, factories, roads, universities, and farms. As a result, the United States emerged 
570 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONafter the war far wealthier than any other country. Further, as the political 
leader of the victorious Allied coalition, it had shaped the postwar settlements and had influence around the globe. Few, if any, questioned that the United States was the most powerful nation on Earth in 1945.
The United Nations Unlike its rejection of the League of Nations following 
World War I, Congress readily accepted membership in the peacekeeping organization that was formed at the end of World War II. Meeting in 1944 at Dumbarton Oaks near Washington, D.C., Allied representatives from the United States, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and China proposed an international organization to be called the United Nations. Then in April 1945, delegates from 50 nations assembled in San Francisco, where they took only eight weeks to draft a charter for the United Nations. The Senate quickly voted to accept U.S. involvement in the UN. On October 24, 1945, the UN came into existence when the majority of member-nations ratified its charter.
Expectations In a final speech, which he never delivered, Franklin 
Roosevelt wrote: “The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be the doubts of today. ” Americans had concerns about what world order might emerge after World War II, but they also shared hopes that life would be more prosperous. Without a doubt, the United States in 1945 was the most prosperous and the most powerful nation in the world. It had played a major role in defeating the Fascist dictators. Now people looked forward with some optimism to both a more peaceful and more democratic world. 
However, the specters of the Soviet Union dominating Eastern Europe 
and gaining the A-bomb would soon dim expectations for cooperation. In 1946, the United States presented a plan to the United Nations for the control of atomic weapons and disarmament, but the Soviet Union vetoed the plan 
and developed its own atomic weapons. The breakdown of cooperation with the Soviet Union ushered in a period (1945–1980) dominated by a Cold War between the democracies and capitalist economies of the “West” and the Communist political and economic ideologies of the “East. ”

Comparison in Period 7
Learning Objective : Compare the relative significance of major events 
of the first half of the 20th century in shaping American identity. 
The reasoning process of comparison  asks students to describe similarities 
and differences between specific historical developments. In studying Period 
7, you can use comparison to make judgments about the relative significance of events that shaped the American identity. For example, a comparison of historical events, such as World War I and World War II, can also help one grasp the unique complexity of each. For example, after World War I, Congress and most voters rejected joining the League of Nations and committing to 
collective security. In 
contrast , after World War II, joining the United Nations 
had bipartisan support. The two wars provide other cases of multiple variables:
• Political Conditions: President Wilson was less willing to compromise 
than President Roosevelt was nearly three decades later. 
• Military Situation: The entry into World War I was controversial, as people continued to question the need for U.S. involvement. The attack on Pearl Harbor unified the nation behind fighting World War II.
• Diplomatic Relations: The main allies of the United States in World War I were democracies. In World War II, the United States worked with non-democracies, such as the Soviet Union.
• National Values: Immediately after World War I, people believed the United States could go its own way in world affairs. By 1945, people had experienced the failure of isolationism to stop the aggression by Japan, Italy, and Germany, and the success of collective security in doing so.
The analysis of such variables will help you to develop a more complex and persuasive argument.
QUESTIONS ABOUT COMPARISON
1. Compare the significance of the 1920s with period from 1933 to 1945 in shaping beliefs about assimilation of migrants and minorities as part of the American national identity.
2. Compare the relative impact of the reforms of the Progressive era and the New Deal in shaping views on the economy and capitalism as part of the American national identity.

Which set of numbers is easier to remember in order: 2, 8, 10, 6, 4; or 2, 4, 6, 
8, 10? They are the same numbers, but the first set lacks an obvious connection between one number and the next, while the second set has one. Recognizing and understanding the significance of connections between people, places, objects, and events in history helps you to better understand the importance of what you are studying. Here are the two ways of making connections that will help you on the AP® exam.
• Identify patterns: This means you notice when historical developments 
or processes have aspects in common.
• Make connections: This means you are able to identify and explain how 
one historical development or process relates to another.
Items related to contextualization may appear anywhere on the AP® exam. 
Y ou can use various reasoning processes to help you see connections:
• Causation: This includes distinguishing between minor and major causes, 
and between short-term and long-term effects of a historical development. 
• Comparison: This includes recognizing both similarities and differences 
among historical developments, either from the same era or different eras.
• Continuity and change: This includes evaluating how significant each 
continuity and each change is.

    UNIT 7 — Period 7 Review:  
1890–1945
WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  WRITE THE SUPPORTING PARAGRAPHS
The supporting paragraphs in your long essay will demonstrate your skill in 
using evidence. They will also demonstrate your ability to follow a reasoning process and develop a complex interpretation of the prompt.
Use of Evidence Suppose your thesis is that Progressive Era reforms were 
more focused on politics while New Deal reforms focused on economics. To earn any points, you need to provide two examples of evidence relevant to your thesis—that is, directly connected to your topic. For example, you might argue that the most important accomplishments of the Progressives were the amendments requiring the direct election of senators and allowing women to vote. In contrast, you might argue that most important accomplishments of the New Deal included a minimum wage, Social Security, and protection for union organizing. 
To earn the maximum number of points, you need to show how your 
evidence supports your argument. The Progressives were often middle-class 
individuals for whom the economy was already working well. In contrast, many supporters of the New Deal were working-class individuals who wanted more government intervention in the economy. Using such terms as because and for this reason  will help you link your evidence to your argument.
Historical Reasoning and Complexity Y our supporting paragraphs 
also need to show that you used reasoning processes (causation, comparison, or continuity and change) to frame your argument. Y ou can show this framing in your choice of words. Using terms such as in constrast  and on the 
other hand  will help you show the differences in two movements. 
To earn the most points, however, your supporting paragraphs must 
demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt. Y ou could demonstrate this in various ways:
• Explain both similarities and differences or address multiple causes and effects. Y ou might note how changes in technology shaped both sets of reforms.
• Note connections across geographic areas and time periods. Y ou might add comparisons with reforms during Reconstruction.
• Use evidence from other sources to corroborate (verify), qualify (set limitations), or modify (revise) an argument. To qualify your argument, you might point to Progressive reforms that affected the economy (creating the Federal Reserve) and New Deal reforms that affected the political system (increasing federal government power).

at once, in the midst of a terrifying cataclysm, abjured our faith in many things American. We no longer believe, as for 140 years, in the moral power of an America unarmed and unafraid; we believe suddenly that the influence of the United States is to be measured only by the numbers of our soldiery and our dreadnoughts—our whole history to the contrary notwithstanding.
Next, the preparedness policy signifies an entire change in our attitude toward 
the military as to whom we inherited from our forefathers’ suspicions and distrust. A cardinal principle of our polity has always been the subordination of the miltary to the civil authority as a necessary safeguard for the republic. ”

Topic 8.1
Contextualizing Period 8
Learning Objective : Explain the context for societal changes from  
1945 to 1980.
In 1945, the United States emerged from World War II with the world’s largest 
and strongest economy. Americans were happy to get back to civilian life. 
However, people feared that without the stimulus of wartime spending, the economic depression of the 1930s might return. What no one could predict with any confidence was how the economy at home, the migration to the suburbs and Sun Belt, the spread of communism, and the civil rights movements for African Americans and others would impact American lives in the future. 
U.S.–Soviet Conflict The postwar struggle between the United States 
and the Soviet Union, between Western democracies and the Communist bloc nations, which became known as the Cold War,  provided the context for many, 
if not most, events of the period from 1945 to 1980. This struggle showed up in U.S. involvement in wars both in Korea and Vietnam, and in the case of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, a direct confrontation that brought the two nations to the brink of n                                                                                                                                         uclear war. The Cold War also had a pervasive effect on American society, from how we built schools (over bomb shelters) to the civil rights movement, as more Americans woke up to the glaring injustices of segregation, which mocked our democracy overseas and contradicted the basic principles of freedom and equal opportunity.
Concerns about Communism After World War II, the United States had 
a second Red Scare . Its context involved spies giving atomic bomb secrets to 
the Communists and hunting down Communists in the State Department, the military, Hollywood, schools, churches, and other American institutions, and at the height of the fear, neighbors. The Cold War also contributed to public 
debates  over foreign policy issues, such as U.S. involvement in Vietnam, which 
led to massive protests by students and antiwar activists that deeply divided the nation and brought down a president. However, the Cold War fluctuated between periods of confrontation and coexistence  or détente .
Economic Growth and Change At the same time, Americans enjoyed 
robust economic growth  through the 1950s and 1960s. Part of the context 
was that the country faced little overseas competition, as the rest of world’s UNIT 8 — Period 8: 1945–1980
580 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONeconomies recovered from the destruction of factories, roads, railways, and 
harbors during World War II. However, it also involved the pent-up demand for housing, autos, and other consumer goods following the austerity of the Great Depression and World War II. Veterans returning from war and their families changed the U.S. landscape by moving to the Sun Belt  states and creating new 
suburbs  across the nation with the help of the government’s GI Bill.
Civil Rights and Liberal Reform If anything pushed the Cold War into 
the background it was the societal changes related to the civil rights movement 
of African Americans during the 1950s and 1960s, and then in the 1970s the issues of equality and social justice raised by women and ethnic minorities. The liberalism  of the postwar era, which expanded the role of government, generated 
a range of responses from support to a growing backlash from both secular and religious conservatives.
Turn toward Conservatism By the late 1960s, frustration over the Vietnam 
War, opposition to civil rights reforms and other liberal domestic programs, and increased civil unrest weakened the Democratic majority. Postwar optimism and prosperity gave way to pessimism and a declining standard of living for many Americans, as many good-paying jobs in manufacturing went overseas to low-wage countries. People were losing confidence in government’s ability to solve problems and in the effectiveness of American institutions, from the news media to colleges and universities. By the mid-1970s, as wage growth stagnated for average Americans, liberalism slowly gave way to a conservative  resurgence .

The Cold War from 1945 to 1980
Communism holds that the world is so deeply divided into opposing  
classes that war is inevitable. Democracy holds that free nations  
can settle differences justly and maintain lasting peace.
President Harry S. Truman, Inaugural Address, January 20, 1949
Learning Objective : Explain the continuities and changes in the Cold 
War policies from 1945 to 1980.
W orld War II dramatically changed the United States from an isolationist 
country into a military superpower and a leader in world affairs. After the war, 
most of the Americans at home and the millions coming back from military service wished to return to normal domestic life and enjoy the revitalized national economy. However, during the Truman presidency, the growing conflict between the Communist Soviet Union and the United States resulted in a long struggle that came to be known as the Cold War.
Origins of the Cold War
The C old War  dominated international relations from the late 1940s to the 
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The conflict centered on the intense rivalry between two superpowers: the Communist Soviet Union and the leading Western democracy, the United States. They competed directly through diplomacy and indirectly through armed conflicts among allies, but rarely through direct military actions against each other. However, in several instances, the Cold War took the world dangerously near nuclear war.
Historians intensely debate how the Cold War began. Some see President 
Truman’s (1945–1953) policies as a reasonable response to Soviet efforts to spread their influence. However, some critics argue that Truman misunderstood and overreacted to Russia’s realistic need to secure its borders. Other critics have attacked his administration as being weak or “soft” on communism.
U.S.–Soviet Relations to 1945 The wartime alliance between the United 
States and the Soviet Union against the Axis powers was actually a temporary halt in their generally poor relations of the past. Since the Bolshevik Revolution that established a Communist government in Russia in 1917, Americans had viewed the Soviets as a threat to all capitalistic countries. In the United States, it led to the Red Scare of 1919. The United States refused to recognize the Soviet Union until 1933. Even then, after a brief honeymoon period, Roosevelt’s 
582 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONadvisers concluded that Joseph Stalin and the Communists could not be 
trusted. Confirming their view was the notorious Nonaggression Pact of 1939, in which Stalin and Hitler agreed to divide up Eastern Europe.
Allies in World War II In 1941, Hitler’s surprise invasion of the Soviet 
Union and Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor led to a U.S.–Soviet alliance of convenience—but not of mutual trust. Stalin bitterly complained that the British and Americans waited until 1944 to open a second front in France. Because of this wait, the Soviets bore the brunt of fighting the Nazis. By some estimates, half of all deaths in World War II were Soviets. The postwar conflicts over Central and Eastern Europe were already evident in the negotiations between Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States at Y alta and Potsdam in 1945. Roosevelt hoped that personal diplomacy might keep Stalin in check, but when Truman came to power, he quickly became suspicious of the Soviets.
Postwar Cooperation and the United Nations The founding of the 
United Nations in the fall of 1945 provided one hopeful sign for the future. The General Assembly of the United Nations was created to provide representation to all member nations, while the 15-member Security Council was given the primary responsibility within the UN for maintaining international security and authorizing peacekeeping missions. The five major allies of wartime—the United States, Great Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union—were granted permanent seats and veto power in the UN Security Council. Optimists hoped that these nations would be able to reach agreement on international issues. In addition, the Soviets went along with a U.S. proposal to establish an Atomic Energy Commission in the United Nations. They rejected, however, a plan proposed by Bernard Baruch for regulating nuclear energy and eliminating atomic weapons. American leaders interpreted rejection of the Baruch Plan as proof that Moscow did not have peaceful intentions.
The United States also offered the Soviets participation in the new 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (now commonly called the World Bank) created at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. The bank’s initial purpose was to fund rebuilding of a war-torn world. The Soviets, however, declined to participate because they viewed the bank as an instrument of capitalism. The Soviets did join the other Allies in the 1945–1946 Nuremberg trials of 22 top Nazi leaders for war crimes and violations of human rights.
Satellite States in Eastern Europe Distrust turned into hostility beginning 
in 1946, as Soviet forces remained in occupation of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Elections were held by the Soviets—as promised by Stalin at Y alta—but the results were manipulated in favor of Communist candidates. One by one, from 1946 to 1948, Communist dictators, most of them loyal to Moscow, came to power in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. Apologists for the Soviets argued that Russia needed buffer states or satellites  (nations under the control of a great power), as a protection 
against another Hitler-like invasion from the West.
583  TOPIC 8.2   THE COLD WAR FROM 1945 TO 1980The U.S. and British governments were alarmed by the Soviet takeover 
of Eastern Europe. They regarded Soviet actions there as a flagrant violation 
of self-determination, genuine democracy, and open markets. The British especially wanted free elections in Poland, whose independence had been the issue that started World War II.
Occupation Zones in Germany At the end of the war, the division of 
Germany and Austria into Soviet, French, British, and U.S. zones of occupation was meant to be only temporary. In Germany, however, the eastern zone under Soviet occupation gradually evolved into a new Communist state, the German Democratic Republic. The conflict over Germany was in part a conflict over differing views of national security and economic needs. The Soviets wanted a weak Germany for security reasons and large war reparations for economic reasons. The United States and Great Britain refused to allow reparations from their western zones because both viewed the economic recovery of Germany as important to the stability of Central Europe. The Soviets, fearing a restored Germany, tightened their control over East Germany. Also, since Berlin lay within their zone, they attempted to force the Americans, British, and French to give up their assigned sectors of the city.
Iron Curtain “I’m tired of babying the Soviets, ” Truman told Secretary 
of State James Byrnes in January 1946. News of a Canadian spy ring stealing atomic secrets for the Soviets and continued Soviet occupation of northern Iran further encouraged a get-tough policy in Washington.
In March 1946, in Fulton, Missouri, Truman was present on the speaker’s 
platform as former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill declared: “ An iron curtain has descended across the continent” of Europe. The Iron Curtain metaphor was later used throughout the Cold War to refer to the division between the U.S. allies in Western Europe and Soviet allies of Eastern Europe. Churchill’s “iron curtain” speech called for a partnership between Western democracies to halt the expansion of communism. Did the speech anticipate the Cold War—or help to cause it? Historians still debate this question.
Containment in Europe
Early in 1947, Truman adopted a containment policy designed to prevent 
Soviet expansion without starting a war. The plan, which would guide U.S. foreign policy for decades, was formulated by three top advisers: Secretary of State General George Marshall, Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson, and an expert on Soviet affairs, George F . Kennan. In an influential article, Kennan had written that only “a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies” would eventually cause the Soviets to back off their plan to spread communism and to live in peace with other nations.
Critics of the containment policy, such as journalist Walter Lippmann (who 
coined the term Cold War ), argued that it was too ambitious. He considered 
some areas vital to U.S. security and others merely peripheral. Further, some governments deserved U.S. support but others did not. American leaders, 
584 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONhowever, had learned the lesson of Munich (when leaders had given into 
demands by Hitler for land in 1938): appeasing dictators did not work. They felt that Communist aggression, wherever it occurred, must be challenged.
The Truman Doctrine
Truman first implemented the containment policy in response to two threats: (1) a Communist-led uprising against the government in Greece, and (2) Soviet demands for some control of a water route in Turkey, the Dardanelles. In what became known as the Truman Doctrine, the president asked Congress 
in March 1947 for $400 million in economic and military aid to assist the “free people” of Greece and Turkey against “totalitarian” regimes. While Truman’s alarmist speech might have oversimplified the situation in Greece and Turkey, it gained bipartisan support from Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
The Marshall Plan
After the war, Europe lay in ruins, short of food and deep in debt. The harsh winter of 1946–1947 further demoralized Europeans, who had already suffered through years of depression and war. Discontent encouraged the growth of the Communist Party, especially in France and Italy. The Truman administration feared that the Western democracies might vote the Communists into power.
In June 1947, George Marshall outlined an extensive program of U.S. 
economic aid to help European nations revive their economies and strengthen democratic governments. In December, Truman submitted to Congress a $17 billion European Recovery Program, better known as the Marshall Plan. In 1948, $12 billion in aid was approved for distribution to the countries of Western Europe over a four-year period. The United States offered Marshall Plan aid to the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites, but the Soviets refused it, fearing that it would lead to dependence on the United States.
Effects  The Marshall Plan worked exactly as Marshall and Truman had 
hoped. The massive infusion of U.S. dollars helped Western Europe achieve self-sustaining growth by the 1950s and ended any real threat of Communist political successes in that region. It also bolstered U.S. prosperity by greatly increasing U.S. exports to Europe. At the same time, however, it deepened the rift between the non-Communist West and the Communist East.
The Berlin Airlift
A major crisis of the Cold War focused on Berlin. In June 1948, the Soviets cut off all access by land to the German city. Truman dismissed any plans to withdraw from Berlin, but he also rejected using force to open up the roads through the Soviet-controlled eastern zone. Instead, he ordered U.S. planes to fly in supplies to the people of West Berlin. Day after day, week after week, the massive airlift continued. At the same time, Truman sent 60 bombers capable of carrying atomic bombs to bases in England. The world waited nervously for the outbreak of war, but Stalin decided not to challenge the airlift. (Truman’s stand on Berlin was partly responsible for his victory in the 1948 election.)
585  TOPIC 8.2   THE COLD WAR FROM 1945 TO 1980By May 1949, the Soviets finally opened up the highways to Berlin, thus 
bringing their 11-month blockade to an end. A major long-term consequence 
of the Berlin crisis was the creation of two Germanys: the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, a U.S. ally) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany, a Soviet satellite). Berlin, located within the GDR, also divided into sectors allied with the United States and the Soviets.
NATO and National Security
Ever since Washington’s farewell address of 1796, the United States had avoided permanent alliances with European nations. Truman broke with this tradition in 1949 by recommending that the United States join a military defense pact to protect Western Europe. The Senate readily gave its consent. Ten European nations joined the United States and Canada in creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a military alliance for defending all members from outside attack. Truman selected General Eisenhower as NATO’s first Supreme Commander and stationed U.S. troops in Western Europe as a deterrent against a Soviet invasion. Thus, the containment policy led to a military buildup and major commitments abroad. The Soviet Union countered in 1955 by forming the Warsaw Pact, a military alliance for the defense of the Communist states of Eastern Europe.

586 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONNational Security Act (1947) The United States had begun to modernize 
its military capability in 1947 by passing the National Security Act. It provided 
for (1) a centralized Department of Defense (replacing the War Department) 
to coordinate the operations of the army, navy, and air force; (2) the creation of the National Security Council (NSC) to coordinate the making of foreign policy; and (3) the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to gather information on foreign governments. In 1948, the Selective Service System and a peacetime military draft were instituted.
Atomic Weapons After the Berlin crisis, teams of scientists in both the 
Soviet Union and the United States were engaged in an intense competition—or arms race—to develop superior weapons systems. For a period of just four 
years (1945–1949), the United States was the only nation that had the atomic bomb. In this period it also developed a new generation of long-range bombers for delivering nuclear weapons.
The Soviets tested their first atomic bomb in the fall of 1949. Truman 
then approved the development of a bomb a thousand times more powerful than the A-bomb that had destroyed Hiroshima. In 1952, this hydrogen bomb (or H-bomb) was added to the U.S. arsenal. Earlier, in 1950, the National Security Council had recommended, in a secret report known as NSC-68, that the following measures were necessary to fight the Cold War:
• quadruple U.S. government defense spending to 20 percent of GNP
• convince the American public that a costly arms buildup was imperative for the nation’s defense
• form alliances with non-Communist countries around the world
Evaluating U.S. Policy Critics of NATO and the defense buildup argued 
that the Truman administration intensified Russian fears and started an unnecessary arms race. Regardless, NATO became one of the most successful military alliances in history. In combination with the deterrent power of nuclear weapons, NATO effectively checked Soviet expansion in Europe and thereby maintained an uneasy peace until the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
Cold War in Asia
The successful containment policy in Europe was not duplicated in Asia. Following World War II, the old imperialist system in India and Southeast Asia crumbled, as former colonies became new nations. Because they had different cultural and political traditions and bitter memories of Western colonialism, they resisted U.S. influence. Ironically, the Asian nation that became most closely tied to the U.S. defense system was its former enemy, Japan.
Japan
Unlike Germany, Japan was solely under the control of the United States. General Douglas MacArthur took firm charge of the reconstruction of Japan. 
Seven Japanese generals, including Premier Hideki Tojo, were tried for war 
587  TOPIC 8.2   THE COLD WAR FROM 1945 TO 1980crimes and executed. Under MacArthur’s guidance, the new constitution 
adopted in May 1947 set up a parliamentary democracy. It retained Emperor Hirohito as the ceremonial head of state, but the emperor gave up his claims to divinity. The new constitution also renounced war as an instrument of national policy and provided for only limited military capability. As a result, Japan depended on the military protection of the United States.
U.S.-Japanese Security Treaties With the signing of treaties in 1951, Japan 
gave up its claims to Korea and some Pacific islands. The United States ended its occupation of Japan, but U.S. troops remained in military bases in Japan for that country’s protection against external enemies, particularly Communists. Japan became a strong ally and prospered under the American shield.
The Philippines and the Pacific
On July 4, 1946, in accordance with an act passed by Congress in 1934, the Philippines became an independent republic, but the United States retained important naval and air bases there throughout the Cold War. These bases, together with U.S. control of the UN trustee islands taken from Japan at the end of the war, began to make the Pacific Ocean look like an American lake.
China
Since coming to power in the late 1920s, Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jie-shi) had used his command of the Nationalist, or Kuomintang, party to control China’s central government. During World War II, the United States had given massive military aid to Chiang to prevent all of China from being conquered by Japan. As soon as the war ended, a civil war dating back to the 1930s was renewed between Chiang’s Nationalists and the Chinese Communists led by Mao Zedong . The Nationalists were losing the loyalty of millions of Chinese 
because of runaway inflation and widespread corruption, while the well-organized Communists successfully appealed to poor, landless peasants.
U.S. Policy The Truman administration sent George Marshall to China in 
1946 to negotiate an end to the civil war, but his compromise fell apart in a few months. By 1947, Chiang’s armies were in retreat. After ruling out a large-scale American invasion to rescue Chiang, Truman seemed unsure of what to do. In 1948, Congress voted to give the Nationalist government $400 million in aid, but 80 percent of the U.S. military supplies ended up in Communist hands because of corruption and the collapse of the Nationalist armies.
Two Chinas By the end of 1949, all of mainland China was controlled by 
the Communists. Chiang and the Nationalists had retreated to an island once under Japanese rule, Formosa (Taiwan ). From there, Chiang still claimed to 
head the legitimate government for all of China. The United States continued to support Chiang and refused to recognize Mao Zedong’s regime in Beijing (the People’s Republic of China) until 30 years later, in 1979.
In the United States, Republicans blamed the Democrats for the “loss of 
China” to Communism. In 1950, Stalin and Mao signed a Sino-Soviet pact. This added to fears of a worldwide Communist conspiracy.
588 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Korean War
After the defeat of Japan, its former colony Korea was divided along the 38th 
parallel  by the victors. Soviet armies occupied Korean territory north of the 
line, while U.S. forces occupied territory to the south. By 1949, both armies 
were withdrawn, leaving the North in the hands of the Communist leader Kim Il Sung and the South under the conservative nationalist Syngman Rhee.
Invasion On June 25, 1950, the North Korean army surprised the world, 
possibly even Moscow, by invading South Korea. Truman took immediate action, applying his containment policy to this latest crisis in Asia. He called for a special session of the UN Security Council. Taking advantage of a temporary boycott by the Soviet delegation, the Security Council under U.S. leadership authorized a UN force to defend South Korea against the invaders. Although other nations participated in this force, U.S. troops made up most of the UN forces sent to help the South Korean army. Commanding the expedition was General Douglas MacArthur. Congress supported the use of U.S. troops in the Korean crisis but failed to declare war, accepting Truman’s characterization of U.S. intervention as merely a “police action. ”
Counterattack At first the war in Korea went badly, as the North Koreans 
pushed the combined South Korean and U.S. forces to the tip of the peninsula. However, General MacArthur reversed the war with a daring amphibious assault at Inchon behind the North Korean lines. UN forces then proceeded to destroy much of the North Korean army, advancing northward almost as far as the Chinese border. MacArthur failed to heed China’s warnings that it would resist threats to its security. In November 1950, masses of Chinese troops crossed the border into Korea, overwhelming UN forces and driving them out of North Korea.
Truman Versus MacArthur MacArthur stabilized the fighting near the 
38th parallel. At the same time, he called for expanding the war, including bombing and invading mainland China. As commander in chief, Truman cautioned MacArthur about making public statements that suggested criticism of official U.S. policy. The general spoke out anyway. In April 1951, Truman, with the support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recalled MacArthur for insubordination.
MacArthur returned home as a hero. Most Americans understood his 
statement, “There is no substitute for victory, ” better than the president’s containment policy and concept of “limited war. ” Critics attacked Truman and the Democrats as appeasers for not trying to destroy communism in Asia.
Stalemate In Korea, neither side seemed able to win. Fighting was stalled 
along a front just north of the 38th parallel. At the city of Panmunjom, peace talks began in July 1951. 
Political Consequences From the perspective of the grand strategy 
of the Cold War, Truman’s containment policy in Korea worked. It stopped Communist aggression without allowing the conflict to develop into a world war. The Truman administration used the Korean War  as justification for 
589  TOPIC 8.2   THE COLD WAR FROM 1945 TO 1980dramatically expanding the military, funding a new jet bomber (the B-52), and 
stationing more U.S. troops in overseas bases.
However, Republicans were far from satisfied. The stalemate in Korea 
and the success of Mao in China led Republicans to characterize Truman and the Democrats as “soft on communism. ” They attacked leading Democrats as members of “Dean Acheson’s Cowardly College of Communist Containment. ” (In 1949, Acheson had replaced George Marshall as secretary of state.) The Republicans went on to win the presidential race in 1952 with former General Dwight Eisenhower.

Eisenhower and the Cold War
President Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953–1961) focused in both his terms on 
foreign policy and the international crises arising from the Cold War. The experienced diplomat who helped to shape U.S. foreign policy throughout Eisenhower’s presidency was Secretary of State John Foster Dulles.
590 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONDulles’s Diplomacy Dulles had been critical of Truman’s containment 
policy as too passive. He advocated a “new look” to U.S. foreign policy that took 
the initiative in challenging the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China. He talked of “liberating captive nations” of Eastern Europe and encouraging the Nationalist government of Taiwan to assert itself against “Red” (Communist) China. Dulles pleased conservatives—and alarmed many others—by declaring that, if the United States pushed Communist powers to the brink of war, they would back down because of American nuclear superiority. His hard line became known as brinkmanship. In the end, however, Eisenhower prevented Dulles from carrying his ideas to an extreme.
Massive Retaliation Dulles advocated relying more on nuclear weapons 
and air power and spending less on conventional military forces. This might save money (“more bang for the buck”), help balance the federal budget, and increase pressure on potential enemies. In 1953, the United States developed the hydrogen bomb, which could destroy the largest cities. Within a year, however, the Soviets caught up with a hydrogen bomb of their own. To some, the policy of massive retaliation looked more like a policy for mutual annihilation. 
Nuclear weapons indeed proved a powerful deterrent against the superpowers fighting an all-out war between themselves. 
However, such weapons did not prevent superpower involvement in small 
“brushfire” wars in the developing nations of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. With the United States and the Soviet backing opposing sides, these conflicts could expand, resulting in hundreds of thousands of casualties. But the superpowers, fearing escalation, refused to use even small nuclear weapons in these wars.
Korean Armistice Soon after taking office in 1953, Eisenhower kept his 
promise to go to Korea to visit UN forces and try to end the war. He understood that no quick fix was likely. Even so, diplomacy, the threat of nuclear war, and the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 finally moved China and North Korea to agree to an armistice and an exchange of prisoners in July 1953. The fighting stopped and most (but not all) U.S. troops were withdrawn. Korea remained divided near the 38th parallel, without a permanent peace treaty. More than 2.5 million people died in the Korean conflict, including 36,914 Americans.
U.S.–Soviet Relations
For U.S. security, nothing was more crucial than U.S. diplomatic relations with its chief political and military rival, the Soviet Union. Throughout Eisenhower’s presidency, the relations between the two superpowers fluctuated between periods of relative calm and extreme tension.
Spirit of Geneva After Stalin’s death, Eisenhower called for a slowdown in 
the arms race and presented to the United Nations an “atoms for peace” plan. The Soviets also showed signs of wanting to reduce Cold War tensions. They withdrew their troops from Austria (once that country had agreed to be neutral in the Cold War) and established peaceful relations with Greece and Turkey. 
591  TOPIC 8.2   THE COLD WAR FROM 1945 TO 1980By 1955, a desire for improved relations on both sides resulted in a summit 
meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, between Eisenhower and the new Soviet 
premier, Nikolai Bulganin. At this conference, the U.S. president proposed an “open-skies” policy  over each other’s territory—open to aerial photography 
by the opposing nation—in order to eliminate the chance of a surprise nuclear attack. The Soviets rejected the proposal. Nevertheless, the “spirit of Geneva,”  as the press called it, produced the first thaw in the Cold War. Even more encouraging, from the U.S. point of view, was a speech by the new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in early 1956 in which he denounced the crimes of Joseph Stalin and supported “peaceful coexistence” with the West.
Hungarian Revolt  The relaxation in the Cold War encouraged workers 
in East Germany and Poland to demand reforms from their Communist governments. In October 1956, a popular uprising in Hungary actually succeeded in overthrowing a government backed by Moscow. The new, more liberal leaders wanted to pull Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact, the Communist security organization. This was too much for the Kremlin, and Khrushchev sent in Soviet tanks to crush the freedom fighters and restore control over Hungary. The United States took no action in the crisis. Eisenhower feared that sending troops to aid the Hungarians would touch off a major war in Europe. In effect, by allowing Soviet tanks to roll into Hungary, the United States gave de facto recognition to the Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe and ended Dulles’s talk of “liberating” this region. Soviet suppression of the Hungarian revolt  also ended the first thaw in the Cold War.
Sputnik Shock In 1957, the Soviet Union shocked the United States by 
launching the first satellites, Sputnik I and  Sputnik II , into orbit around the 
earth. Suddenly, the technological leadership of the United States was open to question. To add to American embarrassment, U.S. rockets designed to duplicate the Soviet achievement failed repeatedly. 
What was responsible for this scientific debacle? Critics attacked American 
schools for their math and science instruction and failure to produce more scientists and engineers. In 1958, Congress responded with the National Defense and Education Act (NDEA), which authorized hundreds of millions of federal dollars for schools for math, science, and foreign language education. 
Also in 1958, Congress created the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) to direct the U.S. efforts to build missiles and explore outer space. Billions were appropriated to compete with the Russians in the space race.
Fears of nuclear war were intensified by Sputnik.  The missiles that launched 
the satellites could also deliver thermonuclear warheads anywhere in the world in minutes, and there was no defense against them.
Second Berlin Crisis “We will bury capitalism, ” Khrushchev boasted. 
With new confidence and pride based on Sputnik, the Soviet leader pushed the Berlin issue in 1958. He gave the West six months to pull its troops out of West Berlin before turning over the city to the East Germans. The United 
592 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONStates refused to yield. To defuse the crisis, Eisenhower invited Khrushchev 
to visit the United States in 1959. At the presidential retreat of Camp David in Maryland, the two agreed to put off the crisis and scheduled another summit conference in Paris for 1960.
U-2 Incident The friendly “spirit of Camp David” never had a chance to 
produce results. Two weeks before the planned meeting in Paris, the Russians shot down a high-altitude U.S. spy plane—the U-2—over the Soviet Union. The incident exposed a secret U.S. tactic for gaining information. After its open-skies proposals had been rejected by the Soviets in 1955, the United States had decided to conduct regular spy flights over Soviet territory to find out about its enemy’s missile program. Eisenhower took full responsibility for the flights—after  they were exposed by the U-2 incident—but his honesty proved to be a 
diplomatic mistake. Khrushchev denounced the United States and walked out of the Paris summit, temporarily ending the thaw in the Cold War.
Communism in Cuba
Perhaps more alarming than any other Cold War development during the Eisenhower years was the emergence of Cuba  as a Communist country. A 
bearded revolutionary, Fidel Castro , overthrew the Cuban dictator Fulgencio 
Batista in 1959. At first, no one knew whether Castro’s politics would be better or worse than those of his ruthless predecessor. Once in power, however, Castro nationalized American-owned businesses and properties in Cuba. Eisenhower retaliated by cutting off U.S. trade with Cuba. 
Castro then turned to the Soviets for support. He also revealed that he 
was a Marxist and soon proved it by setting up a Communist totalitarian state. Fearing communism only 90 miles off the shores of Florida, Eisenhower authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to train anti-Communist Cuban exiles so they could invade the island and overthrow Castro. However, the decision to go ahead with the invasion would be the responsibility of the next president, John F . Kennedy.
Eisenhower’s Legacy
After leaving the White House, Eisenhower claimed credit for checking Communist aggression and keeping the peace without the loss of American lives in combat. He also started the long process of relaxing tensions with the Soviet Union. In 1958, he initiated the first arms limitations by voluntarily suspending aboveground testing of nuclear weapons.
“Military-Industrial Complex” In his farewell address as president, 
Eisenhower spoke out against the negative impact of the Cold War on U.S. society. He warned the nation to “guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence . . . by the military-industrial complex. ” He feared the arms race was taking on a momentum and logic all its own. It seemed to some Americans in the 1960s that the United States was in danger of going down the path of classical Rome by turning into a military, or imperial, state.
593  TOPIC 8.2   THE COLD WAR FROM 1945 TO 1980To the Brink of War and Back
In 1960, John F . Kennedy was elected president after attacking the Eisenhower 
administration for the recent recession and for permitting the Soviets to take the lead in the arms race. In reality, what Kennedy called a “missile gap” was actually in the U.S. favor, but his charges seemed plausible after Sputnik.
Bay of Pigs Invasion The youthful Kennedy made a major blunder shortly 
after entering office. He approved a plan to use Cuban exiles to overthrow Castro’s regime. In April 1961, the CIA-trained force of Cubans landed at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba but failed to set off a general uprising as planned. Trapped on the beach, the anti-Castro Cubans surrendered after Kennedy rejected the idea of using U.S. forces to save them. Castro used the failed invasion to get more aid from the Soviet Union and to strengthen his grip on power.
Berlin Wall Trying to shake off the embarrassment of the Bay of Pigs 
defeat, Kennedy agreed to meet Soviet premier Khrushchev in Vienna in the summer of 1961. Khrushchev seized the opportunity to threaten the president by renewing Soviet demands that the United States pull its troops out of Berlin. Kennedy refused. In August, the East Germans, with Soviet backing, built a wall around West Berlin. Its purpose was to stop East Germans from fleeing to West Germany. As the wall was being built, Soviet and U.S. tanks faced off in Berlin. Kennedy called up the reserves, but he made no move to stop the completion of the wall. In 1963, the president traveled to West Berlin to assure its residents of continuing U.S. support. To cheering crowds, he proclaimed: “Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect, but we have never had to put up a wall to keep our people in. . . . As a free man, I take pride in the words, ‘Ich bin ein Berliner’ [I am a Berliner]. ” The Berlin Wall stood as a gloomy symbol of the Cold War until it was torn down by rebellious East Germans in 1989.
Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) The most dangerous moment in U.S.-Soviet 
relations came in October 1962. In response to the Bay of Pigs invasion, Castro invited the Soviets to build underground missile sites that could launch offensive missiles capable of reaching the United States in minutes. The Soviets agreed. U.S. reconnaissance planes soon discovered evidence of construction. Kennedy responded by announcing to the world that he was setting up a naval blockade of Cuba until the weapons were removed. If Soviet ships challenged the U.S. naval blockade, a full-scale nuclear war between the superpowers might result. After 13 days of tension, Khrushchev finally agreed to remove the missiles from Cuba in exchange for Kennedy’s pledge not to invade the island nation and to later remove some U.S. missiles from Turkey.
The Cuban missile crisis had a sobering effect on both sides. They soon 
established a telecommunications hotline between Washington and Moscow so the countries’ leaders could talk directly during a crisis. In 1963, the Soviet Union and the United States—along with nearly 100 other nations—signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to end the testing of nuclear weapons in the 
atmosphere. This first step in controlling the testing of nuclear arms was offset by a new round in the arms race for developing missile and warhead superiority.

Flexible Response Many “brushfire wars” in Africa and Southeast Asia 
were a different Cold War challenge. Often, insurgent forces aided by Soviet 
arms and training challenged an existing government with ties to the United States. Such conflicts in the Congo in Africa and in Laos and Vietnam in Southeast Asia convinced the Kennedy administration to rethink Dulles’s idea of massive retaliation and reliance on nuclear weapons. Kennedy and his Defense Secretary, Robert S. McNamara, wanted options less likely to escalate into global destruction. They increased spending on conventional (nonnuclear) arms and mobile military forces. While this flexible-response policy reduced 
the risk of using nuclear weapons, it also increased the temptation to send elite special forces, such as the Green Berets, into combat all over the globe.
Lyndon Johnson Becomes President 
After less than three years in office, President Kennedy was assassinated during a visit to Texas (Topic 8.5). Kennedy’s vice president, Lyndon Johnson, was a former leader of the Senate who was more interested in domestic reforms to further the New Deal than in foreign policy. However, Johnson (1963–1969) continued the containment policy that called upon the United States to block Communist expansion around the globe, including in Vietnam. His escalation of the Vietnam War (Topic 8.8) came to dominate the foreign policy of his administration. However, he continued to engage the Soviets on other fronts.
Despite the Vietnam War, President Johnson did negotiate agreements with 
the Soviet Union to control nuclear weapons. In the later 1960s, as a result of the costly arms race and its worsening relationship with China, the Soviet Union sought closer relations with the United States. The Johnson administration signed the Outer Space Treaty and laid the foundation for the Strategic Arms 
595  TOPIC 8.2   THE COLD WAR FROM 1945 TO 1980Limitation Talks. In July 1968, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union 
signed the  Non-Proliferation Treaty, in which each signatory agreed not to 
help other countries develop or acquire nuclear weapons. A planned U.S.–Soviet nuclear disarmament summit was scuttled after Soviet forces violently suppressed the Prague Spring, an attempt to democratize Czechoslovakia. The ebbs and flows in the Cold War revealed that it was a complex chess game, and the next president proved a dedicated player.
Nixon’s Detente Diplomacy 
In his January 1969 inaugural address, President Richard M. Nixon (1969–1974) promised to bring Americans together after the turmoil of the 1960s. Nixon’s first interest was international relations, not domestic policy. Together with his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger (who became secretary of state during Nixon’s second term), Nixon fashioned a realist or pragmatic foreign policy that ended the war in Vietnam (Topic 8.8) and reduced the tensions of the Cold War.
Détente  Nixon and Kissinger strengthened the U.S. position in the 
world by taking advantage of the rivalry between the two Communist giants, China and the Soviet Union. Their diplomacy was praised for bringing about détente —a deliberate reduction of Cold War tensions. Even after Watergate 
ended his presidency in disgrace, Nixon’s critics would admit that his conduct of foreign affairs had enhanced world peace.
Visit to China Nixon had long been a fierce critic of communism. Because 
of this, he could stake the bold step of improving relations with Mao Zedong’s Communist regime in “Red” China without being condemned as “soft” on communism. After a series of secret negotiations with Chinese leaders, Nixon astonished the world in February 1972 by traveling to Beijing to meet with Mao. His visit initiated diplomatic exchanges that ultimately led to U.S. recognition of the Communist government in 1979.
Arms Control with the U.S.S.R. Nixon used his new relationship with 
China to pressure the Soviets to agree to a treaty limiting antiballistic missiles (ABMs), a new technology that would have expanded the arms race. After the first round of Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT I), U.S. diplomats secured Soviet consent to a freeze on the number of ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads. While this agreement did not end the arms race, it was a significant step toward reducing Cold War tensions and bringing about détente.
Another Chill in the Cold War
The resignation of President Nixon (Topic 8.14) in August 1974 puzzled both allies and enemies. After Nixon’s Watergate scandal and the fall of South Vietnam in 1975 many Americans lost trust in their government. Presidents faced strong opposition in Congress against further military interventions. During Ford’s term (1974–1977), the Democratic Congress continued to investigate abuses in the executive branch, especially in the CIA. This intelligence agency was 
596 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONaccused of engineering the assassinations of foreign leaders, among them the 
Marxist president of Chile, Salvador Allende. Ford appointed a former member of Congress, George H. W . Bush, to reform the agency.
Soviets Invade Afghanistan President Jimmy Carter (1977–1981) 
attempted to continue the Nixon-Ford policy of détente with China and the Soviet Union. In 1979, the United States ended its recognition of the Nationalist government in Taiwan as the official government of China and completed the first exchange of ambassadors with the People’s Republic of China. At first, détente also moved ahead with the Soviet Union with the signing in 1979 of the SALT II treaty, which provided for limiting the size of each superpower’s nuclear delivery system. The Senate never ratified the treaty, however, as a result of a renewal of Cold War tensions over Afghanistan.
In December 1979, Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan—an aggressive 
action that ended a decade of improving U.S.–Soviet relations. The United States feared that the invasion might lead to a Soviet move to control the oil-rich Persian Gulf. Carter reacted by (1) placing an embargo on grain exports and the sale of high technology to the Soviet Union, and (2) boycotting the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. After having campaigned for arms reduction, Carter now had to switch to an arms buildup.
A Return to Tension At the end of Carter’s administration, relations with 
the Soviet Union were back to a period of confrontation. Topic 9.3 will trace the arms race with the Soviet Union during the Reagan administration and the steps that led to the breakup of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.
Views of the Cold War Among U.S. historians, the traditional view of the 
origins of the Cold War is that the Soviet government under Stalin started the conflict by subjugating the countries of Eastern Europe in the late 1940s. The United States was viewed as the defender of the free world. 
In the 1960s, during the time of public unhappiness over the Vietnam 
War, revisionist historians began to argue that the United States contributed to starting the Cold War. They blamed Truman for antagonizing the Soviets with his blunt challenge of their actions in Poland and the Balkans. Gar Alperovitz (The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb, 1995) concluded that Truman had dropped atomic bombs on Japan primarily to warn Stalin to remove his troops from Eastern Europe. 
In the 21st century, John L. Gaddis (The Cold War: A New History, 2005), 
recognized by some as “the dean of Cold War historians, ” argued that the causes of the Cold War were rooted in the Big Three’s failure “to reconcile divergent political objectives even as they pursued a common military task” during World War II. Gaddis suggested that objective observers would not have expected a different outcome given that great power rivalries are the normal pattern in history. Gaddis concluded that the most important aspect of the Cold War is what did not happen—a nuclear holocaust.

Soviet Union must be that of a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies. . . .

Topic 8.3
The Red Scare
There are today many Communists in America. They are everywhere—in 
factories, offices, butcher stores, on street corners, in private businesses. 
And each carries in himself the germ of death for society.
J. Howard McGrath, U.S. Attorney General, 1949–1952
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the Red Scare 
after World War II.
Just as a Red Scare had followed U.S. victory in World War I, a second Red 
Scare followed U.S. victory in World War II. The Truman administration’s 
tendency to see a Communist conspiracy behind civil wars in Europe and Asia contributed to the belief that Communist conspirators and spies had infiltrated American society, including the U.S. State Department and the U.S. military.
Rooting Out Communists
In 1947, the Truman administration—under pressure from Republican critics—set up a Loyalty Review Board to investigate the background of more than 3 million federal employees. Thousands of officials and civil service employees either resigned or lost their jobs in a probe that went on for four years (1947–1951).
Prosecutions Under the Smith Act In addition, leaders of the American 
Communist Party were jailed for advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government. In the case of Dennis et al. v. United States (1951), the Supreme 
Court upheld the constitutionality of the Smith Act of 1940, which made it 
illegal to advocate or teach the overthrow of the government by force or to belong to an organization with this objective.
McCarran Internal Security Act (1950) Over Truman’s veto, Congress 
passed the McCarran Internal Security Act, which (1) made it unlawful to advocate or support the establishment of a totalitarian government, (2) restricted the employment and travel of those joining Communist-front organizations, and (3) authorized the creation of detention camps for subversives.
Un-American Activities In the House of Representatives, the House  
Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), originally established in 1939 to seek out Nazis, was reactivated in the postwar years to find Communists. The committee not only investigated government officials but also looked 
601  TOPIC 8.3   THE RED SCAREfor Communist influence in such organizations as the Boy Scouts and in the 
Hollywood film industry. Actors, directors, and writers were called before the committee to testify. Those who refused to testify were tried for contempt of Congress. Others were blacklisted from the industry, meaning no one would hire them.
Cultural Impact The second Red Scare had a chilling effect on freedom 
of expression. Creators of the gritty film noir crime dramas and playwrights such as Arthur Miller (Death of a Salesman, 1949) came under attack as anti-American. Rodgers and Hammerstein’s musical South Pacific (1949) was criticized, especially by Southern politicians, as a Communistic assault on racial segregation. Loyalty oaths were commonly required of writers and teachers as a condition of employment. The American Civil Liberties Union and other opponents of these security measures argued that the First Amendment protected the free expression of unpopular political views and membership in political groups, including the Communist Party.
Artists and writers responded. Shirley Jackson’s short story “The Lottery” 
(1948) is about a town whose citizens blindly accept a tradition even though it has deadly consequences. When called to testify before the HUAC in 1952, playwright Lillian Hellman refused, saying, “I cannot and will not cut my conscience to fit this year’s fashions, ” for which she was blacklisted. Arthur Miller’s play The Crucible  (1953), about the Salem witch trials, was a thinly 
veiled metaphor for the government’s persecution of suspected Communists.
Espionage Cases
The fear of a Communist conspiracy bent on world conquest was supported by a series of actual cases of Communist espionage in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States. The methods used to identify Communist spies, however, raised serious questions about whether the government was going too far and violating civil liberties in the process.
Hiss Case A star witness for the House Un-American Activities Committee 
in 1948 was Whittaker Chambers, who was a Communist. His testimony, along with the investigative work of a young member of Congress from California named Richard Nixon, led to the trial of Alger Hiss. Hiss was a prominent official in the State Department who had assisted Roosevelt at the Y alta Conference. He denied the accusations that he was a Communist and had given secret documents to Chambers. In 1950, however, he was convicted of perjury and sent to prison. Many Americans could not help wondering whether the highest levels of government were infiltrated by Communist spies.
Rosenberg Case When the Soviets tested their first atomic bomb in 
1949, many Americans were convinced that spies had helped them to steal the technology from the United States. Klaus Fuchs, a British scientist who had worked on the Manhattan Project, admitted giving A-bomb secrets to the Russians. An FBI investigation traced another spy ring to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg  in New Y ork. After a controversial trial in 1951, the Rosenbergs 
602 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONwere found guilty of treason and executed in 1953. Civil rights groups charged 
that anti-Communist hysteria was responsible for the conviction and execution of the Rosenbergs.
The Rise and Fall of Joseph McCarthy
Joseph McCarthy, a Republican senator from Wisconsin, used the growing concern over communism to advance his political career. In a speech in 1950, he claimed to have a list of 205 Communists who were working for the State Department. (In other speeches the number varied.) As the press publicized this sensational, though unproven, accusation, McCarthy became one of the most powerful leaders in America. Other politicians feared the damage McCarthy could do if he pointed his accusing finger toward them.
McCarthy’s Tactics Senator McCarthy used a steady stream of 
unsupported accusations about Communists in government to keep the media focus on himself and to discredit the Truman administration. Working-class Americans at first loved his “take the gloves off ” hard-hitting remarks, which were often aimed at the wealthy and privileged in society. While many Republicans disliked McCarthy’s ruthless tactics, he was primarily hurting the Democrats before the election of Eisenhower to the presidency in 1952. He became so popular, however, that even Eisenhower would not dare to defend his old friend, George Marshall, against McCarthy’s untruths.
Army-McCarthy Hearings In 1954, McCarthy’s “reckless cruelty” was 
finally exposed on television. A Senate committee held televised hearings on Communist infiltration in the army, and McCarthy was seen as a bully by millions of viewers. In December, Republicans joined Democrats in a Senate censure of McCarthy. The “witch hunt” for Communists (McCarthyism) had played itself out. Three years later, McCarthy died a broken man.
Decline of the Red Scare The Red Scare after World War II ran out of 
steam as it became clear that the fear of a Communist takeover of the United States was overblown. Cooler heads, including President Eisenhower, gained control of the political dialogue. However, the language, tactics, and threats of McCarthyism remained a concern for democracy whenever politics became bitter and partisan. Americans also pushed the fear of communism into the background after the Korean War armistice as average Americans enjoyed the booming economy of the 1950s (Topic 8.4).

“The United States Senate has long enjoyed the worldwide respect. . . . But

The American people are sick and tired of being afraid to speak their

Topic 8.4
Economy after 1945
America at this moment stands at the summit of the world.
British Prime Minster Winton Churchill, 1945
Learning Objectives 1 : Explain the causes of economic growth in years 
after World War II. 
Learning Objectives 2 : Explain causes and effects of the migrations of 
various groups of Americans after 1945.
The 15 million American military members returning to civilian life in 1945 
and 1946 needed to find jobs and housing. Many feared that the war's end would 
bring back economic hard times. Happily, the fears were not realized because the war years had increased the per-capita income of Americans. Much of that income was tucked away in savings accounts, since wartime shortages meant there had been few consumer goods to buy. The pent-up consumer demand for autos and housing combined with government roadbuilding and other projects quickly overcame the economic uncertainty after the war and introduced an era of unprecedented prosperity and economic growth. By the 1950s, Americans enjoyed the highest standard of living achieved by any society in history.
Postwar Economy
President Harry S. Truman (1945–1953) was thrust into the presidency after 
Franklin Roosevelt’s death in April 1945, Truman matured into a decisive leader whose basic honesty and unpretentious style appealed to average citizens. He attempted to continue the New Deal economic policies of his predecessor but faced growing conservative opposition.
Employment Act of 1946 In September 1945, in the same week that 
Japan formally surrendered, Truman urged Congress to enact a series of progressive measures. Among these were national health insurance, an increase in the minimum wage, and a government commitment to maintaining full employment. After much debate, a watered-down version of the full-employment bill was enacted as the Employment Act of 1946. It created the 
Council of Economic Advisers to advise the president and Congress on means of promoting national economic welfare. Over the next seven years, a coalition of Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats, combined with the beginning of the Cold War, hindered passage of Truman’s domestic program.
606 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONGI Bill—Help for Veterans The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act  of 1944, 
popularly known as the GI Bill of Rights (or just GI Bill), proved powerful 
support during the transition of 15 million veterans to a peacetime economy. It helped more than 2 million GIs attend college and more than 5 million more receive other training, creating a postwar boom in post-high school education. The veterans also received more than $16 billion in low-interest, government-backed loans to buy homes and farms and to start businesses. By focusing on a better-educated workforce and also promoting new construction, the federal government stimulated the postwar economic expansion.
However, these government benefits helped White veterans far more than 
Black veterans. For example, most African Americans returned to their homes in the South. Since most universities in the region did not admit Black students, fewer could use the educational benefits. Further, many banks refused to make loans to African Americans. While the GI Bill helped the economy overall, it also increased the racial wealth gap.
Baby Boom One sign of the confidence among young people was an 
explosion in marriages and births. Earlier marriages and larger families resulted in 50 million babies entering the U.S. population between 1945 and 1960. As the baby boom  generation gradually passed from childhood to adolescence to 
adulthood, it profoundly affected the nation’s social institutions and economic life in the last half of the 20th century. Initially, the baby boom tended to focus women’s attention on raising children and homemaking. Nevertheless, the trend of more women in the workplace continued. By 1960, one-third of all married women worked outside the home.
Suburban Growth The high demand for housing after the war resulted in 
a construction boom. William J. Levitt led in the development of postwar suburbia with his building and promotion of Levittown , a project of 17,000 
mass-produced, low-priced family homes on Long Island, New Y ork. Low interest rates on mortgages that were both government insured and tax deductible made the move from city to suburb affordable for even families of modest means. In a single generation, the majority of middle-class Americans became suburbanites. 
Levittown, Long Island, New Y ork, c. 1948. 
Source: photos.com

607  TOPIC 8.4   ECONOMY AFTER 1945However, Levittown was only for White families. African American 
families were not allowed to buy homes there. At that time, federal government 
policies, which subsidized loans for many people purchasing homes all over the country, supported segregation in housing. 
For many older inner cities, the effect of the mass movement to suburbia 
was disastrous. By the 1960s, cities from Boston to Los Angeles became increasingly poor and racially divided.
Rise of the Sun Belt Uprooted by the war, millions of Americans moved 
more frequently in the postwar era. A warmer climate, lower taxes, and economic opportunities in defense-related industries attracted many GIs and their families to the Sun Belt states from Florida to California. By transferring 
tax dollars from the Northeast and Midwest to the South and West, military spending during the Cold War helped finance the shift of industry, people, and ultimately political power from one region to the other.
Inflation and Strikes Truman urged Congress to continue the price 
controls of wartime in order to hold inflation in check. Instead, Southern Democrats joined with Republicans to relax the controls of the Office of Price Administration. The result was an inflation rate of almost 25 percent during the first year and a half of peace.
Workers and unions wanted wages to catch up after years of wage controls. 
More than 4.5 million workers went on strike in 1946. Strikes by railroad and mine workers threatened the national safety. Truman took a tough approach to this challenge, seizing the mines and using soldiers to keep them operating until the United Mine Workers finally called off its strike.
Truman versus the Republican Congress
Unhappy with inflation and strikes, voters were in a conservative mood in the fall of 1946 when they elected Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. Under Republican control, the 80th Congress attempted to pass two tax cuts for upper-income Americans, but Truman vetoed both measures. More successful were Republican efforts to amend the Constitution and roll back some of the New Deal gains for labor.
Twenty-Second Amendment (1951) Reacting against the election 
of Roosevelt as president four times, the Republican-dominated Congress proposed a constitutional amendment to limit a president to a maximum of two full terms in office. The 22nd Amendment was ratified by the states in 1951.
Taft-Hartley Act (1947) In 1947, Congress passed the probusiness Taft-
Hartley Act. Truman vetoed the measure as a “slave-labor” bill, but Congress overrode his veto. The one purpose of the Republican-sponsored law was to check the growing power of unions. Its provisions included the following:
• outlawing the closed shop (requiring workers to join a union before  
being hired)
608 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION• permitting states to pass “right to work” laws outlawing the union shop 
(requiring workers to join a union after  being hired)
• outlawing secondary boycotts (the practice of several unions supporting a striking union by joining a boycott of a company’s products)
• giving the president the power to invoke an 80-day cooling-off period before a strike endangering the national safety could be called
For years afterward, unions sought unsuccessfully to repeal the Taft-Hartley 
Act. The act became a major issue dividing Republicans and Democrats in the 1950s.
The Election of 1948 Truman’s popularity was at a low point as the 1948 
presidential campaign began. Republicans were confident of victory, especially after both a liberal faction (Progressive Party) and a conservative faction (Dixiecrats) in the Democratic Party abandoned Truman to organize their own third parties. The Republicans once again nominated New Y ork governor Thomas E. Dewey. Meanwhile, the man without a chance toured the nation by rail, attacking the “do-nothing” Republican 80th Congress with “give ’ em hell” speeches. The feisty Truman confounded the polling experts with a decisive victory over Dewey, winning the popular vote by 2 million votes and winning the electoral vote 303 to 189. 
The Fair Deal Truman launched an ambitious reform program, which 
he called the Fair Deal. In 1949, he urged Congress to enact national health insurance, federal aid to education, civil rights legislation, funds for public housing, and a new farm program. Conservatives in Congress blocked most of the proposed reforms, except for an increase in the minimum wage (from 40 to 75 cents an hour) and the inclusion of more workers under Social Security.
Most of the Fair Deal bills were defeated for two reasons: (1) Truman’s 
political conflicts with Congress, and (2) the pressing foreign policy concerns of the Cold War. Nevertheless, liberal defenders of Truman praised him for at least maintaining the New Deal reforms of his predecessor and making civil rights part of the liberal agenda.
Eisenhower in the White House (1953–1961)
Much as Franklin Roosevelt dominated the 1930s, President Dwight D. Eisenhower (“Ike”) personified the 1950s. The Republican campaign slogan, “I Like Ike, ” expressed the genuine feelings of millions of middle-class Americans. They liked his winning smile and trusted and admired the former general who had successfully commanded Allied forces in Europe in World War II.
The Election of 1952 The last year of Truman’s presidency, Americans 
were looking for relief from the Korean War and an end to “the mess in Washington. ” Republicans looked forward with relish to their first presidential victory in 20 years, and nominated the leader of allied forces in Europe, General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Senator Richard Nixon of California as his running 
609  TOPIC 8.4   ECONOMY AFTER 1945mate. The Democrats selected popular Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson, who 
confronted McCarthyism. Eisenhower’s pledge to go to Korea and end the war helped the Republicans win 55 percent of the popular vote and an Electoral College landslide of 442 to Stevenson’s 89.
As president, Eisenhower adopted a style of leadership that emphasized the 
delegation of authority. He filled his cabinet with successful corporate executives who gave his administration a businesslike tone. His secretary of defense, for example, was Charles Wilson, the former head of General Motors. Eisenhower was often criticized by the press for spending too much time golfing and fishing and perhaps entrusting important decisions to others. However, later research showed that behind the scenes Eisenhower was in charge.
Modern Republicanism Eisenhower was a fiscal conservative whose first 
priority was balancing the budget after years of deficit spending. Although his annual budgets were not always balanced, he came closer to curbing federal spending than any of his successors. 
As a moderate on domestic issues, he accepted most of the New Deal 
programs as a reality of modern life and even expanded some of them. During Eisenhower’s two terms in office, Social Security was extended to 10 million more citizens, the minimum wage was raised, and additional public housing was built. In 1953, Eisenhower consolidated welfare programs by creating the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) under Oveta Culp Hobby, the first woman in a Republican cabinet. For farmers, a soil-bank program  was initiated as means of reducing farm production and thereby 
increasing farm income. On the other hand, Eisenhower opposed the ideas of federal health insurance and federal aid to education.
As the first Republican president since Hoover, Eisenhower called his 
balanced and moderate approach “modern Republicanism. ” His critics called it “the bland leading the bland. ”
Interstate Highway System The most permanent physical legacy of the 
Eisenhower years was the passage in 1956 of the Highway Act, which authorized the construction of 42,000 miles of interstate highways linking all the nation’s major cities. When completed, the U.S. highway system became a model for the rest of the world. The justification for new taxes on fuel, tires, and vehicles was to improve national defense by facilitating movements of troops and weapons. At the same time, this immense public works project created jobs, promoted the trucking industry, accelerated the growth of the suburbs, and contributed to a more homogeneous national culture. The emphasis on cars, trucks, and highways, however, hurt railroads and the environment. Little attention was paid to public transportation, on which the old and the poor depended.
Prosperity Eisenhower’s domestic legislation was modest. During his 
years in office, however, the country enjoyed a steady economic growth rate, with an inflation rate averaging a negligible 1.5 percent. Although the federal budget had a small surplus only three times in eight years, the deficits fell in relation to the national wealth. Between 1945 and 1960, the per-capita 
610 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONdisposable income of Americans more than tripled. By the mid-1950s, the 
average American family had twice the real income of a comparable family during the boom years of the 1920s. The postwar economy gave Americans the highest standard of living in the world. For these reasons, some historians rate Eisenhower’s economic policies the most successful of any modern president’s.
Economy under the Democrats (1961–1969)
At 43, John F . Kennedy was the youngest candidate ever elected president. He was also the first Roman Catholic to serve in the White, winning despite fears among some Protestants that he would take directions from the pope. Kennedy's energy and sharp wit gave a new, personal style to the presidency. In his inaugural address, Kennedy spoke of “the torch being passed to a new generation” and promised to lead the nation into a “New Frontier . ” The 
Democratic president surrounded himself with both business executives such as Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and academics such as economist John Kenneth Galbraith. For the sensitive position of attorney general, the president chose his younger brother, Robert. 
Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline (“Jackie”) brought style, glamour, and an 
appreciation of the arts to the White House. The press loved his news conferences, and some later likened his administration to the mythical kingdom of Camelot and the court of King Arthur, the subject of a then-popular Broadway musical.
New Frontier Programs  The promises of the New Frontier proved 
difficult to keep. Kennedy called for aid to education, federal support of health care, urban renewal, and civil rights, but his domestic programs languished in Congress. While few of Kennedy’s proposals became law during his thousand-day administration, most were passed later under President Johnson.
On economic issues, Kennedy had some success. He persuaded Congress 
to pass the Trade Expansion Act (1962), which authorized tariff reductions 
with the new European Economic Community (Common Market) of Western European nations. He faced down big steel executives over a price increase he charged was inflationary and achieved a price rollback. In addition, the economy was stimulated by increased spending for defense and space exploration, as the president committed the nation to land on the moon by the end of the decade. 
Johnson’s Domestic Reforms Upon Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, Vice 
President Lyndon B. Johnson became president. Johnson knew how to pass legislation from his years in the House and Senate. He aggressively promoted the domestic programs that Kennedy had failed to get through Congress. Shortly after taking office, Johnson persuaded Congress to pass (1) an expanded version of Kennedy’s civil rights bill, and (2) Kennedy’s proposal for an income tax cut. The latter measure sparked an increase in consumer spending and jobs. The country enjoyed a long period of economic expansion in the 1960s.
President Johnson’s other significant domestic programs, known as the 
“Great Society, ” will be explored in Topic 8.9. Johnson’s programs to use the power of federal programs to attack the ills of society proved the high point of 
611  TOPIC 8.4   ECONOMY AFTER 1945liberalism in the 20th century. Like the New Deal, some of Johnson’s programs 
produced results, while others did not. Nevertheless, before being cut back to pay for the far more costly Vietnam War, the War on Poverty did significantly reduce the number of American families living in poverty.
Nixon’s Domestic Policy
The election of Richard Nixon in 1968 and 1972 gave the Republicans control of the White House. However, the Democrats continued to hold majorities in both houses of Congress. The Republican president had to live with this reality and obtain some concessions from Congress through moderation and compromise. At the same time, Nixon laid the foundation for a shift in public opinion toward conservatism and for Republican gains that would challenge and overthrow the Democratic control of Congress in the 1980s and 1990s.
The New Federalism
Nixon tried to slow down the growth of Johnson’s Great Society programs by proposing the Family Assistance Plan, which would have replaced welfare by providing a guaranteed annual income for working Americans. The Democratic majority in Congress easily defeated this initiative. 
The Republican president did succeed, however, in shifting some 
responsibility for social programs from the federal to the state and local levels. In a program known as revenue sharing, or the New Federalism, Congress gave local governments $30 billion in block grants over five years to address local needs as they saw fit (instead of using federal money according to priorities set in Washington). Republicans hoped revenue sharing would check the growth of the federal government and return responsibility to the states, where it had rested before the New Deal.
Nixon attempted to bypass Congress by impounding (not spending) funds 
appropriated for social programs. Democrats protested that such action was an abuse of executive powers. The courts agreed with the president’s critics, arguing that it was a president’s duty to carry out the laws of Congress, whether or not the president agreed with them.
Nixon’s Economic Policies
Starting with a recession in 1970, the U.S. economy throughout the 1970s faced the unusual combination of economic slowdown and high inflation—a condition referred to as stagflation (stag nation plus inflation ). To slow inflation, Nixon 
at first tried to cut federal spending. However, when this policy contributed to a recession and unemployment, he adopted Keynesian economics and deficit spending so as not to alienate middle-class and blue-collar Americans. In August 1971, he surprised the nation by imposing a 90-day wage and price freeze. Next, he took the dollar off the gold standard, which helped to devalue it relative to foreign currencies, and imposed a 10-percent surtax on all imports. These actions cost consumers, but they made goods produced in the United States more competitive with those made in other countries. 
612 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONBy the election year of 1972, the recession was over. Also in that year, 
Congress approved automatic increases for Social Security benefits based on 
the annual rise in the cost of living. This measure protected seniors, the poor, and the disabled from the worst effects of inflation but also contributed to increasing costs for these programs in the future. 
Ford and Carter Confront Inflation
In the 1970s, the biggest economic issue was the growing inflation rate. President Gerald Ford (1974–1977) urged voluntary measures on the part of businesses and consumers to fight inflation by minimizing price and wage increases, including the wearing of WIN (Whip Inflation Now) buttons. Not only did inflation continue, but the economy also sank deeper into recession, with the unemployment rate reaching more than 9 percent. Ford finally agreed to a Democratic package to stimulate the economy, but he vetoed most other Democratic bills.
At first President Jimmy Carter (1977–1981) tried to check inflation with 
measures aimed at conserving energy, particularly oil, and reviving the U.S. coal industry. However, the compromises that came out of Congress failed to reduce the consumption of oil or to check inflation. In 1979–1980, inflation seemed completely out of control and reached the unheard-of rate of 13 percent.
Troubled Economy Inflation slowed economic growth as consumers and 
businesses could no longer afford the high interest rates that came with high prices. Inflation also pushed middle-class taxpayers into higher tax brackets, which led to a “taxpayers’ revolt. ” Government social programs that were indexed to the inflation rate helped to push the federal deficit to nearly $60 billion in 1980. 
The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul Volcker, believed that 
breaking the back of inflation was more important than reducing unemployment. Under him, the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates on loans even higher, to 20 percent in 1980. The high interest rates especially hurt the automobile and building industries, which laid off tens of thousands of workers. The policy, though, worked to reduce inflation. By 1982, inflation was under 4 percent. 
The Economic Shift in the 1970s The period of high inflation, high interest 
rates, and high unemployment in the 1970s changed how many Americans viewed the economy. The postwar economy of the 1940s and 1950s had benefited from a booming private sector, strong unions, high federal spending, the baby boom, and technological developments. However, the economic recovery of Japan, Germany, and other war-torn nations challenged the U.S. position as the strongest economy in the world. Less-expensive and often better-built automobiles and other consumer products from newer overseas factories competed successfully with American-made products. In addition, new technology required fewer workers. The combination of competition and technology undercut the high-paying manufacturing jobs that had expanded the middle class in the 1950s and early 1960s. 
613  TOPIC 8.4   ECONOMY AFTER 1945These new realities affected politics, society, and economic thinking from 
the 1970s well into the future. In the 1970s, Americans began to adjust to the 
harsh truth that, for the first time since World War II, their standard of living was on the decline.

Culture after 1945
All you do is make a lot of dough and play golf and play bridge  
and buy cars and drink Martinis and look like a hot-shot. . . .  
How would you know you weren’t being a phony?
J. D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye, 1951
Learning Objective : Explain how mass culture has been maintained or 
challenged over time.
Among White suburbanites, the 1950s were marked by similarities in social 
norms. Consensus about political issues and conformity in social behavior were 
safe harbors for Americans troubled by worries about communism. Consensus and conformity were the hallmarks of a consumer-driven mass economy.
Consumer Culture and Conformity 
Television, advertising, and the middle-class movement to the suburbs contributed mightily to the growing homogeneity of American culture.
Television  Little more than a curiosity in the late 1940s, television  
suddenly became a center of family life in American homes. By 1961, there was  one set for every 3.3 Americans. Programming was dominated by three national networks, which presented viewers with a bland menu of situation comedies, westerns, quiz shows, and professional sports. FCC chairman Newton Minnow criticized television as a “vast wasteland” and worried about the impact on children of a steady dose of five or more hours of daily viewing. The culture portrayed on television—especially for third and fourth generations of White ethnic Americans—provided a common content for their common language. Comedies like The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best, and 
Leave It to Beaver reinforced conservative values by depicting a stereotype of a suburb. Families included a father working in a white-collar job and a mother who did not work outside the home, and everyone was white and middle class. 
Advertising In all the media (television, radio, newspapers, and magazines),  
aggressive advertising by name brands promoted common material wants, and the introduction of suburban shopping centers and plastic credit cards in the 1950s provided a quick means of satisfying them. The phenomenal proliferation of chains of fast food restaurants on the roadside was one measure of success for the new marketing techniques and standardized products as the nation turned from “mom and pop” stores to franchise operations.
616 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONPaperbacks and Records Despite television, Americans read more 
than ever. Paperback books, an innovation in the 1950s, were selling almost 
a million copies a day by 1960. Popular music was revolutionized by the mass marketing of inexpensive long-playing (LP) record albums and stacks of 45 rpm records. Teenagers fell in love with rock and roll music, a blend 
of African American rhythm and blues sounds with White country music, popularized by the gyrating Elvis Presley.

Corporate America In the business world, conglomerates  with diversified 
holdings began to dominate such industries as food processing, hotels, transportation, insurance, and banking. For the first time in history, more American workers held white-collar jobs than blue-collar jobs. Working for one of Fortune  magazine’s top 500 companies seemed to be the road to success. 
Large corporations promoted teamwork and conformity, including a dress code for male workers of a dark business suit, white shirt, and conservative tie. Social scientist William Whyte documented this loss of individuality in his book The Organization Man (1956). A key point was that people believed that 
organizations could make better decisions than individuals, and thus serving an organization became preferable to developing one’s individual creativity.
Big unions became more powerful after the merger of the American 
Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations into the AFL-CIO in 1955. They also became more conservative as blue-collar workers began to enjoy middle-class incomes. 
For most Americans, conformity was a small price to pay for affluence, 
a home in the suburbs, a new automobile every few years, good schools, and maybe a vacation at the recently opened Disneyland (1955) in California.
Religion Organized religions expanded dramatically after World War II 
with the building of thousands of new churches and synagogues. Will Herberg’s book Protestant, Catholic, Jew  (1955) commented on the new religious tolerance 
of the times and the lack of interest in doctrine, as religious membership became a source of both individual identity and socialization. 
617  TOPIC 8.5   CULTURE AFTER 1945Women’s Roles 
The baby boom and running a home in the suburbs made homemaking a full-
time job for millions of women. The traditional view of a woman’s role as caring for home and children was reaffirmed in the mass media and in the best-selling self-help book Baby and Child Care (1946) by Dr. Benjamin Spock.
At the same time, evidence of dissatisfaction was growing, especially among 
well-educated women of the middle class. More married women entered the workforce, especially as they reached middle age. Y et male employers in the 1950s saw female workers primarily as wives and mothers, and women’s lower wages reflected this attitude.
Social Critics
Not everybody approved of the social trends of the 1950s. In The Lonely Crowd (1958), Harvard sociologist David Riesman criticized the replacement 
of “inner-directed” individuals in society with “other-directed” conformists. In The Affluent Society (1958), economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote 
about the failure of wealthy Americans to address the need for increased social spending for the common good. (Galbraith’s ideas were to influence the Kennedy and Johnson administrations in the next decade.) Sociologist C. Wright Mills portrayed dehumanizing corporate worlds in White Collar  (1951) 
and threats to freedom in The Power Elite (1956).
Novels  Some of the most popular novelists of the 1950s wrote about 
the individual’s struggle against conformity. J. D. Salinger provided a classic commentary on “phoniness” as viewed by a troubled teenager in The Catcher in the Rye  (1951). Joseph Heller satirized the rigidity of the military and the 
insanity of war in Catch-22 (1961).
Beatniks A group of rebellious writers and intellectuals made up the Beat 
Generation of the 1950s. Led by Jack Kerouac (On the Road, 1957) and poet Allen Ginsberg (“Howl, ” 1956), the beatniks advocated spontaneity, use of drugs, and rebellion against societal standards. The beatniks would become models for the youth rebellion of the 1960s.
Assassination and the End of the Postwar Era
President Kennedy’s “one brief, shining moment” of life was cut short on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, as two bullets from an assassin’s rifle found their mark. After the shocking news of Kennedy’s murder, millions of stunned Americans were fixed to their televisions for days and even witnessed the killing of the alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, just two days after the president’s death. The Warren Commission, headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin. For years afterward, however, unanswered questions about the events in Dallas produced dozens of conspiracy theories pointing to possible involvement by organized crime, Fidel Castro, the Soviet Union, the CIA, and the FBI. For many Americans, the tragedy in Dallas and doubts about the Warren Commission marked the beginning of a loss of credibility in government.
618 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONIn Retrospect Kennedy’s presidency inspired many young Americans to 
take seriously his inaugural message and to “ask not what your country can do 
for you—ask what you can do for your country. ” In keeping with the patriotic sentiments of the postwar era, some volunteered for the Peace Corps or to fight in the Vietnam War. The war’s failures, the conspiracy theories that multiplied after Kennedy’s death, and conflicts over the civil rights movement and the shallow materialism of the 1950s raised doubts about American society and culture. Instead of the consensus of the 1950s, America had become by 1968 a country that was “coming apart. ” The counterculture had arrived. 
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  A SILENT GENERATION?
Among intellectuals, a commonly held view of the 1950s was that Americans had become complacent in their political outlook—a “silent generation” presided over by a grandfatherly and passive President Eisenhower. Liberal academics believed that McCarthyism had stopped any serious or critical discussion of the problems in American society. Eisenhower’s policies and their general acceptance by most voters seemed a bland consensus of ideas that would bother no one. Critics contrasted the seeming calm of the 1950s with the more “interesting” social and cultural revolution of the next decade.
Eisenhower the Leader Over time, historians have treated the 1950s 
more positively. For example, William O’Neill’s American High: The Years of 
Confidence,  1945–1960 (1987) presents a more positive view of Eisenhower. 
Research into the Eisenhower papers has revealed a president who used a hidden-hand approach to leadership. Behind the scenes, he was an active and decisive administrator who was in full command of his presidency. His domestic policies achieved sustained economic growth, and his foreign policy relaxed international tensions. O’Neill argues that Eisenhower led a needed and largely successful economic and social postwar “reconstruction. ” 
Liberal Victories Some historians have emphasized the liberal successes 
of the period. The strong economy featured strong unions and progressive taxes. The country made progress on civil rights issues, with African Americans organizing bus boycotts, marches, and other protests to draw attention to discrimination. Other historians emphasize that the 1950s prepared the way for the achievements of women and African Americans and other minorities in the following decades. Furthermore, the integration of Catholics, Jews, and other White ethnics into American society during the postwar years made it possible for Kennedy to be elected the first Roman Catholic president in 1960.
Conservative Foundations Some historians see the 1950s as laying the 
intellectual foundation for the conservative politics of the 1980s. Writers such as William F . Buckley and intellectuals such as economist Milton Friedman began arguing for limited government in the 1950s. Their ideas shaped the policies of President Ronald Reagan (1981–1989). 
Supporting an Argument Explain two perspectives on the 1950s.

We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of  
“separate but equal” has no place. Separate educational facilities  
are inherently unequal.
Chief Justice Earl Warren, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, May 17, 1954
Learning Objective : Explain how and why the civil rights movement 
developed and expanded from 1945 to 1960.
Baseball player Jackie Robinson had broken the color line in 1947 by being 
hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers as the first African American to play on a major 
league team since the 1880s. Robinson’s breakthrough had a huge impact on many Americans. However, some argue that the origins of the modern civil rights movement can be traced back to the movement of millions of African Americans from the rural South to the urban centers of the South and the North. In the North, African Americans, who joined the Democrats during the New Deal, had a growing influence in politics in the 1940s and 1950s.
Origins of the Movement
African Americans had been fighting against racial discrimination since the 17th century. However, progress was slow until after World War II. As the 1950s began, African Americans in the South were still segregated by law from Whites in schools and in most public facilities. They were also kept from voting by poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, and intimidation. Social segregation left most of them poorly educated, while economic discrimination kept them in a state of poverty.
Presidential Leadership Harry S. Truman (1945–1953) was the 
first modern president to use the powers of his office to challenge racial discrimination. Bypassing Southern Democrats who controlled key committees in Congress, the president used his executive powers to establish the Committee on Civil Rights in 1946. He also strengthened the civil rights 
division of the Justice Department, which aided the efforts of Black leaders to end segregation in schools. Most importantly, in 1948 he ordered the end of racial discrimination throughout the federal government, including the armed forces. The end of segregation changed life on military bases, many 
622 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONof which were in the South. Recognizing the odds against the passage of 
civil rights legislation, Truman nevertheless also urged Congress to create a Fair Employment Practices Commission that would prevent employers from discriminating against the hiring of African Americans. Southern Democrats blocked the legislation. 
Changing Attitudes in the Cold War The Cold War also played an 
indirect role in changing both government policies and social attitudes. The U.S. reputation for freedom and democracy was competing against Communist ideology for the hearts and minds of the peoples of Africa and Asia. Against this global background, racial segregation and discrimination stood out as glaring wrongs that needed to be corrected. 
Desegregating the Schools and Public Places
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) 
had been working through the courts for decades trying to overturn the Supreme Court’s 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, which allowed segregation as long as facilities were “separate but equal. ” In the late 1940s, the NAACP won a series of cases involving higher education.

history was argued in the early 1950s by a team of NAACP lawyers led by 
Thurgood Marshall. In Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka,  they argued 
that segregation of Black children in public schools was unconstitutional because it violated the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of “equal protection of the laws. ” In May 1954, the Supreme Court agreed with Marshall and overturned the Plessy 
decision. Writing for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Earl Warren  ruled 
623  TOPIC 8.6   E ARLY STEPS IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , 1945–1960that (1) “separate facilities are inherently unequal” and hence unconstitutional, 
and (2) school segregation should end with “all deliberate speed. ”
Resistance in the South Opposition to the Brown  decision erupted 
throughout the South. To start with, 101 members of Congress signed the “Southern Manifesto” condemning the Supreme Court for a “clear abuse of judicial power. ” States fought the decision several ways, including temporarily closing public schools and setting up private schools. The Ku Klux Klan made a comeback, and violence against African Americans increased. 
In Arkansas in 1956, when a federal court ordered school desegregation, 
Governor Orval Faubus used the state’s National Guard to prevent nine African American students from entering Little Rock Central High School. President Eisenhower then intervened. While the president did not actively support desegregation  or the Brown  decision, he understood his constitutional duty 
to uphold federal authority. Eisenhower ordered federal troops to stand guard in Little Rock and protect Black students. Resistance remained stubborn. In 
1964, ten years after the Supreme Court decision, fewer than 2 percent of Black students in the South attended integrated schools. 
Montgomery Bus Boycott In 1955, as a Montgomery, Alabama, bus took 
on more White passengers, the driver ordered a middle-aged Black woman to give up her seat to one of them. Rosa Parks, an active member of the local chapter of the NAACP , refused. The police were called and arrested her for violating the segregation law. This arrest sparked a massive African American protest in the form of a boycott of the city buses. The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., minister of a Montgomery Baptist church, soon emerged as the inspirational leader of a nonviolent movement to end segregation. The protest touched off by Rosa Parks and the Montgomery bus boycott resulted in the Supreme Court ruling that segregation laws were unconstitutional. The boycott also inspired other civil rights protests that reshaped America over the coming decades. 
Nonviolent Protests  In 1957, Martin Luther King Jr. formed the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which organized ministers and churches in the South to get behind the civil rights struggle. In February 1960, college students in Greensboro, North Carolina, started the sit-in 
movement  after being refused service at a Whites-only Woolworth’s lunch 
counter. To call attention to the injustice of segregated facilities, students would deliberately invite arrest by sitting in restricted areas. Within a few months, young activists, including 23-year-old John Lewis, organized the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to promote voting rights and to end segregation. In the 1960s, African Americans used sit-ins to integrate restaurants, hotels, libraries, pools, and transportation throughout the South.
The results of the boycotts, sit-ins, court rulings, and government responses 
to pressure marked a turning point in the civil rights movement. Progress was slow, however. In the 1960s, a growing impatience among many African Americans would be manifested in violent confrontations in the streets.
624 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONFederal Laws  While President Eisenhower was skeptical about the 
Brown  ruling, he did sign civil rights laws in 1957 and 1960. These were the 
first such laws to be enacted by the U.S. Congress since Reconstruction. They 
were modest in scope, providing for a permanent Civil Rights Commission 
and giving the Justice Department new powers to protect the voting rights of African Americans. Despite this legislation, southern officials still used an arsenal of obstructive tactics to discourage black citizens from voting.
The Court rulings and federal laws of the 1950s were only the beginning 
in the fight for racial justice. The movement for racial justice continued with decades of protests, legislation, and court decisions to win African Americans access to schools, public places, voting rights, housing, and employment. The effort took a state-by-state, county-by-county, city-by-city struggle against the entrenched traditions of segregation and discrimination in both the South and the North. These events will be further explored in Topic 8.10.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Questions 1–2 refer to the excerpt below.
“Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of 
race even though the physical facilities and other ‘tangible’ factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal education opportunities?  We believe that it does.
“[I]n finding that a segregated law school for Negroes could not provide them equal educational opportunities, this court relied in large part on ‘those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness in a law school. ’ 
625  TOPIC 8.6   E ARLY STEPS IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , 1945–1960“Such considerations apply with added force to children in grade and high 
schools. To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. . . .
“We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate 
but equal’ has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs . . . [are] deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. ”
Supreme Court, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, May 17, 1954
1. Which of the following is the most important claim in the argument presented in this portion of the Brown  verdict?
(A) All-Black schools were not as well equipped as all-White schools.

residential patterns rather than required racial segregation.
(C) Segregated schools existed in southern but not northern states.
(D) Psychological research indicated the negative effects of segregation on African American children.
2. Which of the following best describes the initial reaction to the Brown  
decision?
(A) Southern leaders supported the decision, but the voters did not.

626 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITION
Topic 8.7
America as a World Power
America was prone to its own illusions, one of which was that the 
independence movements of the developing world paralleled  
the American experience.
Henry Kissinger, Diplomacy, 1994
Learning Objective : Explain various military and diplomatic responses  
to international developments over time.
Decolonization, or the collapse of colonial empires, was among the most 
important developments of the era following World War II. Would people 
fighting for independence look to the anticolonial history of United States for inspiration or to the anticolonial ideology of the Communists? 
Unrest in the “Third World”
Between 1947 and 1960, 37 new nations emerged from colonies in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Most were former subjects of European empires, such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands. In Asia, India and Pakistan became new nations in 1947, and the Dutch East Indies became the independent country of Indonesia in 1949. In Africa, Ghana threw off British colonial rule in 1957, and a host of other nations followed. These new developing nations of the “Third World ” (in contrast to the industrialized nations of the Western bloc and the 
Communist bloc) often lacked stable political and economic institutions. Their need for foreign aid from either the United States or the Soviet Union often made them into pawns of the Cold War.
Foreign Aid The primary tool used by United States to win over the 
developing nations to its side during the Cold War was foreign aid. Until 1952, most of U.S. foreign aid went to Europe, but by 1960 more than 90 percent went to Third World nations. Some foreign aid was grant money with no strings attached. Often, though, the aid was in the form of low-interest loans and came with restrictions, which poorer nations came to resent. However, despite foreign aid many recipients, such as India and Egypt, refused to choose sides in the Cold War and followed a policy of “nonalignment. ” 
The Middle East
In the Middle East, the United States tried to balance maintaining friendly ties with the oil-rich Arab states while at the same time supporting the new state 
627  TOPIC 8.7   AMERICA AS A WORLD POWERof Israel. The latter nation was created in 1948 under UN auspices after a civil 
war in the British mandate territory of Palestine left the land divided between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Israel’s neighbors, including Egypt, had fought unsuccessfully to prevent a Jewish state from being formed.
Covert Action  President Eisenhower’s administration’s (1953–1961) 
conduct of U.S. foreign policy increased the use of covert action . Undercover 
intervention in the internal politics of other nations was less objectionable to voters than employing U.S. troops and proved less expensive. In 1953, the CIA  helped overthrow a government in Iran  that had tried to nationalize the 
holding of foreign oil companies. The overthrow of the elected government allowed for the return of Reza Pahlavi as shah (monarch) of Iran. In return the shah provided the West with favorable oil prices and made enormous purchases of American arms.

628 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONSuez Crisis Led by the Arab nationalist General Gamal Abdel Nasser, 
Egypt asked the United States for funds to build the ambitious Aswan Dam 
project on the Nile River. The United States refused, in part because Egypt threatened Israel’s security. Nasser then turned to the Soviet Union to help build the dam. The Soviets agreed to provide limited financing for the project. Seeking another source of funds, Nasser precipitated an international crisis in July 1956 by seizing and nationalizing the British- and French-owned Suez Canal that passed through Egyptian territory. Loss of the canal threatened Western Europe’s supply line to Middle Eastern oil. In response to this threat, Britain, France, and Israel carried out a surprise attack against Egypt and retook the canal.
Eisenhower, furious that he had been kept in the dark about the attack by 
his allies the British and French, sponsored a UN resolution condemning the invasion of Egypt. Under pressure from the United States and world public opinion, the invading forces withdrew. 
Eisenhower Doctrine The United States quickly replaced Britain and 
France as the leading Western influence in the Middle East, but it faced a growing Soviet influence in Egypt and Syria. In a policy pronouncement later known as the Eisenhower Doctrine, the United States in 1957 pledged economic and military aid to any Middle Eastern country threatened by communism. Eisenhower first applied his doctrine in 1958 by sending 14,000 marines to Lebanon to prevent a civil war between Christians and Muslims. 
OPEC and Oil In Eisenhower’s last year in office, 1960, the Middle Eastern 
states of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and Iran joined with the South American state of Venezuela to form the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Members of OPEC hoped to expand their political power by coordinating their oil policies. Oil was shaping up to be a critical foreign-policy issue. The combination of Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil, Arab nationalism, and the conflict between Israelis and Palestinian refugees would trouble American presidents in the coming decades.
Y om Kippur (October) War and Oil Embargo In world politics, the 
most important event of 1973 was the outbreak of another Middle Eastern war. On October 6, the Jewish holy day of Y om Kippur, the Syrians and Egyptians launched a surprise attack on Israel in an attempt to recover the lands lost in the Six-Day War of 1967. President Nixon ordered U.S. nuclear forces on alert and airlifted almost $2 billion in arms to Israel to stem the retreat. The tide of battle quickly shifted in favor of the Israelis, and the war was soon over.
The United States paid a huge price for supporting Israel. The Arab 
members of OPEC placed an embargo on oil sold to Israel’s supporters. The embargo caused a worldwide oil shortage and long lines at gas stations in the United States. Even worse was the impact on the U.S. economy, which now suffered from runaway inflation, the loss of manufacturing jobs, and a lower standard of living. The hardest-hit people were blue-collar workers. Consumers switched from big American-made cars to smaller, more fuel-efficient Japanese 
629  TOPIC 8.7   AMERICA AS A WORLD POWERcars, which cost U.S. automobile workers more than 225,000 jobs. Congress 
responded by enacting a 55-miles-per-hour speed limit to save gasoline and approving construction of a controversial oil pipeline to tap American oil reserves in Alaska. No government program, however, seemed to bolster the sluggish economy or stem high inflation rates, which continued until the end of the decade.

Camp David Accords Perhaps President Carter’s (1977–1981) single 
greatest achievement as president was arranging a peace settlement between 
Egypt and Israel. In 1977, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat took the first courageous step toward Middle East peace by visiting Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in Jerusalem. President Carter followed this bold initiative by inviting Sadat and Begin to meet again at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Maryland. With Carter acting as an intermediary, the two leaders negotiated the Camp David Accords (September 1978), which provided a framework for a peace settlement between their countries.
Later, as a result of a peace treaty concluded in 1979, Egypt became the 
first Arab nation to recognize the nation of Israel. In return, Israel withdrew its troops from the Sinai territory taken from Egypt in the Six-Day War of 1967. The treaty was opposed by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and most of the Arab world, but it was a step toward a negotiated peace in the Middle East.
Iran and the Hostage Crisis The Middle East also provided Carter’s 
greatest frustration. In Iran, anti-American sentiment had been strong since the United States had helped overthrow the country’s democratically elected leader in 1953 and install a dictatorial government under a leader called a shah. The shah had kept the oil flowing for the West during the 1970s, but his autocratic rule and policy of westernization had alienated a large part of 
630 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONthe Iranian population. In 1979, Islamic fundamentalists in Iran, led by the 
Ayatollah Khomeini, overthrew the shah. He escaped the country, but Iranians demanded his return to stand trials for crimes against his people.
With the ayatollah and fundamentalists in power, Iranian oil exports 
ground to a halt, causing the second worldwide oil shortage of the decade and another round of price increases. U.S. impotence in dealing with the crisis became more evident in November 1979. When the United States allowed the shah into the country for medical treatment, Iranian militants seized the U.S. embassy in Teheran and held more than 50 American staff members as prisoners and hostages. The hostage crisis dragged out through the remainder of Carter’s presidency. In April 1980, Carter approved a rescue mission, but the breakdown of the helicopters over the Iranian desert forced the United States to abort the mission. For many Americans, Carter’s unsuccessful attempts to free the hostages symbolized a failed presidency.
Source: U.S. Department of Defense, via pingnews
On January 27, 1981, the hostages returned to the United States after 14 months in captivity.
Latin America 
In 1954, President Eisenhower (1953–1961) approved a CIA covert action to overthrow a leftist government in Guatemala that threatened American business interests. U.S. opposition to communism often drove Washington to support corrupt and often ruthless dictators, especially in Latin America. As in the case of Iran, this kind of intervention in Latin American politics also fueled anti-American feelings, which became evident in populist attacks on motorcades of U.S. Vice Presidents Richard Nixon and later Nelson Rockefeller during state visits in Latin America.
Kennedy’s Policies After a close election, President John F . Kennedy 
(1961–1963) increasingly turned his attention to policies related to developing countries. In 1961, he set up the Peace Corps, an organization that recruited 
631  TOPIC 8.7   AMERICA AS A WORLD POWERyoung American volunteers to give technical aid to developing countries. In 
1961, Kennedy created the Alliance for Progress, a U.S. program that promoted land reform and economic development in Latin America. Kennedy’s interest in Latin America and the Alliance of Progress were fondly remembered after his death. However, CIA operations fueled anti-American feelings in Latin America. These included the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion that failed to overthrow Fidel Castro (Topic 8.2) and plots to assassinate Communist or leftist leaders, such as Fidel Castro of Cuba.
Return of the “Big Stick” President Johnson’s administration (1963–
1969) judged Western Hemisphere neighbors by their commitment against communism rather than their commitment to democracy. The  Alliance for Progress, begun with such fanfare under Kennedy, was allowed to wither. Johnson’s policy toward Latin America became increasingly interventionist, culminating in the deployment of U.S. soldiers to the Dominican Republic to prevent another Communist takeover in the Caribbean. In 1964, the administration backed a right-wing military coup in Brazil. When Panamanians rioted against U.S. control of the Panama Canal Zone, Johnson dealt firmly with the violence, although he later agreed to negotiations that eventually culminated in the return of the Canal Zone to Panama in 1999. Johnson’s interventionist doctrine was that the United States would unilaterally prevent any Communist government from coming to power in the Western Hemisphere, reminding some of Theodore Roosevelt’s “Big Stick” policy.
Panama Canal Promoting a human rights policy, the Carter administration 
attempted to correct inequities in the original Panama Canal Treaty of 1903 by negotiating a new treaty. In 1978, after long debate, the Senate ratified a treaty that would gradually transfer operation and control of the Panama Canal from the United States to the Panamanians, a process to be completed by the year 2000. Opponents criticized Carter’s “giveaway” of the canal in the 1980 election. 
Policies in Africa
The difficulties of nation building were especially challenging for newly created nations in Africa. Shortly after Belgium abruptly gave independence to the Congo in 1960, civil war broke out. Fearing a Communist victory, the United States helped the United Nations quell the insurrection. While the threat of a Communist takeover was overblown, the Kennedy administration’s intervention into the shaky politics of the Congo caused resentment among African nationalists as another example of White colonialism.
Remnants of Colonialism Until the mid-1970s, Africa ranked low 
in President Richard Nixon’s (1969–1974) list of priorities. The Nixon administration did strengthen ties with the White minority governments of Portuguese Angola, Rhodesia, and South Africa. When Black rebels tried to overthrow colonial control in Angola, the CIA spent tens of millions of dollars on covert actions to prevent the Communist-backed rebels from gaining power. 
632 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONAfter Nixon resigned as president, Congress pulled funding from the scheme. 
In 1976, the Soviet- and Cuban-backed party took control of Angola. After the Angola experience, the United States decided to no longer back White minority governments with segregationist policies (apartheid ) in Africa.
Human Rights Diplomacy The hallmark of President Carter’s (1977–1981) 
foreign policy was human rights, which he preached fervently to the world’s dictators. Carter appointed Andrew Y oung, an African American, to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Carter and Y oung championed the cause of human rights around the world, especially by opposing the oppression of the Black majorities in South Africa and Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) by all-White governments. In Latin America, human rights violations by the military governments of Argentina and Chile caused Carter to cut off U.S. aid to those countries.
Limits of a Superpower 
In 1969, television viewers around the world witnessed the astonishing sight of two American astronauts walking on the moon’s surface. The United States had won the race to land men on the moon. This event, followed by a series of other successes for the U.S. space program, represented some of the high points of the 1970s. Offsetting these technological triumphs, however, were shocking revelations about White House participation in the Watergate break-in, a stagnant economy, and the fall of South Vietnam to communism (Topic 8.8).
Economic Challenges Increased foreign economic competition, oil 
shortages, rising unemployment, and high inflation made Americans aware that even the world’s leading superpower would have to adjust to a fast-changing, less-manageable world. The United States was cutting back on its foreign aid to developing nations. Overall, in world economy the United States seemed to be losing its competitive edge, which had been the foundation of its unrivaled political and military strength since World War II.

Topic 8.8
The Vietnam War
Pouring money, material, and men into the jungle [of Vietnam]  
without at least a remote prospect of victory would be dangerously  
futile and self-destructive.
John F. Kennedy, speech in U.S. Senate, April 6, 1954
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the Vietnam War.
After losing their Southeast Asian colony of Indochina to Japanese invaders 
in World War II, the French made the mistake of trying to retake it. Wanting 
independence, native Vietnamese and Cambodians resisted. French imperialism had the effect of increasing support for nationalist and Communist leader Ho Chi Minh.
Eisenhower’s Domino Theory
By 1950, the anticolonial war in Indochina became part of the Cold War rivalry between Communist and anti-Communist powers. Truman’s government started to give U.S. military aid to the French, while China and the Soviet Union aided the Viet Minh guerrillas led by Ho Chi Minh. In 1954, a large French army at Dien Bien Phu was trapped and forced to surrender. After this disastrous defeat, the French tried to convince Eisenhower to send in U.S. troops, but he refused. At the Geneva Conference of 1954, France agreed to give up Indochina, which was divided into the independent nations of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.
Division of Vietnam By the terms of the Geneva Conference, Vietnam 
was to be temporarily divided at the 17th parallel until a general election could be held. The new nation remained divided, however, as two hostile governments took power on either side of the line. In North Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh established a Communist dictatorship. In South Vietnam, a government emerged under Ngo Dinh Diem, whose support came largely from anti-Communist, Catholic, and urban Vietnamese, many of whom had fled from Communist rule in the North. The general election to unite Vietnam was never held, largely because South Vietnam’s government feared that the Communists would win.
From 1955 to 1961, the United States gave over $1 billion in economic and 
military aid to South Vietnam in an effort to build a stable anti-Communist state. In justifying this aid, President Eisenhower made what became a famous 
636 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONanalogy to a row of dominoes. According to this domino theory, if South 
Vietnam fell under Communist control, one nation after another in Southeast 
Asia would also fall, until Australia and New Zealand were in dire danger.
SEATO  To prevent South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from “falling” 
to communism, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles put together a regional defense pact called the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). 
Agreeing to defend one another in case of an attack within the region, eight nations signed the pact in 1954: the United States, Great Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan.
Escalation of the Vietnam War in the 1960s
Vietnam was hardly mentioned in the election debates of 1960 between Nixon and Kennedy. U.S. involvement was minimal at that time, but every year thereafter, it loomed larger and eventually dominated the presidency of Lyndon Johnson and the thoughts of the nation. None of the divisive issues in the 1960s was as tragic as the war in Vietnam. Some 2.7 million Americans served in the conflict, and 58,000 died in a failed effort to prevent the takeover of South Vietnam by Communist North Vietnam. Total deaths from the war in Vietnam and related conflicts in Southeast Asia were probably between 2 million and 4 million. 
Buildup under Kennedy President Kennedy adopted Eisenhower’s 
domino theory that, if Communist forces overthrew South Vietnam’s government, they would quickly overrun other countries of Southeast Asia—Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Kennedy therefore continued U.S. military aid to South Vietnam’s regime and significantly increased the number of military “advisers, ” who trained the South Vietnamese army and guarded weapons and facilities. By 1963, more than 16,000 U.S. troops in South Vietnam served in support, but not combat, roles. They provided training and supplies for South Vietnam’s armed forces and helped create “strategic hamlets” (fortified villages).
However, the U.S. ally in South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem, was not popular. 
He and his government steadily lost the support of peasants in the countryside, while in the capital city of Saigon, Buddhist monks set themselves on fire in the streets to protest Diem’s policies. Kennedy began to question whether the South Vietnamese could win “their war” against Communist insurgents. Just two weeks before Kennedy himself was assassinated in Dallas, Diem was overthrown and killed by South Vietnamese generals. Historians later learned that the generals acted with the knowledge of the Kennedy administration.
Tonkin Gulf Resolution Lyndon Johnson became president just as 
things began to fall apart in South Vietnam. The country had seven different governments in 1964. During the U.S. presidential campaign, Republican candidate Barry Goldwater attacked the Johnson administration for giving only weak support to South Vietnam’s fight against the Vietcong (Communist guerrillas). 
637  TOPIC 8.8   THE VIETNAM WARIn August 1964, President Johnson and Congress took a fateful turn in 
policy. Allegedly, North Vietnamese gunboats had fired on U.S. warships in 
the Gulf of Tonkin off Vietnam’s coast. The president persuaded Congress that this aggressive act was sufficient reason for a military response by the United States. Congress approved the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which basically gave the president, as commander-in-chief, a blank check to take “all necessary measures” to protect U.S. interests in Vietnam. Johnson used this small, obscure naval incident to secure congressional authorization to send U.S. forces into combat.
Critics later called the full-scale use of U.S. forces in Vietnam an illegal war 
because Congress never declared war, as the Constitution requires. Congress, however, did not have this concern and did not withdraw its resolution. Until 1968, most Americans supported the effort to contain communism in Southeast Asia. Johnson was caught in a political dilemma to which there was no good solution. How could he stop the defeat of a weak and unpopular government in South Vietnam without making it into an American war—a war whose cost would doom his Great Society programs? If he pulled out, however, he would be seen as weak and lose public support.

638 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONAmerica’s War
In 1965, the U.S. military and most of the president’s foreign-policy advisers 
recommended expanding operations in Vietnam to save the Saigon government. After a Vietcong attack on the U.S. base at Pleiku in 1965, Johnson authorized Operation Rolling Thunder, a prolonged air attack using B-52 bombers against targets in North Vietnam. In April, the president decided to use U.S. combat troops for the first time to fight the Vietcong. By the end of 1965, more than 184,000 U.S. troops were in Vietnam, and most were engaged in a combat role. Johnson continued a step-by-step escalation of U.S. involvement in the war. Hoping to win a war of attrition, American generals used search-and-destroy tactics, which only further alienated the peasants. By the end of 1967, the United States had more than 485,000 troops in Vietnam (the peak was 540,000 in March 1969), and 16,000 Americans had already died in the conflict. Nevertheless, General William Westmoreland, commander of the U.S. forces 
in Vietnam, assured the American public that he could see “light at the end of the tunnel. ”
Credibility Gap Misinformation from military and civilian leaders 
combined with Johnson’s reluctance to speak frankly to the American people about the scope and the costs of the war created what the media called a credibility gap. Johnson always hoped that a little more military pressure would bring the North Vietnamese to the peace table. The most damaging knowledge gap, however, may have been within the inner circles of government. Y ears later, Robert McNamara in his memoirs concluded that the leaders in Washington had failed to understand both the enemy and the nature of the war.
Hawks versus Doves Supporters of the war, or “hawks, ” believed that 
the war was an act of Soviet-backed Communist aggression against South Vietnam and that it was part of a master plan to conquer all of Southeast Asia. Opponents of the war, or “doves , ” viewed the conflict as a civil war fought 
by Vietnamese nationalists and some Communists who wanted to unite their country by overthrowing a corrupt Saigon government.
Some Americans opposed the war because of its costs in lives and money. 
They believed the billions spent in Vietnam could be better spent on the problems of the cities and the poor in the United States. By far the greatest opposition came from students on college campuses who, after graduation, would become eligible to be drafted into the military and shipped off to Vietnam. In November 1967, the antiwar movement gained a political leader when scholarly Senator Eugene F . McCarthy of Minnesota became the first antiwar advocate to challenge Johnson for the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination.
Tet Offensive On the occasion of their Lunar New Y ear (Tet) in January 
1968, the Vietcong launched an all-out surprise attack on almost every provincial capital and American base in South Vietnam. Although the attack took a fearful toll in the cities, the U.S. military counterattacked, inflicted much heavier losses on the Vietcong, and recovered the lost territory. As a military 
639  TOPIC 8.8   THE VIETNAM WARattack, the Tet Offensive failed. Even so, it had tremendous impact in the 
United States. The millions of Americans who watched TV news footage of the 
destruction interpreted the attacks as a setback for Johnson’s Vietnam policy. Victory was not imminent. Thus, for the Vietcong and North Vietnamese, Tet was a tremendous political victory in demoralizing the American public. In the New Hampshire primary in February, the antiwar McCarthy took 42 percent of the vote against Johnson.
Johnson Ends Escalation The Joint Chiefs of Staff responded to Tet by 
requesting 200,000 more troops to win the war. By this time, however, the group of experienced Cold War diplomats who advised Johnson had turned against further escalation of the war. On March 31, 1968, President Johnson went on television and told the American people that he would limit the bombing of North Vietnam and negotiate peace. He then surprised everyone by announcing that he would not run for reelection.
In May 1968, peace talks between North Vietnam, South Vietnam, and the 
United States started in Paris, but they were quickly deadlocked over minor issues. The war continued, and tens of thousands more died. But the escalation of the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam had stopped, and under the next administration it would be slowly reversed.
Coming Apart at Home, 1968
Few years in U.S. history outside of the Civil War were as troubled or violent as 1968. The Tet Offensive and the withdrawal of Johnson from the presidential race were followed by the murder of Martin Luther King Jr. and destructive riots in cities across the country. As the year unfolded, Americans wondered if their nation was coming apart from internal conflicts over the war issue, the race issue, and the generation gap between the baby boomers and their parents.
Election of 1968 In 1964, Kennedy’s younger brother, Robert F. Kennedy, 
became a senator from New Y ork. Four years later, he decided to enter the presidential race after McCarthy’s strong showing in New Hampshire. Bobby Kennedy was more effective than McCarthy in mobilizing the traditional Democratic blue-collar and minority vote. On June 5, 1968, he won a major victory in California’s primary, but immediately after his victory speech he was shot and killed by a young Arab nationalist who opposed Kennedy’s support for Israel. After Robert Kennedy’s death, the election of 1968 turned into a three-way race between two conservatives—George Wallace and Richard Nixon —and one liberal, Vice President Hubert Humphrey.
Democratic Convention in Chicago When the Democrats met in Chicago 
for their party convention, it was clear that Hubert Humphrey had enough delegates to win the nomination. As vice president, he had loyally supported Johnson’s domestic and foreign policies. He controlled the convention, but the antiwar demonstrators were determined to control the streets. Chicago’s mayor Richard Daley had the police out en masse, and the resulting violence was portrayed on television across the country as a “police riot. ” Humphrey left 
640 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONthe convention as the nominee of a badly divided Democratic party, and early 
polls showed he was a clear underdog in a nation sick of disorder and protest.
White Backlash and George Wallace The growing hostility of many 
Whites to federal desegregation, antiwar protests, and race riots was tapped by Governor George Wallace of Alabama. Wallace was the first politician of late-20th-century America to marshal the general resentment against the Washington establishment (“pointy-head liberals, ” as he called them) and the two-party system. He ran for president as the self-nominated candidate of the American Independent Party, hoping to win enough electoral votes to throw the election into the House of Representatives.
Return of Richard Nixon Many observers thought Richard Nixon’s 
political career had ended in 1962 after his unsuccessful run for governor of California. In 1968, however, a new, more-confident, and less-negative Nixon announced his candidacy and soon became the front-runner in the Republican primaries. The favorite of the party regulars, he had little trouble securing his nomination at the Republican convention. For his running mate, he selected Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland, whose rhetoric was similar to that of George Wallace. Nixon was a “hawk” on the Vietnam War and ran on the slogans of “peace with honor” and “law and order. ”
Results Wallace and Nixon started strong, but the Democrats began 
to catch up, especially in northern urban centers, as Humphrey preached to the faithful of the old New Deal coalition. On election night, Nixon defeated Humphrey by a very close popular vote but took a substantial majority of the electoral vote (301 to 191), ending any threat that the three-candidate election would end up in the House of Representatives.
The significance of the 1968 election is clear in the combined total of Nixon’s 
and Wallace’s popular vote of almost 57 percent. Apparently, most Americans wanted a time-out to heal what they saw as the wounds inflicted on the national psyche by the upheavals of the 1960s. Supporters of Nixon and Wallace had had enough of protest, violence, permissiveness, the counterculture, drugs, and federal intervention in social institutions. Elections in the 1970s and 1980s would confirm that the tide was turning against New Deal liberalism in favor of the conservatives.
Richard Nixon’s Vietnam Policy
In his January 1969 inaugural address, President Nixon promised to bring Americans together after the turmoil of the 1960s. However, suspicious and secretive by nature, Nixon soon began to isolate himself in the White House and create what Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called an “imperial presidency. ” Nixon’s first interest was international relations, not domestic policy. Together with his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger (who became secretary of state during Nixon’s second term), Nixon fashioned a pragmatic foreign policy that reduced the tensions of the Cold War.
641  TOPIC 8.8   THE VIETNAM WARSource: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. Vietnam Conflict Extract Data File and other sources.
Vietnamization When Nixon took office, more than half a million U.S. 
troops were in Vietnam. His principal objective was to find a way to reduce 
U.S. involvement in the war while at the same time avoiding the appearance of conceding defeat. In a word, Nixon said the United States was seeking nothing less than “peace with honor. ” Almost immediately, the new president began the process called “Vietnamization. ” He announced that he would gradually withdraw U.S. troops from Vietnam and give the South Vietnamese the money, the weapons, and the training that they needed to take over the full conduct of the war. Under this policy, U.S. troops in South Vietnam went from more than 540,000 in 1969 to under 30,000 in 1972. Extending the idea of disengagement to other parts of Asia, the president proclaimed the Nixon Doctrine, declaring that in the future Asian allies would receive U.S. support but without the extensive use of U.S. ground forces. 
Opposition to Nixon’s War Policies Nixon’s gradual withdrawal of forces 
from Vietnam reduced the number of antiwar protests. However, in April 1970, the president expanded the war by using U.S. forces to invade Cambodia in an effort to destroy Vietnamese Communist bases in that country. A nationwide protest on college campuses against this action resulted in the killing of four youths by National Guard troops at Kent State University in Ohio and two students at Jackson State University in Mississippi. In reaction to the escalation of the war, the U.S. Senate (but not the House) voted to repeal the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.
Also in 1970, the American public was shocked to learn about a 1968 
massacre of women and children by U.S. troops in the Vietnamese village of U.S. FORCES IN VIETNAM, 1964 TO 1973

642 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONMy Lai . Further fueling the antiwar sentiment was the publication by The New 
York Times  of the Pentagon Papers, a secret government study documenting 
the mistakes and deceptions of government policymakers in dealing with 
Vietnam. The papers had been turned over, or “leaked, ” to the press by Daniel Ellsberg, a former Defense Department analyst.
Peace Talks, Bombing Attacks, and Armistice On the diplomatic front, 
Nixon had Kissinger conduct secret meetings with North Vietnam’s foreign minister, Le Duc Tho. Kissinger announced in the fall of 1972 that “peace is at hand, ” but this announcement proved premature. When the two sides could not reach a deal, Nixon ordered a massive bombing of North Vietnam (the heaviest air attacks of the long war) to force a settlement. After several weeks of B-52 bomber attacks, the North Vietnamese agreed to an armistice, in which the United States would withdraw the last of its troops and get back more than 500 prisoners of war (POWs). The Paris Accords of January 1973 also 
promised a cease-fire and free elections. In practice, however, the armistice did not end the war between the North and the South and left tens of thousands of enemy troops in South Vietnam. Before the war ended, the death toll probably numbered more than a million. 
The armistice finally allowed the United States to extricate itself from a 
war that had claimed more than 58,000 American lives. The $118 billion spent on the war began an inflationary cycle that racked the U.S. economy for years afterward.
War Powers Act Nixon was politically damaged by the news that he 
had authorized 3,500 secret bombing raids in Cambodia, a neutral country. Congress used the public uproar over this information to attempt to limit the president’s powers over the military. In November 1973, after a long struggle, Congress finally passed the War Powers Act over Nixon’s veto. This law required Nixon and any future president to report to Congress within 48 hours after taking military action. It further provided that Congress would have to approve any military action that lasted more than 60 days. After the long and unpopular war in Vietnam, Congress and the American people were ready to put the brakes on future presidents leading the nation into a war without a thorough debate. 
Defeat in Southeast Asia
In 1974, South Vietnam continued to face strong attacks from Communist forces. However, President Ford was unable to get additional funds to support U.S. military involvement.
Fall of Saigon In April 1975, the U.S.-supported government in Saigon fell 
to the enemy, and Vietnam was reunified under the Communist government in Hanoi (North Vietnam’s capital). Just before the final collapse, the United States was able to evacuate about 150,000 Vietnamese who had supported the United States and now faced certain persecution. The fall of South Vietnam marked a low point of American prestige overseas and confidence at home.
643  TOPIC 8.8   THE VIETNAM WARGenocide in Cambodia Also in 1975, the U.S.-supported government in 
Vietnam’s neighbor, Cambodia, fell to the Khmer Rouge, a radical Communist 
faction that killed between 1 million and 2 million of its own people—perhaps one-quarter of the population—in a brutal relocation program to rid the country of Western influence. Together the wars in Southeast Asia created 10 million refugees, many of whom fled to the United States.
Future of Southeast Asia The fall of Cambodia seemed to fulfill 
Eisenhower’s domino theory, but in fact the rest of Southeast Asia did not fall to communism. Instead, nations such as Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia emerged as the “little tigers” of the vigorously growing Asian (Pacific Rim) economy. Some argued that U.S. support of South Vietnam was not a waste because it bought time for other nations of East Asia and Southeast Asia to develop and better resist communism.

“We will stay [in Vietnam] because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelties 
of its enemies a people who have staked their lives and independence on America’s solemn pledge—a pledge which had grown through the commitment of three American Presidents.
We will stay because in Asia—and around the world—are countries whose 
independence rests, in large measure, on confidence in America’s word and in American protection. To yield to force in Vietnam would weaken that confidence, would undermine the independence of many lands, and would whet the appetite of aggression. We would have to fight in one land, and then we would have to fight in another—or abandon much of Asia to the domination of Communists. ”

1. “So it proved for the 1960’s policymakers, whose ignorance and 
misconceptions of Southeast Asian history, culture and politics pulled America progressively deeper into the war. LBJ, Rusk, McNamara. . . . mistakenly viewed Vietnam through the simplistic prism of the Cold War. They perceived a deeply complex and ambiguous regional struggle, as a grave challenge to world order and stability. . . . Vietnam exposed the limitations and contradictions of this static doctrine in a world of flux. . . . Vietnam represented a failure not just of American foreign policy, but also of American statesmanship. ”

the Evolution of the Vietnam War, 1991
“ America’s military bureaucracy depends on weapons, increasingly complex, difficult to maintain and expensive. . . . Our marvelously clever technology did not help us to understand the [Vietnam] war and, in fact, confused us even more because it created our unquestioning faith in our own power. . . . If we exploded enough bombs and fired enough rounds, we assumed the enemy would quit. . . . The utter failure of military tactics to utilize technology was not the fault of civilians. . . .

The Great Society
The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all.  
It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which  
we are totally committed in our time.
Lyndon B. Johnson, Commencement Address  
at the University of Michigan, May 1964
Learning Objective 1 : Explain the causes and effects of continuing policy 
debates about the role of the federal government over time. 
Learning Objective 2 : Explain the contributions and changes in 
immigration patterns over time.
Two hours after the assassination of President Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson 
took the presidential oath aboard a plane in Dallas. A native of rural west Texas 
and a graduate of a little-known teacher’s college, he seemed unsophisticated compared to the wealthy, Harvard-educated Kennedy. However, Johnson was a skilled politician who had started his career as a Roosevelt Democrat during the Great Depression. As the new president, Johnson was determined to expand the social reforms of the New Deal. He called his program the “Great Society .”  
During his almost 30 years in Congress, he had learned how to get things done.
The War on Poverty
In his best-selling book on poverty, The Other America  (1962), Michael 
Harrington helped focus national attention on the 40 million Americans still living in poverty. President Johnson responded by declaring in 1964 an “unconditional war on poverty . ” The Democratic Congress gave the president 
almost everything he asked for by creating the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) and providing this antipoverty agency with a billion-dollar budget. The OEO sponsored a wide variety of self-help programs for the poor, such as Head Start for preschoolers, the Job Corps for vocational education, literacy programs, and legal services. The controversial Community Action Program allowed the poor to run antipoverty programs in their own neighborhoods.
The Election of 1964
Johnson and his running mate, Senator Hubert Humphrey, went into the 1964 election with a clearly liberal agenda. In contrast, the Republicans nominated 
647  TOPIC 8.9   THE GREAT SOCIETYa staunch conservative, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who advocated 
ending the welfare state, including the Tennessee Valley Authority and Social Security. A television ad by the Democrats pictured Goldwater as a dangerous extremist who might ignite a nuclear war. However, the Goldwater campaign did energize young conservatives and introduced new conservative voices, such as former film actor and TV host Ronald Reagan of California.
Johnson won the election by a landslide, taking 61 percent of the popular 
vote—a higher figure than FDR’s landslide of 1936. In addition, Democrats now controlled both houses of Congress by better than a two-thirds margin. A Democratic president and Congress were in a position to pass the economic and social reforms originally proposed by President Truman in the 1940s.
Great Society Reforms
Johnson’s list of legislative achievements from 1963 to 1966 is long and includes new programs that would have lasting effects on U.S. society. Several of the most significant ones are listed in the table below.
GREAT SOCIETY PROGRAMS
Title Year 
PassedProgram
Food Stamp Act 1964 Expanded the federal program to help low-income people buy food
National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities1965 Provided federal funding for the arts and for creative and scholarly projects
Medicare 1965 Provided health insurance for all people 65 and older
Medicaid 1965 Provided funds to states to pay for medical care for the poor and disabled
Elementary and Secondary Education Act1965 Provided federal funds to poor school districts and funds for special education programs
Higher Education Act 1965 Provided federal scholarships for postsecondary education
Immigration Act 1965 Abolished discriminatory quotas based on national origins
Child Nutrition Act 1966 Added breakfast to the school lunch program
In addition to the programs listed in the table, Congress increased funding 
for mass transit, public housing, rent subsidies for low-income people, and 
crime prevention. Johnson also established two new cabinet departments: the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In response to Ralph Nader ’s book Unsafe at 
Any Speed (1965), Congress also passed automobile industry regulations that would save hundreds of thousands of lives in the following years. Clean air and water laws were enacted in part as a response to Rachel Carson’s exposé of pesticides, Silent Spring (1962). Federal parks and wilderness areas were expanded. President Johnson’s wife, Lady Bird Johnson, helped improve the 
648 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONenvironment with her Beautify America campaign, which resulted in the 
Highway Beautification Act that removed billboards from federal highways.
Evaluating the Great Society Critics have attacked Johnson’s Great Society 
for making unrealistic promises to eliminate poverty, for creating a centralized welfare state, and for being inefficient and very costly. Defenders point out that these programs gave vitally needed assistance to millions of Americans who had previously been forgotten or ignored—the poor, the disabled, and the elderly. Johnson himself would jeopardize his domestic achievements by escalating the war in Vietnam—a war that resulted in higher taxes and inflation.
Changes in Immigration
Before the 1960s, most immigrants to the United States had come from Europe and Canada. By the 1980s, 47 percent of immigrants were coming from Latin America, 37 percent from Asia, and fewer than 13 percent from Europe and Canada. In part, this dramatic shift was caused by the arrival of refugees leaving Cuba and Vietnam after the Communist takeovers of these countries. Of far greater importance was the impact of the Immigration Act of 1965, which ended the ethnic quota acts of the 1920s favoring Europeans and thereby opened the United States to immigrants from all parts of the world. Legal immigration increased sharply. In the 1970s, about 400,000 immigrants entered each year. In many years between 1990 and 2020, the number exceeded 1,000,000 people.
Undocumented Immigrants By the mid-1970s, as many as 12 million 
foreigners were in the United States illegally. The rise in the number of immigrants from Latin America and Asia led to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which penalized employers for hiring immigrants who had entered the country illegally or had overstayed their visas while also granting amnesty to undocumented immigrants arriving by 1982. Even so, many Americans concluded that the nation had lost control of its own borders.
Political Impact of the Great Society President Johnson’s Great Society 
programs also included legislation to end racial discrimination, which is explored in Topic 8.10. Johnson predicted that the Democratic Party would lose its Southern support because of its liberal social legislation. In fact, the mid-1960s did prove the high point for the use of the federal government to achieve racial equality at home. The conservative resurgence in the next decades was partly motivated to undo the Great Society legislation.

The African American Civil Rights 
Movement in the 1960s
I have a dream my four little children will one day live in a nation  
where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the  
content of their character. I have a dream today!
Martin Luther King Jr., speech on steps of the Lincoln Memorial, August 23, 1963
Learning Objectives : Explain how and why various groups responded  
to calls for the expansion of civil rights from 1960 to 1980. Explain the 
various ways in which the federal government responded to the calls for the expansion of civil rights.
The civil rights movement gained momentum during the Kennedy and 
Johnson presidencies. A very close election in 1960 influenced President 
Kennedy not to press the issue of civil rights lest he alienate White voters. But the defiance of the governors of Alabama and Mississippi to federal court rulings on integration forced a showdown. In 1962, James Meredith, a young African American Air Force veteran, attempted to enroll at the University of Mississippi. A federal court guaranteed his right to attend. Supporting Meredith and the court order, Kennedy sent in 400 federal marshals and 3,000 troops to control mob violence and protect Meredith’s right to attend class. A similar incident occurred in Alabama in 1963. Governor George Wallace tried to stop an African American student from entering the University of Alabama. Once again, Kennedy sent troops to the scene, and the student was admitted.
The Leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Civil rights activists and freedom riders who traveled through the South registering African Americans to vote and integrating public places were met with beatings, bombings, and murder by White extremists. Recognized nationally as the leader of the civil rights movement, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. remained committed to nonviolent protests against segregation. In 1963, 
he and some followers were jailed in Birmingham, Alabama, for what local authorities maintained was an illegal march. The jailing of King, however, proved to be a milestone in the civil rights movement because most Americans believed King to have been jailed unjustly. From his jail cell, King wrote an essay, “Letter from Birmingham Jail, ” in which he argued:

hatred and despair of the Black nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle. . . .
One day the South will know that when these disinherited children 
of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. . . .
King’s letter moved President Kennedy to support a tougher civil rights bill.
March on Washington (1963) In August 1963, King led one of the largest, 
most successful demonstrations in U.S. history. About 200,000 Black and White people joined the peaceful March on Washington in support of jobs and the civil rights bill. The highlight of the demonstration was King’s impassioned “I Have a Dream” speech, which appealed for the end of racial prejudice and ended with everyone in the crowd singing “We Shall Overcome. ”
Federal Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965
Ironically, a Southern president succeeded in persuading Congress to enact the most important civil rights laws since Reconstruction. Even before the 1964 election, Johnson convinced both a majority of Democrats and some Republicans to pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which made segregation illegal 
in all public facilities, including hotels and restaurants, and gave the federal government more power to enforce school desegregation. This act also set up the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to end discrimination in 
employment on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin. 
Ending a Barrier to Voting Also in 1964, the 24th Amendment was 
ratified. It abolished the practice of collecting a poll tax, one of the measures that, for decades, had discouraged poor people from voting.
March to Montgomery A voting rights march from Selma, Alabama, 
to the state capital of Montgomery in March 1965 was met with beatings and tear gas. Among those severely injured on “Bloody Sunday” was SNCC organizer John Lewis. He became known as the "conscience of Congress" for his leadership on civil rights as a member of the House of Representatives.
Televised pictures of the violence proved a turning point in the civil rights 
movement. The national outrage prompted Johnson to send federal troops to protect King and other marchers in another attempt to petition the state government. As a result, Congress passed the powerful Voting Rights Act 
of 1965. This act ended literacy tests and provided federal registrars in areas where African Americans had been kept from voting since Reconstruction. The impact was most dramatic in the Deep South. 
653  TOPIC 8.10   THE AFRICAN AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN THE 1960SDivisions in the Civil Rights Movement Laws such as the Civil Rights 
Act and the Voting Rights Act were hard-won victories. Nevertheless, young 
African Americans were losing patience with the slow progress toward equality and the continued violence by White extremists.
Black Muslims and Malcolm X
Seeking a new cultural identity based on Africa and Islam, the Black Muslim leader Elijah Muhammad preached Black nationalism, separatism, and self-improvement. The movement had already attracted thousands of followers by the time a young man named Malcolm Little became a convert while serving in prison. He adopted the name Malcolm X. Leaving prison in 1952, Malcolm X acquired a reputation as the movement’s most controversial voice. He criticized King as “an Uncle Tom” (subservient to Whites) and advocated self-defense—using Black violence to counter White violence. He eventually left the Black Muslims and moved away from defending violence, but he was assassinated by Black opponents in 1965. The Autobiography of Malcolm X remains an engaging testimony to one man’s development from a petty criminal into a major leader.
Race Riots and Black Power
The radicalism of Malcolm X influenced the thinking of young African Americans in civil rights organizations such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). Stokely Carmichael, the chairman of SNCC, repudiated nonviolence 
and advocated “black power” (especially economic power) and racial separatism. In 1966, the Black Panthers were organized by Huey Newton, Bobby Seale, and other militants as a revolutionary socialist movement advocating self-rule for American blacks.
Urban Riots Shortly after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
the arrest of a young black motorist by White police in the black neighborhood of Watts  in Los Angeles sparked a six-day race riot that killed 34 people and 
destroyed more than 700 buildings. 
For the following few summers through 1968, race riots continued to 
erupt in black neighborhoods of major cities, with increasing casualties and destruction of property. Rioters shouting slogans—“Burn, baby, burn” and “Get whitey”—made Whites suspect that Black extremists and revolutionaries were behind the violence. There was little evidence, however, that the small Black Power movement was responsible for the violence. A federal investigation of the many riots by the Kerner Commission concluded in late 1968 that racism and segregation were chiefly responsible and that the United States was becoming “two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal. ” 
By the mid-1960s, the issue of civil rights had spread far beyond de jure  
segregation practiced under the law in the South. It now included the de facto segregation  and discrimination caused by racist attitudes in the North and 
West.
654 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONMurder in Memphis Martin Luther King Jr. received the Nobel Peace 
Prize in 1964, but his nonviolent approach was under increasing pressure from 
all sides. His effort to use peaceful marches in urban centers of the North, such as Chicago, met with little success. King also broke with President Johnson over the Vietnam War because that war was beginning to drain money from social programs. In April 1968, the nation went into shock over the news that King had been shot and killed by a White man while standing on a motel balcony in Memphis, Tennessee. Massive riots erupted in 168 cities across the country, leaving at least 46 people dead. 
The violence did not reflect the ideals of the murdered leader, but it did 
reveal the anger and frustrations among African Americans in both the North and the South. The violence also fed a growing “White backlash” against the civil rights movement, especially among White blue-collar voters, which was soon reflected in national elections in November 1968 (Topic 8.14).

The Civil Rights Movement Expands
I am woman, hear me roar/In numbers too big to ignore . . . 
I am woman watch me grow/See me standing toe to toe . . .
Helen Reddy, “I Am Woman, ” 1971
Learning Objective : Explain how and why various groups responded to 
calls for expansion of civil rights from 1960 to 1980.
One aspect of the protest movements of the 1960s that continued into later 
decades was the movement by a variety of other groups to gain both relief 
from discrimination and recognition for their contributions to U.S. society, including women, Latinos, American Indians, and the gay community.
The Women’s Movement
The increased education and employment of women in the 1950s, the civil rights movement, and the sexual revolution all contributed to a renewal of the women’s movement in the 1960s. In addition, some feminists who participated in the countercultures of the 1960s rejected many of the social, economic, and political values of their parents’ generation and advocated changes in sexual norms.
Betty Friedan’s book The Feminine Mystique  (1963) gave the movement 
a new direction by encouraging middle-class women to seek fulfillment in professional careers in addition to filling the roles of wife, mother, and homemaker. In 1966, Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women (NOW), which adopted the activist tactics of other civil rights movements to secure equal treatment of women, especially for job opportunities. By this time, Congress had already enacted two antidiscrimination laws: the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. These measures 
prohibited discrimination in employment and compensation on the basis of sex but had been poorly enforced. 
In 1972, Congress also passed Title IX, a statute to end sex discrimination 
in schools that receive federal funding. Though far-reaching, the law is best known for its requirement that schools provide girls with equal athletic opportunities. Many believe that these new opportunities in athletics proved to be a key step in promoting women’s equality. 
658 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONCampaign for the Equal Rights Amendment Feminists achieved a major 
legislative victory in 1972 when Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment 
(ERA). This proposed constitutional amendment stated: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. ” Although NOW and other groups campaigned hard for the ERA, it just missed ratification by the required 38 states. It was defeated in part because of a growing reaction against feminism by conservatives who feared the movement threatened the traditional roles of women. 
Achievements Even without the ERA, the women’s movement 
accomplished fundamental changes in attitudes and hiring practices. In increasing numbers, women moved into professions previously dominated by men: business, law, medicine, and politics. Although women still experienced the “glass ceiling” in the corporate world, American society at the beginning of the 21st century was less and less a man’s world.
Latino Americans
Most Latino Americans before World War II lived in the Southwestern states, but in the postwar years new arrivals from Puerto Rico, Cuba, and South and Central America increasingly settled in the East and Midwest. After suffering deportation during the Great Depression, Mexican workers returned to the United States in the 1950s and 1960s to take low-paying agricultural jobs. The farm workers were widely exploited before a long series of boycotts led by César Chávez and the United Farm Workers Association finally gained 
collective bargaining rights for them in 1975.
Latinos achieved goals in other areas as well. Mexican American activists 
also won a federal mandate for bilingual education requiring schools to teach Hispanic children in both English and Spanish. In the 1980s, a growing number of Hispanic Americans were elected to public office, including as mayors of 
Miami, San Antonio, and other large cities. The Census Bureau reported that, in 2000, Hispanics, including Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and other Latin Americans, had become the country’s largest minority group. 
American Indian Movement
In the 1950s, the Eisenhower administration had made an unsuccessful attempt to encourage American Indians to leave reservations and assimilate into urban America. American Indian leaders resisted the loss of cultural identity that would have resulted from such a policy. To achieve self-determination and revival of tribal traditions, the American Indian Movement (AIM) was founded in 1968. Militant actions soon followed, including AIM’s takeover of the abandoned prison on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay in 1969. AIM members also occupied Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973, which was the site of the infamous massacre of American Indians by the U.S. cavalry in 1890.

Source: U.S. Census Bureau. Figures include Alaska Natives.
American Indians had successes in the late 20st century. Congress passed 
the Indian Self-Determination Act of 1975, which gave reservations and tribal 
lands greater control over internal programs, education, and law enforcement. 
Federal courts supported efforts to regain property and compensation for treaty violations. American Indians attacked widespread unemployment and poverty on reservations by improving education through the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978 and by building industries and gambling casinos on reservations under the self-determination legislation. 
Interest in the cultural heritage of American Indians was also overcoming 
old prejudices. By the 2010 census, nearly 3 million people identified themselves as American Indian or Alaska Native, and more than 2 million more identified themselves as a combination of American Indian or Alaska Native and some other ethnic group.
Asian Americans 
Americans of Asian descent had become the fastest growing ethnic minority by the 1980s. The largest group of Asian Americans were of Chinese ancestry, followed by Filipinos, Japanese, Indians, Koreans, and Vietnamese. A strong dedication to education resulted in Asian Americans being well represented in the best colleges and universities. However, at times, Asian Americans suffered from discrimination, envy, and Japan-bashing, while the less-educated immigrants earned well below the national average.
Gay Rights Movement 
In 1969, a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New Y ork City, sparked both a riot and the gay rights movement. Gay activists urged homosexuals to be 
open about their identity and to work to end discrimination and violent abuse. By the mid-1970s, homosexuality was no longer classified as a mental illness, and the federal Civil Service dropped its ban on employment of homosexuals. In 1993, President Clinton attempted to end discrimination against gays and lesbians in the military, but settled for the compromise “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. People would not be asked or expected to describe their sexual identity, but the military could still expel people for being gay or lesbian.
660 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONThe Warren Court and Individual Rights
As chief justice of the Supreme Court from 1953 to 1969, Earl Warren had an 
impact on the nation comparable to that of John Marshall in the early 1800s. Warren’s decision in the desegregation case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka  (1954) was by far the most important case of the 20th century involving 
race relations. Then, in the 1960s, the Warren Court made a series of decisions 
that profoundly affected the criminal-justice system, state political systems, and the definition of individual rights. Before Warren’s tenure as chief justice, the Supreme Court had concentrated on protecting property rights. During and after his tenure, the Court focused more on protecting individual rights.
Criminal Justice Several decisions of the Warren Court concerned 
defendants’ rights. Four of the most important were the following:
• Mapp v. Ohio (1961) ruled that evidence seized illegally cannot be used against the accused in court.
• Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) required that state courts provide counsel (services of an attorney) for indigent (poor) defendants.
• Escobedo v. Illinois (1964) extended the ruling in Gideon , giving 
suspects the right to have a lawyer present during questioning by the police.
• Miranda v. Arizona (1966) extended the ruling in Escobedo  to require 
the police to inform an arrested person of his or her right to remain silent.
Reapportionment Equality Before 1962, many states included at least one 
house of their legislatures (usually the senate) that had districts that strongly favored rural areas to the disadvantage of cities. In the landmark case of Baker v. Carr  (1962), the Warren Court declared this practice unconstitutional. In 
Baker  and later cases, the Court established the principle of “one man, one 
vote , ” meaning that election districts would have to be redrawn to provide 
equal representation for all citizens.
Freedom of Expression and Privacy Other rulings by the Warren Court 
extended the rights mentioned in the 1st Amendment to protect the actions of protesters, to permit greater latitude under freedom of the press, to ban religious activities sponsored by public schools, and to guarantee adults’ rights to use contraceptives.
• Y ates v. United States  (1957) said that the 1st Amendment protected 
radical and revolutionary speech, even by Communists, unless it was a “clear and present danger” to the safety of the country.
• Engel v. Vitale (1962) ruled that state laws requiring prayers and Bible readings in the public schools violated the 1st Amendment’s provision for separation of church and state.
661  TOPIC 8.11   THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT E xPANDS• Griswold v. Connecticut  (1965) ruled that, in recognition of a citizen’s 
right to privacy, a state could not prohibit the use of contraceptives 
by adults. (This privacy case provided the foundation for later cases establishing a woman’s right to an abortion.)
The Warren Court’s defense of the rights of unpopular individuals, 
including people accused of crimes, provoked a storm of controversy. Critics called for Warren’s impeachment. Both supporters and critics agreed that the Warren Court profoundly changed the interpretation of constitutional rights.

Topic 8.12
Youth Culture of the 1960s
Hey, we’re going to change everything.  
We’re going to stop the war tomorrow.
David Crosby, interview for Woodstock: The Oral History, 1989
Learning Objective : Explain how and why opposition to existing policies 
and values developed and changed over the course of the 20th century.
M any American youth in the 1960s were idealistic and desired to make 
the world a better place to live. When President Kennedy created the Peace 
Corps in 1961, there was a surge of volunteers. While most young Americans accepted the social order of the day, a growing number wanted more than the conformity and materialism they saw in the middle-class culture of the 1950s.
Baby Boom Generation
During the 1960s, the first of the baby boom generation were graduating from high school and going to college. Between 1945 and 1970, college and university enrollments had quadrupled. As many American institutions soon discovered, they were not ready for the large numbers of this generation that had not lived through the Great Depression and World War II. Instead they had been influenced by the civil rights movements of African Americans and other groups demanding justice, freedom, and equality.
Student Movement and the New Left
In the early and mid-1960s, various liberal groups began to identify with blacks’ struggle against oppressive controls and laws. The first such group to rebel against established authority were college and university students. In 1962, a newly formed radical student organization called Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) held a meeting in Port Huron, Michigan. Following the leadership of Tom Hayden, the group issued a declaration of purposes known as the Port Huron Statement. It called for university decisions to be made through participatory democracy so that students would have a voice in decisions affecting their lives. Activists and intellectuals who supported Hayden’s ideas became known as the New Left . 
The first major student protest took place in 1964 on the Berkeley campus 
of the University of California. Calling their cause the Free Speech Movement, Berkeley students demanded an end to university restrictions on students’ 
664 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONpolitical activities. They also demanded a greater voice in the government of 
the university. By the mid-1960s, students across the country were protesting against everything from university rules against drinking and coed dorm visits to the right to organize and protest. However, their primary focus became opposition to the war in Vietnam and the draft. 
Students Against the Vietnam War 
Student demonstrations grew with the escalation of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and the dramatic increase in the draft of young men into the military. Students in college could usually claim a deferment but faced the draft after leaving school. Campuses across the nation were disrupted or closed down by antiwar protests. In the first six months of 1968, more than 40,000 students protested in more than 200 demonstrations on 100 campuses across the nation. Demonstrations included draft-card burning, sit-ins, and protests against military recruiters and ROTC programs. Students also protested against war-related companies trying to recruit graduates, such as Dow Chemical Company, which manufactured napalm. Several thousand young men also fled to Canada or Europe to avoid serving in what many thought was an immoral war.
The Vietnam War and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and 
Robert Kennedy made 1968 an especially bad year for protests. SDS members joined African American students in a sit-in and occupation of buildings on the campus of Columbia University in New Y ork City to protest racial discrimination. After nearly a week, police were called in and some 150 protesters were injured and 700 arrested. 
The Chicago Convention The best-known off-campus protest in 1968 
was in Chicago during the Democratic Convention . A mix of peaceful and 
radical antiwar protesters, anarchists, and Yippies  (members of the Y outh 
International Party) damaged property, terrorized pedestrians, and taunted police. In response, Mayor Richard Daley ordered the police to break up the demonstrations in what some in the media called a “police riot. ”
The Weather Underground The most radical fringe of the SDS, known 
as the Weather Underground, embraced violence and vandalism in their attacks of “the system. ” Their methods escalated from riots to stealing weapons to bombings from 1969 through the 1970s. More than 280 Weathermen were arrested during the “Days of Rage” riots carried out in Chicago in 1969. 
The Weather Underground was almost unique among radicals in that 
period in using dynamite bombs to protest government war policies, racial unfairness, and corporate greed. The Weathermen believed that the evil of these injustices warranted an extreme response, if not a revolution. They set off about 25 bombs during their seven years of existence, including bombs at the Capitol, Pentagon, and State Department, which landed them on the FBI’s Most Wanted list. In the eyes of most Americans, the Weathermen’s extremist acts and language discredited the early idealism of the New Left. 
665  TOPIC 8.12   Y OUTH CULTURE OF THE 1960SThe Counterculture
The political protests of the New Left went hand in hand with a new youth 
counterculture  that was expressed in rebellious styles of dress, music, drug use, 
and, for some, communal living. The apparent dress code of the “hippies” and “flower children” of the 1960s included long hair, beards, beads, and jeans. The folk music of Joan Baez and Bob Dylan gave voice to the younger generation’s protests, while the rock music of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jim Morrison, and Janis Joplin provided the beat and lyrics for the counterculture. 
Woodstock In 1969, a gathering of hundreds of thousands of young people 
at the W oodstock  Music Festival in upper New Y ork State reflected the zenith of 
the counterculture. However, as a result of experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD or becoming addicted to various other drugs, some young people destroyed their lives. The counterculture’s excesses and the economic uncertainties of the times led to its demise in the 1970s.
Sexual Revolution  One aspect of the counterculture that continued 
beyond the 1960s was a change in many Americans’ attitudes toward sexual expression. Traditional beliefs about sexual conduct had originally been challenged in the late 1940s and 1950s by the pioneering surveys of sexual practice conducted by Alfred Kinsey. His research indicated that premarital sex, marital infidelity, and homosexuality were more common than anyone had suspected. Medicine (antibiotics for sexually transmitted diseases) and science (the introduction of the birth-control pill in 1960) also contributed to changing attitudes about engaging in casual sex with a number of partners. Moreover, overtly sexual themes in advertisements, magazines, and movies made sex appear to be just one more consumer product. 
How deeply the so-called sexual revolution  changed the behavior of the 
majority of Americans is open to question. There is little doubt, however, that premarital sex, contraception, abortion, and homosexuality became more visible and widely accepted. Later, in the 1980s, there was a general reaction against the loosened moral codes as many blamed it for an increase in illegitimate births, especially among teenagers, an increase in rape and sexual abuse, and the spread of a deadly new disease, AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).
In Retrospect
The generation of baby boomers that came of age in the 1960s believed fervently in the ideals of a democratic society. They hoped to slay the dragons of unresponsive authority, poverty, racism, and war. However, the impatience of some activists with change, the use of violence, and the spread of self-destructive behavior discredited their cause in the eyes of others, particularly older Americans. The mantra of the counterculture, “sex, drugs, and rock and roll, ” was rejected by the majority of Americans and helped to motivate the conservative resurgence in the late 1970s with an emphasis on order and traditional values (Topic 8.14).

The Environment and Natural 
Resources from 1968 to 1980
Industrial vomit . . . fills our skies and seas . . . 
Our technological powers increase, but the side effects  
and potential hazards also escalate.
Alvin Toffler, Future Shock, 1970
Learning Objective : Explain how and why policies related to the 
environment developed and changed from 1968 to 1980.
The Progressive Era conservation movement was fairly small and led by 
politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt. In contrast, the modern environmental 
movement had widespread popular support. Some conservation measures, however, were driven by world events such as oil shortages and high prices.
Origins of the Environmental Movement
In the 1950s and 1960s, three biologists helped launch the modern environmental movement. Through their writings and activism, they made issues such as chemical pollution, nuclear fallout, and population growth a public concern.
Rachel Carson Many historians mark the beginning of the modern 
American environmental movement with the publication of biologist  Rachel 
Carson ’s Silent Spring  in 1962. Silent Spring  explained the negative 
environmental effects of DDT, a potent insecticide that had been used in American agriculture. Carson argued that unchecked industrial growth would destroy animal life and ultimately human life on earth. This best-selling book forced Americans to question whether “better living through chemistry” was the solution or the cause of the emerging environmental crisis.
Barry Commoner In the late 1950s, Barry Commoner and other 
researchers began finding high levels of a cancer-causing substance, strontium-90, in children’s teeth. It came from nuclear weapons tests. Commoner led the political fight to end such testing. In 1963, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries agreed to stop testing weapons aboveground.
Paul Ehrlich In his book The Population Bomb (1968), biologist Paul 
Ehrlich argued that overpopulation was causing the world’s environmental 
669  TOPIC 8.13   THE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES FROM 1968 TO 1980problems. The most frightening of his predictions, that starvation would 
increase dramatically, did not come to pass. Increases in agricultural productivity and anti-poverty programs moderated the effects of population growth. However, his book did spark a debate over how many people the earth could sustain.
Public Awareness
During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, several environmental disasters raised the public awareness of damage to the environment caused by human behavior. Media coverage of industrial disasters increased public questioning of the benefits of industry and new technologies in what some called a “postmodern” culture. 
Environmental accidents reinforced the fears of the deadly combination of 
human error and modern technology. 
• In 1954, the 23-man crew of the Japanese fishing vessel Lucky Dragon was exposed to radioactive fallout from a hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll, a chain of islands in the Pacific Ocean.
• In 1969, an oil well blowout in Santa Barbara Bay spilled more than 200,000 gallons of oil into the ocean. The widespread pollution of the California coastline forced the oil industry to reform its operations. 
• Also in 1969, Ohio’s Cuyahoga River burst into flames from all the oil and chemicals floating on the surface.
• In 1979, opinion also turned against building additional nuclear power plants after an accident at the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania. 
Such events convinced many Americas that the United States had serious environmental problems.
Earth Day The first Earth Day in 1970 reflected the nation’s growing 
concerns over air and water pollution and the destruction of the natural environment, including wildlife. In  New Y ork  City, 100,000 people showed their support for protecting the earth. Organizers estimated that 1,500 colleges and 10,000 schools took part in Earth Day. Time  magazine estimated that about 
20 million Americans participated in some activity related to the event. The popularity of the environmental movement grew after 1970 and became an important political issue.
Pictures from Space The Apollo crew’s first photographs of Earth from 
space in 1968 also raised awareness of humanity’s home. These images portrayed a relatively small and fragile planet in the vast lifeless vacuum of space. The photograph, named “Earthrise, ” and variations of it, became iconic images for the environmental movement. They helped people around the world gain a new perspectiveson the human condition and better understand their shared but finite environment.

Environmental Activists The environmental movement grew and 
gained strength by the late 1960s. For example, membership in the  Sierra 
Club  expanded from 123,000 in 1960 to 819,000 in 1970. Building on the organization and tactics of the civil rights and antiwar movements, thousands of citizens, especially middle-class youth, men, and women, joined the environmental movement. During the 1970s, mainstream environmental organizations, such as the National Audubon Society, the Environmental Defense Fund, the National Wildlife Federation, the National Resources Defense Council, the National Parks Conservation Association, and the Sierra Club, established sophisticated operations in Washington, D.C. These groups served a watchdog function, monitoring whether environmental regulations were properly enforced by federal agencies. They hired lobbyists to advocate for environmental legislation, lawyers to enforce environmental standards in the courts, and scientists to help determine when new regulations were needed.
Government Environmental Protection
While the federal government was slow to develop environmental protection legislation, the state of California became a leader in auto emissions standards by mandating that engine gases be recycled to cut back on the pollution and smog choking its large cities. Congress had passed some air and water quality legislation during the postwar period but often left regulation and enforcement to the individual states. 
In the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson (1963–1969) signed almost 300 
conservation and beautification bills, supported by more than $12 billion in authorized funds. The most significant was the Wilderness Act, which permanently set aside certain federal lands from commercial economic development in order to preserve them in their natural state. The  federal government also took a new interest in controlling pollution. 
During the Nixon administration, protecting the environment was a 
bipartisan issue, and the administration worked with a Democratic majority in Congress. President Nixon recognized the power of a popular movement 
671  TOPIC 8.13   THE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES FROM 1968 TO 1980and over the next few years proposed an ambitious program, including the 
Environmental Protection Agency, the foundation of the nation’s modern environmental protection system.
Environmental Protection Agency To enforce federal regulations, 
Nixon created the  Environmental Protection Agency  (EP A) in 1970. An 
independent federal agency, the EPA was given responsibility for regulating and enforcing federal programs and policies on air and  water pollution, radiation issues, pesticides, and solid waste. The agency began with a staff of 8,000 and a budget of $455 million, but by 1981 it had a staff of nearly 13,000 and a budget of $1.35 billion. Enforcing environmental regulations proved to be a difficult and complex task, particularly as new legislation gave the agency more responsibilities. 
Clean Air and Water During the 1970s, the federal government took 
over responsibility for clean air and water. Growing concerns about the environmental and economic impact of polluted air and water came from growing cities as well as rural areas. The Clean Air Act of 1970 regulated air emissions from both stationary and mobile sources and authorized the EPA to set standards to protect public health by regulating emissions of hazardous air pollutants.
Other legislation followed, including the Marine Protection, Research, 
and Sanctuaries Act of 1972; the Safe Drinking Water Act (1974); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (1976); the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1977, which became known as the Clean Water Act ; and the 
Superfund Act (1980) to clean up toxic waste from former industrial sites.
Wildlife Protection The Endangered Species Act of 1973 was created 
to protect critically imperiled species such as the American bald eagle from  extinction  as a “consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation. ” The Endangered Species 
Act was created to also protect the ecosystems upon which wildlife depend. The 
habitat of wildlife became the source of contention between preservationists and land developers and industries. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 was called “the Magna Carta of the environmental movement. ”
The Oil Embargo and Fuel Economy As a result of the 1973 Y om Kippur 
War (Topic 8.7), the Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) placed an embargo on oil sold to Israel’s supporters, which included the United States. This caused a worldwide oil shortage and long lines at American gas pumps. In response, Congress reduced speed limits to save gasoline. And consumers switched from big American-made gas guzzlers to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars imported from Japan. In 1975 Congress first enacted standards for fuel economy, which resulted in more fuel-efficient American cars. More fuel-efficient cars meant fewer harmful emissions, bolstering the regulation of tailpipe emissions that was part of the Clean Air Act of 1970 and helping to reduce the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that scientists blame for climate change.
672 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONAntinuclear Movement Antinuclear protests grew out of the 
environmental movement, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s. Public opinion also 
turned against building additional nuclear power plants after the accident at the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania. Besides the growing concerns over the safety of nuclear power plants, the issue of disposal of the radioactive waste became a major issue, as it needed to be safely stored somewhere for many generations. The antinuclear movement  delayed construction or 
halted commitments to build new nuclear plants, and pressured the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to enforce and strengthen the safety regulations for nuclear power plants. 
Backlash to Environmental Regulations
In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan sought to curtail the scope of environmental protection. For example, by 1984 the EPA ’s budget was cut by 44 percent, and the number of enforcement cases submitted to the EPA declined by 56 percent. It turned out that the 1970s were a high point in the environmental movement as industrial and conservative groups fought back against federal regulations.

Society in Transition
My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over. Our Constitution 
works, our great Republic is a government of laws, not men.
President Gerald Ford, speech after Nixon’s resignation, August 9, 1974
Learning Objectives : Explain the causes and effects of continuing policy 
debates about the role of the federal government over time. Explain the 
effects of religious movements over the course of the 20th century.
The 1970s was a decade many Americans wanted to forget, marked by losses 
in Vietnam and Cambodia, the Kent State shootings, the OPEC oil embargo, 
and the Watergate scandal, along with high unemployment, stagnant wages, 
hyperinflation, tax revolts, the polarization of politics, and the politicization of religion. The 1970s also marked the transition from the dominance of the more liberal Democratic Party to the more conservative Republican Party, each with a very different view on the role of the federal government.
American Society in Transition
Social changes in the 1970s had even greater potential significance than politics. By the end of the decade, half of all Americans lived in the fastest-growing sections of the country—the South and the West. Unlike the previous decade, which was dominated by the youth revolt, the 1970s was the decade when Americans became conscious that the population was aging. The fastest-growing age group consisted of senior citizens, people over age 65.
The country’s racial and ethnic composition was also changing noticeably 
in the late 20th century. By 1990, minority groups made up 25 percent of the population. The Census Bureau predicted that by 2050 as much as half of the population would be Hispanic American, African American, or Asian American. Cultural pluralism was replacing the melting pot as the model for U.S. society, as diverse ethnic and cultural groups strove not only to end discrimination and improve their lives but also to celebrate their unique traditions.
The Nixon Presidency
Having received just 43 percent of the popular vote in 1968, President Richard Nixon (1969–1974) was well aware of being a minority president. He devised a political strategy to form a Republican majority by appealing 
675  TOPIC 8.14   S OCIETY IN TRANSITIONto the millions of voters who had become disaffected by civil rights, liberal 
court rulings, antiwar protests, black militants, school busing to achieve racial balance, and the excesses of the youth counterculture. Nixon referred to these conservative Americans as the “silent majority. ” Many of them were Democrats, including southern Whites, northern Catholic blue-collar workers, and recent suburbanites who disagreed with the liberal drift of their party.
Nixon’s Southern Strategy To win over the South, the president asked 
the federal courts in that region to delay integration plans and busing orders. He also nominated two Southern conservatives (Clement Haynsworth and G.  Harold Carswell) to the Supreme Court. Though the courts rejected his requests and the Senate refused to confirm the two nominees, his strategy played well with southern White voters. 
Nixon’s Southern strategy proved a powerful tool for the Republican 
Party in future elections, as the party became more socially conservative and political power shifted to the Sun Belt and rural America. This also diminished prospects for further civil rights legislation far into the future. 
The Election of 1972 The success of Nixon’s Southern strategy became 
evident in the presidential election of 1972 when the Republican ticket won majorities in every Southern state. Nixon’s reelection was practically assured by (1) his foreign policy successes in China and the Soviet Union (Topic 8.2), (2)  the removal of George Wallace from the race by a would-be assassin’s bullet that paralyzed the Alabama populist, and (3) the nomination by the Democrats of a very liberal antiwar, antiestablishment candidate, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota.
On election day, Nixon overwhelmed McGovern in a landslide victory 
that carried every state but Massachusetts and won 61 percent of the popular vote. The Democrats still managed to keep control of both houses of Congress. Nevertheless, the voting patterns for Nixon indicated the start of a major political realignment of Sun Belt and suburban voters, who were forming a new Republican majority. Nixon’s electoral triumph in 1972 made the Watergate revelations and scandals of 1973 all the more surprising. For details about Richard Nixon’s presidency, see Topics 8.2 (Cold War), 8.4 (Economy), and 8.8 (Vietnam).
Watergate Scandal
The tragedy of Watergate  went well beyond the public humiliation of Richard 
Nixon and the conviction and jailing of 26 White House officials and aides. Watergate had a paralyzing effect on the political system in the mid-1970s, a critical time both at home and overseas, when the country needed respected, strong, and confident leadership.
White House Abuses In June 1972, a group of men hired by Nixon’s 
reelection committee was caught breaking into the offices of the Democratic national headquarters in the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. This 
676 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONbreak-in and attempted bugging were only part of a series of illegal activities 
and “dirty tricks” conducted by the Nixon administration and the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP).
Earlier Nixon had ordered wiretaps on government employees and 
reporters to stop news leaks such as the one that had exposed the secret bombing of Cambodia. The president’s aides created a group, called the “plumbers , ” to stop leaks as well as to discredit opponents. Before Watergate, 
the “plumbers” had burglarized the office of psychiatrist Daniel Ellsberg, the person behind the leaking of the Pentagon Papers, in order to obtain information to discredit Ellsberg. The White House had also created an “enemies list” of prominent Americans who opposed Nixon, the Vietnam War, or both. People on this list were investigated by government agencies, such as the IRS. The illegal break-in at Watergate reflected the attitude in the Nixon administration that any means could be used to promote national security—an objective that was often confused with protecting the Nixon administration from its critics.
Watergate Investigation  No solid proof demonstrated that President 
Nixon ordered any of these illegal activities. However, after months of investigation, it became clear that Nixon did engage in an illegal cover-up to avoid scandal. Tough sentencing of the Watergate burglars by federal Judge John Sirica led to information about the use of money and a promise of pardons by the White House staff to keep the burglars quiet. A Senate investigating committee headed by Democrat Sam Ervin of North Carolina brought the abuses to the attention of Americans through televised hearings. A highlight of these hearings was the testimony of a White House lawyer, John Dean, who linked the president to the cover-up. Nixon’s top aides, H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, resigned to protect him and were later indicted, as were many others, for obstructing justice.
The discovery of a taping system in the Oval Office led to a year-long 
struggle between Nixon, who claimed executive privilege for the tapes, and investigators, who wanted the tapes to prove the cover-up charges. The Nixon administration received another blow in the fall of 1973, when Vice President Agnew had to resign when the Justice Department discovered evidence of his political corruption, including accepting bribes as governor of Maryland and as vice president. Replacing him was Michigan Representative Gerald Ford. 
Resignation of a President  In 1974, Nixon made triumphal visits to 
Moscow and Cairo, but at home his reputation continued to slide. In October 1973, the president appeared to be interfering with the Watergate investigation when he fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor assigned to the case. In protest, the U.S. attorney general resigned. The House of Representatives began impeachment hearings, which caused Nixon to reveal transcripts of some of the Watergate tapes in April 1974. Still, it took a Supreme Court decision in July to force him to turn over the tapes to the courts and Congress. Included on one tape made just days after the Watergate burglary was an 18½-minute gap 
677  TOPIC 8.14   S OCIETY IN TRANSITIONthat had been erased. Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee voted three 
articles of impeachment: (1) obstruction of justice, (2) abuse of power, and (3) contempt of Congress.

The conversations recorded on the tapes shocked friends and foes alike. 
The transcript of one such White House conversation clearly implicated Nixon in the cover-up only days after the Watergate break-in. Faced with certain impeachment in the House and a trial in the Senate, Richard Nixon chose to resign on August 9, 1974. Vice President Gerald Ford then took the oath of office as the first unelected president in U.S. history.
Significance To some, the final outcome of the Watergate scandal (Nixon 
leaving office under pressure) proved that the U.S. constitutional system of checks and balances worked as it was intended. For others, the scandal underlined the dangerous shift of power to the presidency that began with Franklin Roosevelt and had been expanded during the Cold War. Without a doubt, Watergate contributed to a growing loss of faith in the federal government.
Gerald Ford in the White House (1974–1977)
Before Nixon chose him to replace Vice President Agnew in 1973, Gerald Ford  had served in Congress for years as a representative from Michigan 
and as the Republican minority leader of the House. Ford was a likable and unpretentious man, but many questioned his ability to be president. For details about Gerald Ford’s presidency, see Topics 8.2 (Cold War), 8.4 (Economy), and 8.8 (Vietnam).
678 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONPardoning of Nixon In his first month in office, President Ford lost the 
goodwill of many by granting Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any 
crime that he might have committed. The pardon was extended even before any formal charges or indictment had been made by a court of law. Ford was accused of making a “corrupt bargain” with Nixon, but he explained that the purpose of the pardon was to end the “national nightmare, ” instead of prolonging it for months, if not years. Critics were angered that the full truth of Nixon’s deeds never came out.
Investigating the CIA During Ford’s presidency (1974–1977), the 
Democratic Congress continued to search for abuses in the executive branch, especially in the CIA. This intelligence agency was accused of engineering the assassinations of foreign leaders, among them the Marxist president of Chile, Salvador Allende. Ford appointed former Texas Congressman George H. W . Bush to reform the agency.
Bicentennial Celebration In 1976, the United States celebrated its 200th 
birthday. Americans’ pride in their history helped to put Watergate and Vietnam behind them. Even the lackluster presidency of Gerald Ford served the purpose of restoring candor and humility to the White House.
The Election of 1976
Watergate still cast its gloom over the Republican Party in the 1976 elections. President Ford was challenged for the party’s nomination by Ronald Reagan, a former actor and ex-governor of California, who enjoyed the support of the more conservative Republicans. Ford won the nomination in a close battle, but the conflict with Reagan hurt him in the polls.
A number of Democrats competed for their party’s nomination, including 
a little-known former governor of Georgia, James Earl (Jimmy) Carter. With Watergate still on voters’ minds, Carter had success running as an outsider against the corruption in Washington. His victories in open primaries reduced the influence of more experienced Democratic politicians. After watching his huge lead in the polls evaporate in the closing days of the campaign, Carter managed to win a close election (287 electoral votes to 241 for Ford) by carrying most of the South and getting an estimated 97 percent of the African American vote. In the aftermath of Watergate, the Democrats also won strong majorities in both houses of Congress.
An Outsider in the White House
The informal style of Jimmy Carter signaled an effort to end the imperial presidency. On his inauguration day, he walked down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House instead of riding in the presidential limousine. Public images of the president carrying his own luggage may have impressed average Americans. However, veteran members of Congress always viewed Carter as an outsider who depended too much on his politically inexperienced advisers from Georgia. Even Carter’s keen intelligence and dedication to duty may have been partly a liability in causing him to pay close attention to all the details of 
679  TOPIC 8.14   S OCIETY IN TRANSITIONgovernment operations. Critics observed that, when it came to distinguishing 
between the forest and the trees, Carter was a “leaf man. ” For details about Jimmy Carter’s presidency, see Topics 8.2 (Cold War), 8.4 (Economy), and 8.7 (World Power).
Loss of Popularity The Iranian hostage crisis and worsening economic 
crisis hurt Carter in the opinion polls. In 1979, in what the press called Carter’s “national malaise” speech, he blamed the problems of the United States on a “moral and spiritual crisis” of the American people. By that time, however, many Americans blamed the president for weak and indecisive leadership. By the 1980 election year his approval rating had fallen to only 23 percent. In seeking a second term, the unpopular president was clearly vulnerable to political challenges from both Democrats and Republicans.
The Burger Court
As liberal justices of the Supreme Court retired, Nixon had replaced them with more conservative members. However, like other presidents, Nixon found that his appointees did not always rule as he had hoped. In 1969, after Chief Justice Earl Warren resigned, Nixon appointed Warren E. Burger of Minnesota to replace him. The Burger Court was more conservative than the Warren Court, but several of its major decisions angered conservatives. For example, in 1971 the Court ordered busing to achieve racial balance in the schools, and in 1972 it issued strict guidelines that made carrying out the death penalty more difficult. Finally, in the last days of Nixon’s Watergate agony, the Court that he had tried to shape denied his claims to executive privilege and ordered him to turn over the Watergate tapes (United States v. Nixon,  1974).
Abortion Rights The Court’s most controversial ruling was Roe v. Wade 
(1973). In this 7–2 decision, the high court struck down many state laws prohibiting abortions as a violation of a woman’s right to privacy. The decision to allow women access to abortions became a primary target for the conservative movement in the coming decades. Over time, opposition to abortion became a virtual political requirement for Republican candidates to either overturn or limit the Roe decision through legislation and conservative appointees to the 
federal courts.

680 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONConservative Resurgence
The protest movements by diverse groups in American society seemed to 
produce more social stress and fragmentation. Combined with a slowing economy and a declining standard of living, these forces left many Americans feeling angry and bitter. A conservative reaction to the liberal policies of the New Deal and the Great Society was gaining strength in the late 1970s and would prove a powerful force in the politics of the next decades.
Conservative Religious Revival Moral decay was a weekly theme of 
religious leaders on television such as Pat Robertson, Oral Roberts, and Jim Baker. By 1980, televangelists had a combined weekly audience of between 60 million and 100 million viewers. 
Religion became an instrument of electoral politics when an evangelist 
from Virginia, Jerry Falwell, founded the Moral Majority, which financed campaigns to unseat liberal members of Congress. Religious fundamentalists attacked “secular humanism” as a godless creed taking over public education and also campaigned for the return of prayers and the teaching of the Biblical account of creation in public schools. The legalization of abortion in the Roe  
v. Wade  (1973) decision sparked the right-to-life movement. This movement 
united many Catholics and fundamentalist Protestants who believed that human life begins at the moment of conception.
Deregulation of Business Starting in the 1970s, business interests 
launched a very successful campaign to mobilize and influence federal and state governments to curtail regulations, lower taxes, and weaken labor unions. Business donors created “think tanks, ” such as the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and the Cato Institute, to promote free-market ideas, while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbied for pro-business legislation.
Elimination of Racial Preferences In 1965, President Johnson had 
committed the U.S. government to a policy of affirmative action to ensure that underprivileged minorities and women would have equal access to education, jobs, and promotions. Suffering through years of recession and stagflation in the 1970s, many Whites blamed their troubles on affirmative action, calling it “reverse discrimination. ” In a landmark court case challenging the admissions policies of one medical school, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke  (1978), the Supreme Court ruled that while race could be considered, 
the school had created racial quotas, which were unconstitutional. Using this decision, conservatives intensified their campaign to end all preferences based on race and ethnicity. 
Taxpayers’ Revolt In 1978, California voters led the revolt against 
increasing taxes by passing Proposition 13, a measure that sharply cut property taxes. Nationally, conservatives promoted economist Arthur Laffer’s belief that tax cuts would increase government revenues. Two Republican members of Congress, Jack Kemp and William Roth, proposed legislation 
681  TOPIC 8.14   S OCIETY IN TRANSITIONto reduce federal taxes by 30 percent, which became the basis for President 
Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts.
A New Era in American Politics
The rise of conservatism reshaped the political climate.

Questions 1–3 refer to the following excerpt.
“Our people are losing faith, not only in government itself but in their ability 
as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy. 
We were sure that ours was a nation of the ballot, not the bullet, until the 
murders of John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. We were taught that our armies were always invincible and our causes were always just, only to suffer the agony of Vietnam. We respected the Presidency as a place of honor until the shock of Watergate.

Topic 8.15
Continuity and Change in Period 8
Learning Objective : Explain the extent to which the events of the period 
from 1945 to 1980 reshaped national identity. 
The Cold War tested Americans’ image of themselves as the leaders of the 
free world. Hot wars in Korea and Vietnam challenged their resolve to bear the 
ongoing sacrifice of men and resources to stop the advances of communism. For example, by the 1970s it became clear that the involuntary military service through the Selective Service draft had become very unpopular with the younger generation. Under the Nixon Doctrine future allies would receive U.S. support but without U.S. ground forces. While the commitment to stop aggression remained largely unchanged, many Americans became unwilling to serve in future wars.
The Cold War also tested Americans’ commitment to the Bill of Rights, 
especially during the Red Scare. Americans’ tolerance of opposing views as an exercise of their freedom of speech rather than the work of traitors varied from case to case. The civil rights movements of the period also exposed differences in Americans’ understanding of the Constitution and ideas about freedom, equality, and assimilation. Although the progress made in legal standing of women and minorities can be well documented or, as Dr. King argued, “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice, ” vestiges of bigotry and racism continued into the next period. 
American identity as the economic powerhouse of the world also underwent 
change during this period as other nations recovered from World War II and modernized their industries. The identity of many American wage earners and others who became part of the middle class during the 1950s was also tested as their economic status stagnated or declined by the 1970s. The emergence of populist politicians such as George Wallace reflected the resentments of a working and middle class under pressure from competition from overseas and racial integration at home.
In addition to international, economic, and assimilation events, American 
identity was changed by the new generation of Americans born after World War II who not only had different ideas about music and dress, but also new definitions of status, work, and the freedom to live alternative lifestyles. Was there more continuity or change during the period from 1945 to 1980? The conclusion often depends on the topic and criteria used to measure change, but the period provides a wealth of contrasting points of view.
685  TOPIC 8.15   C ONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN PERIOD 8QUESTIONS ABOUT CONTINUITY AND CHANGE
1. Evaluate the extent to which the Cold War reshaped the American 
national identity in the period from 1945 to 1980.
2. Evaluate the extent to which the African American civil rights movement changed the American national identity in the period from 1945 to 1980.
THINK AS A HISTORIAN:  ARGUMENTATION—SUPPORT AND REASONING
Success on the AP® exam requires you to do much more than recall specific facts and details. Y ou will also need to use and evaluate that information in various ways, including understanding that some pieces of evidence are more important and more convincing than others. The free-response questions on the exam will require you to think about what you have learned and then choose supporting evidence that is accurate and relevant to the argument.
Part of your task on the exam will be not only to cite evidence but also to 
explain how different pieces of evidence relate to one another. As discussed in the Think as a Historian feature in Unit 7, the exam will focus on the reasoning processes of causation, comparison, and continuity and change. Using these reasoning processes is particularly important in answering the document-based question and the long essay question.
Select one of the arguments below and answer the two questions that follow.
Argument 1: Actions such as Winston Churchill’s “iron curtain” speech and 
Harry Truman’s encouraging the United States to join NATO were meant to 
protect capitalist countries. However, these actions actually helped to bring about and intensify the Cold War.
Argument 2: The launch of the Soviet Sputnik  satellites initially raised Cold 
War tensions but eventually led to significant technological achievements in 
the United States.
Argument 3: The completion of the Interstate Highway System led to economic 
progress and environmental destruction.Argument 4: The Tet Offensive was a military failure but a political success for 
Communist forces in North Vietnam.Argument 5: Although Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society programs have been 
attacked as unrealistic and inefficient, many of them still affect Americans’ 
daily lives.
1. What evidence for this argument can you describe and explain? 
2. What relationships exist between these pieces of evidence? Do any of them share causation, comparison, or continuity? Explain your answer.

    UNIT 8 — Period 8 Review:  
1945–1980
WRITE AS A HISTORIAN:  WRITE THE CONCLUSION
A strong conclusion helps create unity by circling back to the ideas in your 
introduction and thesis statement. The conclusion is also a good opportunity to extend and refine the complex understanding you have developed and woven throughout your essay.
Providing Unity While wrapping up your essay with a return to the 
ideas in your introduction helps provide unity, do more than restate your thesis. If your thesis is that the main cause of the end of the Cold War was technological change, avoid saying simply: “The Soviets lost the Cold War because they failed to adapt to new technology. ” Instead, you might say, “ Although Gorbachev’s efforts at reform and Reagan’s willingness to negotiate arms deals weakened Soviet conservatives, the most basic problem the Soviets faced was that technology changed faster than the government did. The Soviets could neither afford new industrial technology nor keep out liberal ideas coming in through new communications technology. ” This change extends the thesis statement. 
Demonstrating Complexity An extension of your thesis statement 
such as the one above also helps demonstrate a complex understanding of the topic by referring to multiple causes. The College Board identifies the following ways to demonstrate a complex understanding: “Corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument using diverse and alternative evidence in order to develop a complex argument. ” Y ou might, for example, analyze multiple variables to arrive at a nuanced conclusion: Y ou could point out that the Soviets continued to invest in new military technology and that the breakdown of the alliance with China hurt them diplomatically. 
Other ways you can demonstrate a complex understanding are to 
consider the significance of a source’s credibility and limitations and explain why a historical argument is or is not effective. Most of the development of your complex understanding must be done within the body of your essay for you to earn the point for complexity, but you can use the conclusion to summarize or extend that understanding. 
Application: Review the sample scored essays on the College Board website. 
Evaluate the conclusion of each sample. For any that lack a conclusion, draft one 
that would provide unity to the essay and summarize a complex understanding of the historical development.

December 10, 1964
“I accept the Nobel Prize for Peace at a moment when 22 million Negroes of the 
United States of America are engaged in a creative battle to end the long night of racial injustice. I accept this award on behalf of a civil rights movement which is moving with determination and a majestic scorn for risk and danger to estab-lish a reign of freedom and a rule of justice. I am mindful that only yesterday in Birmingham, Alabama, our children, crying out for brotherhood, were answered with fire hoses, snarling dogs and even death. I am mindful that only yesterday in Philadelphia, Mississippi, young people seeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered. And only yesterday more than 40 houses of worship in the State of Mississippi alone were bombed or burned because they offered a sanctuary to those who would not accept segregation. I am mindful that debilitat-ing and grinding poverty afflicts my people and chains them to the lowest rung of the economic ladder. 
The tortuous road which has led from Montgomery, Alabama, to Oslo bears 
witness to this truth [nonviolence]. This is a road over which millions of Negroes are travelling to find a new sense of dignity. This same road has opened for all Americans a new era of progress and hope. It has led to a new Civil Rights Bill, and it will, I am convinced, be widened and lengthened into a super highway of justice as Negro and white men in increasing numbers create alliances to over -
come their common problems. ”

Contextualizing Period 9
Learning Objective : Explain the context in which the United States  
faced international and domestic challenges after 1980.
The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 signaled the closing of the chapter on 
the postwar era. The United States now entered a more conservative political 
period. The political divide between rural and urban regions increased. Rural regions became older, Whiter, and more conservative. Urban regions became younger, multicultural, and more open to changing ideas about gender and ethnicity. This divide showed up clearly in bitterly fought presidential elections, contentious federal court nominations, and government shutdowns.
In Reagan’s historic 
appearance  at the Brandenburg Gate of the Berlin Wall in 1987, he challenged the Soviets to “tear down this wall. ”
Source: Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library
In foreign affairs, President Reagan combined an aggressive anti-
Communist foreign policy with a willingness to negotiate arms-reduction 
treaties with the Soviet Union, which collapsed in 1991. However, the end of the Cold War took away the 45-year focus of U.S. foreign policy and revealed the political, ethnic, and religious conflicts long suppressed in many countries during the Cold War that would explode in violence in the following decades. After the terrorists’ attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States quickly became involved in seemingly endless wars in the Middle East, and terrorist threats and homeland security came to dominate American priorities.
The decline of faith in the federal government’s ability to solve social 
and economic problems, and the championing of unregulated markets by American corporations, gave conservatism new life in both the Republican UNIT 9 — Period 9: 1980–Present
693  TOPIC 9.1   C ONTE xTUALIz ING PERIOD 9and Democratic Parties. Republicans were also strengthened by the increasing 
involvement of evangelical Christians in politics, the demographic growth of the Sun Belt, and the shift of Southern White conservative voters into their party. However, the economic problems of the era also opened the door to populist and autocratic movements.
After 1980, increased competition from globalization and financial 
mismanagement at home challenged American economic success. Corporate capitalism and tax cuts seemed to mainly benefit the top 5 percent, while the income of the lower and middle class stagnated. Industrial decline in many parts of America and downturns in the economy, such as the Great Recession of 2008, left many Americans living in or on the edge of poverty. Depression and drug use increased, and the average American life span declined for the first time in many decades.

Topic 9.2
Reagan and Conservatism
In this present crisis, government is not the solution  
to our problem; government is the problem.
President Ronald Reagan, inaugural address, January 20, 1981
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of continuing 
debates about the role of the federal government.
The rebirth of the conservative movement can be traced back to the 
Goldwater campaign for president in 1964. The election of Ronald Reagan as 
president in 1980 signaled its arrival as a dominant force in American politics.
Ronald Reagan and the Election of 1980
Ronald Reagan, a well-known movie and television actor, gained fame among Republicans as an effective political speaker in the 1964 Goldwater campaign. He was soon elected the governor of California, the nation’s most populous state. By 1976, Reagan was the party’s leading spokesperson for conservative positions, and he almost defeated President Ford for the nomination. Handsome and vigorous in his late sixties, he proved a master of the media and was seen by millions as a likable and sensible champion of average Americans. In 1980, Reagan won the Republican presidential nomination.
Campaign for President As the Republican nominee, Reagan attacked 
the Democrats for expanding government and for undermining U.S. prestige abroad. (Throughout the campaign, American hostages remained in the hands of Iranian radicals.) Reagan also pointed to a “misery index” of 22 (the rate of inﬂation added to the rate of unemployment) and concluded his campaign by asking a huge television audience, “ Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” The voters’ rejection of Carter’s presidency and the growing conservative mood gave Reagan 51 percent of the popular vote and almost 91  percent of the electoral vote. Carter received 41 percent of the popular vote. A third candidate, John Anderson, a moderate Republican running as an independent, received 8 percent. 
Significance Reagan’s election broke up a key element of the New Deal 
coalition by taking more than 50 percent of the blue-collar vote. The defeat of 11  liberal Democratic senators targeted by a political organization of conservative Christians called the Moral Majority gave the Republicans control 
695  TOPIC 9.2   R EAGAN AND CONSERVATISMof the Senate for the first time since 1954. The Republicans also gained 33 seats 
in the House. The combination of Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats formed a working majority on many key issues. The 1980 election ended a half century of Democratic dominance of Congress. 
The Reagan Revolution
On the very day that Reagan was inaugurated, the Iranians released the 52 American hostages, giving his administration a positive start. Two months later, the president survived a serious gunshot wound from an assassination attempt. Reagan handled the crisis with such humor and charm that he emerged from the ordeal as an even more popular leader. He ran as a mainstream conservative whose goal was to reduce the size and scope of the federal government. Reagan pledged that his administration would lower taxes, reduce government spending on welfare, build up the U.S. Armed Forces, and create a more conservative federal court. He delivered on all four promises—but there were costs. 
Reaganomics
The Reagan administration advocated supply-side economics, arguing that tax cuts and reduced government spending would increase investment by the private sector, which would lead to increased production, jobs, and prosperity. This approach, which became known as “Reaganomics, ” contrasted with the Keynesian economics long favored by the Democrats, which relied on government spending during economic downturns to boost consumer income and demand. Critics of the supply-side theory compared it to the “trickle-down” economics of the 1920s, in which wealthy Americans prospered and some of their increased spending benefited the middle class and the poor.
Federal Tax Reduction The legislative activity early in Reagan’s presidency 
reminded some in the media of FDR’s Hundred Days. Congress passed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which included a 25 percent decrease in personal income taxes over three years. Cuts in the corporate income tax, capital gains tax, and gift and inheritance taxes guaranteed that a large share of the tax relief went to upper-income taxpayers. Under Reagan, the top income tax rate was reduced to 28 percent. At the same time, small investors were also helped by a provision that allowed them to invest up to $2,000 a year in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) without paying taxes on this money until they withdrew it. 
Spending With the help of conservative Southern Democrats (“boll 
weevils”), the Republicans cut more than $40 billion from domestic programs, such as food stamps, student loans, and mass transportation. However, these savings were offset by a dramatic increase in military spending. Reagan pushed through no cuts in Medicare or Social Security, but he did support and sign into law a bipartisan bill to strengthen Social Security. The law increased what 
696 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONindividuals paid into the system, raised the age at which they could get full 
benefits to 67, and taxed some beneﬁts paid to upper-income recipients. 
Deregulation  Following up on the promise of “getting government 
off the backs of the people, ” the Reagan administration reduced federal regulations on business and industry—a policy of deregulation begun under Carter. Restrictions were eased on savings and loan institutions, mergers and takeovers by large corporations, and environmental protection. To help the struggling American auto industry, regulations on emissions and auto safety were also loosened. Secretary of the Interior James Watt opened federal lands for increased coal and timber production and offshore waters for oil drilling. 
Labor Unions Despite having once been the president of the Screen 
Actors Guild, Reagan took a tough stand against unions. He fired thousands of striking federal air traffic controllers for violating their contract and he decertified their union (PATC O ). Many businesses followed this action by 
hiring striker replacements in labor conflicts. These anti-union policies, along with the loss of manufacturing jobs, hastened the decline of union membership among nonfarm workers from more than 30 percent in 1962 to only 12 percent in the late 1990s. In addition, the recession of 1982 and foreign competition had a dampening effect on workers’ wages.
Recession and Recovery In 1982, the nation suffered one of the worst 
recessions since the 1930s. Banks failed and unemployment reached 11 percent. However, the recession, along with a fall in oil prices, reduced the double-digit inflation rate of the late 1970s to less than 4 percent. With lower inflation, tax cuts, and ballooning federal deficits, the economy rebounded beginning in 1983. However, the recovery only widened the income gap between rich and poor. While upper-income groups, including well-educated workers and “yuppies” (young urban professionals), enjoyed higher incomes from lower taxes and a deregulated marketplace, the standard of living of the middle class remained stagnant or declined. Not until the late 1990s did the middle class gain back some of its losses.
Social Issues
President Reagan followed through on his pledge to appoint conservative judges to the Supreme Court. His nominations included Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman on the court, as well as Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy. Led by a new chief justice, William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court shifted to the right. It scaled back affirmative action in hiring and promotions and limited Roe v. Wade  by allowing states to impose greater restrictions on abortion, such 
as requiring minors to notify their parents before having an abortion. However, the court did not end affirmative action or overturn the Roe  decision.
The Election of 1984
The return of prosperity restored public confidence in the Reagan administration. At their convention in 1984, Republicans nominated their popular president by 
697  TOPIC 9.2   R EAGAN AND CONSERVATISMacclamation. Democrats nominated Walter Mondale, Carter’s vice president, 
to be their presidential candidate. For vice president, they chose Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New Y ork, the ﬁrst woman to run on a major-party ticket.
President Reagan campaigned on an optimistic “It’s Morning Again 
in America” theme. Reagan won every state except Mondale’s home state of Minnesota. Two-thirds of White males voted for Reagan. Only two groups of voters favored the Democrats: African Americans and people earning less than $12,500 a year. 
Budget and Trade Deﬁcits
By the mid-1980s, Reagan’s tax cuts, combined with large increases in military spending, were creating larger federal deﬁcits. In 1979, the federal deficit was 1.5 percent of GDP . By 1986, it was 4.8 percent. Over the course of Reagan’s two terms as president, the national debt tripled from about $900 billion to almost $2.7 trillion. The tax cuts, designed to stimulate investments, seemed only to increase consumption, especially of foreign-made luxury and consumer items. As a result, the U.S. trade deﬁcit reached a then-staggering $150 billion a year. The cumulative trade imbalance of $1 trillion during the 1980s contributed to a dramatic increase in the foreign ownership of U.S. real estate and industry. In 1985, for the ﬁrst time since the World War I era, the United States became a debtor nation. 
Fearing that the federal deﬁcit was getting too large, Congress passed and 
Reagan signed several bills to increase taxes. In 1985, Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget Act, which provided for across-the-board spending cuts. Court rulings and later congressional changes kept this legislation from achieving its full purpose. However, the combination of spending cuts, tax increases, and greater revenues from a stronger economy reduced the deﬁcit to a manageable 2.9 percent of GDP in 1988. 
Impact of President Reagan
During President Reagan’s two terms, the government reduced restrictions on the economy and placed more money in the hands of investors and higher-income Americans. His policies also reduced the growth of the New Deal/Great Society welfare state. Another legacy of the Reagan years was greater concern about large federal deficits. Neither Democrats nor Republicans felt they could propose new social programs, such as universal health coverage. Instead of asking what new government programs might be needed, Reaganomics changed the debate to issues of which government programs to cut and by how much. 
By the end of Reagan’s second term in 1988, “the great communicator’s” 
combination of style, humor, and expressions of patriotism had won over the electorate. He would leave ofﬁce as one of the most popular presidents of the 20th century. In addition, he changed the politics of the nation for at least a generation by bringing many former Democrats into the Republican Party.
698 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONPresident George H. W. Bush 
In the 1988 election, the Republican ticket consisted of Reagan’s vice president, 
George H. W . Bush, and a young Indiana senator, Dan Quayle. Michael Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts, won the Democratic nomination and balanced the ticket geographically by selecting Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as his running mate. Bush did not have Reagan’s ease in front of the camera, but he quickly overtook a low-key Dukakis by charging that the Democrat was soft on crime (for furloughing criminals) and weak on national defense. Bush also appealed to voters by promising not to raise taxes: “Read my lips—no new taxes.”  
The Republicans won a decisive victory in November by a margin of 
7 million votes. Once again, the Democrats failed to win the conﬁdence of most White middle-class voters. Nevertheless, the voters sent mixed signals by returning larger Democratic majorities to both the House and the Senate. Americans evidently believed in the system of checks and balances, but it often produced legislative gridlock in Washington. 
President Bush faced a host of domestic problems. While some grew out of 
his decisions, others reflected larger economic changes. (See Topic 9.4.) 
Nomination of Clarence Thomas The president’s nomination of Clarence 
Thomas to the Supreme Court to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall proved extremely controversial. Thomas faced strong opposition because of his conservative judicial philosophy, opposition to government efforts to combat racism, and the charges of sexual harassment against him. In the final Senate vote, a coalition of 41 Republicans and 11 Democrats approved his confirmation. He became only the second African American member of the Supreme Court.
Taxes and the Economy Americans were shocked to learn that the 
government’s intervention to save weak savings and loan institutions (S&Ls) and to pay insured depositors for funds lost in failed S&Ls would cost the taxpayers more than $250 billion. Also disturbing were the federal budget deﬁcits of more than $250 billion a year. In 1990, Bush, worried that federal deficits were growing too high and recognizing that most federal spending was for programs voters liked, such as defense, violated his campaign pledge of “no new taxes. ” He agreed to $133 billion in new taxes. Many Republicans felt betrayed. The unpopular tax law increased the top income tax rate to 31 percent and raised federal excise taxes on beer, wine, cigarettes, gasoline, luxury cars, and yachts. Most damaging of all for Bush’s reelection prospects was a recession starting in 1990. The prosperity that began under Reagan ended as unemployment increased and average family income decreased. 
Americans with Disabilities Act Bush’s most significant accomplishment 
in domestic affairs was that he signed into law the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA) in 1990. This act prohibited discrimination against citizens 
with physical and mental disabilities in hiring, transportation, and public accommodation. This act had a lasting change on the country, bringing individuals with disabilities into the mainstream of American life.
699  TOPIC 9.2   R EAGAN AND CONSERVATISMPolitical Inertia  President Bush began his administration calling for 
“a kinder, gentler America” and declaring himself the “education president. ” 
However, dealing with budget issues and the declining trust in government allowed him little opportunity to change the direction of government. He tried to carry on Reagan’s attempt to cut federal programs, but this was difficult in the midst of a recession. His administration seemed to offer little hope to the growing numbers of Americans who felt left behind by economic change and the “Reagan revolution. ” 
Political Polarization 
During most of this period the nation continued to become more divided between the conservative South, Great Plains, and Mountain States and the more moderate-to-liberal Northeast and West Coast. As a result of this division, a few swing states, such as Ohio and Florida, determined presidential elections. The more traditional, religious, and limited- or anti-government small towns and rural areas went Republican, while the more diverse large urban centers and internationally minded coasts voted Democratic. 
The shift of Southern White conservatives that began in the 1960s from 
the Democratic to the Republican Party transformed American politics. In the 1990s, Southern conservatives took over the leadership of the Republican Party, making it more conservative and partisan. As the party of Lincoln became the party of Ronald Reagan, moderate Republicans lost influence and primary contests to conservatives. In the state legislatures, both parties gerrymandered congressional districts to create “safe seats, ” which rewarded partisanship and discouraged compromise in Congress. As the Republican Party became more ideologically conservative and Southern conservatives left  the Democratic Party, the political split deepened. Close elections often created divided governments and legislative stagnation. 
Divisions in the Federal Government The conservative resurgence 
starting with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 was most apparent in state legislatures and the control of Congress. In the post-World War II era, Democrats controlled the House and Senate with few exceptions until the 1980s, after which the control of the House and Senate has been closely contested, resulting in legislative stalemate and government shutdowns. However, the shift of Southern conservatives to the Republican Party gave the edge to the Republicans, especially in the Electoral College.
In the seven presidential elections after 1988, the Democrats won the popular 
vote for six times, but won the White House only four times. In 2000 and 2016, the Republican candidates won the electoral vote and hence the presidency. In often very close elections, Democratic Bill Clinton won the presidential elections of 1992 and 1996. Republican George W . Bush (son of George H. W . Bush) won the elections of 2000 and 2004. Democrat Barack Obama won the elections of 2008 and 2012 to become the first African American president. In 2016, Donald Trump, a one-time Democrat who became a Republican and reshaped the party, won the election for president.

The Media Conservative versus liberal disagreements contributed to the 
growing partisan divide in Washington and across the nation. Changes in the 
media also intensified partisanship. CNN, television’s first 24-hour all-news network in 1980, and the growth of cable television provided platforms that opened up American media to many different views and voices. The growth of talk radio in the late 1980s provided another outlet, especially for conservative opinions. Hosts such as Rush Limbaugh developed a large following. The media became more polarized after an FCC ruling in 1987 abolished the fairness doctrine. This doctrine had required broadcasters to present the news and issues of public debate in a manner the FCC considered honest, equitable, and balanced. Critics argued that the doctrine violated freedom of speech.
Abortion  The Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade  ruling in 1973 granted 
women the right to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restrictions. This ruling prompted a fierce, ongoing moral debate over abortion. Some argued that human beings came into existence at the moment of conception, so abortion was murder and should be illegal. Others argued that each woman had a right to control her own body, so whether to have an abortion was her choice and should be legal. In national politics, the issue produced a continual fight over appointment of federal judges, especially to the Supreme Court, who could uphold, restrict, or overturn the decision.  
Gun Rights The assassination attempt on President Reagan renewed 
discussion for regulating gun ownership, especially for unstable persons. Congress in 1993 passed the Brady Bill, which mandated background checks 
and a ﬁve-day waiting period for the purchase of handguns. The National Rifle Association (NRA) mobilized its supporters to overturn the bill and helped to defeat politicians who supported it. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller that the 2nd Amendment provides an 
individual the right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia. 
701  TOPIC 9.2   R EAGAN AND CONSERVATISMThis created a new hurdle for the regulation of gun ownership, as some gun 
advocates argued that gun ownership was a constitutional right that allowed no, or only very limited, restrictions. The debate over guns grew more intense in the 21st century in response to mass shootings in schools, workplaces, clubs, and concerts. In general, conservatives and Republicans opposed new regulations on gun sales, background checks, and the ownership of semi-automatic military-style weapons, while liberals and Democrats were more supportive of these regulations.
Women’s Equality and Safety Women during this period increased their 
participation in the labor force, narrowed the pay gap, and were more likely to be college educated than men. However, women still lagged in achieving pay equity and getting hired as top business leaders. 
Women were also twice as likely as men to report gender discrimination 
on the job. It took the #MeToo movement in 2017 to roll back the curtain 
on the problem of sexual harassment and sexual abuse throughout society. In response, many businesses examined how they could improve their sexual harassment policies and end gender-based pay differences. A priority for the #MeToo movement was to change the laws surrounding sexual harassment and assault and to give survivors the ability to file complaints without retaliation. Many people with traditional views felt that the proposed reforms went too far.
African Americans and Justice The civil rights movement of the previous 
period opened up opportunities for many African Americans to move into the middle class and leadership positions in business and government. However, the legacy of segregation and ongoing discrimination was still evident in the poverty and incarceration rates, which for Black men was five times greater than Whites. Police beatings and killings of unarmed Black men and boys during arrests drew increasing attention during this period. The video of the severe beating of Rodney King in 1991 and the acquittal of the police involved ignited a national conversation about racial disparity in the justice system and the police use of force. The issue escalated as more videos captured police killing and beating Black men and boys. Starting in 2013, the Black Lives Matter  movement began campaigning for reforms in police training and arrest 
procedures. The death of George Floyd in 2020 resulting from a police officer kneeling on his neck created international protests and deepened the divide between advocates for human rights and advocates for law and order.
LGBT Rights Equality related to sexual orientation continued to divide 
conservatives and liberals. President Clinton (1993–2001) failed to end discrimination against gays in the military and settled for the rule, “Don’t ask, don’t tell. ” In 2009, Congress made it a federal crime to assault someone 
because of sexual orientation or gender identity. Over several years, more than 30 states allowed same-sex marriage by legislation or by court order. Finally, in a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) that the 
Fourteenth Amendment protects the right of same-sex couples to marry. Some objected to same-sex marriage because of their religious beliefs or cultural values.
702 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONImmigration Demographic changes such as immigration from Latin 
America and Asia also contributed to political divisions during this period. 
(See Topic 9.5.) The divisions continued the long history of conflict over immigration between some native-born citizens who found fault with the newer arrivals because of their ethnic, racial, religious, or cultural traits. During this period, the issue of amnesty for those who had entered the country without authorization became a roadblock to immigration reform in Congress. Opponents argued that undocumented immigrants should be forced to leave the United States and, like other aspiring immigrants, apply to enter the country.
Economy and Health The growing income and wealth disparities between 
the wealthy and lower-income Americans and the domination of the economy by Wall Street and large corporations created debates, especially during recessions, when lower-income Americans tended to suffer the most, such as in the Great Recession of 2008. However, the issue of health care coverage for all Americans was an ongoing issue between those who argued that health care was a right and others who held it was a personal responsibility that should not involve the government. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 deeply divided Washington, with Republicans repeatedly trying to repeal it. The pandemic of 2020 also raised doubts about both the readiness of the health care system in the United States during a crisis and the disparity in health outcomes for the poor and minorities.
The problem of political polarization between liberals and conservatives, 
between Democrats and Republicans, became more critical during this period because it often prevented the political system from dealing with the challenges coming from within and from outside the nation. It caused former allies and observers around the world to question if the United States could carry on the leadership roles that it took on during the 20th century, or would that leadership pass on to others?

705  TOPIC 9.3   THE END OF THE COLD WAR
Topic 9.3
The End of the Cold War
General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity  
for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization:  
Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, 
tear down this wall!
Ronald Reagan, speech at Brandenburg Gate, West Berlin, June 12, 1987
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the end of the 
Cold War and its legacy.
Historians debate the relative importance of the various causes for the end of 
the Cold War, but the roles of Ronald Reagan of the United States and Mikhail 
Gorbachev of the Soviet Union were pivotal. Today, Europeans, Russians, and Americans continue to experience its long-lasting effects.
Foreign Policy During the Reagan Years
Reagan started his presidency determined to build the military might and superpower prestige of the United States and to intensify the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union. He called the Soviet Communists the “evil empire”  and “focus of evil in the modern world. ” Reagan was prepared to use 
military force to back up his rhetoric. During his second term, however, he proved ﬂexible enough in his foreign policy to respond to signiﬁcant changes in the Soviet Union and its satellites  in Eastern Europe.
Renewing the Cold War
Increased spending for defense and aid to anti-Communist forces in Latin America marked Reagan’s approach to the Cold War during his ﬁrst term. 
Military Buildup The Reagan administration spent billions to build 
new weapons systems, such as the B-1 bomber and the MX missile, and to expand the U.S. Navy from 450 to 600 ships. The administration also increased spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), an ambitious plan for building a high-tech system of lasers and particle beams to destroy enemy missiles before they could reach U.S. territory. Critics called the SDI “Star Wars”  and argued that the costly program would only escalate the arms race 
and could be overwhelmed by the Soviets building more missiles. Although 
706 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONCongress made some cuts in the Reagan proposals, the defense budget grew 
from $171 billion in 1981 to more than $300 billion in 1985. 
Central America In the Americas, Reagan supported “friendly” right-
wing dictators to keep out communism. In Nicaragua in 1979, a Marxist 
movement known as the Sandinistas had overthrown the country’s dictator. In response, the United States provided significant military aid to the Contras  
trying to dislodge the Sandinistas. In 1985, Democrats opposed to the administration’s policies in Nicaragua passed the Boland Amendment, which prohibited further aid to the Contras. 
In El Salvador, meanwhile, the Reagan administration spent nearly $5 
billion to support the Salvadoran government against a coalition of leftist guerrillas. Many Americans protested the killing of more than 40,000 civilians, including American missionaries, by right-wing death squads with connections to the El Salvador army. 
Grenada  On the small Caribbean island of Grenada , a coup led to the 
establishment of a pro-Cuban regime. In October 1983, President Reagan ordered a small force of marines to invade the island in order to prevent the establishment of a strategic Communist military base in the Americas. The invasion quickly succeeded in reestablishing a pro-U.S. government in Grenada. 
Iran-Contra Affair If Grenada was the notable military triumph of 
Reagan’s presidency, his efforts to aid the Nicaraguan Contras involved him in a serious blunder and scandal. The so-called Iran-Contra affair  had its origins in 
U.S. troubles with Iran. Since 1980, Iran and Iraq had been engaged in a bloody war. Reagan aides came up with the plan—kept secret from the American public—of selling U.S. antitank and antiaircraft missiles to Iran’s government for helping to free the Americans held hostage by an Iranian-linked group in Lebanon. In 1986, another Reagan staff member had the “great idea” to use the proﬁts of the arms deal with Iran to fund the Contras in Nicaragua. 
President Reagan denied that he had knowledge of the illegal diversion 
of funds—illegal in that it violated both the Boland Amendment and congressional budget authority. The picture that emerged from a televised congressional investigation was of an uninformed, hands-off president who was easily manipulated by his advisers. Reagan suffered a sharp, but temporary, drop in the popularity polls. 
Lebanon, Israel, and the PLO
Reagan suffered a series of setbacks in the Middle East. In 1982, Israel (with U.S. approval) invaded southern Lebanon to stop Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) fighters from raiding Israel. Soon the United States sent peacekeeping forces into Lebanon to contain that country’s bitter civil war. In April 1983, an Arab suicide squad bombed the U.S. embassy in Beirut, killing 63 people. A few months later, another Arab terrorist drove a bomb-ﬁlled truck into the U.S. Marines barracks, killing 241 soldiers. Reagan soon pulled U.S. forces out of Lebanon, with little to show for the effort and loss of lives. 
707  TOPIC 9.3   THE END OF THE COLD WARSecretary of State George Schultz pushed for a peaceful settlement of the 
Palestinian-Israeli conﬂict by setting up a homeland for the PLO in the West 
Bank territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war. Under U.S. pressure, PLO leader Y asser Arafat agreed in 1988 to recognize Israel’s right to exist. 
Improved U.S.-Soviet Relations
The Cold War intensiﬁed in the early 1980s as a result of both Reagan’s arms buildup and the Soviet deployment of more missiles against NATO countries.  
Gorbachev In 1985, however, a dynamic reformer, Mikhail Gorbachev, 
became the new Soviet leader. Gorbachev attempted to change the troubled Communist political and economic system by introducing two major reforms: (1) glasnost , or openness, to end political repression and move toward greater 
political freedom for Soviet citizens, and (2) perestroika, or restructuring of 
the Soviet economy by introducing some free-market practices. 
To achieve his reforms, Gorbachev wanted to end the costly arms race. 
However, Soviet conservatives fought efforts to reduce military spending. In 1987, President Reagan challenged the Soviet leader to follow through with the reforms he said he wanted. In front of Brandenburg Gate and the Berlin Wall, the most tangible symbol of the Cold War, Reagan ended his speech with the line, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. ”
Reagan and Gorbachev held three summit meetings. The first, in November 
1985, resulted in agreements on a range of issues, from cultural and scientific exchanges to environmental issues. A second meeting the following October in Reykjavik, Iceland, was less successful, since Reagan’s commitment to a new missile defense system proved to be a major obstacle to talks on arms control. At their third summit in 1987, which took place in Washington, D.C., both sides were able to compromise on a range of arms-control issues. They agreed to remove and destroy all intermediate-range missiles (the INF agreement). 
In 1988, Gorbachev further reduced Cold War tensions by starting the 
pullout of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. He also cooperated with the United States in putting diplomatic pressure on Iran and Iraq to end their war. By the end of Reagan’s second term, superpower relations had so improved that the end of the Cold War seemed at hand. 
Assessing Causes Multiple causes contributed to the decline in the Cold 
War. Some historians emphasize Gorbachev’s desire for domestic reforms, which contributed to his willingness to negotiate. Others argue that Reagan’s military buildup forced the Soviet Union to concede defeat in the Cold War. Reagan is also credited for his willingness to negotiate arms reductions with the Soviets. His actions relieved Russian domestic pressure on Gorbachev, who could then pursue his reform agenda. Historians also credit other leaders and thinkers besides Reagan and Gorbachev. For example, the opponents of communism in Eastern Europe, such as a Polish union leader, Lech Walesa, and a Polish pope, John Paul II, carried on a long struggle for freedom. In the United States, George Kennan’s containment policy guided the United States through the Cold War without setting off a world war.
708 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONGeorge H. W. Bush and the End of the Cold War
The Cold War threatened the existence of humankind. At the same time, it gave  
clear purpose to U.S. foreign policy. What would be the U. S. role in the world after the Cold War? George H. W . Bush, a former ambassador to the United 
Nations and director of the CIA (and the father of President George W . Bush), became the ﬁrst president to deﬁne the country’s role in the new era. 
Persian Gulf War
President Bush’s plans for a “new world order” of peace and democracy were challenged in August 1990 when Iraq’s dictator, Saddam Hussein, invaded oil-rich but weak Kuwait. This move threatened Western oil sources in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. President Bush successfully built a coalition of United Nations members to pressure Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait. In January 1991, in a massive operation called Desert Storm, more than 500,000 Americans were joined by military units from 28 other nations. A brilliant invasion led by American forces took only 100 hours of ﬁghting to defeat the Iraqi army. However, Saddam Hussein, though weakened, remained the dictator  
in Iraq.
The Collapse of Soviet Communism and the Soviet Union
The ﬁrst years of the Bush administration were dominated by dramatic changes in the Communist world. 
Tiananmen Square  In China, during the spring of 1989, prodemocracy 
students and workers demonstrated for freedom in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square . Television cameras from the West broadcast the prodemocracy 
movement around the world. Under the cover of night, the Chinese Communist government crushed the protest with tanks, killing hundreds and ending the brief ﬂowering of an open political environment in China. The Chinese Communist Party, while promoting economic development and national pride, ruled its large population as an authoritarian one-party state. 
Eastern Europe Challenges to communism in Eastern Europe produced 
more positive results. With the overwhelming electoral victory of the once-outlawed Solidarity movement led by Lech Walesa, the Communist Party fell from power in one country after another—Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. The Communists in East Germany were forced out of power after protesters tore down the Berlin Wall, the hated symbol of the Cold War, 
in late 1989. In October 1990, the two Germanys, divided since 1945, were ﬁnally reunited with the blessing of both NATO and the Soviet Union. 
Breakup of the Soviet Union The swift march of events and the 
nationalist desire for self-determination soon overwhelmed Gorbachev and the Soviet Union. In 1990, the Soviet Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania declared their independence. After a failed coup against Gorbachev by Communist hard-liners, the remaining republics dissolved the Soviet Union in December 1991, leaving Gorbachev a leader with no country. Boris Y eltsin, 
709  TOPIC 9.3   THE END OF THE COLD WARpresident of the Russian Republic, joined with nine former Soviet republics to 
form a loose confederation, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Y eltsin disbanded the Communist Party in Russia and attempted to establish a democracy and a free-market economy. 
End of the Cold War Sweeping agreements to dismantle their nuclear 
weapons were one piece of tangible proof that the Cold War had ended. Bush and Gorbachev signed the START I agreement in 1991, reducing the number 
of nuclear warheads to under 10,000 for each side. In late 1992, Bush and Y eltsin agreed to a START II treaty, which reduced the number of nuclear weapons to just over 3,000 each. The treaty also offered U.S. economic assistance to the troubled Russian economy.

Even as Soviet communism collapsed, President Bush, a seasoned diplomat, 
remained cautious. Instead of celebrating ﬁnal victory in the Cold War, 
Americans grew concerned about the outbreak of civil wars and violence in the former Soviet Union. In Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia started to disintegrate in 1991, and a civil war broke out in the province of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992. At home, the end of the Cold War raised questions about whether the United States still needed such heavy defense spending and so many U.S. military bases around the world. 
Aftermath of the Cold War in Europe
In 2002, the European Union (EU) became a unified market of 15 nations, 12 of which adopted a single currency, the euro . The EU grew to include 27 
European nations by 2007, including 10 former satellites of the USSR, such as Poland , Bulgaria, and Romania.
710 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONRussia Under President Boris Y eltsin, Russia struggled to reform its 
economy and to fight rampant corruption. In 2000, Y eltsin’s elected successor, 
Vladimir Putin, took office. Relations with the United States were strained by Russia’s brutal repression of the civil war in Chechnya, by NATO’s admittance in 1999 of the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, and by Russia’s support of Serbia in the Balkan wars of the 1990s. 
War in the Former Yugoslavia Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic 
violently suppressed independence movements in the former Yugoslav provinces  of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Kosovo. Ethnic divisions  were complicated by religious rivalries among Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and Muslims. Hundreds of thousands of people, including many Muslims, were killed in “ethnic cleansing. ” A mix of diplomacy, 
bombing, and NATO troops, including U.S. troops, stopped the bloodshed in Bosnia in 1995 and then in Kosovo in 1999. These Balkan wars were Europe’s bloodiest conﬂicts since World War II and reminded people of how World War I  
had started.
Difficult Times The path to democracy and prosperity for the former 
Communist bloc nations in Eastern Europe and Russia was hard. Y ears of economic stagnation under communism were difficult to overcome, and democracy was slow to take root in these newly independent states. These states became easy targets for corruption and autocratic rulers.

Topic 9.4
A Changing Economy
“We need a new approach to government. . . . A government that is leaner, 
not meaner; a government that expands opportunity, not bureaucracy;  
a government that understands that jobs must come from growth  
in a vibrant and vital system of free enterprise. ”
Bill Clinton, nomination acceptance speech, July 16, 1992. 
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of economic and 
technological change over time.
The Republicans nominated President George H. W . Bush in 1992 for a 
second  term. After a long career in public service, the president seemed 
tired and out of touch with average Americans, such as when he was surprised by the use of barcode scanners in the check-out line at the supermarket. The Cold War was over, and America wanted to enjoy its economic benefits and the technological innovations of the period.
Election of 1992
A youthful governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, emerged from the Democratic primaries as the party’s choice for president. The ﬁrst member of the baby boom generation to be nominated for president, Clinton presented himself as a moderate “New Democrat” who focused on economic issues such as jobs, education, and health care, which were important to the “vital center” of the  electorate. The strategy was, according to his political advisers, to focus on “the economy, stupid!” Clinton did well in the South and recaptured the majority of the elderly and blue-collar workers from the Republicans. Despite a serious third-party challenge from Ross Perot, a Texas billionaire, Clinton won with 370 electoral votes (and 43 percent of the popular vote) to 168 for Bush (37 percent of the popular vote). 
Clinton’s Focus on the Economy
During the ﬁrst two years of the Clinton administration, Senate Republicans used filibusters and the threat of filibusters to prevent passage of the president’s economic stimulus package, campaign ﬁnance reform, environmental bills, and health care reform. However, some “incremental” reforms did become law.
714 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONEarly Accomplishments The Democratic Congress was able to pass the 
Family and Medical Leave Act, which required businesses to allow workers to 
take unpaid leave for specific medical reasons. It also passed the “motor voter” law that enabled citizens to register to vote as they got their driver’s licenses. The Brady Bill, which mandated a ﬁve-day waiting period for the purchase of 
handguns, was enacted. In 1994, Congress enacted Clinton’s Anti-Crime Bill, which provided $30 billion in funding for more police protection and crime-prevention programs. The legislation also banned the sale of most assault rifles, which angered the gun lobby led by the National Rifle Association (NRA). After protracted negotiation and compromise, Congress passed a deficit-reduction budget that included $255 billion in spending cuts and $241 billion in tax increases. Incorporated in this budget were the president’s requests for increased appropriations for education and job training. 
Defeat and Adjustments In the midterm elections of November 1994, the 
Republicans gained control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1954. Led by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who would become 
Speaker of the House, the phenomenon came to be known as the “Republican Revolution ” or the “Revolution of ’94. ” They benefited from a well-organized 
effort to promote a short list of policy priorities they called the “Contract with America. ” In addition, the Democratic Congress was unpopular because it had raised taxes and limited gun ownership. President Clinton adjusted to his party’s defeat by declaring in his 1995 State of the Union address, “The era of big government is over. ” 
Balanced Budget Finally, in the 1996 election year, Congress and the 
president compromised on a budget that left Medicare and Social Security benefits intact, limited welfare benefits to five years under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, set some curbs on immigration, increased the minimum wage, and balanced the budget. The spending cuts and tax increases made during Clinton’s first term, along with strong economic growth, helped to eliminate the deficit in federal spending in 1998 and produced the first federal surplus since 1969. Unlike any other modern president, Clinton could point to a total $63 billion surplus during his two terms, if one adds up their four deficits and four surpluses.
Clinton Reelected  In his battle with the Republican Congress, President 
Clinton tried to position himself as a moderate. He characterized the Republicans as extremists while at the same time he took over their positions that were popular, such as balancing the budget and reforming welfare. In the 1996 election, Clinton was aided by a fast-growing economy that had produced more than 10 million new jobs during his first term. Clinton became the ﬁrst Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt to be reelected president. The Republicans could celebrate retaining control of both houses of Congress, which they had not done since the 1920s. 
Tax Cuts Versus Social Security The prosperity of the late 1990s shifted 
the debate in Washington to what to do with the federal government’s surplus 
715  TOPIC 9.4   A CHANGING ECONOMYrevenues, projected to be $4.6 trillion over the ﬁrst ten years of the 21st century. 
In 1997, Congress and the president did compromise on legislation that cut taxes on estates and capital gains and gave tax credits for families with children and for higher education expenses. The Republicans pressed for more tax cuts, such as the elimination of the estate tax (the “death tax”) and taxes on two-income families (the “marriage penalty”). Clinton held out for using the projected surplus to support Social Security, expand Medicare, and reduce the national debt. 
While Clinton could point to successful policies, his personal activities 
created problems for him. In 1999, the Republican House impeached President Clinton for lying under oath about sexual relations and related abuses of power, but he was not convicted. For his ability to get out of trouble, his critics nicknamed him “Slick Willie. ” 
Technology and a Changing Economy
During President Clinton’s two terms, the United States enjoyed the longest peacetime economic expansion in its history, with annual growth rates of more than 4 percent. Much of the economic boom resulted from increased productivity related to technological innovations.
Technological Innovations The use of the Internet, personal computers, 
software, and wireless mobile communications fueled increased national productivity (a gain of more than 5 percent in 1999) and made “e-commerce” (or electronic commerce) part of American life. GPS systems, digital photography, solar panels, and wind turbines brought more economic changes. High-tech companies, such as Apple, Intel, and Microsoft, were joined during the “dot-com” boom by the likes of Amazon, AOL, Y ahoo, and Google. 
Innovations in the medical field included DNA testing and sequencing, 
human genome mapping, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and robotic and noninvasive laser surgery. These new diagnostic tools and advances in surgery, along with drug development based on individual genetic factors, promoted the growth of the medical field and promises for the conquest of diseases.
Flattening of the Earth The technology of the period created new 
opportunities for growth and development across the globe. For example, cellular communication grew from zero to over four billion people with mobile devices that could connect them with other people and the latest knowledge all over the world. Technology leveled the playing field regardless of one’s location. As Thomas Friedman explained in his book The World is Flat, the swift advances in technology and communications linked people all over Earth, creating new wealth in the developing world and flattening competition around the globe. 
The Boom of the 1990s After years of heavy competition with Europe 
and Asia, American businesses had become proﬁcient in cutting costs, which both increased their proﬁtability and held down the U.S. inﬂation rate to below 3  percent a year. Investors were rewarded with record gains of more than 22 percent in the stock market. The number of households worth $1 million or 
716 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONmore quadrupled in the 1990s to more than 8 million, or one in 14 households. 
The unemployment rate fell from 7.5 percent in 1992 to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent in 2000. The unemployment of African Americans and Hispanics was the lowest on record to that point. During the peak of prosperity from 1997 to 1999, middle- and lower-income Americans experienced the ﬁrst gains in real income since 1973. However, the economic boom was over by 2001, and both investors and wage earners faced another recession.
Globalization The surging increases in trade and communications and 
the movement of capital around the world during this era were key parts of the process of globalization. Globalization promoted the development of global and regional economic organizations. During the Clinton administration, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was passed by Congress and signed by the president over objections from union leaders, who feared job losses to low-wage Mexico. It created a free-trade zone with Canada and Mexico. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1994 to oversee trade agreements, enforce trade rules, and settle disputes. The powerful International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank made loans to, and supervised the economic policies of, poorer nations with debt troubles.
The Group of Eight (G8), the world’s largest industrial powers (Canada, 
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), which controlled two-thirds of the world’s wealth, remained the leading economic powers in 2000. However, China, India, and Brazil would soon surpass many of the older industrial powers in the 21st century. The growing gap between the rich and poor nations of the world caused tensions, especially over the debts the poor nations owed to powerful banks and the richest nations. Workers and unions in the richest nations often resented globalization because they lost their jobs to cheaper labor markets in the developing world.
Digital Security and Privacy The use of wireless communications 
and the Internet raised the issue of privacy in the digital age. Domestic and foreign hacking of digital data and the use of social media to disrupt politics exposed failings and abuses by large Internet companies such as Facebook and Google. These companies became wealthy and powerful through the extraction and analysis of personal data of hundreds of millions of their users for focused advertisements and resale of data to third parties. Fearful of discouraging innovation, the government exercised little regulation of the industry. Congressional hearings exposed the failure of the Internet companies to monitor how the data was used or to protect it from cyber attacks. Some saw the rise of “surveillance capitalism” as a growing threat to Americans’ privacy, security, and tradition of self-government.
Income and Wealth
In many ways, Americans were achieving the American dream. Homeownership continued to climb during the prosperity of the 1990s to 67.4 percent of all households. The economy was continuing to generate more and more wealth. 
717  TOPIC 9.4   A CHANGING ECONOMYPer capita income in constant (inflation-adjusted) dollars rose dramatically, 
from $12,275 in 1970 to $22,199 in 2000. However, in 1999 the top fifth of American households received more than half of all income. The average after-tax income for the lowest three-fifths of households actually declined between 1977 and 1997. In addition, the distribution of income varied widely by race, sex, and education. For example, the median income in 2000 was $53,256 for White families, $35,054 for Hispanic families, and $34,192 for Black families. High school graduates earned only half the income of college graduates. 
Concentration of Wealth  In terms of wealth, which includes property and 
investments minus debts, data from 2007 show that wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few:
• the wealthiest 1 percent possessed 35 percent of the nation’s wealth
• the next 19 percent possessed 50 percent
• the bottom 80 percent owned only about 15 percent 
By the late 2010s, wealth was even more concentrated, with the top 1 
percent holding 43 percent of the nation’s financial wealth. The wealthy 
possessed greater financial opportunities that allowed their money to make more money. In contrast, one study found 62 percent of households headed by a single parent were without savings or other financial assets. The United States was the richest country in the world, but among industrialized nations, it had the largest gap between lowest and highest paid workers and the greatest concentration of wealth among the top-earning households. The economist Joseph Stiglitz argued that the decline of strong unions since the 1970s was related to the rise in the inequality of income and wealth in the United States. 
This concentration of wealth reminded some of the Gilded Age of the late 
19th century. Scholars and political leaders expressed concern that high levels of wealth inequality were incompatible with a democratic society and would result to a drift towards oligarchy and autocratic governments.
One debated cause of wage stagnation was the increase in immigration 
to the United States in the 1990s and 2000s. Topic 9.5 will explore the causes and effects of immigration and the shift of population growth to the South and West.

Topic 9.5
Migration and Immigration  
in the 1990s and 2000s
“America has constantly drawn strength and spirit from wave after wave 
of immigrants. . . . They have proved to be the most restless, the most 
adventurous, the most innovative, the most industrious of people.”
President Bill Clinton, speech at Portland (Oregon) State University, June 13, 1998
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of domestic and 
international migration over time.
Anti-immigrant sentiment has risen and fallen throughout American history. 
Immigrants made up 13 percent to 15 percent of the nation’s population in 
the decades before the passage of legislation restricting immigration in the 1920s. In the 2010s, the immigrant population again reached over 13 percent, and again restrictions on immigration gained a popular following. This was made evident in the 2016 national election, when supporters of the winning candidate opposed to undocumented immigration from Mexico chanted, “Build the wall!” The causes and effects of migration and immigration shaped many aspects of American life in the 1990s and early 2000s. 
Changing Immigration Policies
The  Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 did away with the racially 
based quota system of the 1920s. The new system gave preference to potential immigrants with relatives in the United States and with occupations deemed critical by the Department of Labor. It also opened up immigration from non-European countries. This change occurred as the recovery of Europe after World War II meant that fewer Europeans were interested in migrating, while Castro’s takeover of Cuba and the war in Vietnam prompted people to flee those countries. The result of all of these changes was a dramatic change in the origins of immigrants to the United States. For example, the percentages of immigrants from Europe and Canada gradually dropped between 1970 and 2015 from 68 percent to 14 percent of the annual immigrant population. In contrast, the number of immigrants from South and East Asia increased from 7 percent to 27 percent, those from Mexico increased from 8 percent to 27 percent, and those from Latin America outside of Mexico increased from  
11 percent to 24 percent. 
721  TOPIC 9.5   M IGRATION AND IMMIGRATION IN THE 1990S AND 2000S  By 2000, the Hispanic population was the fastest-growing segment 
of the population and emerged as the largest minority group in the nation, 
representing 13 percent of the population. The number of Asian Americans also increased sharply, exceeding 4 percent. Immigration accounted for 27.8 percent of the population increase in the 1990s and was a key stimulus to the economic growth during the decade. Without immigration, the United States was on a path to experience negative population growth by 2030. 
Federal Legislation  Undocumented entry into the United States 
became a growing political issue in the 1990s and 2000s. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 attempted to create a fair entry process for immigrants, but it failed to stop people in search of work from entering the United States without authorization. The law was also criticized for granting amnesty to over three million undocumented immigrants from Mexico and the Americas. 
During the Clinton administration, Congress passed the Illegal 
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to reform the process for admitting or removing undocumented immigrants. It strengthened U.S. immigration laws, restructured immigration law enforcement, and limited immigration by addressing undocumented migration. However, these reforms did little to stop the flow of people. Private employers continued to hire undocumented workers, paying them far lower wages than they would have had to pay legal residents.
Executive Action  In the 21st century, Congress discussed various plans 
for controlling immigration, but the Senate and House were unable to reach an agreement. The Obama administration had no more success than the Bush administration in getting immigration reform through Congress. 
In 2012, President Obama took executive action to protect undocumented 
young people brought to the United States as children (known as “Dreamers”) from deportation and to allow them to continue their education and apply for work permits. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)  
program was controversial. Further action to expand it in 2014 was challenged by lawsuits from 26 states and partially blocked by a federal judge. Anger at Obama’s immigration policies increased, even though the number of border guards was increased, deportations of undocumented immigrants increased, and the total undocumented immigrant population decreased during his presidency.
Trump Immigration Policies As a presidential candidate in 2016, Donald 
Trump promised to be much tougher on immigration and asylum seekers than Obama had been. After his election, President Trump proposed policies to fulfill this promise. For example, he said he would force Mexico to build a 2,000-mile border wall, require Mexico and Central American countries to 
stop migrants at their borders to keep them from getting to the U.S. border, and use the courts to end the DACA program. Further, he would restrict legal immigration, limit the number of “green cards ” granted legal residents and 
722 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONasylum seekers, and prevent all immigrants from receiving welfare within the 
first five years of their arrival. 
This broad attack on immigration did discourage the number of migrants 
trying to get into the United States by 2019. Many welcomed the changes as a needed pause after a period of dramatic increase in immigration, while others criticized these policies for abandoning an American tradition as a nation welcoming of, and built by, immigrants.
Influence of the American South and West 
By 2000, almost 60 percent of Americans lived in the South or West. The increasing influence of the two regions was related to their growing economic and political power, which also affected their traditional cultures.
Economies By the 1980s, the Sun Belt was booming. The shift to the 
Sun Belt continued in the 1990s and 2000s because of its friendly business environment of small government, low taxes, weak labor unions, and low-wage economies. By the 1990s, these states had improved their communication and transportation systems to support growth. Southern states had also desegregated their public institutions to the extent that the region no longer discouraged the relocation of large corporations. Oil helped Texas grow economically, and military installations drew people, defense industries, and aerospace firms to the Southwest, while favorable weather led to increased tourism in Southern California, Las Vegas, and Florida. 
Political Power   In addition to economic growth, the South and West 
dramatically increased their political influence. As these mostly conservative states increased their populations, they gained more seats in the House of Representatives and more electoral votes in presidential elections. These population shifts, along with the movement of Southern conservatives from the Democratic to the Republican Party, played an important role in the Republican majorities in both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. By the 1990s, most U.S. political leadership came from the Sun Belt. Before the election of Barack Obama of Illinois in 2008, the previous seven U.S. presidents had come from the Sun Belt. Meanwhile, the more liberal Northeast and Midwest, which had been the most influential regions in U.S. politics since the Civil War, lost representation in Congress and some of their former political influence.
Cultural Change The culture of the South and West became more 
influential throughout the country. For example, country and western music became increasingly popular in all regions. Ideas once associated with these regions, such as evangelical Protestant Christianity, conservative attitudes toward gender issues, and opposition to regulations on gun ownership spread. 
On the other hand, the cultures of these regions also changed. The growing 
Hispanic population made Mexican food, Roman Catholic Christianity, and the Spanish language more common. The migration of Americans from other regions to Southern states modified its traditional “Southern” culture and made 
723  TOPIC 9.5   M IGRATION AND IMMIGRATION IN THE 1990S AND 2000S  the region more urban and cosmopolitan. In some cases, such as Virginia, the 
migration caused them to become politically liberal, with Democrats gaining control of the state government and even passing gun regulations.

American Society in 2000
According to the 2000 census, the resident population of the United States was 281.4 million, making it the third most populous nation in the world, after China and India. The fastest-growing regions of the United States in the 1990s continued to be in the West and the South. The 2000 census reported that 50 percent of U.S. residents lived in suburbs, 30 percent in central cities, and only 20 percent in rural regions. Immigration was making the country more ethnically diverse.
A falling birthrate combined with an increase in life expectancy resulted 
in a population that was “graying. ” By 2000, 35 million people were over 65, but the fastest-growing segment of the population was those 85 and over. As the baby boom generation aged, concern about health care, prescription drugs, senior housing, and Social Security increased. In 2010, there were 2.9 workers for each beneficiary receiving Social Security. By 2035, the number of workers would decrease to 2.3. 
The decline of the traditional family and the growing number of single-
parent families was another national concern. The number of families headed by a female with no husband soared from 5.5 million in 1970 to 12.8 million in 2000. Single women headed 47.2 percent of Black families in 2000, but the same trend was also evident in White and Hispanic households with children under 18. Children in these families often grew up in poverty and without adequate support.

Topic 9.6
Challenges of the 21st Century
There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America 
and Asian America—there’s the United States of America.
Barack Obama, Democratic National Convention keynote address, 2004
Learning Objective : Explain the causes and effects of the domestic and 
international challenges the United States faced in the 21st century.
The United States entered the 21st century with unrivaled economic and 
military dominance in the world. Few countries in history had been so 
powerful. However, international terrorism, economic problems, and partisan politics exposed the nation’s vulnerabilities. 
Disputed Election of 2000
The presidential election of 2000 was the closest since 1876 and the first ever to be settled by the Supreme Court. President Clinton’s vice president, Al Gore, easily gained the nomination of the Democratic Party. Governor George W . Bush  of Texas, eldest son of former President George H. W . Bush, won the 
nomination of the Republican Party. Both candidates fought over the moderate and independent vote. Ralph Nader, the candidate for the Green Party, ran a distant third, but he might have taken enough votes from Gore to make a difference in Florida and other states. 
Gore received over 500,000 more popular votes nationwide than Bush, but 
victory hinged on who won Florida’s 25 electoral votes. Bush led by only 537 popular votes in Florida after a partial recount. Then the Democrats asked for manual recounts of the error-prone punch cards. The Supreme Court of Florida ordered recounts of all the votes, as requested by the Gore campaign. 
Then the Bush campaign appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Bush v. 
Gore, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a 5–4 decision that overruled the Florida 
Supreme Court, making Bush the victory. The majority ruled that the varying standards used in Florida’s recount violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, so the recount should be halted. The division on the Court reflected the division in the country. T he five justices appointed by Republican 
presidents voted to end the recount. The four justices appointed by Democratic presidents voted to let the recount go forward. 
Al Gore ended the election crisis by accepting the ruling. Governor Bush 
won with 271 electoral votes against Gore’s 266. (One elector abstained.) 
727  TOPIC 9.6   CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURYThe War on Terrorism
George W . Bush entered the White House with no foreign policy experience. 
However, he surrounded himself with veterans of previous Republican administrations. For example, his vice president, Dick Cheney, had served as secretary of defense under Bush’s father. General Colin Powell  became 
his secretary of state, the first African American to hold the job. President Bush’s confident and aggressive approach against terrorism won over many Americans, but his administration often alienated other nations. 
Roots of Terrorism The United States was faulted by many in the Arab 
world, as well as in the non-Arab world, for siding with Israel in the deadly cycle of violence between Palestinians and Israel. However, the causes of anti-Americanism often went deeper. After World War I, the Ottoman Empire, the last of the Islamic empires, was replaced in the Middle East by Western-style, secular nation-states. Religious fundamentalists decried modernization, including equality for women, and the corruption of the “House of Islam, ” an ancient Islamic ideal of a realm governed by the precepts of the Quran (Koran) and Sharia (Islamic law). They saw the stationing of U.S. troops in the Middle East after the Gulf War as another violation of their lands. Islamic extremists, such as supporters of Al-Qaeda (“The Base”), preached jihad, which they defined as a holy war against the “Jews and Crusaders. ” The goal of Al-Qaeda and others was to restore an Islamic caliphate, or realm, from North Africa to East Asia. The restrictive economic and political conditions in the Middle East also provided a fertile breeding ground for recruiting extremists. 
Early Terrorist Attacks The threat of terrorism and “asymmetric” 
warfare  in which a small band of militants could inflict great damage on a more 
powerful country was brought home to the United through several attacks.
• In 1993, a truck bombing of the World Trade Center in New Y ork City killed six people. 
• In 1998, bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania killed over 200 people, including 12 Americans. The United States responded by bombing Al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan and the Sudan. Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had fled to Afghanistan and allied himself with the Taliban , Islamic fundamentalists who controlled Afghanistan. 
• In 2000, two suicide bombers in a small rubber boat nearly sank a billion-dollar warship, the USS Cole , docked in the Middle Eastern 
country of Y emen. 
September 11 Terror Attacks The coordinated attacks by Al-Qaeda 
terrorists in commercial airliners on the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New Y ork City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., and a fourth plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, claimed nearly 3,000 lives on September 11, 2001. The attacks galvanized public opinion as nothing had since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, and they empowered the Bush administration to take action.

War in Afghanistan President Bush declared that he wanted Osama 
bin Laden and other Al-Qaeda leaders “dead or alive. ” The Taliban refused 
to turn over bin Laden and his associates. In the fall of 2001, a combination of U.S. bombings, U.S. special forces, and Afghan troops in the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance quickly overthrew the Taliban government. American and Afghan forces continued to pursue the remnants of Al-Qaeda in the mountains bordering Pakistan but failed to capture bin Laden. With U.S. support, Hamid Karzai became head of the government in Kabul, but Afghanistan remained unstable and divided by the Taliban insurgency and tribal conflicts. 
Homeland Security After the 9/11 attacks, most Americans accepted more 
extensive security measures such as background checks and airport searches. The USA P ATRIOT Act of 2001 gave the U.S. government unparalleled powers 
to obtain information and to expand surveillance and arrest powers. However, many Americans were troubled by unlimited wiretaps and the collection of records about cell-phone calls and emails. Some also objected to the use of military tribunals to try suspects accused of terrorism and the indefinite imprisonment and alleged torture of suspects at a U.S. military prison in the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.
To better protect against terrorism, the Bush administration created a 
new Department of Homeland Security by combining more than 20 federal 
agencies with 170,000 employees. Among these were the Secret Service, the Coast Guard, and agencies dealing with customs and immigration. This was the largest reorganization of government since the creation of the Department of Defense after World War II. Many in Congress questioned why the FBI and CIA were left out of the new department. In 2004, a bipartisan commission on 
729  TOPIC 9.6   CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURYterrorism criticized the FBI and the CIA, as well as the Department of Defense, 
for failing to work together to “connect the dots” that might have uncovered the 9/11 plot. Congress followed up on the commission’s recommendations, creating a director of national intelligence with the difficult job of coordinating the intelligence activities of all agencies. 
Iraq War  In his 2002 State of the Union address, President Bush singled 
out Iraq, North Korea, and Iran as the “axis of evil. ” While U.S. intelligence agencies were finding no link between Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and the 
September 11, 2001, attacks, the Bush administration publicly asserted there was. Furthermore, the Bush administration argued that Iraq was developing nuclear or biological weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) that it could use or 
sell to terrorists. Late in 2002, Secretary of State Powell negotiated an inspection plan with the UN Security Council, which Iraq accepted. UN inspectors would investigate Iraqi facilities to search for signs of weapon development. In the following months, the UN inspectors failed to find WMDs in Iraq. 
Operation Iraqi Freedom In early 2003, President Bush declared that 
Iraq had not complied with numerous UN resolutions and that “the game was over. ” Without support of the UN Security Council, the United States launched air attacks on Iraq on March 19. In less than four weeks, U.S. armed forces, with the support of the British and other allies, overran Iraqi forces, captured the capital city, Baghdad, and ended Hussein’s dictatorship. When U.S. forces could not find WMDs in Iraq, criticism of the “war of choice” and the “regime change” mounted both at home and overseas. 
The defeat of the Iraqi army and the capture of Saddam Hussein in late 
2003 did not end the violence in Iraq. Diverse groups of insurgents (Sunni followers of the former dictator, Shiite militias, and foreign fighters, including Al-Qaeda) continued to attack U.S. and allied troops and one another. Millions of Iraqis fled the country or were displaced by the sectarian attacks. The Bush administration was widely criticized for going into Iraq without sufficient troops to control the country and for disbanding the Iraqi army. Photographs of the barbaric treatment of prisoners by U.S. troops at Abu Ghraib further diminished America’s reputation in Iraq and around the world. 
Elections of 2004 and a Bush Second Term
The Democrats approached the elections of 2004 optimistic that they could unseat the incumbent president burdened by an increasingly unpopular war and limited economic recovery. Democratic voters selected Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts as their presidential candidate. The Republicans successfully energized their conservative base on issues such as the war against terrorism, more tax cuts, and opposition to abortion and gay marriage.
President Bush received 51 percent of the popular vote and captured 286 
electoral votes to Kerry’s 252. The Republicans also expanded their majorities in the Senate and House and continued to gain on the state level, especially in the South. This left the party in its strongest position since the 1920s. 
730 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONUnresolved Wars The reconstruction of Iraq had made some headway by 
2005, when the Iraqis held their first election, created a national assembly, and 
selected a prime minister and cabinet ministries, but the violence continued. On average, 100 Americans and 3,000 Iraqis were killed each month. In an attempt to reduce the violence, President Bush sent a “surge” of an additional 30,000 U.S. troops in early 2007. By late 2008, militia violence and American deaths were down in Iraq, and the United States had started to turn over control of the provinces to the Iraqi government. 
In Afghanistan, the Taliban stepped up their attacks. For the first time, the 
number of Americans killed there outnumbered those killed in Iraq. President Bush turned over to the next president two unresolved wars and incomplete efforts to deal with nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea. The Bush administration, though, did have the satisfaction of knowing that there had not been another major terrorist attack in the United States since September 11, 2001.

The war in Afghanistan began in 2001. By the time this photo was taken in 2013, the conflict was on its 
way to becoming the longest war in U.S. history. 
Other Foreign Policies President Bush played an active role in selected 
global affairs. For example, he worked with European nations to expand the 
European Union and NATO, supported admission of China to the World Trade Organization, and brokered conflicts between India and Pakistan. 
However, the Bush administration refused to join the Kyoto Accord  to 
combat climate change, walked out of a UN conference on racism, abandoned the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia, and for years would not negotiate with North Korea or Iran. Critics questioned whether the administration valued cooperation with the nations of the world or instead followed a unilateralist approach. The president argued, in what became known as the “Bush Doctrine, ” that the old policies of containment and 
731  TOPIC 9.6   CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURYdeterrence were no longer effective in a world of stateless terrorism. The 
president claimed that the United States was justified in protecting itself by using preemptive attacks to stop the acquisition of WMDs by terrorists and by nations that support terrorism.
Election of 2008
In 2008, the Democrats went through a long primary battle. The top candidates were former first lady and U.S. senator from New Y ork Hillary Clinton and the charismatic 47-year-old African American junior senator from Illinois, Barack Obama. After winning the nomination, Obama chose as his running mate Joseph Biden of Delaware, an experienced member of the Senate. In the shadow of the unpopular Bush administration, the Republicans nominated Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Vietnam War hero and a political maverick 
who hoped to appeal to undecided voters. 
Senator McCain briefly led in the polls, but Obama’s message for change, 
his opposition to the Iraq War, and an economy on the brink of collapse helped the Democrats win in November. Obama received a decisive 364 electoral votes to McCain’s 174 by taking eight states (including Florida, Ohio, Virginia, and North Carolina) that had been won by Bush in 2004. The Democrats also increased their majorities in the House and Senate well beyond their victories in 2006. 
The election of the first African American president of the United States 
was historic. However, Barack Obama and the Democrats faced the country’s worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, two unfinished U.S. wars, and a world increasingly skeptical of U.S. power and leadership. President Obama appointed his Democratic primary opponent, Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state and reappointed a Republican, Robert Gates, as secretary of defense to provide operational continuity in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
Foreign Policy of the Obama Presidency (2009–2017)
Barack Obama was elected in part because of his opposition to the Iraq War and his promise to end the unilateral approach overseas that had damaged the reputation of the United States during the Bush presidency. In general, the Obama administration was reluctant to use large-scale military actions that would put many U.S. troops on the ground. Instead, they opted for negotiations, targeted operations by special forces, and drone strikes. Critics attacked Obama for “leading from behind, ” but the issue remained unresolved whether more troops would solve or worsen conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere. 
Iraq  In early 2009, the United States continued to wind down ground 
combat operations in Iraq. U.S. military support and air power helped the Iraqi forces battle insurgents through 2011, when the last of U.S. forces were withdrawn. However, sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite Muslims erupted again. 
732 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONAfghanistan The Obama campaign charged that the Bush administration 
had ignored Afghanistan in order to invade Iraq. As president, Obama made 
fighting Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan a priority. He approved adding 17,000 troops to the U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2009 and then 30,000 more in 2010. The counterterrorism surge proved effective in Afghanistan, but the increased use of pilotless drone attacks on terrorists in Pakistan intensified anger against the United States. In 2012, President Obama and President Karzai of Afghanistan signed a long-term partnership agreement. After 2014, the new focus for U.S. forces was to train and support the Afghan military.
Death of Osama bin Laden In May 2011, Osama bin Laden, the leader 
of Al-Qaeda, was killed in Pakistan in a clandestine operation of the CIA and Navy SEALs. The death of bin Laden and other top leaders of Al-Qaeda raised the question of whether the U.S. role in the area was completed. 
Arab Spring In June of 2009, President Obama traveled to Egypt and gave 
a speech at the University of Cairo calling for a “new beginning” in relations between the Islamic world and the United States. In 2010, Obama was soon tested by a wave of protests across the Middle East and North Africa, known as the “Arab Spring. ” Civil unrest and armed rebellion toppled governments in Tunisia, Libya (where the dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, was killed), Egypt (where the president, Hosni Mubarak, was imprisoned), and Y emen. However, the civil war in Syria created a greater humanitarian crisis as 12.5 million Syrian refugees tried to escape to safety, often to neighboring countries in the Middle East and Europe. President Obama was widely criticized for not intervening more effectively.
Rise of ISIS In Syria and Iraq, another terrorist movement, ISIS (Islamic 
State of Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIL) vowed to create a worldwide caliphate under strict Islamic law. This well-financed movement used social media to recruit fighters from around the world. Former members of the Iraqi military, driven from power in the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, also joined ISIS. President Obama, while reluctant to return American soldiers to fight in Iraq and Syria, did commit American air power and trainers to help Iraq regain lost territories. By 2016, the United States had around 5,000 military personnel in Iraq.
Iran  The Obama Administration joined other world powers in a 2015 
agreement with Iran that would prevent Iran from developing and producing nuclear bombs for at least 15 years. Republicans opposed the agreement because it released the frozen assets of Iran, which it could use for conventional weapons and terrorism.
Asia  Events in the Middle East limited President Obama’s planned “pivot” 
to Asia. The administration understood that America’s economic and strategic future was closely tied to the Pacific Rim. The United States and 11 other Pacific countries (excluding China) negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement in 2016. However, American public opinion turned against globalization, and the U.S. Senate did not ratify the TPP . 
733  TOPIC 9.6   CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURYU.S. relations with China and North Korea also became more difficult under 
Obama. China’s attempts to claim islands in the South China Sea threatened 
Southeast Asian nations and free passage through international waters guarded by the U.S. Navy. The most immediate threat to U.S. interests in Asia came from North Korea, which was developing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.
Europe  After the Great Recession of 2008, the European Union struggled 
with a debt crisis, especially in countries with weaker economies, such as Greece. The crisis passed, but the resulting fiscal austerity programs and the EU open-borders policies alienated many working-class people. This promoted a resurgence of nationalism among people who worried that they were losing their jobs and national identities. 
Russia In 2014, Ukraine’s pro-Russian government was overthrown by a 
popular pro-Western movement. Russia, under Vladimir Putin, responded by orchestrating a revolt of pro-Russian partisans in eastern Ukraine and annexing the militarily strategic Crimea peninsula. The United States and European nations retaliated by placing economic sanctions on Russia and its leaders. A resurgent Russia also intervened in Syria’s civil war, making it a player in Middle Eastern politics once again. By the end of the Obama administration, relations between the United States and Russia were at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War.
Cuba  President Obama started a slow normalization of relations with 
Cuba . In 2015, the two countries agreed to open embassies in Havana and 
Washington and to resume direct flights for the first time since the Eisenhower administration. Against some Republican opposition, American travelers and businesses took advantage of the thaw in relations with the former Cold War enemy.
Cyber Attacks The greatest new threats to the nation’s security in the 
21st century were electronic. Cybercrime, such as stealing digital data, and cyber warfare, such as incapacitating the computerized networks that operate another country’s electric power grid, threatened to be very destructive. Russians, Chinese, Iranians, and others used cyber attacks to steal U.S. private and governmental digital data, including credit card and personnel records. In 2016, Russian agents hacked documents and emails from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and released the information through the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks in an effort to disrupt the U.S. election.
Domestic Policy of the George W. Bush Years 
(2001–2009)
On the domestic front, President George W . Bush aggressively pushed 
his conservative agenda: tax cuts, deregulation, federal aid to faith-based organizations, antiabortion legislation, school choice, privatization of Social Security and Medicare, drilling for oil and gas in the Alaskan wildlife refuge, and voluntary environmental standards for industry. 
734 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONRepublican Tax Cuts In 2001, Congress, enjoying a rare budget surplus, 
passed a $1.35 trillion-dollar tax cut spread over ten years. The bill lowered 
the top tax bracket, gradually eliminated estate taxes, increased the child tax credit and limits for IRA and 401(k) contributions, and gave all taxpayers an immediate tax rebate. In 2003, President Bush pushed through another round of tax cuts for stock dividends, capital gains, and married couples. Democrats criticized the tax cuts for giving most of the benefits to the richest 5 percent of the population and for contributing to the doubling of the national debt during the Bush presidency from about $5 trillion to $10 trillion. By the time Bush left office, the deficit was approaching 10 percent of GDP , about triple what economists thought was manageable.
Education and Health Reform President Bush championed the bipartisan 
No Child Left Behind Act. It aimed to improve student performance and close the gap between well-to-do and poor students in the public schools through testing of all students nationwide, granting students the right to transfer to better schools, funding stronger reading programs, and training high-quality teachers. Republicans also passed laws to give seniors enrolled in Medicare the option to enroll in private insurance companies. Congress also fulfilled a campaign promise by President Bush to provide prescription drug coverage for seniors. Democrats criticized the legislation as primarily designed to profit insurance and drug companies. 
Economic Bubbles and Corruption The technology boom of the 1990s 
peaked in 2000 and was over by 2002. The stock market crashed; the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 38 percent. The unemployment rate climbed to 6 percent, and the number of people living in poverty increased for the first time in eight years. 
Fraud and dishonesty committed by business leaders also hurt the stock 
market and consumer confidence in the economy. For example, the large corporations Enron and WorldCom had “cooked their books” (falsified stated 
earnings and profits) with the help of accounting companies. 
The Federal Reserve fought the recession by cutting interest rates to 1.25 
percent, the lowest in 50 years. The end of the technology boom-bust cycle (1995–2002) encouraged many investors to move their money into real estate, which created another speculative “bubble” (2002–2007) that would burst with even more tragic consequences in Bush’s second term. 
Washington Politics After his reelection victory in 2004, President Bush 
pushed Congress without success to privatize Social Security by encouraging Americans to invest part of their Social Security payroll deductions in various market investments. His administration also argued for immigration reform, which was blocked by conservatives who criticized it as “amnesty” for undocumented immigrants. President Bush did, however, leave a lasting impact on the federal courts by appointing two conservatives to the Supreme Court—John Roberts (as Chief Justice) and Samuel Alito—and increasing 
conservative majorities in the federal appellate courts.
735  TOPIC 9.6   CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURYWhen Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast hard and flooded New 
Orleans in August 2005, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
failed both to anticipate and respond to the crisis. More than 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands of others (mostly poor people) were left in desperate conditions. Public dissatisfaction with the Katrina response, the Iraq War, and a variety of Republican congressional scandals involving bribery, perjury, and obstruction of justice helped the Democrats win control of both houses of Congress in 2006. 
The Great Recession The housing boom of 2002–2007 was fueled by 
fraudulent mortgage lending and runaway real-estate speculation, particularly by nonbank financial institutions that worked with little government regulation. Wall Street firms packaged these high-risk loans into a variety of complex investments (securitization) and sold them to unsuspecting investors around the world. 
However, as soon as housing prices started to dip, the bubble burst. Prices 
collapsed, foreclosures climbed, and investments worth trillions of dollars lost value. Investors panicked, which caused many banks and financial institutions at home and overseas to face failure. This resulted in a credit, or liquidity, crisis because banks either lacked funds or were afraid to make the loans to businesses and consumers that were necessary for the day-to-day functioning of the economy. 
As the crisis within credit markets deepened, Americans were also hit with 
soaring gas prices (well over $4 a gallon), stock market declines of more than 40 percent, and rising unemployment. In early 2008, the federal government tried a $170 billion stimulus package and took over a few critical financial institutions, such as quasigovernmental mortgage institutions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
However, the crisis was not over. In September, the bankruptcy of the 
large Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers led to panic in the 
financial industry. This persuaded the Bush administration to ask Congress for additional funds to help U.S. banks and restore the credit markets. Congress passed the controversial Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, creating a $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) to purchase from financial 
institutions failing assets that included mortgages and mortgage-related securities. Some conservatives attacked TARP as “socialism, ” while some liberals attacked it as a bailout of the Wall Street executives who had caused the problems.
As with the Great Depression of 1929, the causes of this crash will be debated 
for years. Some blamed the Federal Reserve for keeping interest rates too low. Others criticized excessive deregulation of the financial industry. And others saw the cause in government efforts to promote home ownership. Moreover, real-estate bank fraud and Ponzi schemes that cost investors tens of billions of dollars in losses also helped to destroy investor confidence. Whatever its causes, the crisis significantly affected the 2008 election. 
736 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONDomestic Policy of the Obama Presidency (2009–2017)
The rapidly growing economic crisis dominated the transition between 
President Bush and President Obama. Congress approved the use of the second half of the controversial TARP funding—$350 billion. At Obama’s request, Bush used more than $10 billion of TARP funds to support the failing automakers General Motors (GM) and the Chrysler Corporation. Republicans largely rejected the president’s efforts at bipartisanship legislation. 
However, during Obama’s first term, Democrats controlled the House and 
briefly had enough Senate votes to stop filibusters and so could pass legislation with little Republican support. Several Republicans did vote to confirm the appointments of Sonia Sotomayor  and Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court. 
Since the new justices replaced other liberals, Justice Anthony Kennedy remained the swing vote in many 5–4 decisions.
Economic Stimulus The Great Recession of 2008 started in the 
United States. During the downturn, the stock market lost half of its value and unemployment peaked at more than 10 percent. Relying on Keynesian economic ideas to avoid a greater depression, Obama and the Democrats enacted a number of programs to promote recovery and financial reform.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided a $787 
billion economic stimulus package designed to create or save 3.5 million jobs. Included was $288 billion for tax cuts to stimulate spending and $144 billion to help state and local governments maintain services. The balance of the package was for construction projects, health care, education, and renewable energy. The Federal Reserve , under the leadership of economist and scholar of the 
Great Depression Ben Bernanke, also promoted recovery. It lowered interest rates and injected $600 billion dollars into the banking system.
With the domestic auto industry near collapse, the federal government 
became deeply involved in its recovery. The government temporarily took over General Motors (“Government Motors”) while the company went through bankruptcy and guided the sale of Chrysler to Fiat, an Italian automaker. The popular “Cash for Clunkers” program provided $3 billion in incentives to U.S. residents to scrap old cars in order to promote sales and to purchase new, more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
Financial Reforms The Great Recession revealed serious flaws in the 
federal oversight of financial institutions after the deregulation that began in the 1970s. The comprehensive Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  (2010) was designed to improve regulation of banking and 
investment firms and to protect taxpayers from future bailouts of businesses that were “too big to fail. ” The act also set up a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to regulate consumer products, such as mortgages and credit cards. Some criticized the act for not breaking up the big banks that contributed to the meltdown of the economy and needed the bailouts. 
By late 2016, the economy looked far stronger than in 2010. It had added 
15 million jobs, the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.6 percent, and the 
737  TOPIC 9.6   CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURYDow Jones Industrial Average was up 210 percent. The new CFPB had already 
investigated nearly one million consumer banking and credit card complaints and provided $11.7 billion in relief for more than 27 million consumers. However, the Obama administration was still criticized for a slow recovery, and a lower percentage of Americans were working than before the recession.
Environment and Climate Change The Obama administration used the 
stimulus bill to reduce reliance on oil and increase development of alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power. Auto manufacturers were encouraged to produce more hybrid and electric cars. In 2015, the United States joined 195 other nations in the Paris Agreement to reduce global carbon emissions. However, many in Congress disagreed with the science behind climate change and opposed tighter controls of greenhouse gases caused by the use of fossil fuels, making the environment another partisan issue.
Education  In the stimulus package, Obama promoted reforms in early 
childhood and K–12 education (Race to the Top), including more private-public partnerships and more use of charter schools. Democrats attacked the growing college loan debt crisis by cutting out private banks in the federal college-loan program. The bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act was signed into law in 2015 to replace No Child Left Behind, which had been attacked for excessive testing and for supporting efforts to develop common curriculum standards across the country. The new law placed more emphasis on local and state flexibility. 
Budget Deficits The recession decreased federal tax receipts, increased 
federal spending to avoid a depression, and shrank the overall economy. As a result, total national debt initially ballooned under Obama. Congressional efforts to reduce deficit spending were stymied by Democrats who opposed cuts to social services and by Republicans who fought tax increases: compromise  
had become a dirty word in Washington. Despite the stalemate in Congress, renewed economic growth reduced the burden of the annual deficit. It declined from almost 10 percent of GDP at the depth of the recession to under 3 percent in 2016, a level most economists thought the government could afford.
Health Care  The U.S. “fee for service” medical system was the most 
expensive in the world but produced mixed results. It promoted innovation but left more than 45 million people outside the system to seek medical care in emergency rooms. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  of 2010 
(“Obamacare”) aimed to extend affordable health insurance to an additional 25 million Americans through combinations of subsidies, mandates, insurance exchanges, and expansion of Medicaid while introducing medical and insurance reforms to control health care costs. The act required insurance companies to accept patients regardless of preexisting conditions, allowed children to remain on their parents’ insurance until age 26, and funded wellness exams and women’s medical needs. Republicans opposed the law for its regulations and costs, but after a slow rollout, nearly 20 million Americans gained coverage through private health insurance or Medicaid.
738 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONOther Presidential Initiatives President Obama signed a number of 
executive orders to overturn actions of the Bush administration. He placed 
a formal ban on torture by requiring that army field manuals be used as the guide for interrogating terrorist suspects. The new president expanded stem cell research and ended restrictions on federal funding of overseas health organizations. One of the first bills passed by Congress that Obama signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act that strengthened protection of equal pay for female employees. He had promised to close the U.S. prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, but failed to win needed congressional support.
The Tea Party The opposition to government spending and to “Obamacare” 
coalesced in a loosely united conservative and libertarian movement known as the Te a Par ty . While many in the movement focused on debt and health care, 
others emphasized expanding gun rights, outlawing abortions, and preventing undocumented immigration. Fueled by Tea Party energy, the Republicans in 2010 took control of the House with a 242 to 193 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans reduced the Democrats’ majority to 53 votes, which consisted of 51 Democrats and 2 independents who caucused with them. 
Elections and Money In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United 
v. Federal Election Commission  that corporations were “legal persons” and had 
the same rights as individuals to buy ads to influence political elections. This ruling opened a flood of new money into politics from wealthy donors. As individual donors replaced traditional party fundraising, the parties became weaker. 
Election of 2012 The presidential election of 2012 was dominated by 
issues related to the Great Recession, the Affordable Care Act, immigration, and the long-term fiscal health of the United States. Republicans conducted a long, hard-fought battle for their party’s nomination before selecting Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts. President Obama defeated Romney 332 to 206 in the Electoral College and by five million popular votes. The president ran strongly among Hispanics, winning 71 percent of their votes.
In Congress, Republicans could celebrate after the election of 2012 by 
keeping their strong majority in the House of Representatives, while the Democrats retained control of the Senate. However, the election of 2014 again proved the strength of the Republican turnout in nonpresidential elections as the Republicans took control of both the House and Senate. 
Government in Deadlock During Obama’s first term, the divisions 
between the Democratic president and the Republican-controlled Congress were so serious that Standard & Poor’s downgraded the government’s credit rating. These differences continued through the last four years of Obama’s presidency. Compromise was difficult and rare, and as a result, little significant legislation was signed into law. The sharply divided government produced one one budget stalemate after another and even a Republican threat to default on the national debt. 
739  TOPIC 9.6   CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURYOne high-profile point of conflict was the Affordable Care Act. After 
Republicans regained control of the House, they unsuccessfully tried more 
than 50 times to overturn or defund the ACA. 
The two parties did pass one major tax compromise in January 2013. It 
preserved the Bush tax cuts for incomes of $400,000 and less and allowed the top tax rate to rise to 39.6 percent for higher incomes. However, Congress was unable to compromise on the annual budget, so sequestrations  (automatic 
cuts) went into effect across both domestic and defense spending. Neither party liked the impact on military and domestic programs, but the deep divisions prevented compromise. In October 2013, Republicans carried out their threat to shut down the federal government, which remained closed for 16 days. 
The unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016 opened a 
new arena for conflict. Senate Republicans refused to hold hearings for Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. As a result, the Supreme Court had only eight members for 13 months. When the Court deadlocked 4–4, it could not rule on decisions made in the lower federal courts.
The Trump Presidency and the Election of Biden
The flood of refugees and immigrants into Europe from the Middle East and Africa fueled a worldwide backlash against immigration and globalization. In the United States, the unsolved issues of 11 million undocumented immigrants and the loss of manufacturing jobs to new technology and to lower-wage countries in Asia and Latin America set the stage for a dramatic political upset.
2016 Election The most vocal U.S. leader against globalization was 
Donald J. Trump, a well-known real estate developer and reality TV show personality. He became a prominent political figure by fueling the false belief that Obama was not born in the United States. He criticized Washington politicians (“drain the swamp”), unwanted immigration (“build the wall”), and international trade deals (such as NAFTA). Trump’s effective use of slogans (“Make America Great Again”), social media (Twitter), and large rallies won him the Republican Party’s presidential nomination. In the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state, U.S. senator, and first lady, became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. She vowed to build on Obama’s achievements by expanding access to health care and continuing U.S. leadership globally.
Early polls favored Clinton. However, Trump’s bold attacks energized some 
working-class voters, adding them to the traditional Republican base. Though Trump lost the popular vote by three million votes, he won the closely contested “swing” states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Florida. As a result, he received 306 electoral votes against Clinton’s 232 votes, giving him a solid victory. The Republican Party held control of the House and Senate.
Trump’s Domestic Policy President Trump emphasized tax cuts, 
deregulation of the private sector, trade protection, and immigration control. In 2017, he signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which cut the corporate tax rate 
740 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONfrom 35 to 21 percent, temporarily lowered personal tax brackets, and raised 
the threshold for estate taxes to $11 million per individual. The cuts mostly benefitted wealthy Americans and resulted in a sharp increase in the federal deficit. The Republicans dismantled parts of the Dodd-Frank Act that regulated banks and consumer borrowing and overturned Obama-era regulations to control greenhouse gases. 
Trump used executive orders to weaken Obama’s Affordable Care Act by 
eliminating the mandate to buy health insurance and to overturn DACA, an Obama program that stopped deportation of individuals who had entered the country with their families as children. His administration discouraged illegal immigration with get-tough policies at the border and cooperated with Mexico and Central American countries to restrict people leaving them. 
President Trump fulfilled another campaign promise by filling over 200 
vacancies in the federal courts with conservative judges, including three Supreme Court justices: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. By 2019, President Trump enjoyed the lowest unemployment rate (3.5 percent) in decades, steady business growth, and a booming stock market.  
However, Trump failed to deliver on his pledges to propose a replacement 
for the ACA and to persuade Mexico to pay for a border wall. In addition, Trump’s term was marked by frequent firings and resignations of top officials, and the president was repeatedly cited by fact-checking services for making false statements.
Trump’s Foreign Policy On the international front, Trump pledged 
to follow an “ America First” policy. He pulled the United States out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, the Paris Agreement to curb climate change, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the UN Human Rights Council, and UNESCO. He announced that the United States would withdraw from the World Health Organization. Further, he threatened to leave NATO and the World Trade Organization. Trump placed tariffs on China with mixed results, including increased prices for U.S. consumers, difficulties for U.S. manufacturers that relied on parts imported from China, and reduced agricultural exports to China. However, the tariffs led to a Phase 1 trade agreement that softened the impact of the trade war. 
Trump changed U.S. policy toward Iran. He withdrew the United States 
from the six-nation agreement to restrict that country’s development of nuclear weapons. In addition, he ordered the assassination of a top Iranian general who had been involved in terrorist attacks. In a strategy to isolate Iran, the administration brokered Arab-Israeli peace agreements with UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco, agreements that some of his critics supported.
Investigation and Impeachment In 2017, the Justice Department 
appointed Robert Mueller to lead an investigation into the Russian government’s interference in the 2016 election. The investigation resulted in 34 indictments and 8 convictions of Trump campaign staff. However, following Justice Department guidelines against indicting a sitting president, Mueller did not make an explicit recommendation to indict Trump.
741  TOPIC 9.6   CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURYAfter the Democrats gained control of the House in the 2018 elections, they 
impeached President Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress 
for withholding military aid to Ukraine in exchange for evidence against the Biden family. In February 2020, the Republican majority in the Senate found Trump not guilty. Democrats generally saw Trump’s actions as a threat to the rule of law. Some Republicans labeled Mueller’s investigation as a “witch hunt” based on unproven charges. Others argued that what Trump did was not an impeachable offense.
2020 Pandemic The virus COVID-19 was first identified in China in 
December 2019. The first case in the United States was confirmed on January 20, 2020. While the Trump administration restricted travel from China and later from Europe, he consistently downplayed the significance of the disease, despite the warnings of his advisors. With a lack of federal leadership, the United States was slow in testing for the virus and in manufacturing critical medical supplies, and policies across the 50 states were inconsistent. Many American refused to wear masks or practice social distancing, seeing these actions as violations of their personal liberties. Together, these factors contributed to the United States having one of the poorest records among advanced nations in its initial response to the crisis. By early 2021, over 500,000 Americans had died.
The pandemic caused many schools and all but essential businesses to close. 
Tens of millions of people lost their jobs and many businesses failed. The eco-nomic disruption did benefit Internet and e-commerce companies. Congress and the Federal Reserve responded with a series of aid programs costing over $7 trillion to help the unemployed, small businesses, and industries. 
President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, a $10 billion government 
program to help pharmaceutical companies develop COVID-19 vaccines at a record pace, proved successful. The first people in the United States to receive shots were vaccinated in December 2020.
Election of 2020 The pandemic curtailed large political rallies and 
promoted voting by mail. The government’s response to the pandemic and economic stress contributed to President Trump’s decline in the polls. The Democrats nominated 78-year-old Joseph Biden, Barack Obama’s former vice president. He picked California Senator Kamala Harris as his vice president, the first person of color for the position. 
In a historic turnout of more than 66 percent of eligible voters, Biden and 
Harris won by seven million votes, receiving 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232. Y et President Trump, without evidence, claimed he had won. After months of recounts and court rulings, no serious fraud was found. However, Trump continued to energize his followers to “Stop the Steal. ” 
Attack on the Capitol and a Second Impeachment Finally, on January 6, 
2021, the date the Senate was to accept the electoral votes from the 50 states, Trump held a rally near the White House, encouraging his supporters to march to the Capitol. That march turned into an attack on the Capitol, the first since 
742 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP® EDITIONthe British invasion in 1814. Five 
people died and hundreds were injured, as lawmakers and their staff members fled for their lives. After troops overcame the mob, the Senate finally confirmed Biden as president.
Trump’s actions before 
and during the attack on the Capitol resulted in his becoming the first president ever to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives. In the Senate, the vote to convict him won bipartisan, majority support but not the two-thirds needed to pass.
Biden’s Administration Speaking to a deeply divided nation, President 
Biden called for unity in his inaugural address: “Every disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war. ” His priority was to end the suffering from the pandemic, in part through a $1.9 trillion aid package for struggling Americans and by vaccinating every American against COVID-19 by the fall of 2021. 
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES:  WHAT DOES FREEDOM MEAN?
Freedom is a major theme of American history, but people have always disagreed on what “freedom” means. The most dramatic example of this was the Civil War. Both sides fought in the name of freedom, but for Confederates the right to enslave others was a “freedom. ” 
Contests over Freedom In The Story of American Freedom (1999), 
Eric Foner traced America’s thoughts about freedom from the struggle for independence through the Reagan era. The Reconstruction, Progressive, New Deal, and Civil Rights eras enlarged the meaning of freedom to include equal rights for more people, often by expanding the power of government to protect individuals. During the Reagan Revolution, freedom was frequently defined as reducing the power of “big government” by cutting federal regulations. Foner attributed this change to reactions against federal court rulings promoting desegregation, equality, privacy, abortion rights, and other issues.
Diverse Expressions of Freedom David Hackett Fischer, in Liberty and 
Freedom  (2005), pursued its meaning through American visual expressions, 
customs, and what Tocqueville called “habits of the heart. ” Fischer’s analysis of the images and symbols from the Liberty Trees of the American Revolution through the protest posters of the late 20th century revealed the rich diversity of traditions about freedom that eluded abstract definitions. Hackett concluded that the United States remains free because of its diversity of traditions about freedom. He believes that the gravest threat to freedom comes from those

Questions 1–3 refer to the excerpt below.
“These militants are not just the enemies of America or the enemies of Iraq. 
They are the enemies of Islam, and they’re the enemies of humanity. . . . 
[I]t is cowardice that seeks to kill children and the elderly with car bombs, 
and cuts the throat of a bound captive, and targets worshipers leaving a mosque. It is courage that liberated more than 50 million people from tyranny. And it is courage in the cause of freedom that will once again destroy the enemies of freedom!
Islamic radicalism, like the ideology of communism, contains inherent 
contradictions that doom it to failure. By fearing freedom, by distrusting human creativity, and punishing change, and limiting the contributions of half a population, this ideology undermines the very qualities that make human progress possible and human societies successful. The only thing modern about the militants’ vision is the weapons they want to use against us. The rest of their grim vision is defined by a warped image of the past, a declaration of war on the idea of progress itself. ”

Topic 9.7
Causation in Period 9
Learning Objective : Explain the relative significance of the effects of 
change in the period after 1980 on American national identity.
One way to evaluate effects on the national identity is to look at who 
Americans were becoming in this period after 1980. The significant shift of 
migration to the Sun Belt affected how many Americans thought about the nation. The norms of the urban and more liberal Northeast and Midwest were challenged in the South, where people favored less government, little regulation of business, and a more active role for religion. One could argue that the culture wars fought over these differences left Americans with deeply divided views of the national identity. The change in immigration patterns from predominantly ethnic European countries to Asian, Latin American, and African countries also sparked fears among older White majorities about what was happening to the national identity, and the identity of America in 2050 and beyond.
Economic Division The economic changes after 1980 were particularly 
negative for many lower- and middle-class Americans. In previous decades, they had won prosperity and security from industrial growth, strong unions, and the social safety net policies of the New Deal and Great Society. However, new technology, globalization, and pro-business public policies meant that the benefits of economic growth were distributed unequally. The identity of the United States as the land of opportunity suffered in both the old industrial centers of the Rust Belt and in the new low-wage economy of the Sun Belt. 
At the same time, the American dream and entrepreneurial opportunities 
remained strong for well-educated people in urban centers. The result caused deeper divisions between rural and urban regions and between working-class and upper-class Americans. Critics wondered if America’s democracy would survive the inequality caused by the concentration of wealth.
Foreign Affairs The end of the Cold War and the rise of terrorism also 
left Americans with a less clear mission of how to use the country’s military power. Formerly, the country could focus on a single foe, such as the Soviet Union, that could be deterred by a large military. Replacing it were stateless terrorists scattered around the world with access to powerful explosives. After 2001, the large-scale use of American troops in the Middle East, a region with deep-rooted conflicts, seemed inappropriate to many. These challenges again left Americans divided over the U.S. role in the world. Would it be a partner in collective security pacts with other nations, a superpower that would take unilateral action for its own purposes, or a bystander in a type of isolationism?

THINK AS A HISTORIAN:  ARGUMENTATION—DEVELOPING COMPLEXITY
To do well on the AP® exam, you will need to develop and support complex arguments, ones that are detailed and demonstrate four skills:
• Explain the nuance. Nuance means subtlety or precision. A nuanced 
argument analyzes multiple variables related to that argument.
• Explain connections. These connections should be relevant, which 
means related to the argument. They should also be insightful, which means you understand why they are important on a deep level.
• Explain significance. Beyond merely citing names and dates, you should 
describe the argument’s credibility, signficance, and possible limitations.
• Explain effectiveness. Is this evidence solid enough, relevant enough, 
and important enough to strengthen the argument? Why or why not?
Being able to write a complex argument is one of the most challenging tasks for many students. Mastering it takes practice.
Choose one of the arguments below and answer the questions that follow.
Argument 1: After 1980, the United States became increasingly polarized 
between rural and urban regions.Argument 2: Passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 affected 
U.S. employment, transportation, and architecture in ways that still exist today.Argument 3: The political philosophy of the United States is a struggle between 
proponents of “freedom to” have equal rights and participation and “freedom from” government regulations and restrictions.
1. How can you make this argument more nuanced? Describe details related to this argument that make it more precise or subtle.
2. What connections can you make, either within one historical period or across periods, that will help strengthen this argument?
3. What details can you add that are significant to this argument? Significant details should be closely connected to the argument and should help to illuminate it in some way.
4. How effective is the evidence you have provided to support the argument? Explain why your evidence is relevant, trustworthy, important, or persuasive.

“Part of the myth about the first Americans is that all of them . . . had one 
culture . . . the white man turned everything upside down. Three elements were important in the early influence: the dislodgement of eastern tribes, the introduction of the horse, and metal tools and firearms.
“The British invaders of the New World, and to lesser degree the French, 
came to colonize. They came in thousands to occupy the land. They were, therefore, in direct competition with the Indians and acted accordingly, despite their verbal adherence to fine principles of justice and fair dealing. The Spanish came quite frankly to conquer, to Christianize. . . . They came in small numbers. . . . and the Indian labor force was essential to their aims. Therefore they did not dislodge or exterminate the Indians. . . . 
“The Spanish, then, did not set populations in motion. That was done 
chiefly from the east. The great Spanish contribution was the horse. ”

“ Although Kennedy did not rush to deal with domestic issues—in large 
part because he believed that foreign policy needed precedence—the press of events gradually forced his administration to use government power to confront racial discrimination and advance the cause of equality at home. ”
John M. Murrin, et al., historians,  
Liberty, Equality and Power, 1996
“Chopped down in his prime after only slightly more than a thousand days in the White House, Kennedy was acclaimed more for the ideals he enunciated and the spirit he had kindled than for the concrete goals he had achieved. He had laid one myth to rest forever—that a Catholic could not be trusted with the presidency of the United States.
“In later years revelation about Kennedy’s womanizing and allegations about 
his involvement with organized crime figures tarnished his reputation. But despite those accusations, his apparent vigor, charisma, and idealism made him an inspirational figure for the generation of Americans who came of age in the 1960s. ”
David M. Kennedy, et al., historians,  
The American Pageant, 2006
Using the excerpts above, answer (a), (b), and (c).

Kennedy’s interpretations of the impact of the Kennedy presidency. 
(b) Briefly explain how ONE event, development, or circumstance from the period 1960 to 1963 that is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts supports Murrin’s view. 
(c) Briefly explain how ONE event, development, or circumstance from the period 1960 to 1963 that is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpts supports Kennedy’s view.

Source:  Progressive Party Platform, August 5, 1912
The conscience of the people, in a time of grave national problems, has called into 
being a new party, born of the nation’s sense of justice. We of the Progressive Party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. . . . Political parties exist to secure responsible government and to execute the will of the people. . . . Instead of instruments to promote the general welfare, they have become the tools of corrupt interests which use them impartially to serve their selfish purposes. Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invis-ible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between cor -
rupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of statesmanship of the day.

No one can mistake the purpose for which the Nation now seeks to use the Demo-
cratic Party. It seeks to use it to interpret a change in its own plans and point of view. Some old things. . . . as we have latterly looked critically upon them. . . . have dropped their disguises and shown themselves alien and sinister. Some new things, as we look frankly upon them. . . . have come to assume the aspect of things long believed in and familiar, stuff of our own convictions.We have itemized. . . . the things that ought to be altered. . . . A tariff which makes the Government a facile instrument in the hands of private interests; a banking and currency system perfectly adapted to concentrating cash and restricting cred-its; an industrial system which restricts labor, and exploits natural resources; a body of agriculture never served through science or afforded the facilities of credit best suited to its practical needs.

The recognition of shortcomings or inconveniences in government is not by itself 
sufficient to warrant a change of system. There should be also an effort to estimate and compare the shortcomings and inconveniences of the system to be substi-tuted, for although they may be different, they will certainly exist.

Sir, you have now been President of the United States for six months and what is 
the result? It is no exaggeration to say that every enemy of the Negro race is greatly encouraged; that every man who dreams of making the Negro race a group of menials and pariahs is alert and hopeful.A dozen worthy Negro officials have been removed from office, and you have nominated but one black man for office, and he, such a contemptible cur, that his very nomination was an insult to every Negro. . . . To this negative appearance of indifference has been added positive action on the part of your advisers, with or without your knowledge, which constitutes the grav-est attack on the liberties of our people since emancipation. Public segregation of civil servants in government employ. . . . has for the first time in history been made the policy of the United States government.

When one starts to investigate conditions the result is appalling. . . . For instance, it 
is a fact that although this country is in its infancy, and has gained in wealth more in fifty years than any other country has in 700 years, still we have more poverty in comparison with any of those old countries.I have always felt that no true state of civilization can ever be realized as long as we continue to have two classes of society. But that is a tremendous problem. . . . I think myself that we are bound to have a revolution here before these questions are straightened out. We were on the verge of it in the Colorado strike and the reason we did not have it then was not due to the good judgement of public officials, but to that of labor officials, who worked unceasingly to prevent it.
