The World
in 1500

Costume 16th Century Europe

EUROPE
As the world approached the 1500s, old institutions
and polities gave way to new structures. The decline
of the Mongol Empire, which had controlled much
of Eurasia for centuries, and the rise of the Islamic
Ottoman Empire changed the course of human history.
The newly dominant Ottomans began disrupting trade,
especially the lucrative spice routes to Asia. In response,
Europeans increasingly turned to maritime exploration
to find new routes to Asia.

In 1492, Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic
Ocean, initiating a five-century interchange between the
Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. This “Columbian
Exchange” circulated people, diseases, plants, goods
and ideas throughout the world.
Europe in 1500 was comprised of numerous highly
competitive states, many of which still exist today
(although their borders and compositions have altered

with time). European political and religious leaders
during this period sought not merely to expand their
kingdoms but to solidify power within their borders.
A hierarchical society for most European polities, the
monarch was the most powerful person in the realm.
The monarch ruled over a class of nobles, people who
acted as not only extensions of a monarch’s power but
also a check upon it. Nobles and monarchs were special
people who had their own rules, had the right to wear
certain clothes, and owned most of the land and wealth.
Most nobles were expected to serve the monarch,
including providing military service when required.
Below the nobility were a class of merchants, traders,
artisans and craftsmen, some of which could be rather
wealthy. Peasants who worked the land of nobles formed
the lowest rung of the European social order. Regardless
of whether they were sharecroppers who shared their
produce with local nobles or serfs tied directly to the
land, peasants had little to no freedom of movement.

violence and even rebellion. Monarchs struggled against
their nobility for control over the levers of power. One
of the most successful in this regard would be the
long-ruling self-proclaimed Sun King Louis XIV (r.
1643-1715) of France, who successfully controlled and
managed his nobility. In contrast, in the 15th century, a
bloody conflict between two houses of the Plantagenet
dynasty (the Lancastrians and Yorks) turned into a civil
war that tore England apart. The civil war would last
until 1485 when Henry Tudor (r. 1485-1509), a scion of
the House of Lancastrian, won the throne of England at
the Battle of Bosworth Field.

Early modern monarchs struggled to control not
just the minds and bodies but also the souls of their
subjects. For most Europeans, the “Church” referred
to the Catholic Church seated in Rome. A pillar of
European society, the Church’s wealth, power and
influence often rivaled that of the monarchs and
emperors. For centuries, monarchs attempted to gain
religious autonomy from Rome and to find ways to

CHAPTER 1 THE WORLD IN 1500

Intense competition on the continent inspired European
monarchs to look outside their borders and the known
world for ways to tap into the riches of Africa and
Asia. The merging of new maritime technologies and a
desire to find new trade routes led to a period of naval
expansion, which would change the world not only for
Europeans but also for the people they encountered.

MUSLIM EMPIRES
In the 14th century, new powerful states emerged in
territories formerly controlled by the Mongol Empire.
Many of these states adopted Islam, a faith that originated
in the early seventh century in Arabia. By the early to mid1500s, the Ottomans (1299-1922) had already established
themselves as a dominant power centered around Anatolia,
the Persian Safavid Empire (1501-1736) was just beginning,

and so too was the Mughal Empire (1526-1857) in India.
During this period Egyptian Mamluks (manumitted slave
soldiers) spread Islamic theology across North Africa. The
Mamluks were great patrons of the arts, and the splendor
of their architecture is still evident today. By the 1600s,
Islam had become the dominant religion across much of
Eurasia, India, the Middle East, and North Africa.

Map of the Ottoman Empire c. 1450

To understand the rise of the Ottomans, we need to
examine the expansion of Turkic tribes westward
into Central Asia from the 600s to the 1100s. The
rise of the Mongol Empire checked this expansion
until the mid-14th century when the Mongols, no
longer the force they once were, began retreating
from Persia and Central Asia. With the decline of
the Mongols, new regimes including the Ottomans,
the Safavids and the Mughals would emerge.
Because of their use of muzzle-loading firearms,
the three empires are sometimes referred to as the
(Islamic) Gunpower Empires.

SUNNI AND SHIA ISLAM

The Ottomans derived their name from Osman
(r. 1299-1326), a Turkic leader that had important
victories over other warlords and eventually
the declining Byzantine Empire. By 1352, the
Ottomans were the chief power in the Balkans.
In 1453, during the reign of Sultan Mehmed II
(r. 1451-1481), Ottoman armies conquered the
Byzantine capital of Constantinople. Renamed
Istanbul, the city became the center of a sprawling
and culturally dynamic Islamic empire that Asian,
Middle Eastern, Northeastern and European
leaders viewed with envy and fear.

Today Sunnis account for 85-90% of all Muslims, with the rest
identifying as Shias. Both Sunnis and Shias read the Quran,
fast during Ramadan, make pilgrimages to Mecca, pray
multiple times a day and practice charity toward the poor.
The schism between Sunnis and Shia began over the issue
of who should succeed the Prophet Muhammad (570-632)
as head of the Muslim faith. Those later labeled as Sunni
asserted that their “caliph” or leader should be selected
based on leadership skills. At the same time, those who
argued that caliphs ought to be a member of the Prophet’s
family became the forebearers of Shiism. They initially
supported Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law Ali’s
(600-661) claim to become caliph. However, Shias were
vastly outnumbered by Sunnis who backed Muhammad’s
friend and long-time companion, Abu Bakr (573-634). In
time Umar (583/584-644) and then Uthman (573/576656) succeeded Abu Bakr. Both caliphs pursued policies
that centralized religious power which further contributed
to the growing political turmoil. Both Umar and Uthman
were murdered, which paved the way for Ali to become
the fourth caliph. He too met a violent end in 661. Such
strife led to the creation of two branches of Islam that
would, over the subsequent centuries, develop distinctive
political and religious traditions.

AFRICA
From 300-1450, a variety of complex political systems,
social structures and cultural groups emerged on the
African continent. As agricultural populations grew
and trade in high-value commodities increased, new
states rose to prominence. Over time the introduction
of Islam to the region by Arab merchants became
important for the development of madrasas, literacy
and state bureaucracies. The opening of the transSaharan trade integrated Africa into the Mediterranean
world, Europe and the Middle East. The emergence of
the new trade-oriented Swahili city-states along the
East African coast represented an important example of
these changes.

including the Oyo Empire during the 17th and 18th
centuries, the Kingdom of Dahomey during the 17th
through the 19th century, and the Asante Kingdom,
18th through the early 20th century. In Central Africa,
local rulers rebuilt old trade roads and created new
ones to meet the ever-increasing demands of European
and Arab merchants for more slaves. This altered the
political sphere as older polities, such as the Kingdom
of Kongo (14th -18th centuries), struggled to adapt to
changing circumstances. Although Kongolese rulers
initially profited from contact with the Portuguese, soon

CHAPTER 1 THE WORLD IN 1500

The religion of the Portuguese (Catholic Christianity)
appealed to the kings of Kongo, who hoped that
conversion to the new faith would give them the same
power which Portuguese rulers held over their subjects.
After all, Catholic Christianity justified the rule of
kings over their subjects, helping to legitimize and
centralize the power of such monarchs. Furthermore,
Catholicism was readily compatible with traditional
Kongo spiritual beliefs. For instance, the Creator God
of Christianity appeared similar to the Creator God of
ancient Bantu belief. Catholic Christianity also had a
group of holy individuals, the saints, who had died and
gone to heaven and could be prayed to for help in this
life. This concept again mirrored Kongolese beliefs in
a sky God whose spirits could likewise be invoked to
intervene in the lives of mortals.

Portuguese and Latin and, by the later 16th century, in
the KiKongo language.

The contact with the Portuguese provided a
commercial basis and a new set of ideas supportive of
royal legitimacy and authority, helping Kongo become
the most powerful kingdom of the region. Cities
arose at the critical points of political authority and
commercial connections. Mbanza Kongo, already a city
in the 1480s, became a still larger city with more than
50,000 inhabitants. Provincial capitals developed into
good-sized cities. Enslaved people, especially those
captured in war, helped build these expanding urban
centers. Significant growth in upper-class wealth took
place, intensifying social stratification. Such wealth
encouraged Kongo to become increasingly involved in
the slave trade. In the 16th century, Kongo began to

which dominated the production and supply of nzimbu
shells (used as currency). Portuguese merchants also
set up regular trade relations with local kingdoms
to the south, drawing them away from the sphere of
Kongo influence. The Atlantic trade also began to
attract other European merchants to the coast by the
late 1500s, most notably the Dutch. In the 1630s and
the 1640s, Dutch traders offered new direct outlets
for goods from the Lower Congo region. These new
routes cut the Kongo kingdom off from lucrative trade
connections in the interior. In 1665, Dutch forces and
their African allies defeated a Kongolese expedition
at the Battle of Mbwila. The kingdom then entered
a period of civil war as powerful factions sought to
install their own candidates as king. Having lost most
of its power by the early 18th century, the Kingdom of
Kongo existed largely in name only.

By the 16th century, European mercantile companies
started to establish permanent trading posts along the
West, Central and Southern African coasts. Until the
partition of Africa in the 19th century, most European
involvement in African affairs remained confined to
these coastal regions and relied heavily on African
middlemen and collaborators. Even African nations

occupation prior to the 1800s were transformed rather
than outright destroyed by the new power dynamics
brought about by overseas trade. When European
powers annexed these regions into their colonial
empires during the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
many pre-1800 institutions continued to exist, albeit
under a different jurisdiction and with a different kind
of sovereignty.

CHAPTER 1 THE WORLD IN 1500

AMERICAS
The arrival of the Europeans in the New World led not
only to the exchange of crops and commodities but also
the imposition of European economics, habits and
values on indigenous populations. Enslaved Africans
were also imported to many regions of the Americas,
which led to the creation of creole cultures. Whereas
Spain created colonial societies on the ruins of the
Aztec (1428–1521) and Maya Empires (1511–1697),
Portuguese settlers moved into areas that comprise
much of modern-day Brazil. Profiting from forced
labor, both Portugal and Spain shipped large quantities
of gold and silver back to Europe. Exposure to diseases
brought from Europe, coupled with overwork in

the encomienda system, caused massive population
declines among indigenous peoples over the course of
the 16th and 17th centuries.
In North America, European exploration led to the
establishment of settler colonialism, the appropriation
of Native American/First Nations lands and eventually,
the decimation, marginalization and displacement of
Native Americans. During the colonial period (from
the early 17th century until the formation of the United
States), Spain, France, England, the Netherlands and
Russia sent out expeditions to claim North American
territory.

ENCOMIENDA SYSTEM
The arrival of the Europeans in the New World resulted
in an exchange of goods, ideas and people that scholars
later dubbed the “Columbian Exchange.” Beginning in the
16th century, Spanish conquistadores expanded into the
Caribbean, Mexico and Peru. Following conquest, colonial
officials incorporated these areas into the Spanish Empire.
Spanish soldiers, priests and administrators forced Iberian
Catholic economic institutions, habits and values upon
indigenous people. During this time, crown lawyers legally
defined the status of Native Americans within the empire to
more effectively tax them. To help administer its New World
territory, the Spanish crown entrusted conquistadores and
other officials with grants of land and Native American slaves
known as encomiendas (from the Spanish word encomendar
-“to entrust”). The recipients of such grants, the encomederos,
would in turn, collect tribute in the form of gold, kind, or forced
labor from the Native Americans who lived on the allotted
land. Spanish officials demanded that landholders provide
military protection to their Native American laborers and make
provisions to convert them to Catholicism. However, most
encomideros claimed the land they occupied without fulfilling
their obligations to either protect or convert their Indian slaves.

Developed in part to support the needs of the early mining
industry, the encomienda system allowed for the rapid
development of areas like the San Luis Potosi silver mines
in Bolivia. However, given the brutal human costs of mining
and the exhaustion of many mines over the course of the
17th century, Spanish officials began to view the encomienda
system as outdated. They instead promoted the hacienda
system that resembled early modern European style feudalism.
Under the terms of the hacienda system, landowners kept
peasants in debt so that they could neither leave the land they
were working on nor the landowner who owned the hacienda.

ASIA
Today Asia is generally divided into four different regions:
Southeast Asia (mainland Southeast Asia and maritime
Southeast Asia), South Asia (Indian subcontinent), East
Asia (Far East), Central and West Asia (the Middle East
and the Caucasus), and North Asia (Siberia). It shares
the continental landmasses of Eurasia, Africa, and North
and South America. It is bounded by the Pacific, Indian
and Artic Oceans. Nomadic horsemen dominated steppe
life, conquering large sections. Russian explorers and
settlers began relocating to Asia in the 1600s, a process
they would complete by the 19th century. During this
same period, the Ottoman Empire expanded throughout
Anatolia, the Balkans and Egypt. In the 17th century,
the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644-1912) conquered
China. The Islamic Mughal Empire (1526-1857) and
the Hindu Maratha Empire (16th to early 19th century)
likewise controlled much of India from the 16th to 18th
century. Japan held sway over most of East Asia, parts of
Southeast Asia and Oceania until 1945.

SOUTHEAST ASIA
Over the centuries, the term “Southeast Asia” has wielded little influence over Southeast Asia and even
meant different things to different people. For instance, afterward were forced to limit such influence to the
Chinese mapmakers referred to the coastal areas of relatively small coastal areas.
Southeast Asia as Nanyang (literally
“the Southern sea”). On the other
hand, Arab explorers called the region
Zīrbād or Zīrbādāt (“land below the
winds”). Geographers did not refer to
Southeast Asia as a geographical and
distinct political term until the midtwentieth century.
Today experts refer to mainland
Southeast Asia (also known as the
Indochinese Peninsula), comprising
Cambodia,
Laos,
Myanmar,
Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand and
Vietnam, under the general heading
of Southeast Asia. Maritime Southeast
Asia consists mainly of the Malay
Archipelago, including Brunei, East
Malaysia, East Timor, Indonesia, the
Philippines and Singapore.
As in the case of Africa, European
explorers, soldiers, merchants and
missionaries who voyaged to Asia
from the 1500s through the 1800s
primarily dealt with coastal areas.
For example, Portuguese merchants
arrived in the region in the 1500s to
dominate the spice trade. However, in
the 17th century, the Dutch displaced
the Portuguese by establishing trading
relations with the Sultans of Java and Sumatra. By the
1800s the British East India Company dominated large
sections of India and controlled Hong Kong on the south
China coast and Penang and Singapore in Malaysia.
Although the bulk of Spain’s overseas colonies lay in
Central and South America, Madrid still maintained
a tight hold over the Philippines. However, unlike the
Americas where Europeans quickly imposed their
religious and cultural beliefs on native populations, in
Southeast Asia Thais, Burmese, Vietnamese and other
groups learned European economic techniques but
continued to follow Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana
Buddhism and Islam. In sum, prior to 1500, Europeans

BUDDHISM
During the sixth or fifth centuries BCE, an Indian monk
named Siddhartha Guatama taught a form of spiritual
asceticism. Enshrined by his followers as the “Buddha” or
enlightened one, his teachings became known as Buddhism.
As the Buddha eschewed religious dogma and urged
individuals to develop their own methods of meditating
and praying, Buddhism flowered throughout Asia in a
variety of contrasting styles and traditions. Today Tantric,
Northern Mahāyāna, and Southern Hinayana Buddhism
represent the three largest groups of Buddhists in the world.
Native to Sri Lanka (Ceylon), Myanmar (Burma), Thailand,
Cambodia and Laos, the Theravada school represents the
most conservative branch of Buddhism. Theravadins (Pali;
“Way of the Elders”) enshrine the teachings of Buddha’s
followers, maintain a sharp division between monks and
ordinary practitioners, and venerate the Buddha as not
merely a spiritual leader but the perfect master.

The Mahāyāna (Sanskrit for “Greater Vehicle”) movement
arose in India around the ninth century CE and spread
rapidly through Central and East Asia. Central to Mahāyāna
ideology is the idea of the bodhisattva, the one who
seeks to become a Buddha. Mahāyāna Buddhists believe
that everybody can aspire to become a bodhisattva.
Bodhisattvas seek to understand the nature of reality
through acquiring wisdom (prajna) and actualization
through compassion (karuna). Providing an organized
monastic movement and large scholastic centers,
Mahāyāna Buddhism remains a very popular form of
Buddhism. Mahāyāna accepts the primary scriptures and
teachings of early Buddhism but also recognizes other
texts that are not accepted by Theravada Buddhism,
such as the Mahāyāna Sūtras, which emphasizes the
history of bodhisattvas.

SOUTH ASIA
Today, South Asia includes the countries of
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The region is bounded
by the Himalayan mountains to the north and the
Indian Ocean in the south. When Europeans traders
in the 1500s and 1600s first moved into the region,

they faced opposition from the Mughal Empire that
dominated Northern India. However, the decline of
the Mughals in the 18th century provided an opening
for the British Empire, which would eventually gain
control over much of the region.

SUMMARY
This chapter has laid the essential groundwork for our investigation of world history. The following
chapters will build upon this information by encouraging readers to broaden their horizons and
confront the past from a multitude of perspectives. As we cover more than 500 years of history,
we will see that while many aspects of the human experience have radically changed, other
areas retain a high degree of continuity. When reading through this text, try to identify trends
of continuity and change over time. The next three chapters deal with empires that governed
vast lands in Europe, America, Asia, Eurasia and the Middle East. The following three chapters
examine revolutions in science and religion, social and cultural revolutions that challenged and
toppled existing political orders, and a technological revolution that changed the world. We then
examine how various societies dealt with the challenges of modernity and outside encroachment.
Our textbook concludes with an investigation of the 20th century and our modern world.

EUROPE
The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople and
subsequent expansion into the Mediterranean World
impeded European commercial development. Increasing
competition between different European states and the
Ottomans encouraged European monarchs to look
beyond their shores for new markets. They heavily
invested in their navies, not just in new ships but new
maritime technology such as astrolabes and caravels
with ribbed hulls, which gave captains and navigators
the ability to explore the wider world. Europeans started
to look for routes that would allow them to circumvent
the Ottoman Empire by sea. The Portuguese were the

first Europeans to circumnavigate the African continent
and venture into the Indian Ocean. The silver they
gained from the Americas, coupled with the application
of new military and maritime technologies, allowed
the Portuguese to become important participants in
the Indian Ocean trade. As a vital component of this
flourishing market, the Portuguese, and eventually
other Europeans, transacted with Arab, Persian, Indian
and Chinese merchants, and polities. The Portuguese
ruler King Henry the Navigator (1394-1460) played a
vital role in the growth of Portugal as a sea power.

CHAPTER 2 EXPANDING EMPIRES, EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS, 1500-1700

Jan Hus dismissed the practice and many other
church doctrines as corrupt. Although church
officials executed Wycliffe and Hus in 1509, Dutch
theologian Erasmus of Rotterdam’s Praise of Folly
raised the same issue of corruption in the church.
Due to Gutenberg’s invention of the moveabletype printing press in 1453, Praise of Folly quickly
became available across Europe.
Doctrinal questions about the Catholic church’s
ultimate authority, combined with the invention
of the printing press, set the stage for the
Protestant Reformation. In 1517, the German
monk and scholar Martin Luther (1483-1546)
challenged the Catholic church with his “NinetyFive-Theses.” Like many before, Luther was
dissatisfied with several Catholic doctrines and
practices, including the selling of indulgences.
Luther stressed that salvation could only be
gained by faith in God. Luther’s Justification by
Faith spread rapidly throughout Europe. In 1521,
a group of religious and political leaders known
as the Diet of Worms declared Luther a heretic
and suggested his ex-communication from the
Catholic church. Luther’s subsequent separation
from the church sparked a new movement known
as Protestantism. For many individuals, including
John Calvin, Luther had not gone far enough in
his reformative endeavors. As these dissonances
grew, the Catholic church fought back, creating
religious orders to win back believers. However,
the rise of Protestantism led to the creation of
many new Christian denominations.

JOHANN GUTENBERG
Johannes Gensfleisch zu Laden zum Gutenberg was born around 1399 in the
German town of Mainz. A goldsmith, gem cutter and metallurgist, he invented
one of the most revolutionary devices in modern history – the printing press.
Previously monks and scribes wrote and copied texts by hand. The possibility
of having movable blocks of letters and graphics in a type setting form made it
possible to print texts and entire books faster, cheaper and in greater numbers.
Gutenberg initially printed Latin Bibles with colorful illustrations for distribution
across Europe. When the Protestant Reformation started, the printing press
allowed for the mass publication of Bibles translated into vernacular languages.
This sparked popular interest in theology and contributed to rising literacy
rates throughout Europe.

EFFECTS OF THE
PROTESTANT REFORMATION
Catholic teachings stressed the importance of doing
good deeds and sacraments that depended heavily on
church traditions to earn salvation. However, Luther
argued that Christianity rested solely on the Bible’s
authority and that salvation could only be achieved
by faith alone. In letters and proclamations, Luther
challenged the Pope’s authority and the Catholic
Church’s organization. While these changes transformed
European society, women did not necessarily profit from
these new developments. The male Jesus figure moved
to the center of Protestant faith, and the Virgin Mary
and other female saints lost their iconic status within
the church. Even as literacy and education flourished
across Europe, women’s roles became more defined
by domesticity, marriage and motherhood, roles more
bound to the house than outside of it.

Luther’s translation of the New Testament into
German soon inspired the translation of the Bible
into other languages across the globe. The rise of
the printing press allowed these new volumes to be
quickly produced and distributed. As the Protestant
movement spread, it fractured into a wide array
of competing denominations, such as Calvinists,
Anglicans, Anabaptists and Quakers. Formulated
by French attorney and theologian John Calvin in
the Swiss canton of Geneva, Calvinists espoused
“predestination,” the concept that from the moment
of creation, an omniscient God had predetermined
certain Christians for election to heaven. Calvinists thus
had to be exemplary Christians, not to earn their way
into heaven, but as members of the “divine elect,” there
would naturally be observable signs of their holy status.
Although an extreme faith by the standards of the time,
Calvinism appealed to many “middling sorts” such as
bankers, merchants, doctors, attorneys and publishers
who did not fit neatly into traditional European feudal
society but who craved divine and secular approval of
their accomplishments.

CHAPTER 2 EXPANDING EMPIRES, EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS, 1500-1700

MARTIN LUTHER’S WIFE,
KATHARINA VON BORA
Martin Luther’s wife, Katharina von Bora, is believed
to have been born in 1499 in the German village of
Lippendorf. As a child, she attended a Benedictine
monastery in Brehna in 1504 and later moved to the
Cistercian monastery Marienthron in Nimbschen, near
the German town of Grimma. Interested in the reformist
movement, she secretly asked Luther for help in leaving
the monastery. Katharina escaped with some other
nuns from the convent to Wittenberg, hiding on a food
delivery wagon Luther had sent on Easter Eve, April
4, 1523. Realizing that the nuns would be rejected by
their families, Martin Luther found many of them homes,
husbands and jobs.
Initially, Katherina stayed with the city clerk of Wittenberg,
Philipp Reichenback but eventually ended up living
with the painter Lucas Cranach the Elder and his wife,
Barbara. Katherina received several marriage proposals
but held out hope for an engagement to Luther. Although
worried that pursuing a relationship might impair his
leadership of the Protestant reform movement, Luther
eventually proposed marriage. On June 13, 1525, Martin
Luther married the 15 years younger Katherina von
Bora, setting a precedent for allowing reformist clergy to
marry. The couple moved into the Augusteum, dubbed
the “Black Cloister,” the former dormitory and college of
Augustinian friars studying in Wittenberg. Von Bora took
over the monastery’s administration, oversaw a small
farm associated with it, and ran an on-site hospital.
Martin and Katherina had six children together, of which
only three survived. They also took in four orphans.
When her husband died in 1546, Katherina struggled
financially without his income as a pastor and professor.
Although Luther had named her his heir in his will, it did
not conform with Saxon Law. She was forced to leave
Wittenberg at the outbreak of the Schmalkalden War, a
conflict between Protestant and Catholic nobles from
1546 to 1547. She died in poverty at Torgau in Germany
in 1552 at 53. She was buried at St. Mary’s Church in
Torgau, far away from her husband, Martin Luther.

THE ENGLISH REFORMATION
The marital problems and dynastic ambitions of King
Henry VIII (1491-1547) led to the creation of an
independent Church of England. Increasingly worried
about not having a male heir, Henry wished to divorce
his Spanish Catholic wife, Catherine of Aragon (14851536). Worried about offending Catherine’s nephew
King Charles V of Spain (1500-1558), Pope Clement VII
(1478-1534) refused Henry’s request for an annulment
(similar to a divorce but would mean that in the eyes
of the Catholic Church Henry and Catherine’s marriage
had never happened and he would be free to marry
whoever he liked). Frustrated with the lack of progress,
Henry eventually persuaded the English Parliament to
pass the 1534 Act of Supremacy, which made the King
of England rather than the Pope the head of the English
(Anglican) Church. Henry then had his marriage to
Catherine annulled so he could marry his long-time
favorite Anne Boleyn (1501 or 1507-1536). When
Henry and Anne proved unable to conceive a male heir,
English officials executed her, in May of 1536, on charges
of witchcraft, incest and adultery. Henry would go on to
have another four wives. He and his third wife would
produce a son, Edward VI, who reigned from 1547-

1553. Edward was succeeded by his eldest half-sister Mary
(daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine) who returned
England to the Roman Catholic fold. Mary (b. 1516)
reigned until her death in 1558 when she was replaced
by Henry and Anne’s Anglican daughter Elizabeth, who
would become one of the most successful and longest
reigning (1558-1603) monarchs in English history.
Throughout the 16th century, government-sponsored
Anglicanism became the dominant faith among
English subjects. However, several branches of reform
Protestants also proved popular to the masses. Led
by the reformer John Knox (c. 1514-1572), Scotland
adopted Presbyterianism. Presbyterians emphasized
local churches by rejecting the hierarchy and
especially the power of appointed bishops, a feature
of Anglicanism. Meanwhile, in England, a branch of
strict Calvinists known as Puritans sought to “purify”
the church from features associated with Catholicism,
such as the hierarchy of bishops, Latin liturgies and
the use of sacraments. From the 17th century onward,
immigrants from the British Isles brought Calvinist
ideas to the Americas.

OTHER EARLY PROTESTANT FAITHS
During the 16th century, other new Protestant groups emerged with
religious beliefs that did not easily align with either Lutheranism or
Calvinism. In the German states, Mennonites began to preach that
parishioners were equal to one another as the Christian church
constituted the body of Christ on Earth. Anabaptists likewise rejected
infant baptism, arguing that only adults capable of freely agreeing to
baptism could be cleansed of sin. In the German states, the Mennonites
practiced traditional agrarian lifestyles and spoke a variant of
Alemannic German. In the 1600s and 1700s, many Mennonites and
Amish migrated to Canada and the United States. To this day, Old
Order Mennonites and Amish continue to live conservative lifestyles
and eschew automobiles in favor of horses and carriages.

THE COUNTER-REFORMATION
The Reformation provoked a Catholic CounterReformation. During the Council of Trent (15461563), Catholics reaffirmed their doctrines,
sacraments, practices and the authority of the church.
New emphasis was placed on the education of priests
and their supervision by bishops. Church officials also
created an official list (Index Librorum Prohibitorium)
of heretical books to be burned. In 1540, Pope Paul
III (1468-1549) granted Spanish soldier Ignatius of
Loyola (1491- 1556) the right to organize the Society
of Jesus. Accountable only to the Papacy, the Jesuits
focused on education and spreading the Catholic faith.
By the 1700s, the Society of Jesus became one of the
first global Catholic orders.

RELIGIOUS WARS
AND THEIR OUTCOMES
By 1555 the Peace of Augsburg ended a 10-year civil war
and split the German states into Catholic and Protestant
areas. The rest of Europe likewise fragmented (see
map) along religious lines. Scandinavia became almost
entirely Lutheran. At the same time, Austria, Hungary
and Poland remained Catholic but retained large
Calvinist and Lutheran minorities. Portugal, Spain and
Italy remained solidly Catholic. Russia and southeastern
Europe continued to practice Orthodox Christianity. In
Ottoman-occupied areas such as Romania and Bosnia,

CHAPTER 2 EXPANDING EMPIRES, EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS, 1500-1700

AMERICAS
European arrivals in the New World triggered a
tremendous exchange of crops, diseases, people and
ideas. Beginning in the 1500s, Spanish conquistadors
asserted their will over millions of Aztecs, Mayans and
Incas. Epidemic diseases like smallpox, measles and
influenza decimated local Native American populations.
Following waves of colonists, merchants and priests
attempted to destroy traditional Native American
cultures, or merged them with Iberian Catholic
institutions, customs and ideas. The emerging “castas”
society represented a hybrid of Native American,
African and European peoples and cultures. Facing
continued resistance from Mayans in Central America,
Incas in Peru, Mapuche in Patagonia, and Pueblos
in New Mexico, Spanish officials created systems of
fortified missions such as Santa Fe and San Francisco to

convert and train Native Americans to assume positions
in Spanish colonial society.
While the Spanish conquered large swathes of North
and South America, Portuguese explorers concentrated
on the area of Brazil. With less manpower and resources
to devote to colonization, Portuguese settlers quickly
intermarried with Native Americans. Their descendants
became known as mamelucos in Brazil and mestizos
in Spanish-speaking regions. Both Portuguese and
Spanish colonies profited from large plantation systems,
especially those that focused on sugarcane. The big
agricultural estates were initially run by an encomienda
system that later gave way to the hacienda system. Some
areas were also rich in gold and silver mines.

AFRICA
In the 17th and early 18th centuries, English, French
and Dutch explorers began to colonize parts of the
Americas and the Caribbean, partaking in the transAtlantic slave trade and exploiting people of African
and Native American descent. This led to multiple slave
uprisings, the most successful of which was the Haitian
Revolution (1791-1804) led by Touissant L’Ouverture
(1743-1803), which resulted in the first independent
state in the new world governed by former slaves. By
the early 1800s, a wave of additional revolutions created
sovereign states like Mexico, Honduras, Columbia,
Peru, Venezuela, Argentina and Chile.
The African continent experienced many changes
between the 15th and the 17th centuries. In some
regions of Africa, Europeans only dealt with African
intermediaries and never set foot into the interior.
Africans who lived in coastal areas experienced the
most significant changes. Some of the empires in the
hinterland such as the declining Songhay Empire,
the Hausa city-states, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire
remained more focused on the trans-Saharan trade. In

contrast, certain coastal kingdoms, such as Benin and
Oyo, started to play an essential role in the emerging
Atlantic trade.
A rise in international trade helped create new kingdoms
in the Great Lakes region around Lake Victoria and
Lake Tanganyika. Bunyoro-Kitara emerged as one of
the most important regional powers, ruling over the
kingdoms of Karagwe, Burundi and Buganda. By the
late 18th century, the Kingdom of Buganda and coastal
Swahili City-states likewise became key players in the
Atlantic world. Great Zimbabwe experienced influences
from the Portuguese and the Omani Arabs, whose
trading monopolies intersected in the Indian Ocean.
The Portuguese tried to dominate the East African
ivory and gold trade. They established significant
fortifications in Mozambique and Mombasa while
controlling regional trading hubs such as Paté, Lamu,
Malindi, Pemba, Zanzibar and Kilwa. In the 1660s, the
dominance of the Portuguese in East Africa would be
challenged by not only the Swahili but their Arab allies,
especially the Imamate of Oman (in southeast Arabia).

THE TRANS-ATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE
AND AFRICANS IN THE MAKING OF
THE ATLANTIC WORLD
Beginning in the Early Atlantic Age (1450 – 1640), a
‘third zone’ of commercial encounter sprang up along
the West African coast. Different European nations,
such as the Portuguese, Castilians (Spanish), Dutch,
English and French, began exchanging goods with
African traders and middlemen along the coasts. New
markets for existing commodities started to open,
which initially stimulated domestic trade. These new
markets provided copper and ivory from the Congo
Basin, textiles from Benin, and enslaved people from
western Sudan.

in the Caribbean increased demands for slave labor.
As European merchants began to pay West African
chieftains for increasing numbers of slaves with produce
and manufactured goods, the traditional practice of
carrying goods from one African coastal area to another
began to break down.

The shift in trade away from Central and West Africa
and toward the Atlantic World also brought about
tremendous political changes. Powerful empires such as
the Oyo and Benin began to play important diplomatic
and economic roles in the region. Women rose to
prominent roles in West and Central African kingdoms.
For example, in the Kingdom of Dahomey, women
served as soldiers and administrators. New emerging
states and the development of new trading networks in
West-Central Africa marginalized some of the existing

The rise of the trans-Atlantic slave trade led to the
spread of African religious practices through the
African diaspora. The Yoruba people of present-day
Nigeria were among the largest and the latest groups
forcibly transported to the Americas. Many enslaved
people retained memories of their religious practices
while simultaneously merging such beliefs with
those of other enslaved African groups and elements
of Catholicism. In Cuba, these religious practices
became known as Santeria; in Brazil, they were
referred to as Candomblé.
The name Santeria comes from comparisons some
followers made between Roman Catholic saints
(santos) and the Yoruba deities known as orishas. Many
modern practitioners refer to the religion as “the religion
of the orishas” or the “Lucumi religion.” In Santeria,
we can find many practices such as divination and
spirit possession gleaned from West African religious
traditions. Santeria was initially practiced by enslaved
people and later by people of African descent. Many
exiles fleeing the Cuban Revolution brought the faith to
the United States.

Like Cuba, Brazil represented one of the largest
importers of enslaved Africans. Salvador de Bahia
became one of the centers for the practice of Nagô
Candomblé. Like Santeria, its origins lay in Yoruba
religious practices but also integrated Central Africa
spiritual practices. Also, here, we can again find a
duality of Catholic saints and African deities. After the
downfall of the Oyo Empire and the rise of the Sokoto
Caliphate, many Yoruba were forcefully enslaved and
shipped across the Atlantic at the beginning of the 19th
century. Because their faith resembled an organized
religion, it made it easier to merge with Catholicism. An
organized priesthood, complex religious ceremonies,
and texts and prayers used in divination provided
avenues for religious syncretism on many levels.
Both Santeria and Candomblé are examples of hybrid
and creolized religious systems. On the one hand, they
created something new and contributed to a newly
emerging Afro-Caribbean culture. On the other, the
ritual practices using the Yoruba language continued
to maintain a strong connection to Africa.

SUMMARY
Between 1500-1700 the world underwent tremendous changes. Contact with Europeans rattled the African
continent and led to one of the biggest genocides in world history – the trans-Atlantic slave trade. During this
four-century ordeal, slave traders forcibly transported 15 million Africans to the Americas. Both the political and
economic landscape in West and West-Central Africa was forever altered. Products imported to the African
continent through the Columbian exchange changed the cuisines and diets of people. An emphasis on the trade
in human beings contributed to the downfall of such powerful kingdoms like the Kingdom of Kongo, the rise and
influence of European colonial powers on the African continent, and a change in the power dynamics providing
coastal states with larger political and economic clout than they had previously held.

The Russian Empire’s origins lay in the medieval Slavic
state of Kievan Rus. Kievan Rus occupied most of

In the 13th century, the state, including the princes
of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, remained under the
command of Mongolian control. With the decline of
the Mongol Empire, the princes of the Grand Duchy
of Moscow successfully out-maneuvered other Kievan
Rus princes, increasing their power and prestige.

Ivan III (r. 1462-1505) expanded his control and, by 1480,
was strong enough to declare the autonomy of Moscow
from the Golden Horde. Known by his followers as Ivan
the Great, he and his successors incorporated political,
military and technological ideas from Asia and Europe.
The Muscovites relied on the Boyars (high-ranking
nobles) and the church for support. After the fall of
Byzantium, Russians increasingly viewed themselves as
the protectors of Orthodox Christians both within and
outside their borders.

borderlands in western Russia) and expanded Russia
into Kazan, Astrakhan and the Ural Mountains. Under
Ivan, Russia also made its first forays into Siberia. To
reduce the power of the Boyars, Ivan established a new
service-styled nobility, one which derived its position
and power from supporting rather than challenging the
crown. By his death in 1584, Ivan further strengthened
Russia and the power of the Tsar.
Ivan’s death in 1584 ushered in a period of chaos known
as the Time of Trouble as his relatives struggled over
the imperial throne. Centralized power waned until
Ivan’s nephew, the new Czar Michael (r. 1613-1645), reestablished centralized control, establishing the Romanov
dynasty that would rule Russia until 1917.
Resuming its expansionary push, Russia conquered parts
of Ukraine in 1667 and seized control of Siberia by the
end of the century. The borders of the Russian Empire
now extended to the Pacific. The conquest of Siberia
would be consequential for Russian development as its
natural resources, especially its furs, brought increased
wealth to the Russian state. In 1649, a new code of laws
stipulated that anyone who did not own land would be
considered a serf, which made it clear that landowners
had the right to rule, direct and control the Russian
state and people. The new laws also ended the period of
religious tolerance and ordered all non-Russians to adopt
the Eastern Orthodox faith.

CHINA
China also benefited from the end of Mongol rule. By
1500, the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) had ruled China
for more than 130 years. The rise of the Mings ushered
in a new period of peace that allowed China to flourish.
However, by 1500 problems had begun to beset the
Ming dynasty. A succession of weak and incompetent
emperors, coupled with fiscal, military and bureaucratic
issues, undermined the stability of the Chinese state.
Enthusiastic builders, the Mings constructed a new
capital called Beijing. Built between 1407 and 1420, the
new capital consisted of a series of squares within squares,
each being more restrictive and private than the next. A
palace complex of nearly 10,000 rooms, the Forbidden

City was the most private area. Within these walls,
the emperor and the bureaucracy worked, sometimes
together, others at odds, to run the Chinese state.

MING DYNASTY
Chinese scholar-officials represented the backbone
of the Chinese state and bureaucracy. Unlike Europe,
China had no hereditary aristocracy, nor did its
merchant class become politically significant as in some
European countries. Deriving power and status from
their education and high government office, scholarofficials became the most formidable check on the
absolute power of the emperor. Scholar-officials gained
their place in government by passing rigorous civil
service examinations held at the prefecture, provincial
and capital levels. Quotas ensured that each province
could only send so many worthy candidates to the
capital, ensuring no regional dominance in government.
The prestige associated with being sent to the capital
meant that families who could afford to do so would hire
tutors to give their male children an advantage. Based
mainly on Confucian texts, the examinations could last
for several days. The grueling process of the exams, the
writing of essays, the drafting of mock state papers and
edicts, and commenting on Confucian texts, coupled
with the meager passing rates, ensured that those who
advanced would be adept public servants capable of
administering the Chinese state.
The rise of the Ming dynasty did not end the threat of
another Mongol invasion. Ming rulers deeply respected
and feared the Mongols, especially their fighting abilities.
This encouraged them to expand, rebuild and improve a
series of walls, some very old, to aid in keeping the Mongols
at bay. Earlier walls, often made of rammed earth, were
replaced, buttressed, or built anew with stone and brick.
This increased the overall cost and labor needed to develop
and improve the walls. The walls also had a series of watch
towers and gates to facilitate trade, taxation and security.

GREAT WALL OF CHINA
The earliest origins of the Great Wall of China
belong to the Spring and Autumn period (771476 BCE). During the Qin dynasty (221-206
BCE), Emperor Qin Shi Huang (r. 221-210
BCE) connected some of the various defensive
walls to create a more extensive fortification
to protect his newly founded dynasty from
outside invasion. Subsequent dynasties would
also build new walls. The Great Wall of China
as it stands today largely dates from the Ming
dynasty (1368-1644). Not all of the Wall is
manufactured from stone and brick as natural
hills, mountain ridges and rivers are woven into
the defensive structure. Although parts of the
Wall have disappeared over time (it is estimated
that the total building would equal more than
13,000 miles), today, the best-preserved
section is still more than 5,000 miles in length.

JAPAN
Before the 15th century, Japan held links to Korea and
China but remained primarily isolated from the rest
of the world. The Japanese experienced early Chinese
influence, reflected in paintings and architecture.
Buddhism flourished in Japan to a greater extent than
it ever did in China. In 1550, European seafarers and
merchants brought along the first Jesuits and with them,
Christianity. Converts to Christianity were persecuted
and oppressed, culminating in a mass execution in 1622.
Simultaneously, Japan exhibited extreme xenophobia
that led to complete isolation. The self-imposed isolation
and simultaneous inner peace allowed Japan to flourish

culturally and led to immense economic improvement.
However, over time the military dictatorship turned into
a stagnant bureaucracy. After 200 years, the opening of
Japan was unpreventable. The opening occurred due to
pressure from Western imperial powers in 1858.
One can think of Japan as torn between China’s
influences and later, the Western world. From the sixth
to the 19th century, Japan was utterly under the influence
of Chinese culture. The Japanese made many parts
of Chinese culture, such as the script, administrative
practices, architectural and art styles, and philosophical

and religious systems their own. There were many
instances when Japan turned the historical course
of things. For example, Hideyoshi’s occupation of
Korea at the end of the 16th century contributed to
the weakening of the Ming dynasty in China as well
as the later downfall of Korea. Japan dismantled
ambitious plans of the Portuguese and Spanish in
the region during the 17th century. Japan rose to a
modern superpower after the restoration in 1868,
which led to the stationing of troops in Manchuria
and China. During World War II, Japan played
a significant role as an adversary to the U.S. and
became a very destructive power in China and
Southeast Asia.

ENCOUNTER WITH
EUROPEANS
Initial contact with the Portuguese started in the
1500s. There was an initial interest in the firearms
the Portuguese could provide. Still, there was also
the fear of foreign influences brought about by such
contacts, embodied mainly by Christianity. The
Catholic missionaries, among them Franciscans,
Dominicans and Jesuits were instrumental in
spreading the Christian faith across the Japanese
islands. From the 1500s-1700s, several thousand
Japanese converted to Christianity. At the time
Japanese practiced Shintoism or one of the varieties
of Buddhism. The shogun eventually decided to
expel all foreigners for fear that Christianity would
undermine the legitimacy of the shogunate and
lead to a rebellion among the commoners.

TOKUGAWA SHOGUNATE
The emperor’s political power in Kyoto was relatively
weak. He remained more of a figurehead throughout
the modern period, with samurai controlling the
provinces. During the Warring States or Sengoku
period (1460-1570), warrior nobles known as
daimyo led the provinces. Wars and shifting
alliances during this time led to the establishment

of a federal state known as the shogunate. In 1560, Japan
underwent significant changes. During the next 40
years, military leaders Oda Nobunaga (1534-1582) and
Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536-1598) suppressed uprisings
by the daimyo and united the country. Tokugawa Ieyasu
(1549-1616) established and legitimized the shogunate
government, which lasted 250 years until 1867.

During the Tokugawa shogunate, the Japanese domestic
economy improved particularly in fine wares and
ceramics. Even though situated at the bottom of the
Confucian hierarchy of classes, merchants gained
prestige and recognition, often lending money to
impoverished samurai. Commercial networks started
to gain importance. By experimenting with credit, a

SHINTOISM
Shinto, the way of the gods, is considered the
indigenous religion of Japan. It does not consist of
a unified religious system but is more influenced by
local culture and thus more connected to the territorial
spirits of a specific region. The term Shinto emerged
as a counter term to Butsudo, the way of the Buddha,
after the introduction of Buddhism during the sixth
century. Shinto entails various religious practices and
functions, which are classified into four big groups:
1.
2.
3.
4.

The Shinto of the Emperor
Shinto of sects
Shrine Shinto
Shinto of the masses/people/commoners/
popular Shinto

Shinto does not have a founder or holy scripts, a
doctrine or a confession of faith. In the center of the
religious practice lies kami-veneration. Kami refers
to female and male deities, ancestors, territorial
spirits (spirits of the house, forest or water, etc.),

nature powers (power of life, fertility) and exceptional
nature representations (moon, sun, volcanoes, cave
information, old trees). Central to Shintoism is the belief
that nature has a soul (animism). Regional diverse
customs, festivals and mythology are connected to
the local Shinto practices. Shinto experienced some
changes through cross-cultural encounters with
mainland traditions (ancestor veneration, Chinese
mythology, Taoism, Buddhism).
The deities of Shinto are connected to nature powers,
the elements and plants. They emerged out of the
core of the world and are understood as powers
through which life is created and sustained. Their
venerations are therefore often connected to fertility
ceremonies. The Japanese kami exist and function
in this world. Shintoists do not believe in an afterlife
but are focused on the presence of the here and
now. The roles of humans in the maintenance and
progress of life correlate with the will of the deities/
gods. The afterlife/hereafter is instead portrayed as
a dark, grave-like sphere of dirt and decay. Central
terms such as purity (sei) and fault (tsumi) should not
be interpreted based on an ethical-moral background.
Impurities emerge through contact with blood, death
and decay, and can be removed through purification
rituals (harai, misogi). Actions are not considered
harmful or good, evil is not to be found in a human
being but is caused by external causes. Purification
rites can eliminate the evil.
Over time the Japanese started to build Shinto shrine
houses. Building on the rituals performed in early
agrarian societies, the sacred place contains the
symbols of the shrine deity (shintai), a prayer hall,
a place for sacrifices, a stage for the sacred dance
(kagura), and an administrative building. In Shinto,
there are no official weekly ceremonies. Practitioners
decide the frequency and duration of their shrine
visits, often made for specific requests. The religious
practice in the community is characterized by the
participation in the traditional annual customs, rites
and festivals (matsuri) within a local shrine. The actual
rituals are performed by the priesthood, which include
the calling of the deities, the recitation of the prayers
(nurito), offerings (such as rice, rice wine, dried
seafood and sakaki branches), and the consumption
of the offerings. There is a public part of it too. It
includes a procession during which the kami will be
taken out carrying shrines (mikoshi), traditional dress,
and traditional dance and theatre performances.

In 1600, the Portuguese lost control of the spice islands in
Southeast Asia. To maintain their influence in the spice
trade, Dutch merchants and officials built relationships
with the Muslim Sultanates of Java and Sumatra. The
Dutch East India Company put their headquarters
on the Island of Java, from which they oversaw the
regional trade. The British East India Company left

Ocean and Southeast Asia from which the Portuguese
controlled the spice islands. The region was dominated
by Hinduism and Islam, except for the Philippines,
where Catholicism was practiced. In 1700, Thailand,
Burma and Vietnam dominated parts of Southeast
Asia. Theravada Buddhism ruled supreme in Thailand
and Burma, while the Vietnamese practiced Mahayana
Buddhism. Cambodia had been divided between
Thailand and Vietnam.

SUMMARY
The period 1500-1700 witnessed a consolidation of power in Russia, China, Japan and parts of Southeast
Asia. In each of these areas, local rulers effectively checked or at least reduced Western encroachment. The
Russian Empire vastly expanded its borders, and this would bring it into conflict with other expanding powers
including the Ottoman Empire. The Ming dynasty also centralized power and embarked on ambitious building
projects, including the construction of a new imperial capital and an expansion of the Great Wall of China. The
Qing dynasty, which overthrew the Mings in 1644, increasingly faced the challenges of Western encroachment.
The establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate ushered in a period of relative stability in Japan. The shogunate
introduced a policy of strict isolation as it banned Christianity and severely restricted trade and interaction with
Western nations. This isolation would last until the 1850s. During this period, European influence in Southeast
Asia remained relatively limited. The Spanish Philippines was the only real and significant area where Europeans
wielded any meaningful authority. Over the next two centuries (18th and 19th), each of the powers/regions
covered in this chapter would have to wrestle with Western ideas and the threat of foreign intrusion.

During the period 1500 to 1700, the (Islamic)
Gunpowder Empires used their advanced technology,
tactics and fearsome fighting skills to expand their
borders. Many of these empires followed a similar
trajectory. They often began with a strong and brave
conquering ruler who united disparate people into a
single unit. This leader created a new identity by melding

traditional ideas with ideas
borrowed or adopted from those
they conquered. These empires
helped to spread Islam across many
of the territories they conquered
and the peoples they traded with.
Both the Ottomans and Safavids
relied upon slave soldiers to fill
their armies. The sultan owned
everything and there was not,
like in many other places in the
world, an aristocracy to check the
sultan’s power. Expansion, within
all the empires, caused issues as
the state infrastructure struggled
to administer such vast territories.
Since power was so highly
concentrated in the leader, each
of these states struggled when their leader lacked the
ability to effectively rule. Each empire also experienced
infighting and succession issues which weakened the
state from within. Ultimately, each of these empires
would crumble as the state machinery failed to address
both internal issues and external threats.

OTTOMAN EMPIRE
During its earliest years of development, the armies of
the Ottoman Empire had been successful conquerors.
Armed with a variety of weapons including firearms, the
Ottomans and their army of Janissaries (slave soldiers)
appeared unstoppable. Victories over Syria (1516),
Palestine (1516) and Egypt (1517) gave the Ottomans
control over vast territories. These victories and the
prestige from controlling the holy cities of Islam (Mecca
and Medina) prompted Ottoman rulers to adopt the
title “Protector of the Sacred Places.”

Janissaries were part of a complicated slave system within
the Ottoman Empire called the devshirme system. This
system required Christian communities, especially in the
Balkans, to provide young boys to help staff the Ottoman
state. Converted to Islam, the boys underwent a series of
tests to determine their abilities. The brightest would be
sent to the palace school, where they would be taught
to read and write in various languages and instructed
on how to be a successful government official. Others
would be sent for religious instruction while those who
displayed martial skills would become Janissaries. The

Janissaries were under the direct command of the sultan
and were taught to obey his every order. Once their
training had been completed, these people could wield
tremendous power, becoming generals, viziers (highranking officials), or provincial governors. Because of

The Ottomans tended to rule with a light hand allowing
these groups much independence. Although not
formalized until the 18th century, Ottoman rulers
granted confessional communities much autonomy.
These communities were responsible for governing their
people, providing education, administering law, and
helping the Ottoman state collect taxes. Many Christians
found it much less restrictive to live under Ottoman
rule than their former Christian ones. Beginning in the
15th century, Jews from throughout Europe, including
those expelled from Spain in 1492, would settle in the
Ottoman Empire because of its religious toleration.

The Ottoman court developed a highly regulated
system of concubinage. Sultans were attached to slave
concubines who, though understood to be a spouse,
did not hold the rank of a wife. The son of a concubine
would be raised in the harem (a place of separation
for a man’s wife, unmarried daughters, pre-pubescent
sons and other unmarried female relatives) until about
the age of 12 when they would be given a province or
area to govern under the stewardship of their mother.
Since any son of a sultan could inherit the throne,
competition among children and concubines could be
fierce. This competition could lead to exile, blinding
CHAPTER 4 ISLAMIC EMPIRES: MUGHALS, OTTOMANS, AND SAFAVIDS 1500-1700

or even fratricide. This system of inheritance caused much
infighting and instability.
The Ottoman Empire reached its peak under Sulieman I (r.
1520-1566). In 1526, the Ottomans defeated the Hungarians
at Mohács, killing the king and thousands of his nobles. By
1529 the Ottomans had reached the gates of the Hapsburg
capital of Vienna. Although unsuccessful in taking Vienna,
the Ottomans became significant players in European
politics and generally aligned themselves with the Hapsburg’s
European rival, the House of Bourbon, which held the
French throne.
Called the lawgiver, Sulieman ordered that a new law
code aimed at reforming the state be devised. Seeking to
improve the economy, to root out government corruption,
increase justice and to put an end to bribery of officials,
Suliman’s reforms introduced the idea of balanced budgets,
governmental responsibility, and ended imprisonment
without trial. Ultimately, the reforms of Suliman strengthened
the state and introduced or buttressed existing freedoms
while rationalizing the bureaucracy.

OTTOMAN COFFEEHOUSE
Culture and art flourished during the period of
Ottoman expansion. Likely an import from Yemen,
coffee drinking gave rise to the Ottoman coffeehouse,
a place to meet and drink with friends. People also
went to play games, watch shows and discuss the most
recent political developments. Coffeehouses catered
to different audiences and people. For instance, one
coffeehouse might be primarily patronized by military
men while another by members of the civil service.
Coffeehouses might be best known for different
activities including their poetry, music, debates, or
shows. The popularity of the Ottoman coffeehouse
represents a growing urban and public culture within
the expanding Ottoman Empire.

Sulieman’s son, Selim II (r. 1566-1574), shared few of
his father’s attributes or strengths. Without a strong
sultan, the centralization that had occurred under his
father started to unravel. The Ottomans were beset
by dissatisfaction in the military, naval defeats, crop
failure and inflation. Many of these issues continued to
undermine the Ottoman Empire as successive sultans
failed to deal with the growing issues within their vast
borders.

corps as their primary loyalty. This shift encouraged
the Janissaries to become involved in politics, Ottoman
policy and even succession disputes.

The growth of the Janissaries put increased financial
pressure on the Ottoman state. Desperate to find
money to pay these men, the Ottomans began debasing
their currency. Debasement led to inflation, making
most goods in the empire cost more. The Ottoman

CHAPTER 4 ISLAMIC EMPIRES: MUGHALS, OTTOMANS, AND SAFAVIDS 1500-1700

The once-conquering Ottoman Empire experienced a
series of military setbacks during the 17th century. In
1604, the Ottomans lost territory in Mesopotamia and
the Caucus region to the Persian Safavid Empire. The
Ottomans would also be pushed out of Hungary and
Belgrade. As a geo-political and military power, the
Ottomans were weaker in 1700 than they were in 1500.
The following centuries would prove equally, if not more
so, difficult for the Ottoman state.

SAFAVID EMPIRE
In 1501, Ismail I (1487-1524) conquered large swaths
of Persia establishing the Safavid Empire. Previous to
his gaining control of Persia, much of Iran had been
in the hands of Arab leaders. After a series of military
victories, the 14-year-old Ismail proclaimed himself the
shah (king) of Iran.

Ismail declared that the empire would follow Shia
Islam. To ensure that religion and religious teaching
aligned with the interests of the state, Ismail recruited
religious scholars from outside his borders who had no
community ties and would be loyal to him and the state.
Anxious to increase his army, Ismail actively recruited
Qizilbash (nomadic Turkish Sufis) by granting them
vast grazing lands in return for military support.
Considered the most successful Safavid ruler, Shah
Abbas I’s (r. 1588-1629) reforms helped to strengthen
and solidify the empire. Worried about the growing
power of the Qizilbash, Abbas created a new gunpowder
army funded by the state. Similar to the devshirme
system in the Ottoman Empire, enslaved people, largely
drawn from the Caucasus region, were converted to
Islam, selected to serve a particular branch of the state,
and were expected to be loyal only to the shah. This

not only strengthened the army, but allowed Abbas to
centralize power in the throne, allowing him to carry
out his reforms and to defend and expand the empire.
Abbas drove the Ottomans out of Iraq and Azerbaijan
and checked their power by making alliances with
European powers.
Worried about conspiracy, Shah Abbas ordered the
blinding, murder, or imprisonment of several family
members, including his father, brothers and sons. In
1615, Shah Abbas ordered that his son and heir be
executed after being told that his son had been part of a
conspiracy that sought to remove him from the throne.

Two of his other sons would be blinded. Eventually,
Shah Abbas selected his grandson Sam Mirza (from his
eldest son) to succeed him, which he did (as Shah Safi)
in 1629. The achievements of Shah Abbas in protecting
the Safavids are marred by his disastrous family relations
and the instability brought by constant intrigues and
power struggles.
After Abbas, the Safavid Empire rapidly declined. Abbas’
successors struggled against encroaching powers,
especially the Ottomans and the Uzbeks (a Turkic people
who had conquered much of Central Asia). Tensions
between the Ottomans and Uzbeks had a religious
CHAPTER 4 ISLAMIC EMPIRES: MUGHALS, OTTOMANS, AND SAFAVIDS 1500-1700

component, as both the Ottomans and Uzbeks followed
Sunni Islam. Beset by bad governance, an unstable and
struggling economy, and religious tensions, the Safavid
Empire could no longer hold. In 1722, an Afghan
leader sacked the Safavid capital Isfahan forcing the
abdication of Husayn I (r. 1694-1722). A brief period
of revival occurred under Nadir Shah (r. 1736-1747),
who made the official religion Sunni Islam. Although
Nadar Shah’s impressive conquests, including parts of

India, temporarily saved the Safavids they ultimately
drained the empire’s finances. After the collapse of the
Safavid Empire, the region would be plunged into years
of instability.

Khan (r. 1206 -1227) and Timur (r. 1370-1405), Babur sought
out distant lands to conquer. This sense of adventure and
desire for wealth drew Babur to India. In 1526, at the battle of
Panipat, Babur’s forces defeated the Sultan of Delhi. This led to
the establishment of the Mughal Empire (Persian for Mongol),
an empire that, at its height, extended over one million square
miles and ruled over 100 million people. A warrior poet, Babur
composed an autobiography which recounts his conquests and
tells us of his wide-ranging interests, including swimming,
eating fruit, and the difficulties he had in giving up wine. Under
his son, Humayun (r. 1530-1540 and 1555-1556), the Mughals

lost much of their territories in Afghanistan.
Humayun’s most significant impact may be
his deep appreciation for Persian culture, a
passion he passed on to his children. It fell
to Humayun’s son Akbar (r. 1556-1605) to
restore glory to the Mughal Empire.
Although only thirteen when he ascended to
the throne, Akbar was a shrewd and capable
individual. He was a warrior king, and soon
the independent kingdoms of Northern
India fell under his grasp. To rule over these
extensive regions, add stability and ensure
loyalty, Akbar created a vast government
structure. Showing no bias toward any ethnic
group or faith, Akbar’s government invited
all those with talent to participate. Akbar
understood that by dividing power among
48

CHAPTER 4 ISLAMIC EMPIRES: MUGHALS, OTTOMANS, AND SAFAVIDS 1500-1700

multiple groups would ensure that no one
in the empire could challenge him. Akbar
married Hindu princesses, thus aligning
himself and his government with key Hindu
families. He also eliminated discriminatory
taxes, including the jizya, a tax levied on
non-Muslims. Religious toleration enabled
Akbar to harness all his subjects’ energies
and abilities. Akbar enjoyed learning about
different religions and often invited those of
other faiths to discuss theology.
Akbar’s son and successor, Jahangir (r.
1605-1628), expanded the Mughal Empire
by consolidating Mughal rule in Bengal.
War brought riches and prestige, but
new territories often brought new sets
of difficulties. Jahangir’s son, Shah Jahan
(r. 1628-1658), is best known for the
construction of the Taj Mahal. Shah Jahan’s
son, Aurangzeb (r. 1658-1707), deposed
his father, confining him to a small room.
A devout Muslim, Aurangzeb expanded
the empire, especially in the south. While
Aurangzeb ruled over more territory than
any of his predecessors, his reign marked
the beginning of Mughal decline. He had
over-extended the empire with his costly
wars, and his decision to end the period
of religious tolerance angered many of his
subjects. The Mughals went from being an
empire of toleration to one that tried to
force religious laws onto its people.

died in labor while pregnant with their 14th child, the
Taj Mahal is an example of the sophistication, scale and
grandeur of Mughal architecture. Completed around
1653, the 42-acre complex contained intricate gardens,
a mosque and an ornate guest house. The most famous

building, the ivory-white marble mausoleum, had been
largely completed by 1643. Set in what is today Agra,
Uttar Pradesh, India, it is believed that tens of thousands
of laborers were needed to complete the project. After
Shah Jahan’s death in 1666, his body was interred next
to Mumtaz Mahal in the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal
remains one of the most recognizable buildings in
the world and stands as a lasting reminder of Mughal
wealth, grandeur and power.

SUMMARY
All three of these Muslim empires were more powerful and secure in the 16th century than at the
beginning of the 18th. Each empire struggled to rule the vast lands and the people they had conquered.
They had internal pressures, often from the groups that had helped expand their empire. Conquered
groups also fought back, sapping the attention and resources of the centralized state. As administration
size and costs ballooned, none of these empires had the revenues needed to meet these demands.
External pressures came from other empires that had successfully modernized. By the beginning of
the 18th century, all three Islamic empires faced the realities of decline as each one struggled to
reconcile past successes with current realities.

Age of Reason: The
Scientific Revolution,
Enlightened Thought
and its Impact

Galileo Demonstrates How to Use a Telescope
to the Doge of Venice, 1596
The Age of Enlightenment had its origins in the
Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution. A social,
political, intellectual and philosophical movement
during the 17th and 18th centuries, the Enlightenment
wrestled with the tensions inherent between a scientificdriven world and one that placed human endeavors at

Artist: Johannes Kepler

the center of all things. Whereas the Renaissance placed
humanity more at the center of human thinking, the
Scientific Revolution challenged many long-standing
beliefs and led to the creation of modern evidencebased science. While Enlightenment thought varied in
space and time, some central ideas emerged, including
51

the importance of human progress, individual liberty and the value
of religious tolerance. The printed word was also significant as books,
academic journals, pamphlets and the highly influential Encyclopédie
began to be more widely distributed and discussed.
The Enlightenment undermined much older modes of thought
and political organization. It challenged all absolutes, including the
notion that monarchy was divinely ordained or the best form of
governance. In response, monarchs, including Catherine the Great of
Russia (r. 1762-1796), Frederick the Great of Prussia (r. 1740-1786),
and Joseph II of Austria (Holy Roman Emperor from 1765-1790),
promised enlightened reforms inspiring a variety of 19th-century
political and intellectual movements.

ENCYCLOPÉDIE
Published between 1751 and 1772, the Encyclopédie,
a 28-volume work in the Enlightenment tradition,
showcased new approaches to knowledge, government
and society. Edited by Denis Diderot and later co-edited
with Jean le Rond d’Alembert, the Encyclopédie pushed
for the secularization of knowledge and education,
placed political power with the people, not traditional
powerbrokers, and espoused the notions of natural,
inalienable rights while advocating for less state
intervention in the economy. The text gained attention for
its vast knowledge and willingness to challenge traditional
elites and orthodox thinking. Dedicated to disseminating
new forms of knowledge, contributors spent considerable
time sharing their knowledge and expertise. The largest
contributor, Louis de Jaucourt (1704-1779), wrote more
than 17,000 articles. While any text based on the work
of numerous contributors and more than 70,000 articles
will offer multiple perspectives, it is clear that many of the
contributors to the Encyclopédie desired a new society
based not on tradition but on the Enlightenment values of
rational thought and fair and good government.

influenced and helped engender the French Revolution.
As we shall see, the social and political ramifications of
the Enlightenment helped direct the development of
human history and still impacts much of our thinking
about liberty, legal and universal rights and government.

SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
The Scientific Revolution represented one of the most
significant movements in world history. Not merely
an advancement in technological or industrial science,
the Scientific Revolution represented nothing less
than a transformation of how people perceived the
Much Enlightenment thought concerning religion was
in response to the political and religious violence that
occurred after the Protestant Reformation. Fought over
religious differences and political control of Europe,
The Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648) killed between five
to eight million soldiers and civilians. In the face of
such devastation, Enlightenment thinkers advocated
using reason to achieve religious, social and political
peace. For some Enlightenment thinkers, such as
the Englishman John Locke (1632-1704), this meant
simplifying his faith into the single idea of Jesus as the
redeemer and steadfastly avoiding further discussion
or debate. Frenchman François-Marie Arouet (16941778), better known as Voltaire, argued that all people,
not just fellow Christians, were children of God. Thus,
religious conflict was both pointless and detrimental to
human development. This encouraged Enlightenment
thinkers to call for a reduction in the social and political
power of organized religion and to support the notion
of the separation of church and state.
Enlightenment thought has had a tremendous impact
on theories of government. Many significant figures
involved in the American Revolution were closely
aligned and influenced by Enlightenment ideas. The
Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights are all inspired by Enlightenment thoughts
and aspirations. Enlightenment ideals also inspired,

relationships with God, inspired ordinary Europeans
to think more freely for themselves. Political leaders in
England, Scotland, the Netherlands and France took
steps to protect the rights of inventors and property
holders, helping to create financial incentives for new
scientific discoveries.
Most scholars cite Nicolaus Copernicus’s (14731543) publication of his seminal De Revolutionibus
Orbius Coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly
Spheres) in 1543 as a critical moment in the onset of
the Scientific Revolution. By proving that the Earth
and the other planets revolved around the Sun,
Copernicus upended traditional religious accounts,
which saw the Earth in general and humanity in
physical world and their place within it. Historians particular as the center of the universe. Seventy years
have spent centuries debating why the Scientific later, German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571-1630)

navigation reveal that humans had long been capable
of scientific development. However, early modern
European philosophers and scientists benefitted
from the intersection of several historical trends that
created favorable conditions for the development of
scientific thought. The rediscovery of classical Greek
and Roman knowledge and the importation of Arabic
science during the Renaissance made scientific inquiry
famous throughout European culture.
Furthermore, the loss of 30-60% of Europe’s population
during the Black Death promoted an interest in medical
science and a desire to invest in labor-saving technology
such as looms and water wheels. The abundance of
natural resources like coal and navigable waterways
made Western Europe well-suited for promoting
science and industry. The discovery of the Americas
provided infusions of new capital, crops and ideas,
which stimulated scientific thought. The rise of the
Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation,
which challenged traditional religious dogmas and
stressed the ability of individuals to create personal

development of anesthetics and vaccines.

mathematically predicted planets’ actual routes around
the sun. Galileo Galilei’s (1564-1642) experiments with
the telescope likewise identified Jupiter’s moons, Venus’s
rate of rotation, and Saturn’s rings. Isaac Newton’s
(1643-1727) 1687 Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural
Philosophy) completed this process by postulating the
law of universal attraction, which used mathematics to
account for both gravity on Earth and the movements
of the planets and stars on a cosmic scale.

The Scientific Revolution brought tremendous
developments in diverse scientific fields, including
astronomy, physics, mathematics and medical
science. It also helped usher in a new sensibility in
human philosophy. It promoted the view that the
universe was a rational, orderly place. Once humans
understood the underlying axioms that governed the
natural world, they could apply such principles to
improve the human condition.

These discoveries in mathematics and physics inspired
scholars to analyze the world around them using
increasingly precise criteria. In the 1620s, Francis Bacon
(1561-1626) promoted the concept of empiricism or
the “scientific method,” using a rigorous examination
of observable phenomena and inductive reasoning to
draw generalizations about how the world operates. At
roughly the same time, French scholar René Descartes
(1596-1650) made a critical distinction between
empirical knowledge based on experiences such as
physics and the rational knowledge that rested upon
logical inference, including mathematics.
The Scientific Revolution also changed how medical
professionals, sculptors and artists perceived the human
body. Bucking centuries of Church teachings, Italian
doctor Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) published De
Humani Corporis Fabrica (1543), which depicted the
human body as a mechanical construct that required
proper maintenance. Nearly a century later, English
physician William Harvey (1578-1567) would map

SOCIAL AND POLITICAL
CONSEQUENCES OF THE
ENLIGHTENMENT AND
SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION
The intellectual resources unleashed by the Scientific
Revolution brought a similar transformation in social
and political beliefs. For centuries, Western theologians
and scholars had taught that human nature, mired in
original sin, needed strong governments and laws to
keep it in check. God ordained feudal hierarchies by
determining what social classes humans were born into.
Individuals should not seek to change the natural social
order and instead concentrate on leading virtuous lives
to gain salvation after death.
The Crusades, Renaissance, Columbian Exchange and
Scientific Revolution challenged early modern beliefs.
In the 1600s, Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler argued
that the universe operated by specific, predictable laws.
A century later, John Locke, Charles-Louis de Secondat,
Baron de Montesquieu (1689-1755), François-Marie
d’Arouet (Voltaire) and Jean Jacques Rousseau
similarly insisted that human beings were created
with an innate ability to reason and use education and
science to improve society by overcoming the ignorance
and superstition of past centuries. John Locke’s
arguments that humans possessed natural rights to life,
liberty and property, and constructed governments to
protect such rights, proved a tremendous inspiration
to America’s founding generation. Montesquieu’s
Spirit of the Laws (1750) postulated that mixed
governments, which provided political representation
to different social classes and divided power between
different branches, represented more efficient regimes
than traditional monarchies.
In contrast, the French philosopher Voltaire argued that
although humans had natural rights and rationality, most
were incapable of governing themselves. The best form
of government was, therefore, one run by a benevolent
despot. Perhaps the most expansive thinker of the
Enlightenment, Rousseau argued that governments
derived legitimacy not from divine right or tradition
but the consent of the governed. When humans agreed
to live together in organized communities, they created
a social contract. Rulers whose dictates went against
what the majority in a society wished could therefore
56

be overthrown and replaced by a government more
responsive to the needs of the people.
Enlightenment ideas quickly spread throughout the
salons, university classrooms, pulpits and town squares
of Europe. The theories of Locke, Montesquieu and
Rousseau helped inspire the generation of American
revolutionaries such as Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826),
who authored the Declaration of Independence, and
James Madison (1751-1836) and Alexander Hamilton
(1755 or 1757-1804), who contributed to the creation
of the U.S. Constitution. Enlightenment ideas also
played a role in the outbreak of the Haitian and
French Revolutions. Ironically, although an absolute
despot, Napoleon (1769-1821) helped to spread the
Enlightenment-inspired ideals of fraternity, equality
and liberty throughout his conquest of large swaths of
western and eastern Europe.
Enlightenment ideals also helped to create more
progressive, egalitarian societies throughout Europe
and the Americas. Many Enlightenment thinkers like
Thomas Paine (1737-1809) and Thomas Jefferson
became deists. Although they believed that God had
created the universe and the natural laws that governed

it, deists maintained that humans could use their reason
to promote good in the world around them. Methodist
theologians of the mid-1700s, like John Wesley (17031791) and George Whitefield (1714-1770), began to urge
their congregations to cultivate personal relationships with
God and pursue virtuous lives through their efforts. New
denominations like Baptists promoted adult baptism and that
all people, regardless of social class, were equals in God’s eyes.
The notions of natural rights inspired numerous movements
including the right to vote, the rights of women, and groups
opposed to slavery. In the 1780s, British abolitionists like
William Wilberforce (1759-1833) invoked natural rights
to argue against slavery within the British Empire and the
international slave trade. Mary Wollstonecraft’s (17591797) A Vindication of the Rights of Women (1792) asserted
that women and men enjoyed natural rights. On a more
general level, Enlightenment beliefs that humans could
use rationality and education to improve society led to the
growth of universities, lending libraries, affordable primary
and secondary schools, museums, hospitals and asylums.

By the convening of the Second Continental Congress in May 1775,
hostilities had already commenced between Patriot and British
forces. On June 11, 1776, Congress created a committee of five
including John Adams (1735-1826), Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790),
Thomas Jefferson, Robert R. Livingston (1746-1813) and Roger
Sherman (1721-1793) to draft a formal declaration of independence.
As one of the younger and most erudite member of the committee,
Jefferson authored the initial document. Drawing from the
Enlightenment thought of John Locke, Baron de Montesquieu and

Jean Jacques Rousseau, Jefferson
argued that all people had natural
rights, that the purpose of government
was to protect these rights, and that
governments that usurped the rights
of their citizens could be legitimately
overthrown. The document then went
on to blame British King George III
and his government for restricting
trade stationing British troops in
American cities, suspending elected
colonial governments, declaring martial
law, supporting the Atlantic slave
trade, and setting Native Americans
against colonial settlers. Adopted by
delegates from all thirteen colonies, the
Declaration of Independence was read
aloud from pulpits and in town squares
across the newly created United States.
57

MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT
Born in 1759 to a wealthy farming family, Mary
Wollstonecraft became a successful governess and
social companion. Inspired by Enlightenment thought
and frustrated by the lack of professional options for
women in traditional British society, Wollstonecraft
published her seminal work, A Vindication of the
Rights of Woman: with Stricture on Political and Moral
Subjects, in 1792. Throughout her work, Wollstonecraft
argued that women played a vital role in the health of
the nation and as the educators of young children,
women should be allowed to pursue educations so
as to be able to raise future generations of British
subjects. Furthermore, wives should be treated as
companions of husbands rather than merely spouses.
Wollstonecraft’s daughter Mary Shelley (1797-1851)
would become famous in her own right as the author
of the novel Frankenstein. Generations of women’s
rights advocates would cite A Vindication of the Rights
of Woman as inspiration for their causes.

SUMMARY
Although the Enlightenment enriched the minds and improved the lives of millions, it retained a dark
underside. A faith in rationality and scientific progress allowed for the creation of ever more violent
military weapons used in increasingly bloody wars. Although French Revolutionaries initially created
a republic with a moderate constitution, they later embraced violence and executed people for
challenging the government or having royalist ties. Although the Napoleonic Wars spread Enlightenment
ideas throughout Europe, it did so at the cost of millions of casualties. Furthermore, as the American
Revolution proved, creating a nation based on natural rights did not end the enslavement of millions of
people of African descent or the dispossession of hundreds of Native American tribes.

The Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution and the

understood themselves and the world around them.
They encouraged new ways of thinking, which

forms of government. Enlightenment ideas concerning

and state put pressure on old regimes, many of which
could not or would not respond to these challenges.
These tensions gave birth to the Age of Revolutions, a
momentous historical period where new governments
and countries would be formed. This chapter will deal
with three revolutions: The American Revolution, the
French Revolution and the Haitian Revolution.
59

AMERICAN REVOLUTION
The origins of the American Revolution lie in Britain’s
mercantile and economic expansion in the 18th century
and the intellectual developments that grew out of the
Enlightenment. Under the leadership of Robert Walpole
(PM 1721-1742) and then William Pitt (PM 1766-1768),
British prosperity and the empire itself grew. After a

year of stunning victories known as the Annus Mirabilis
in 1759, the British turned around and eventually won
the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763). Having defeated the
French, the British now held extensive lands in Canada
and east of the Mississippi.

CHAPTER 6 CHALLENGING THE OLD ORDER: AGE OF REVOLUTIONS

The question after the war became how to pay for and
protect these newly acquired territories. The conflict
revolved around a question of governance. While
many at the time, and still do, blame the “tyrant” King
George III, the origins of the Revolution lay in differing
conceptions of parliamentary rule. Since the so-called
glorious revolution of 1688, when James II (1633-1701)
was deposed by the eventual co-monarchs his daughter
Mary (Mary II r. 1689-1694) and her husband William
of Orange (William III r. 1689-1702), the power of
parliament had significantly increased. The British
parliament began to see itself as the supreme governing
body able to levy and pass laws for the whole of the
empire. This, however, was contested in the Thirteen
Colonies, which had their own assemblies. These
assemblies insisted that they should control local affairs
and that no law or tax was valid unless approved by an
American assembly.

Instead of negotiation, the British parliament attempted
to levy new taxes, including the Stamp Act of 1765. With

neither side willing to alter their position, tensions rose,
leading to the Second Continental Congress’s fateful
decision to approve, on July 4, 1776, a declaration of
independence composed by Thomas Jefferson. The war
for control over America had formally begun.
General George Washington (1732-1799) would lead
the American Continental Army. Encouraged by early
victories and eager to antagonize its rival, France with
its large fighting force and navy, entered the war against
Britain. Outmaneuvered, the British admitted defeat,
surrendering to American troops in 1781 at Yorktown.
Two years later, in 1783, the Treaty of Paris recognized
American independence.

After winning the Revolution came the task of creating
a structure for the new nation. Fearful of centralized
power and influenced by the Enlightenment and its
natural rights, Americans developed a new system
of government. Inspired by the ideas of checks and
balances, the government would be divided into three
branches of government. The first would be the office of
the President. An elected President would serve as chief
61

executive, having the power to execute and veto laws
and to serve as head of the armed forces. The second
branch of government would be the legislature, a bicameral body divided into a house of representatives
and a senate. The number of seats in the house of
representatives would be decided based on population,
while each state would have two senators. The third
branch, the judiciary, would be tasked with carrying out
and defending the Constitution.
The promise that an additional bill of rights would be

devised and added to the Constitution was essential
to forming the new government and its structure.
Ten amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, were
added to the Constitution in 1789. Influenced by the
Enlightenment and natural rights, the Bill of Rights
guaranteed freedom of religion, free speech and press,
the right to assembly and petition, the right to bear
arms, trial by jury, due process under the law, protection
against unreasonable searches and arrest, and protected
and expanded property rights. The new government did
not end slavery, as many of these rights were restricted

FRENCH REVOLUTION
to men of European descent.
The causes of the French Revolution lie primarily in
the structure of French society. Since the medieval
period, France, which at the eve of the Revolution had
a population numbering around 27 million, had been
divided into three unequal estates or classes, each with
its own responsibilities and, for the first two estates,
special privileges.

for the rights to use certain infrastructure.
At the top of this pyramid were the king and his family.
Louis XIV (r. 1643-1715) had centralized power at his
palace in Versailles, and this meant that a strong and
vibrant king was needed to keep the state functioning.

The First Estate consisted of the clergy and numbered
some 125,000 people. The Church controlled about onetenth of the land in France. The clergy had special rights,
exemptions, courts and status and were exempted from
paying the main tax called the taille. The clergy were
not a unified class, as those who tended to occupy the
Church’s highest offices were often from or related to
the nobility. At the same time, the parish priests were
almost uniformly poorer and lacked the political and
financial power of those tied to the nobility.
The nobility formed the Second Estate. They comprised
some 350,000 people who controlled about 30 percent
of the land. Like the clergy, the aristocracy had certain
rights, privileges and exemptions. They also held the
highest positions within the state and military. They,
too, were exempt from paying the taille.
The Third Estate was comprised of nearly everyone else.
Although they constituted the bulk of the population,
they only controlled about 40 percent of the land.
Like the clergy, they too were divided as some of their
members were wealthy and educated while most,
upward of 80 percent, were poor peasants. Peasants also Portrait of Louis XIV

CHAPTER 6 CHALLENGING THE OLD ORDER: AGE OF REVOLUTIONS

Not only charged with protecting the nation, the current
King Louis XVI (r. 1774-1792) had to be sensitive to
economic issues, including inflation, wage deflation,
unemployment, and how to service the growing
national debt. Bad harvests, slowing production and
food shortages had exacerbated these problems.
Unable to fix these problems, Louis XVI had no real
choice but to call for a meeting of the Estates-General,
a parliament that had not met since 1614. Each Estate
elected 300 members. In an attempt to demonstrate
flexibility and win popular support, the king ruled that
since it made up a vast majority of the population, the
Third Estate could elect and send 600 members to the
parliament.
The Estates-General convened at the splendid palace
of Versailles on May 5, 1789. Voting had traditionally
occurred by estate. This meant that, effectively, the First
and Second Estates could cancel out the vote of the
Third Estate. Members of the Third Estate wondered
why the King had allowed it to have double the number
of members if the King did not expect voting by head.
All knew that if voting proceeded by head, the agenda
of the Third Estate would dominate as they could count
on votes from sympathetic clergy members and nobles.
When the First Estate refused to alter the voting by
Estate, members of the Third Estate left the parliament,
declared themselves the National Assembly, and began
drafting their own constitution.

of the Bastille

Threatened by a concentration of troops and frustrated
that government members sympathetic to the Third
Estate had been dismissed, Parisians stormed the Bastille,
a royal armory and prison. Known today as Bastille
Day, July 14 is France’s national day of celebration. The
storming of the Bastille signaled a change as members
of the Third Estate rose up all over France to contest the
government and the old regime. Soon much of France
was in the hands of those who wanted change.
As the National Assembly took charge, they began to
abolish the old order, including the rights of landlords
and the exemptions and privileges held by the clergy
and the nobility. The National Assembly would adopt
the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen
(1789), which granted all men equal rights under the law.
It protected free speech and stated that all government
officers would be employed based on talent, not birth.
Some wondered if the Declaration of Man and of the
Citizen also applied to women. Olympe de Gouges
(1748-1793) argued that all citizens should be equal
under the law and was inspired to write her own
Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female
Citizen (1791). The National Assembly did not heed
her demands, and in 1793 she was executed for her
outspoken criticism of the revolutionary government.

As the National Assembly began to reform France it
had to deal with the size, power and popularity of the
Church. The National Assembly decided to seize much
of the Church’s land and put into the service of the state.
Adopted in 1790, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy
made the Church a part of the state as clergy were now
paid by the state and elected by the people. This put the
National Assembly at odds with the Catholic Church,
which still wielded tremendous influence in France.

Angered at the treatment of Louis XVI, Austria and
Prussia proclaimed their willingness to invade France
to place Louis XVI back on the throne. This put pressure
on the revolutionary government. In response to these
threats, the National Assembly voted, in April 1792, to
go to war.

The war further radicalized the public, and in September
1792, a new assembly, known as the National Convention,
officially proclaimed France a republic. Under the sway of

In 1793, France declared war on Britain, Spain and the
Dutch Republic. While trying to keep foreign powers
at bay, the National Convention struggled to suppress
opposition at home, including counterrevolutionaries
who supported the old order. Internally the Convention
was divided between more moderate and radical groups.

as the Mountain) to enter the Convention and arrest 29

now controlled the state.
Faced by threats on all sides, Robespierre and his allies
did all they could to gain control. Central to this was
a new set of programs aimed at rooting out the old
regime’s remaining vestiges, symbols, and traditions. For

instance, the Convention banned female participation
in politics, adopted the decimal system and created a
calendar with a week lasting ten rather than seven days.
To gain control over the economy, Robespierre and his
allies initiated price controls and even told some citizens
what to produce. Anxious to build up loyalty, the
government-sponsored art and entertainment aimed
at producing a sense of patriotism and a commitment
to the republican government. They also initiated a
program of de-Christianization, although this was
dropped in 1794 because of resistance to it especially in
the countryside.
Despite these reforms, Robespierre and his allies still
worried about counter-revolution and that to many
French citizens lacked a real commitment to the
republican cause. This led to a Reign of Terror where
many suspected traitors, individuals with royalist

Known as the Thermidorian Reaction, the execution of
Robespierre announced a new period of more moderate
government. Fearing another Robespierre, eventually
a five-person executive council known as the Directory
would be formed. The Directory ruled until 1799 when a
famous general Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) ended
the Directory, making himself the sole ruler of France.
Born Napoleone Buonaparte in Corsica in 1769,
Napoleon was only a few months old when France
formally annexed the island. Son of a minor Italian

the government were sent to the guillotine.
During the Reign of Terror even ardent revolutionaries,
many of which had been part of the republican
movement from its earliest days but, similar to
Olympe de Gouges, had been critical of Robespierre
and the current government were targeted. Worried
that they too might be convicted of treason, a group of
moderates supported by some radicals moved against
Robespierre and his allies. Convicted of treason,
Robespierre, on July 28 (or 10 Thermidor in the new
calendar), was guillotined.

GUILLOTINE
Employed as a tool for execution using beheading, the
guillotine is most readily associated with France, the French
Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The guillotine derives
its name from Joseph-Ignace Guillotine (1738-1814), a
French physician who, although opposed to the death

opportunities for advancement. Although only 25 years
old, by 1794, Napoleon had been made a brigadier

penalty, suggested, in 1789, the use of the tall, bladed
instrument to make executions less gruesome and more
efficient. Originally called the Louisette, Tobias Schmidt
(1755-1831) and Antoine Louis (1723-1792) had built the
actual prototype. During the Reign of Terror, approximately
17,000 people were guillotined. Last used in France in the
1970s, the last public execution employing the guillotine
occurred in 1939.

Napoleon ensured that the revolution took a decidedly
more conservative and pragmatic turn. Desiring peace
with the Church, Napoleon agreed to a concordat
with the Pope in 1801 that allowed Catholicism to be
recognized as the majority religion of French people,
while the Church agreed not to seek the return of lands
seized during earlier phases of the Revolution. Making
peace with the Church bought much goodwill with
various interest groups in France.

The coup established Napoleon as the consul of
France. The consul had complete power over the
executive branch of the government and, with the
army’s support, could also influence the legislature. Napoleon set about reforming the state. One of his most

As Napoleon conquered new lands, this Civil Code
would be exported, bringing a new uniformity to
Europe. Meritocracy, republicanism and civil equality
(largely restricted to men) would be promoted in these
conquered territories, which would have a lasting
impact on Europe and its development.

One difficulty for Napoleon and his plans was the
strength of the British navy. The British had previously
defeated France and its allies, and its victory at Trafalgar
in 1805 secured British dominance of the seas. Unable
to attack England directly, Napoleon devised the
Continental System. A form of economic warfare, the
Continental System sought to prevent British goods
from entering the continent. France’s allies disliked it as
it led to shortages and drove up the costs of goods.

as, instead of engaging in a set battle, the Russians
opted for a tactical retreat. They burned their crops and
villages as they withdrew further and further into Russia,
refusing to fight Napoleon. Napoleon pressed on under

defend their capital Moscow: They did not. Moscow,
too was set ablaze. Having “conquered” the capital in

On 18 June 1815, Napoleon met a combined British,
Prussian and Dutch army led by the Duke of Wellington
(1769-1852). Wellington defeated Napoleon; this time,
he was exiled to Saint Helena, an island in the South
Atlantic. Napoleon would remain on the island until
his death in 1821. Although Napoleon had died, the
French state, the people and those he had conquered
would have to wrestle with the legacy of Napoleon and
the legal and political frameworks he constructed. At
the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815), delegates redrew
the map of Europe, creating what they hoped would be
a balance of power that would prevent another nation
from dominating Europe and European politics.

free people of color (which consisted of formerly
enslaved blacks and people of mixed white and black
ancestry). Society was highly stratified both between
and within these groups. For instance, the 40,000 whites
were divided into two overarching groups: the planters,
lawyers and wealthy merchants, known as the grand
blancs; and poor whites known as petits blancs.

Considered the most profitable colony in the world,
Saint-Domingue produced nearly half the world’s
sugar and coffee. The island’s population comprised
approximately 500,000 slaves, 60 percent of whom had
been born in Africa; 40,000 whites and about 30,000

As a colony of France, different groups in SaintDomingue had to consider and confront what the
French Revolution and its ideals meant for them.
The conclusions reached by different groups in the
colony exacerbated rather than remedied tensions. For

the petits blancs, the French Revolution meant equality
with wealthy landowners, a greater political say and
equal economic opportunity. The grand blancs did not
interpret it this way. Instead, for them, the Revolution
meant greater political and economic freedom from
France. They believed that the Revolution’s focus on
meritocracy meant that they, as the educated class,
would naturally be best placed to run the colony and
could shape it to best suit their own interests. For free
people of color the Revolution’s focus on fraternity and
citizenship meant that they should be given full equality
under the law. The petits and grand blancs opposed such
a development. For the slaves, the Revolution meant an
end to slavery and the slave system.
Triggered partly by a rumor that the French king had
already abolished slavery in 1791, slaves across the
colony burned plantations and killed hundreds of

whites and mixed-race individuals. Many of the slaves
had been born in Africa and had considerable military
experience. Throughout the colony, factions of whites,
free people of color and slaves all fought one another
for control. The British and Spanish eventually entered
the conflict, hoping to claim the colony for themselves.
Under the leadership of the former slave, Toussaint
Louverture (1743-1803) slaves would acquire the upper
hand. He and his successor Jean Jacques Dessalines
(1758-1806) gained control of the colony. They fought
off the Europeans, including an army under the direction
of Napoleon’s brother-in-law, creating, on January 1,
1804, a newly independent nation called Haiti. Only
the second independent nation in the Americas, the
fact that former slaves were now in charge inspired
repressed people across the globe, including those still
in bondage.

HAITIAN INDEPENDENCE

Traité avec Haïti

The devastation, the legacy of racism and the plantation
system, coupled with an unstable government prone to
authoritarianism, made it difficult for the new nation to
prosper. Given these issues, Haiti became the poorest
nation in the Western world. The formation of an
independent Haiti contributed to the growth of slavery
elsewhere. Cuba, for instance, significantly increased its
production of sugar, whereas the Louisiana purchase,
spurred in part by Napoleon’s loss of Saint Domingue,
gave rise to new areas in the United States that exploited
slave labor.

One of the new nation’s many challenges was getting
the international community to recognize Haiti as an
independent and equal nation. Most importantly, Haiti
needed France to recognize its independence. Until
it did, there was always the chance that France would
try and reconquer its lost territory. France continued
to ignore requests for recognition believing it was
entitled to compensation for the financial costs of
the Haitian Revolution. Ultimately, France demanded
an indemnity payment of 150 million francs in return
for France’s recognition of Haitian independence.
To strengthen these demands, in July 1825, French
King Charles X (1757-1836) sent warships to Haiti
as a show of force. Having little choice, Haitian
President Jean-Pierre Boyer (1776-1850) agreed to
the 150 million francs indemnity. This cost (reduced
to 90 million francs in 1838) severely undermined
the new nation, which had to take on a series of
loans to try and meet the imposed repayments.
The debt and the associated interest payments
severely undermined Haitian independence and
made economic development and investment
nearly impossible, as a high percentage of Haitian
GDP was spent on servicing the debt. This led to
under-investment in infrastructure and the domestic
economy and has contributed significantly to the
political and economic instability that has impacted
Haitians since independence.  

American colonies featured a decentralized imperial
government, considerable regional political autonomy,
a sizeable middling sort of attorneys, printers and
other professionals, a preoccupation with private
property, written contracts and the exclusion of most
Native Americans from colonial society. However, the
colonies of Nueva España sported top-down imperial
governance, a ruling gentry of landholders, soldiers and
church officials, an emphasis on personal relationships
and multicultural societies that included large numbers
of Native Americans and African Americans.

attempt by Napoleon Bonaparte to install his brother on
the Spanish throne led to a power struggle. Unwilling
to submit to a French ruler, Spanish officials in South
America created several juntas to govern the colonies.

When Madrid attempted to reassume its control over
its American colonies in 1808, several juntas declared
their independence. In 1811, wealthy creole Simón
Bolívar (1783-1830) launched a bloody eleven-year
independence movement in Venezuela. To promote

Bolívar’s war for independence inspired revolutionaries
to the south. In 1816, Spanish military officer turned
revolutionary José de San Martín (1778-1850) liberated
Argentina. The following year he and his soldiers
pushed Spanish forces out of Chile. In 1821, Bolívar
and San Martín met in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where they
planned a campaign against Spanish forces entrenched
in the Peruvian Andes.

In 1824, Mexican officials gathered together in
Mexico City to create the nation’s first written
Constitution. Modeled on the U.S. Constitution
and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man
and of the Citizen, the Mexican Constitution
called for a federal government with a separation
of powers, a system of checks and balances,
and provincial assemblies with considerable
autonomy. However, the Mexican Constitution
differed from its American counterpart in several
ways. First, rather than providing a separation
of church and state, the Mexican Constitution
declared Roman Catholicism to be the official
state religion of the country. Second, the
Mexican Constitution abolished slavery and
provided equal rights for all minorities. Texas
revolutionaries cited the suspension of the
Mexican Constitution in 1836 as a key reason
for declaring their independence from Mexico.

No one knows how the two men reached
an agreement, but San Martín left his army
for Bolívar to command. Soon after, San
Martín sailed for Europe, dying almost
forgotten on French soil in 1850. Bolívar
followed the Spaniards into the heights of
the Andes. His forces defeated the Spanish
army at the Battle of Ayacucho in 1824,
which was the war’s last major battle for
independence.
In Brazil, independence took a different
turn. When Napoleon’s armies entered
Portugal in 1807, the royal family
escaped to Brazil, its largest colony.
For the next 14 years, it would be the
center of the Portuguese empire. When
Napoleon was defeated, the people
of Brazil wanted their independence.
In 1822, 8,000 creoles successfully
petitioned the restored Portuguese
government to become an independent
nation with Crown Prince Pedro (17981834) as its head.

BATTLE OF AYACUCHO
The Battle of Ayacucho, fought on December 9, 1824,
represented the final major battle in the Spanish American War
for Independence. In 1821, a revolutionary army led by Simón
Bolívar invaded Spanish-occupied Peru. Three years later, a
large Spanish army of 9,000 soldiers remained embedded in the
Peruvian Andes. Leading an army of 6,000 soldiers representing
provinces stretching from Columbia to Argentina, General
Antonio José de Sucre (1795-1830) launched a devastating
cavalry charge against extensive Spanish artillery. Capturing the
Peruvian Viceroy and his officers, Sucre’s victory represented
the defeat of Spain’s last large army in South America.

SUMMARY
The impact of the American, French and Haitian Revolutions and what they meant then and mean to us
today are still widely debated. One aspect about these revolutions is certain: they still influence much of
how humanity views and understands the world and continue to shape our conceptions of liberty, equality
and freedom. The Haitian Revolution interfered with Napoleon’s plan to establish a French Empire across
the Atlantic world. The Louisiana Purchase extended slavery in the United States. It also blocked slave
holding empires such as France and Britain from expansion, moving them closer to the abolition of the
trans-Atlantic slave trade. The French abolished the slave trade in 1815, followed by the abolition of
slavery in 1845. The British abolished the slave trade in 1807 and slavery in 1833. In Latin America, this
period of revolutions was marked by violence and turmoil. Inspired by the America, French and Haitian
Revolutions, rebellions against the Spanish and Portuguese led to the establishment of independent
nations. Following these revolutions, each of the new countries would have to establish a new framework
for governance as they attempted to create a new prosperous and independent nation.

Revolution, Workers and
a New Economic Order

The Industrial Revolution began in earnest during
the latter half of the 19th century. It is one of the
most defining features of world history as few
developments so definitely separated Europe and
eventually North America from the rest of the world.
The productive capacities, technological innovations
and the power that came from harnessing energy in
new ways allowed Europeans to distance themselves
from the rest of the world.

The origins of the Industrial Revolution began with the
agricultural revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries.
The agricultural revolution can be characterized as
a series of efforts, reforms and experiments aimed at
creating and eventually succeeding at producing a more
stable and plentiful supply of food.
Investment in infrastructure and innovation drove the
agricultural revolution forward. In the low countries,

farmers, landlords and local governments invested in
new dykes and devised more effective ways to drain the
land, thereby increasing the amount of land that could
be farmed. In other parts of Europe, the enclosure
movement began when landlords started restricting
access to their lands by walling off their properties. By
having complete control over their crops, landlords
could more effectively manage the harvest. No longer
were the decisions made communally about what crops
to plant, as the property owner now made the decision
and kept the whole of the profits.

including waterways and its road system, had a surplus
of coal and iron ore, and profited from the increased
farm yield.

Textile production became the first industry to be truly
revolutionized by the Industrial Revolution. In Britain,
many families, especially in the winter, wove or spun
thread to make ends meet. Known as the putting-out
system, merchants would go to the houses of families
who would then either spin fabrics into thread or take
thread and weave it into a finished product. This was
a time consuming, labor-intensive process. Although
The Industrial Revolution began in Britain. Britain families that spun may have owned the machinery, it
would be the leading industrial power until the late was increasingly common that both the fabrics and the
19th century when other powers (notably Prussia and machines used to create the product were owned by a
America) would equal and eventually surpass British merchant. This normalized much of the economies of
industrial capacity. Britain had many advantages, factory work as in a factory, workers sold their labor but

Although labor costs were cheap, once demand rose,
there was no real way to increase production. While
higher wages might encourage more families to spin, it
could not really increase the production of those already
producing for the system. As demand rapidly increased,
new solutions were sought to solve the inability to meet
domestic and international demand for British textiles.
By the mid-18th century, new innovations and
inventions solved some of the production issues. The
invention of the spinning jenny was important in
increasing production, a machine that allowed for, at
first, 16 spindles of thread to be spun at once. By the
end of the century, over 100 spindles could be operated
at once. This allowed those who spun thread to vastly
increase their productive output and provided weavers
with enough thread to start to meet the outsized demand
for finished textiles.
The Industrial Revolution was a period of incredible
innovation as new inventions dramatically increased
production. Inventions such as the water frame replaced
the spinning jenny by offering a more consistent output
and a better product. Horses had first powered the water
frame, but falling water proved so much more reliable.

Although water was and remains a reliable and effective
form of energy (for instance, hydroelectric plants), the
innovation that really transformed England and directed
the growth of the Industrial Revolution was the steam
engine. Not reliant upon naturally produced energy
like wind or water (what we today might call renewable
energy), the burning of coal allowed for factories to be
set up anywhere, which enabled industrial capacity to
be placed closer to transport systems and the consumer.
By improving on a previous design, James Watt (17361819) created a steam engine that was much more
productive and reliable. Having patented the steam
engine in 1769, the engine’s initial impact was rather
muted. It was not until the 19th century, after the steam
engine was modified to power cotton mills, that Watt’s
invention really began to change the world. Once it
proved its industrial uses, the steam engine became
the backbone of British industry. It also changed
transportation as it would be applied to ships and
eventually led to the development of steam-powered
railways. The steam engine spurred other innovation,
especially in the production of iron which allowed
the British to produce a stronger, more malleable and
affordable iron that could be deployed in the building of
machines and rail lines.

The Industrial Revolution led to a social revolution
as people flocked to urban areas in search of better
economic prospects. This led to an explosion in the
number of cities and the number of people who now
counted themselves among the growing population
of city dwellers. This resulted in the development of
a distinct urban culture exacerbating the differences
between the countryside and cities. Within the cities
themselves, it created new classes of citizens and
subjects that experienced the Industrial Revolution and
the factory system in widely different ways.

had to work long hours and were dependent upon the
factory owner to provide work, and through the threat
of dismissal. By having workers only complete a single
task over and over, factory owners effectively deskilled
their workers, which left them with few skills or options.
Within a generation or so, few among the laboring poor
remembered the old ways as the factory system became
normalized. The Industrial Revolution was not simply
a technological or economic change but a tremendous
social one that remade society’s fabric by changing
people’s relationship to work.

The lowest class and by far the most numerous were
the workers themselves. The first workers to arrive in
the factory needed to be taught the factory system.
Accustomed to working in the country, where seasons
dictated the pace and type of work, rural workers had
their own rhythm. For them, once a task was finished,
it was done, and they could enjoy some rest, relaxation,
or socialize. Factory owners wanted to teach these
workers that in a factory, the work is never complete
and as such, workers needed to constantly labor. They
did this by disciplining the worker (either physically
or through fines), by low pay, which meant workers

Above the industrial workers were the artisans, a class of
skilled laborers that could demand more money for their
work than the unskilled labor that filled the factories.
Some of the occupations held by artisans included
cabinetmakers, carpenters, printers and smiths. This
class could be further divided into those who sold their
skills and labor (wage-earners) and those who owned
or rented their workshop. For the latter, many had
their shop in or next to their home, which meant that
there was little division between home life and work as
customers could come at any time expecting service.

Great Britain, had a decidedly conservative turn, with
those in power arguing that political change, or at least
rapid political change, was dangerous and pointed to the
French Revolution and the years of war as an example.
For nearly 20 years, while the economy in Great Britain
was rapidly developing, the political elite sought to keep
the political situation from changing by limiting who
could participate in national and local politics.

The middle class comprised merchants, managers and
other professional people. These people made their living
through capital and, as such, usually sought an ending
of traditional privileges held by the aristocracy, desiring
a society that would be governed by meritocracy. They
also pushed for the right to vote so that they could better
participate in local and national politics and have a larger
say in decision-making.
The top of the social pyramid in most countries
remained the traditional elite. This might include
nobility, high-ranking church officials, wealthy
merchants, industrialists and financiers. After the
defeat of Napoleon, many places in Europe, including

The middle class benefitted significantly from the
Industrial Revolution and the subsequent urbanization
of Europe. Their growing strength across the 18th
and especially 19th century allowed them to push for
reforms that ultimately would facilitate their inclusion
in the political process in much of Europe. Some of
them might be so successful that they joined the upper
classes—those who often copied the aristocracy’s
pastimes, fashions and manners.
For unskilled labor in the cities, the Industrial
Revolution offered little benefit. The pay was poor, and
the long hours and accommodations were terrible. The
factories of 19th century Europe were awful places
where workers were treated poorly with little care for
their health, happiness or safety. Workers worked long,

grueling shifts (sometimes upward of 18 hours a day),
doing backbreaking tedious work such as shoveling coal,
and would be paid very little for this labor. Workers had
few rights, and there was no worker’s compensation,
pension plans or unions. An employee injured on the
job that could no longer work was “let go” and forced
out onto the street with no real prospects of finding any
other employment. It was a cruel system that maximized
the profits for the factory owner, who had absolute
control over his workforce. Worked to the bone, having
no fundamental skills or the chance to develop them,
workers labored until they died. The deskilling and
the complete control over their life meant that workers
were an exploited class who primarily produced wealth
for others. At the same time, their salaries were barely
enough to survive on.
The Industrial Revolution not only changed society but
heavily influenced approaches to production, work and
capital. Such shifts engendered massive social changes
as people increasingly viewed individuals as the central
social unit rather than the community or even the
family. Individualism, as some have called it, would, in
the West, be synonymous with modernity.

CRITIQUES OF
INDUSTRIALIZATION
Factory conditions were dangerous and unhealthy,
and the poor pay meant that the whole family needed
to work for wages. Children as young as seven or eight
could be found next to their parents toiling for little
pay. For these children, there was little escape, for they
had little or no education, knew little of life outside
the factory, and by the time they hit their 20s, many
were completely worn out. Working 12 to 14 hours a
day, usually six days a week, they lacked the energy
and time to apply themselves to anything else, even if
they wanted to. These workers toiled until they died or
were discarded when they were no longer productive,
scratching a living by begging or petty crime. The
system saw and treated workers as disposable.

Published from 18451848

A worker-run newspaper published from 1845-1848, The
Voice of Industry provides insights into the perspectives
and opinions of actual workers during the height of the
Industrial Revolution in America. Founded in Fitchburg,
Massachusetts, the paper moved to Lowell, where it
became associated with women workers, especially
the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association, which
many consider to be the first union for working women.
The paper demonstrated the social and economic
dislocation wrought by the factory system and how
workers were now forced to sell their labor rather than,

like in the past, sell the actual fruits of their labor. This
seemed, to them, to undermine the American spirit
of freedom and independence. Contributors worried
that profit was beginning to shape all relationships and
came to dominate, direct and define American politics.
Many contributors understood that the factory system
would not end, and focused their energy and attention
on improving workers’ lives. To this end, The Voice of
Industry supported numerous initiatives, including
improving working conditions, better pay, and limiting
the workday to 10 hours.

Industrial by-products, waste from the tanneries,
sewage and horse manure all mixed to make the
cities a pungent and unhealthy place. The increase in
population only worsened the problems as industrial
workers lived in poorly constructed rowhouses that left
little room for natural light. Given the poor pay, most
families could only afford to rent a single room in a
crowded house. Life was hard and unhealthy, and for
many, there appeared little chance to escape.
The terrible conditions inspired demands for reform.
One group, the socialists, wanted to replace the
capitalist system with what they believed would be a
more equitable distribution of property and profits.

This, they argued, would lead to improvements in
working conditions and pay. For instance, Frenchman
Charles Fourier (1772-1837) called for the creation of
self-sustaining industrial communities in which jobs
were distributed based on temperament and ability. He
believed the highest paid should be individuals who did
dangerous or undesirable work. Robert Owen (17711858) created new industrial communities dedicated
to improving working conditions at New Lanark,
Scotland, and Indiana, U.S.A., where he established
New Harmony. While the success of these operations
continues to be debated, Owen demonstrated, at least in
Scotland, that one could run a successful business while
better treating, paying and educating workers.

CHAPTER 7 REMAKING THE WORLD: THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, WORKERS, AND A NEW ECONOMIC ORDER

The most famous social reformer is the
German academic Karl Marx (1818-1883).
Marx realized that a more equitable society
could not be created as long as people
subscribed to the notion of differentiated
compensation. People who subscribe to
this model are called capitalists and see
money as the main reward for intelligence
and hard work. Marx believed that genuine,
long-lasting improvement could not be
achieved until capitalism was destroyed.
Born in Germany in 1818 to a relatively
prosperous family that held liberal and
reformist views, Marx, in the 1840s, would
meet his lifelong friend and supporter
Friedrich Engels who had recently
completed The History of the English
Working Classes. Engels convinced Marx
that the working class was the key to
history. From this point forward, Marx
dedicated his life to the working class and
universal change.

The factory system encouraged Marx to consider the
relationship between workers and capital, leading him
to conclude that one of the most defining factors in
an individual’s life is their relationship to the means of
production. Marx determined that there were only two
classes those who owned the means of production, which
he called the bourgeoisie, and those who did not and
sold their labor, known as the proletariat. For Marx, this
meant that you are either someone who exploits others
by profiting off their labor or you are exploited: There is
no middle ground.
Marx believed that all institutions in a capitalist society
–government, media, religion and education–served the
capitalist class’s interests. These institutions tried to keep
the workers down and trick them into believing that their
lives and labor were free when they were stripped of their
individuality and ability to sell their labor freely.
Marx concluded that the history of the world had been
largely shaped by two classes: those who own the means
of production, and the workers. Marx argued that the
movement of history from one historical era to another
is based upon the conflict that occurs between these two
groups. Marx believed that just as capitalism replaced
feudalism, capitalism would be replaced by socialism.
Eventually socialism would be replaced by a stateless,

classless society known as communism. Communism
would spread to every corner of the globe and would be
the final step in human development. Marx stated that
the end of capitalism would begin in the West as they
had the most highly developed capitalist economies.
Marx believed that workers would eventually be pushed
to a stage of near-total mechanization and automation,
which would cause increasing dissatisfaction and
help them realize that they are being manipulated in
a rigged system. Developing what Marx called a class
consciousness, the oppressed workers would “unite”
to overthrow the bourgeoisie. This would be a violent
process, as Marx believed that the capitalist class would
not relinquish their privileged position without a fight.

This violent revolution would give birth to socialism.
In this new socialist state, ownership of the means of
production would be collective. The fundamental goal
of the state would not be to encourage personal profit
but to improve the welfare of all workers who would
share in society’s resources and wealth. But socialism,
too, would give way. Eventually, socialism would be
transformed into communism, an idealized state
without the need for government, as all people would
live in harmony. Since all members of society would
relate to the means of production on equal footing,
there would be no classes or division of labor as each
person would contribute to the best of their abilities.
There would be no specialization as specialization leads
to the formation of hierarchy and class distinction.
Communism would create an enduring classless
society. There would be no more fundamental changes
in the government for government itself would no
longer be needed.

Marx asserted that revolution was the only way to create
a communist state. One could not elect a left-leaning
or socialist government and expect to break the chains
of capitalism. It did not matter whether you desired
communism (Marx believed most workers would) or Marx and his ideas have had a tremendous impact on

of the world’s population lived under a government
that called itself Marxist. Although he would never
have agreed with the strong state policies that have
characterized communist governments, Marxism has
had a tremendous impact of the world. Marx has given
the world an ideology that (although yet to be applied
in true Marxist fashion) is a powerful tool in fighting
oppression by offering a way for the oppressed to voice
their struggles and a method for organizing resistance.
Workers’ calls for reform were eventually heard.
Whether driven by humanitarian concerns,
environmental considerations, or worries over national
decline as men from the factory were judged too worn
out to go to war, fear of a worker-led revolution or other
factors; eventually, politicians voted for reform. In 1833,
the English parliament passed the Factory Act, which
made the minimum age for employment 9 years old and
limited the working day for those children from 13 to 18
to 12-hour days. For children over nine but not yet 13,
the workday was capped at eight hours. In the following
decade, the work week for women and children would
be limited to 58 hours.

INDUSTRIALIZATION IN THE
UNITED STATES
In 1783, the United States emerged from the American
Revolution as an overwhelmingly rural nation. Yet in
just a century, the nation would become one of the
world’s most advanced industrial nations. After World
War II, the United States became the strongest and most
productive in world history, a distinction it continues
to hold.
British law prevented American subjects from creating
their own factories during the colonial period. A few
daring merchants experimented with “putting out” or
“cottage industry” systems whereby they hired different
groups of artisans to make machine parts (such as gun
barrels, gun stocks, ramrods, bullets, shot and powder).
Other craftsmen would then combine these parts into a
final product.

American merchants and industrialists borrowed
copiously from European precedents throughout the
19th century while making their own innovations. In
The efforts of workers, reformers and politicians who the 1780s, New England mechanic and industrialist

inland water of the United States, facilitating the settlement
of the western frontier and America’s commercial expansion
worldwide.
In 1837, Yale-trained Massachusetts inventor and artist
Samuel F. B. Morse (1791-1872) obtained a patent for his
“American Recording Electro-Magnetic Telegraph.” Morse’s
invention provided an inexpensive single-wire method of
carrying electromagnetic current over extended distances.
He also created an alphabet based on long and short
telegraph signals. In time this “Morse Code” would become
the international language of the telegraph, allowing for the
reliable, instantaneous transmission of news and information
across the nation.
Borrowing from British precedents, New England
industrialist Francis Cabot Lowell (1775-1817) created the
first textile mill in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1814. To help
sell the idea of industrialization to skeptical New England
patriarchs, Lowell suggested that young women between the
ages of 15-35 staff his factories.

Francis Cabot Lowell’s plan to use young women from New England
farming families to staff his textile mills proved a bold experiment
in the 1830s. Dominated by large, religiously conservative landowning families, Massachusetts political leaders remained wary
of industrialization. They acknowledged Britain’s rapid industrial
success but lamented the damage such success had wrought
among Britain’s poor working classes. However, Lowell argued that
by hiring young women to work in his factories for a set number of
years, he would provide his young charges with not just wages but
job skills, work experience, educational opportunities, room and
board, proper chaperoning and religious instruction. A portion of
their salaries would be sent home, helping to sustain their family’s
farms. They would return home poised to become hard-working,
sensible wives and mothers. In this regard, industrialization would
support rather than endanger traditional New England family values.
However, in reality, Lowell women worked long hours in dangerous
conditions. To be specific, many did gain crucial workplace skills
and a sense of working-class solidarity. For instance, Lowell
women participated in one of the first labor strikes for higher
wages. However, Lowell factory managers replaced them with poor
Irish and German factory laborers. By training such immigrants to
perform simple industrial tasks, factory owners could easily replace
troublesome or rebellious workers. Furthermore, unlike the Lowell
girl system, factory owners felt no compulsion to house, feed or
educate their immigrant labor forces.

One of Lowell’s factory employees was a young
inventor and mechanic named Elias Howe (1819-1867).
Following the Panic of 1837 (a financial crisis that
led to a depression), Howe began to experiment with
creating a mechanical sewing machine. In 1846, he
secured a patent for a lockstitch sewing machine that
used a steam-powered shuttle to feed garments into
an automatic needle and thread processor. Faced with
competition from other industrialists like Isaac Singer
(1811-1875), Howe defended his invention in court.
By the American Civil War, the sewing machine had
transformed the clothing industry across the United
States, allowing for the creation of mass-produced,
high-quality garments which allowed working class and
middling-sort Americans to adopt the refined tastes of
the nation’s elites.
The U.S. Civil War represented a watershed moment
in the history of American industrialization. By the
1860s, 90% of America’s industrial and financial
centers existed in the northern states. Thousands of
new factories sprang up overnight to meet the federal
government’s incessant demand for weapons, uniforms,
telegraphs and warships. The north’s industrial output
90

played a crucial role in the eventual northern victory
as Union forces outpaced the ability of the south to
manufacture or import its wartime material. Following
the outbreak of peace in 1865, many of these factories
were recalibrated for civilian use.
In 1869, corporate leaders of the Central Pacific and
Union Pacific Railroads and government officials
gathered in Promontory Point, Utah, to drive a golden
spike into a rail line. The act symbolized the uniting of
the first transcontinental railroad, which allowed for
the rapid settlement of the American west. By building
railroad lines through tribal lands and shooting buffalo
from railroad cars, Anglo-American settlers brought
thousands of Native Americans to the edge of starvation.
They accelerated the displacements of dozens of tribes
onto reservation land.
Throughout the Gilded Age, a new class of American
entrepreneurs emerged on the scene. In 1872, Scottishborn industrialist Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919)
witnessed “Bessemer steal” production in England.
Pioneered by British inventor Henry Bessemer (18131898), the “Bessemer process” called for the injection

of oxygen into molten metal to burn off impurities and
thus create high-quality steel. In 1892, Carnegie started
the U.S. Steel Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
and soon came to dominate the fledgling American steel
industry. He pioneered vertical development, buying
up mines for extracting ore, mills for processing it, and
railroads to distribute final goods to markets. One of

America’s first billionaires, Carnegie championed the
cause of self-improvement. He funded the creation
of lending libraries across the United States (many of
which remain in operation today). He poured funds
into institutions of higher learning, such as CarnegieMellon University.

Oil magnate John D. Rockefeller (1839-1937) proved
an interesting contrast to Carnegie. Originally a
commission merchant and salesman, Rockefeller
created an oil refining business in the 1860s. Buying
out several competitors, Rockefeller established the
Standard Oil Company in 1870. By the 1890s, critics
charged that Rockefeller and his lieutenants were
engaging in horizontal expansion, strongarming smaller
oil companies into selling out to U.S. Steel to cut down
on competition and keep oil prices high. Rockefeller also
successfully provided financial support to Congressmen
who passed laws providing U.S. Steel with tax breaks,
free land, and tariffs to discourage foreign competition.
However, like Carnegie, Rockefeller became a leading
philanthropist late in life.

Born into a poor Scottish weaving family,
Andrew Carnegie migrated with his family
to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as a young boy
in the 1840s. Using the newly emerging
telegraph industry, Carnegie learned morse
code and became a successful telegraph
operator. Investing in railroad and bridge
companies, he multiplied his fortune many
times during the Civil War. A firm believer in
self-cultivation, Carnegie gave generously
to foundations, schools and churches. Most
significantly, he funded a series of first-rate
libraries in poor urban neighborhoods and
small rural towns across the nation. Boasting
an impressive array of not just technical
or business manuals, these libraries also
sported great works of literature and history.
Carnegie and his supporters argued that the
goal of these libraries was not just to allow
men and women to prepare for professional
careers but to make them refined citizens of a
national culture that rewarded risk-taking and
self-improvement.

distinguish between sounds. Quickly realizing his
invention’s commercial application, Graham obtained
a patent for his “acoustic telegraph” in 1876. In time
the telephone would revolutionize the transmission of
knowledge across the world.

While Bell experimented with transmitting sound, his
contemporary Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931) poured
his time and energy into illuminating the world. In
1880, he created the first practical, long-lasting electrical
lightbulb at his Menlow Park laboratory in New Jersey.
The lightbulb allowed for the nighttime illumination of
large American cities, reducing the need for dangerous

SUMMARY
The Industrial Revolution radically altered society. It accelerated a host of processes and
developments, including urbanization. It took advantage of new ways to harness energy and
increased the productive abilities of humankind. The Industrial Revolution was not simply a
physical revolution but a social and intellectual one. It has massively altered how we understand
and approach work, capital and the individual. The Industrial Revolution provided the countries
that best employed the new technological and productive capabilities a considerable advantage
and buttressed attempts, especially by the West, to expand their global reach and control.

countries also swept across the globe, using breachloading rifles, steamboats, railroads, telegraphs and
even medical science to subjugate the native peoples
of Africa, Asia and Oceania. However, to manage such
large empires, colonial administrators relied upon large
classes of indigenous intermediaries trained in Western
reading, writing, accounting, engineering, military
techniques and law. As such, native peoples learned to
use European-inspired political ideas, such as modern
nationalism, to create resistance movements. In time,
new postcolonial nations such as the United States,
Mexico and Brazil would develop their own unique
political ideas and sense of cultural nationalism. This
chapter examines how modern nations came into being,

higher wages and safer working conditions. Czechs and
Hungarians demanded their own independent states.
In contrast, over 800 German delegates in Frankfurt
gathered in defiance of traditional political elites
to create a popularly elected national assembly as a
preliminary step to creating a united Germany.

The inability of revolutionaries to work together or
govern effectively quickly led to the defeat of their
movements. For instance, an inability of political
liberals and socialists to work together in France’s
National Assembly led to a series of bloody worker
uprisings in Paris called the “June Days.” The National
Assembly hired French peasants from the countryside
to crush the demonstrators. In the ensuing confusion,
Louis Napoleon (1808-1873), the nephew of the former
French Emperor, became President of the French
Republic. In keeping with his family tradition, four

IMPERIALISM
Throughout this period, many Western nations pursued
imperial and colonial ambitions. In the early modern
period, European rulers were aware of imperialism. The
concept went back to the Greek and Roman Empires
and involved the military or diplomatic conquest of
other regions and exploiting their natural resources. In
CHAPTER 8 NATION BUILDING AND REFORM 1700-1900

the late 1300s and 1400s, Portugal and Spain overthrew
Moorish rule and emerged as modern empires. Armed
with classical descriptions of India and China and Arabic
inventions such as ribbed hulled ships and astrolabes,
explorers such as Vasco De Gama and Christopher
Columbus brought knowledge of Africa, India and the
Americas back to their European sponsors. Due to a
lack of royal funds, Portuguese and Spanish monarchs
granted explorers and conquistadors in the 1500s royal
charters to conquer certain regions in return for a share
of the wealth extracted from such regions. In the 1600s,
England and France followed suit, offering colonial
charters to noblemen and joint-stock companies in
return for a percentage of the wealth these groups
generated off their overseas adventures.

COLONIALISM
European rulers viewed overseas colonies as more than
just sources of wealth. Monarchs and their advisors
also viewed such areas as sites where their own subjects
could settle and create families and communities
among themselves or through unions with indigenous
people. Such colonists could then help procure raw
resources, which would then be shipped back to the
home country for processing into manufactured
goods, which could either be sold abroad or back to
the colonists at considerable markups. Royal officials
likewise argued that colonies could serve as a dumping
ground for unwanted groups of people back home,
such as criminals, ethnic minorities, or simply debtors.
Some nations, such as England, envisioned colonies
expanding the borders of their empires, creating
miniature versions of the home country around the
world.
Although colonial powers had significant advantages
over indigenous peoples and colonists, they were not
all-powerful. Beginning in the late 1700s, areas such
as the thirteen British North American colonies,
Haiti, Mexico, Peru, Columbia and Rio De La Plata,
began to declare themselves independent of the
British and Spanish empires. By the mid-19th century,
even post-colonial states like the United States were
experimenting with becoming imperial and colonial
powers. It would only be after the Second World War
that de-colonization would emerge as a worldwide
movement.

Born in Herefordshire, Richard Hakluyt (15531616) became an Anglican Priest and writer in
his teens. A favorite at the court of Elizabeth
I, Hakluyt published Divers Voyages Touching
the Discoverie of America (1582) and The
Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and
Discoveries of the English Nation (1589–1600).
These works became cornerstones in defining
and promoting English colonialism. Hakluyt
argued that Spanish colonies were based on
force and exploitation. He suggested creating
English colonies around the world. English
settlers would treat indigenous peoples fairly,
giving them the benefits of English science,
culture and religion in return for labor and service.
In time the two groups would intermarry and
become one. England would thus create “miniEnglands” worldwide, spreading the English
language, culture and religion far and wide.
Hakluyt’s ideas would become a cornerstone
in the creation of the British North American
colonies and, later the United States.

ITALIAN UNIFICATION
Following the Napoleonic Wars, the delegates at the
1815 Congress of Vienna created a series of powerful
alliances designed to maintain a balance of power by
propping up traditional European empires. While
such a system protected established nations it made
it difficult for new ones to be formed. For instance,
since the fall of the Roman Empire in the fifth century
AD, the Italian peninsula had remained divided into a
series of petty kingdoms, city-states and papal lands.
Although constant conflict and trade between these
small states provided the creative ferment that led to
the rise of the Renaissance, it made any consensus for
Italian nationalism hard to achieve.

The Italian Campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars
destabilized the traditional Italian feudal order and
introduced new ideas, such as nationalism. Attempts at
Italian unity under the short-lived Cispadane Republic
(1796-1797) were rolled back by Napoleon’s defeat and
the efforts of the Congress of Vienna. Throughout the
1810s and 1820s, a secret order known as the Carbonari
spearheaded a movement for Italian unification.
One such member, Giuseppe Mazzini (1805-1872),
established a movement known as La Giovine Italia
(Young Italy) that trained a generation of future
revolutionary leaders. Another Carbonaro, Giuseppe
Garibaldi (1807-1882), spent several years learning to
function as a professional revolutionary by participating
in armed struggles in Brazil and Uruguay.

Born in 1808 in Nice, part of Napoleon’s French
Empire, Giuseppe Garibaldi trained as a young man
to become a ship captain. Joining the Carbonari
and Mazzini’s Young Italy movement in 1833,
Garibaldi participated in an unsuccessful uprising
in Piedmont. Fleeing to the Americas, Garibaldi
worked with revolutionaries seeking independence
from Brazil. Marrying Brazilian revolutionary Ana
Maria de Jesus Ribeiro (1821-1849), Garibaldi
learned guerilla warfare techniques. During the
Uruguayan Civil War, Garibaldi raised a legion of
Italian expatriates known as the Redshirts because
of their distinctive uniforms that featured red shirts,
ponchos and sombreros. Returning to Italy in
1848, Garibaldi played an active role in the Italian
Wars for Independence. A dedicated republican,
he disliked dealing with aristocrats like Camillo
Benso, Count Cavour (1810-1861) and Victor
Emmanuel II (1820-1878), whom he felt moved
slowly toward independence. When the American
Civil War broke out in 1861, the Union government
offered Garibaldi a commission as a major general.
Although Garibaldi met with U.S. Minister Henry S.
Sanford (1823-1891) in Brussels, he demanded that
he be made commander-in-chief of all Union forces
and wield power to abolish slavery in areas he
liberated. The Lincoln administration did not agree
with Garibaldi’s demands.

alliance with French Emperor Louis Napoleon III to
launch a resistance movement against Austrian forces
in Milan and Venice. In June, Sardinian forces defeated
Austrian troops at the battles of Magenta and Solferino.
In the meantime, Garibaldi led an army of Italian
volunteers to victory over the Austrians at the actions of
Varese and Como. Behind the scenes, Sardinian, French
and Austrian diplomats brokered a compromise whereby
Sardinia would receive Lombardy, France gained Savoy
and Nice, and Austria would maintain Venice.

In 1848, a series of liberal revolutions broke out across
Europe. Popular uprisings quickly began in Sicily,
Naples, Milan and Venice. Local nobles, including Pope
Pius IX (1792-1878), promptly fled. Giuseppe Garibaldi
led an army of peasants into Rome. In January 1849,
revolutionaries held local elections of an assembly that
declared the creation of the Italian Republic on February
9th. Two months later, Giuseppe Mazzini became Chief
Minister of the new Italian government. He helped
prepare a Constitution which guaranteed, among other
things, freedom of religion and a right to free public
education. However, the intervention of Austrian and
French military forces led to a defeat of the republicans
and a restoration of the Pope and nobles to power.

The precarious peace created by the end of the conflict
lasted less than a year. When peasants in Messina
and Palermo began to revolt against the government
of Francis II, King of the Two Sicilies (1836-1894),
Garibaldi led an army of 1,000 volunteers from all
over the Italian peninsula (I Mille) to liberate Sicily
from Neapolitan rule. He then began an invasion of
the Kingdom of Naples, defeating a papal army hastily
thrown together by Pope Pius’s followers. Victor
Emmanuel II, King of Sardinia, arrived to take the
head of Garibaldi’s volunteer army. Francis II held out
in the fortress of Gaeta for three months before finally
surrendering. In February 1861, Victor Emmanuel
II called for the creation of an Italian Parliament,
which declared him King of Italy. Although Garibaldi
attempted to raise an army to take Rome and create a
republic, Victor Emmanuel II negotiated quietly behind
the scenes for French and Austrian troops to leave the
peninsula.

For nearly five years, the Kingdom of Italy continued to
grow, wielding power throughout the peninsula except
for Venice, which remained under Austrian control,
and Rome, where the Papacy held sway. During the
Austro-Prussian War (1886), Italy sided with France

in over a millennium.

GERMAN UNIFICATION
In many ways, the process of German unification
paralleled that of Italian unification. For centuries
German-speaking people lived in a variety of separate
kingdoms, duchies and empires. In 800, Emperor
Charlemagne (747-814) unified them into a loose
confederation known as the Holy Roman Empire. By
the early 1800s, the Kingdom of Prussia had emerged as
a powerful state in opposition to the Austrian Empire.
Following the Napoleonic Wars, the different German
states were combined into the German Confederation.
During the revolutions of 1848, progressive German
nationalists, intellectuals, intelligentsia and politicians
elected a German National Assembly. However, this
movement fell apart after only a few months in power.
Many Germans remained divided over whether
Germany should be unified with or without the
Austrian Empire.

Throughout the 1850s and 1860s, Prussian Prime
Minister Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898) led efforts to
unify Germany from the top down. In 1862, he aligned
with Austria to argue that the Danish government of
King Christian IX (1818-1906) had no right to annex
the provinces of Schleswig and Holstein directly into
Denmark. After defeating the Danish armies, Prussia
annexed the two territories. Bismarck then signed a
mutual defense treaty with the newly formed Kingdom
of Italy. When Italy went to war with Austria in 1866,
Prussia defeated its rival and annexed several German
states, including Hanover and Nassau.
In 1867, Bismarck created the North German
Confederation, which unified many German states
under Prussia’s leadership. Worried about the growth
of Prussia, Napoleon III demanded that Prussia return
Luxembourg and parts of Saarland and Bavaria.
Bismarck not only refused these demands but continued
to block French ambitions. In response, France declared
war on Germany. With virtually all German states except
Austria supporting Prussia, German forces quickly
defeated several French armies and occupied Paris. In
January 1871, German officials and generals proclaimed
Prussian King Wilhelm as Wilhelm I, Emperor of the
German Empire (1797-1888).

his travels, the Streltsy (riflemen) had rebelled. Once
he returned, Peter crushed them and anyone who
opposed his plans to reform Russia and Russian
society. Peter increased his power by modernizing the
army and staffing it through an aggressive conscription
program. By the end of his reign, his army boasted
nearly 300,000 soldiers.

RUSSIA
In 1682, Feodor III (r. 1676-1682), Czar of Russia,
died without heirs. The next in line was his brother
Ivan V (1666-1696), but since Ivan was sickly and
considered mentally incapable, the Boyars (the old
nobility) elected his 10-year-old half-brother Peter
(1672-1725) instead. Eventually, it was agreed to
name the half-brothers co-monarchs. Peter I (r. 16821725) outpaced his brother in energy and talent and,
in a few years, began to dominate the court. In 1696,
Ivan V died, which left Peter the sole ruler of Russia.
Fascinated by maritime trade and technology, in
1697, Peter I traveled to Western Europe in disguise
as part of his “Grand Embassy.” This trip aimed to
find allies against the Ottomans and learn more about
the West. Though he failed to win much European
support, he learned a lot about modern methods of
shipbuilding and manufacturing.
His eighteen months abroad encouraged Peter I to
initiate a period of reform. Before he returned from

successful as Russia would win the Great Northern
War (1700-1721) against Sweden, which gave Russia
control of Livonia, Estonia and parts of Sweden.
Believing that the old ways hindered Russian progress,
Peter designed a new capital in western Russia on the
Gulf of Finland. Called Saint Petersburg, this new capital
signified the modern and Western inspired direction of
his empire. To complete the project, upwards of 40,000
conscripted peasants were sent to Saint Petersburg to
labor for free each year. Tens of thousands died during
its construction. The impressive capital, with its wide
straight boulevards, uniform buildings, imposing
government buildings and large greenspace, looked
modern but was built by unfree and unpaid labor.
To protect Russian interests, Peter began heavily
investing in his navy. His primary focus was to increase
Russian control of the Black Sea and protect Russian
access and trade in the Baltic. These efforts proved

Peter wanted a nobility that served him and the state. To
signify a more ‘European’ outlook, Peter ordered that
the elite shave their beards and that they dress more like
their European counterparts. He also commanded that

CATHERINE THE GREAT
One of the most discussed features of Catherine II’s
life is her relationships with men. Her husband, the
future Peter III, gave her a position at court, but their
marriage was not happy. During their marriage, she
had at least three lovers, and we can’t be certain that
any of her children, including the future Czar Paul I
(1754-1801), were legitimate. Her third child, a son,
was almost certainly fathered by Grigory Orlov (17341783). The number of Catherine’s lovers continues
to be debated by historians, with many placing the
number somewhere between 12 and 22. The actual
number will likely never be known. Until her stroke and
subsequent death at age 67, Catherine had surrounded
herself with young men and participated in the courtly
games of flirting and intrigue. It is unlikely that all of
these relationships were physical. Whatever the case,
Catherine kept a close eye on her court, ruled Russia
with an iron fist, and let little stand in her way of getting
what she wanted.

Catherine understood that Russia needed reform.
Recognizing the power of Enlightenment ideals,
Catherine wanted to harness the ideas and technology of
the West without undermining Russian institutions and,
of course, the power of the throne. To rule effectively,
institute reforms and strengthen the state, Catherine
needed the support of the nobility. In return for their
loyalty, Catherine increased and protected the power of
the elite.
Catherine expanded the state, creating a relatively stable
Russian Empire. Evaluating Catherine is complex and
often contentious. On the one hand, she promoted
Enlightenment values and was enthusiastic about
education. On the other hand, her support of the
nobility and the 500,000 serfs she owned suggests that
the Enlightenment values of equality and fairness were
more philosophical than a practiced position. That she
gave serfs away to important officials and court favorites
demonstrates how little rights serfs had and that they
were treated as a commodity to be traded and used
for the benefit of the few. Although Catherine’s reign
was largely successful, she strengthened a top-down
hierarchical system based primarily upon one’s birth.

OTTOMANS
As many European Empires strengthened their
economies, states and militaries, the Ottomans
entered a period of decline. While the reign of
Suleiman I (r. 1520-1566) may have marked the
zenith of the Ottoman Empire, it remained viable and
flourished until about the mid-18th century when it
became increasingly evident that it no longer had the
power and prestige it once held. As Ottoman power
began to drain away, Ottoman nationalists began to
debate what went wrong and, more importantly, how
to fix the empire. Although numerous approaches
and solutions were offered, two dominant camps
emerged. One side argued that the problem was that
the Ottomans had deviated from their historical
trajectory and that the solution to its problems was to
go back to the old and traditional ways, while others
wanted to borrow state policies from its European
neighbours. Caught between these two forces, the
Ottoman Empire went back and forth between
periods of reform and trying to implement policies
based on the old ways. This caused a lot of disorder,
blocked reform and made it difficult for any sultan

After the war, Mustafa Kemal, a respected Ottoman
general, fought against the occupying Allied forces and,
eventually, the Ottoman state. In 1920, a provisional
government announced its desire and intention to
replace the Ottoman Empire with a republic. On
November 1, 1922, the Turkish Parliament officially
announced the end of the Ottoman state. This ended
more than 600 years of Ottoman rule.
Elected the first President of the new republic, Mustafa
Kemal came to be known by the honorific Atatürk,
which means Father Turk. Kemal launched a series
of reforms aimed at modernizing the new nation of
Turkey. These reforms included building a sense of
nationalism, secularization and a strict separation of
church and state. Kemal discouraged the wearing of
Ottoman clothing, encouraging state employees and
citizens to wear European-inspired dress and adopt
European manners and pastimes. The new Turkey, so
far as Kemal saw it, would be a radical departure from
the past.

NATION BUILDING IN LATIN
AMERICA 1500-1700
Nation-building in Latin America proved a radically
different undertaking than similar efforts in Europe,
Africa and North America. Before the arrival of
Europeans, powerful Native American empires and
city-states dominated large swathes of Central and
South America. For instance, from the 1100s to the
1500s, the Mexica moved into the Central Valley of
Mexico. Conquering Mayan and Toltec city-states, the
Mexica’s renamed themselves the Aztecs and created
a powerful empire based on force. The Aztecs created
vibrant commercial networks, intricate artwork and
a complex religion that featured human sacrifice. The
Incan Empire arose in Peru at roughly the same time,
tying together large cities through an intricate system
of roads that allowed for the rapid deployment of trade
and armed forces. Yet for all of their strengths, the
Aztecs and Incas fell quickly to Spanish conquistadors
equipped with steel armor, lances and swords, firearms,
horses and germs for which many Native Americans
had no resistance.
Conquistadors such as Hernan Cortes (1485-1547)
and Francisco Pizarro (1478-1541) were not social
revolutionaries looking to create new societies in the

Employing brutal methods against Native Americans,
Spanish priests proved much more successful in gaining
converts than Protestant ministers in the English North
American colonies. Many Mayans and Incans accepted
conversion because they felt baptism might protect
them from the European-borne diseases ravaging their
communities. Others saw the adoption of Spanish
culture and transformation as stepping stones for entry
into Spanish trading networks and colonial society.
Many Native Americans empathized with the image of
a savior figure whose suffering resembled their own.
Many Native Americans selectively combine aspects
of their Native American religions with Catholicism to
create a hybrid faith. For instance, Aztecs combined
traditions associated with the Corn Goddess Tonantzin
with the cult of the Virgin Mary to create a blended
religious figure.

Americas. They were mercenaries seeking “gold, glory
and God.” In particular, they sought to extract wealth
from their conquered subjects and return to Spain as
rich men. It fell to subsequent generations of colonial
administrators and priests to create a colonial social
order on the ruins of the Aztec, Mayan and Incan
states. They began by creating the encomienda system
by which individual conquistadors received land grants
buttressed by the unfree labor of Native Americans.
Franciscan and Dominican Priests also operated
missions throughout Nueva España designed to function
as forts and imperial outposts and as community centers
where Native Americans could receive conversion and
training in industrial skills. In 1542, Dominican Priest
and former conquistador Bartolome de las Casas (14841566) published A Short Account of the Destruction
of the Indies, which condemned the harshness of the
encomienda system.
Although some Catholic Priests became champions of
Indian rights, many others viewed Native Americans as
heathens who could only be saved through conversion to
Spanish culture and Roman Catholicism. They began by
destroying thousands of Native American codices, such
as the Mayan Popul Vuh, which recorded the creation
myth, deities and customs of K’iche Mayans. They

raised Native American temples and built Christian
cathedrals on their ruins. Well-versed in the techniques
used by the Spanish Inquisition, Catholic priests used
physical torture and psychological intimidation to
forcibly convert millions of Aztecs, Mayans and Incas
to Christianity.
Within a generation of conquest, many conquistadors
married into Native American families who had lost
members due to disease and warfare. For example,
Hernan Cortes and his native translator Malinche
(c. 1500-c. 1529) gave birth to a son, Martín Cortés
el Mestizo (1522-1595), who later became a Spanish
nobleman. Latin American society thus developed
castas (or caste system). Peninsulares, Spanish-born
whites, represented the large landholders, government
officials and church leaders. Beneath them were the
creoles, white Spaniards born in the colonies. Creoles
were usually small-time ranchers, low-level government
functionaries and friars who worked with Native
Americans. Mestizos, those of European and Native
American descent, traditionally performed as craftsmen,
merchants and intermediaries. Full-blooded Native
Americans (Indios), African Americans (Negros), and
their children (Zambos) served as itinerant laborers,
peasants, miners and enslaved people.

El héroe español Fray Bartolomé de las Casas. Controversia de
Valladolid bestial de españoles a los indios
Born into a family of Spanish merchants in 1484,
Bartolome de Las Casas became a secular priest
in 1507. He participated in the Spanish conquest
of Cuba but became horrified by the brutal ways in
which Spaniards treated the conquered Taino Indians.
Following the publication of his A Short Account of
the Destruction of the Indies (1542), de Las Casas
argued in Valladolid, Spain, from 1550-1551, that

Native Americans had souls capable of salvation
and thus could not be treated as enslaved people.
The Spanish government reformed the encomienda
system and created the Juzgado General de Indios
(General Indian Court) to protect Native Americans
from the worst abuse of the colonial rule. Full-blooded
Native Americans and African Americans remained at
the margins of Spanish colonial society.

By the mid-1500s, the wealth of Central and South
America had made Spain the wealthiest nation in Europe.
Spanish officials generally taxed wealth imported to
Spain at a rate of 20%, which became known as the
Quintano Real (literally “the king’s fifth”). In addition
to gold, silver and gems looted from Native American
temples and palaces, the silver mines of San Luis Potosi
in Bolivia provided a steady stream of precious metals
to Madrid. However, the cost of such mineral wealth
came at the expense of millions of lives of enslaved
Native Americans and Africans who died in the brutal
extraction process common in the Potosi mines. Sugar,
coffee and tobacco plantations in the Caribbean likewise
provided incredible profits for landholders and Spanish
officials but did so at the cost of millions of Taino and
West African lives.

a certain amount of autonomy within the empire. When
Philip V (1683-1746) of the House of Bourbon became
the Spanish King in 1700, he began to streamline colonial
governments and centralize royal authority under his
leadership. Latin American elites bitterly resented what
they considered an attempt to reign in their autonomy.
By the late 1700s, Spanish revolutionary leaders like
Simon Bolívar and José de San Martín became inspired
by the Enlightenment philosophy of John Locke, Baron
de Montesquieu and Jean Jacques Rousseau. Encouraged
by the success of the American, French and Haitian
revolutions, Spanish colonial leaders formed juntastyle governments that declared their independence
from Spain in the 1810s and 1820s. However, while
Bolívar and San Martín promised liberal reforms to

CHAPTER 8 NATION BUILDING AND REFORM 1700-1900

Later, imports of firearms in exchange for enslaved
people changed the political tapestry of West Africa and
strengthened coastal regions. Initially, the Portuguese
engaged in the slave trade, soon followed by other
nations such as the Dutch, English, French and Danes.
As sugar and tobacco plantations began to develop
in the New World the demand for labor increased.
Trading companies, such as the English Royal African
Company (RAC), started to build their trading
monopolies along the West African coast. Initially
focused on the gold trade, the RAC would dominate
the English slave trade until its abolishment in 1807.
In the western part of Africa, after the fall of the Songhay
empire in 1492, small and medium size kingdoms arose
in the regions south of the Niger Bend and upstream
along the Niger River. One of these kingdoms,
the Mandingo kingdom of Segu, developed in the
heartlands of the former Mali Empire. Its power rested
on an army of enslaved people. North of Segu, in the
Sahel region, the Soninke kingdom of Jaara dominated
the area. In this part of West Africa, a mix of class and
caste institutions controlled access to political authority
and economic activities. To the east of the Niger Bend
and north of the rainforest, the Mossi kingdoms,
whose rulers used cavalry-based armies, started to
arise in the 16th and 17th centuries. Juula merchants
traded in the Mossi capital towns and connected the
Mossi regions to the trans-Saharan and West African
commercial networks. Further west in the Senegambia

region, along the Gambia and Senegal Rivers, the Jolof
state and the kingdom of Kaabu dominated the area
politically and economically. Their leaders became
increasingly involved with Portuguese and later Dutch
and British merchants.
In the 16th century, three states gained importance due to
their strong ties to the Atlantic slave trade: Oyo, Asante,
and Dahomey. Another important state in this region,
the kingdom of Benin located in present-day Nigeria,
although it participated in the slave trade it primarily
focused on other forms of trade. During the 15th and
16th century, Benin experienced its most significant
expansion. Such growth happened in the 15th century
under the warrior kings Ewuare (c. 1440) and Ozolua
(c. 1481) and in the 16th century under Esigie (1504),
Orhogbua (c. 1550) and Ehengbuda (c. 1578-1608).
The first contact with the Portuguese occurred in 1485,
when Portuguese traders brought a cargo of guns and
coconuts to Benin. Soon after, trade relationships were
established between the king of Portugal and the Benin
rulers, and commodities were exchanged. Over the
ensuing decades ivory, cloth, pepper and other goods
were exported to Benin in exchange for damask, silk,
manillas and cowries.
While encounters with Europeans influenced the
external politics of the Benin kingdom, Benin kings
primarily dealt with the Igala kingdom, located to the
east of the Niger-Benue confluence in the interior,

Benin’s imperialist leaders now directed their efforts
toward the coast, spreading as far as Lagos and Badagry
and waging war against villages and towns along the
way.
The 16th and early 17th centuries saw a period of
relative stability and peace in the region. But a civil
war broke out in the late 17th century. Conflicts over
succession devastated the kingdom. Concerned over
the sincerity of adoption and spread of Christianity,
Pope Innocent XII (1615-1700) sent a Catholic mission
to Benin to keep its rulers focused on spreading the
faith. The mission determined that earlier efforts at
Christianization had failed to take root as the churches
had been converted to shrines and priests had returned
to practicing African traditional religions.
While the 18th century remained relatively uneventful,
increasing European pressure during the 19th century
eventually placed the Benin kingdom under British
jurisdiction. In 1892, the British signed a treaty with
the Oba of Benin that also allowed for the opening of
the kingdom to British missionaries and merchants.
The Oba ignored the treaty and continued as usual.

In the rainforest west of the Niger River, the Oyo Empire
rose to power dominating many of the Yoruba city-states
who had tributary relationships to Oyo. The key to Oyo
strength lay in its reliance on a strong cavalry consisting
of horses supplied by their northern neighbors. The
Oyo conducted many wars against other Yoruba citystates to gain prisoners of war which could be sold to
merchants involved in the Atlantic slave trade. As the
demand for slaves increased, the Oyo developed into a
major slave trading empire trading enslaved people.
Dahomey was another West African state heavily
involved in the Atlantic trade. Founded around 1620,
Dahomey was initially a small kingdom. By the 1700s,
Dahomey exercised an increasing amount of control
over the trade with Europeans while at the same time
restricting their access to the interior. The Oyo attack of
1730 eventually made Dahomey a tributary to the Oyo
Empire for about 80 years. While this changed regional
power dynamics, the Kings of Dahomey continued to
rule over smaller chiefdoms. In the Dahomey Army all
female regiments, known as Amazons, fought alongside
their male counterparts.

governed from the capital city of Kumasi, Asante
became an important commercial hub for West African
trading networks. Under the stewardship of Osei Tutu
(1680-1718) and his successor Opuko Ware (17181748) the Asante Confederation was transformed into
a powerful empire. Starting with Osei Tutu, all Asante
rulers took the title of Asantehene and received
religious legitimacy through the Golden Stool which
was provided by priests during coronation ceremonies.
The empire became known for producing gold and
kola nuts, rivaling the cotton textile and indigo trade
of the Hausa city-states northeast of Kumasi in the
Sahel region of West Africa. The Ashanti kingdom
became heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade
selling prisoners of war down to the coast. It controlled
territories to the north, such as the tributary Dagomba
kingdom, and smaller Akan-speaking kingdoms to the
south. One of the important imports both Dahomey
and Asante made were European firearms which they
acquired in exchange for slaves. By the 18th century
both kingdoms could call upon about 10,000 soldiers
armed with muskets while fielding armies upwards of
80,000 strong.

against the Hausa kings who, despite being Muslims,

The jihad resulted in the establishment of the Sokoto

As Europeans slowly outlawed the slave trade and slavery,
they transitioned to what became known as “legitimate
commerce” in African products like groundnuts or palm
oil which replaced the trade in slaves, as the African
continent also became a destination for the import of cheap
products from Europe. As public interest in the interior of
Africa heightened, more geographical and anthropological
studies were performed by European explorers. In addition,
European traders backed by their respective governments
became interested in controlling the African continent and
maximizing profits.
Similarly, to West Africa, the western equatorial rainforest
and the savannas to the south in what is today modernday Angola became involved in the slave trade. As early
as the 1500s, the Portuguese had started to circumvent
the Kongo Empire in gaining control of the slave trade
and had established Luanda as a major port city to which
slaves captured in the interior were transported and then
shipped across the Atlantic. In the 1600s, the Portuguese
also established the coastal town of Benguela from which
they secured slaves from the highland territories of the
Ovimbundu kingdoms. In the 18th century, the merchants
of the Ovimbundu kingdoms traveled as far as the Lunda
kingdom but also to the areas of the upper Zambezi River
to acquire goods and slaves.

The early 19th century also saw turbulence in southern
Africa. The Nguni of the southeast described these as
mfecane, the “crashing,” and the Sotho-Tswana referred to
them as difaqane, the “scattering.” The mfecane emerged
as conflict erupted between the emerging northern Nguni
kingdoms over access to natural resources. Famine caused

warfare between 1816-1819 rattled the region. In 1819,
a minor chief named Shaka (c.1787-1828) consolidated
the various Zulu groups into a single kingdom. He then
expanded his borders from Tugela and Pongola into the
Drakensberg foothills and started to demand tribute
payments from the people between the Tugela and
Umzimkulu Rivers. By the mid-1820s, he controlled most
of the area of modern day KwaZulu Natal in South Africa.
Shaka developed a centralized government in which the
king wielded absolute control. In the newly conquered
regions, petty chiefs answered directly to Shaka. In 1828,
Shaka was assassinated by his half-brother Dingane (c.
1795-1840) who made himself king. While it took Shaka
ten years to establish the Zulu kingdom, his half-brother
took less than a decade to lose it.

In 1795, the British government seized control of South
Africa from the Dutch East India Company. One of the
consequences of the establishment of British settlements
in the region was the annexation of Natal. Thousands
of Dutch settlers known as Boers fled Natal for the Zulu
dominated lowveld. The Boers killed 3,000 Zulus in several
pitched battles before settling south of Tugela, creating the
short-lived Republic of Natalia (1839-1843). Tied up by a
civil war in which Chief Mpande (1848-1872) usurped his
brother Dingane, the Zulu remained too divided to deal
with the Boers. In 1879, British military invaded the Zulu
kingdom, beginning the Anglo-Zulu war that resulted in a
defeat of the Zulu people and the absorption of their area
into the Colony of Natal which later became part of the
Union of South Africa.

SUMMARY
The period of 1700-1900, provided momentous change for the world. Ground zero for the
Enlightenment, Romanticism and the Industrial Revolution, Europe witnessed a series of
revolutions that challenged the old feudal social order. While Britain and France tried to liberalize
their political systems, Germany, Italy and Russia struggled to modernize and unify. Across the
Atlantic, Spain, France and Britain established massive empires in the Americas. However, as
they struggled to exterminate or incorporate indigenous peoples into their empires, they had to
deal with increasingly rebellious colonists. Beginning with the American Revolution in the late
1700s, one by one the provinces of English, French and Spanish America threw off their colonial
chains. Meanwhile, on the African continent, Central African kingdoms declined as West Africa
became embroiled in the Atlantic slave trade. By the late 1800s, a Scramble for Africa left almost
the entire continent in the hands of European occupiers. As the world approached the twentieth
century, the unresolved issues of colonialism, imperialism and nationalism would set the stages
for the outbreak of world war in 1914.

During the period 1700-1900, Western influence in
Asia markedly increased. Western countries used

in different ways. Some countries attempted to adopt
Western education and political structure while
others clung (as long as they could) to traditional
ways of operating. Western influence and the reaction
to the growing power of Europe and America helped
to remake Asia and reorient global politics, power
and trade.

Although illegal, initially Chinese authorities did
little to stop the opium trade as the scale and impact
of opium were not widely known. By the 1830s,
there was a growing acceptance that the opium trade
had negative social and economic impacts, and this
encouraged the Chinese state to attempt to stem the
flow of opium into China.
In 1839, Chinese authorities empowered the
trustworthy and ever-efficient Lin Zexu (1785-1850)
to employ strict measures to end the opium trade.
After learning how the drug had been smuggled
into China, Zexu went on the offensive. Refusing to
look the other way or take a bribe, Zexu seized and
destroyed some 20,000 chests of opium.

granted British traders extraterritoriality, which
meant they were not subject to Chinese laws and were
basically outside the control of Chinese authorities.
Other powers, including a host of European nations,
Japan and the United States, forced their own unequal
treaties onto China.
The opium wars and subsequent unequal treaties came
at a time of significant instability in China. During
the 19th century, the Chinese population increased
by some 50 percent to nearly 480 million people.
Differences in wealth, the lack of available lands,
widespread poverty, and growing drug addiction
made much of the Chinese population unhappy. This
erupted in a series of disturbances and rebellions, the
most important of which was the Taiping rebellion
(1850-1864).

The origins of the rebellion lie in many of the frustrations
and difficulties that the Chinese people faced, coupled
with dissatisfaction with the Machu rulers, who
continued to be viewed as unwanted foreigners. The
spark, however, would be the rebellion’s future leader
Hong Xiuquan (1814-1864). An untraditional thinker,
Xiuquan rejected Chinese socio-religious systems,
creating his own form of Christianity, one in which he
proclaimed himself to be the younger brother of Jesus.
115

Xiuquan’s story begins with his difficulties with the
civil services examinations. After failing the imperial
exam for the third time, Xiuquan experienced a
breakdown and was delirious for days. He had vivid
dreams about a heavenly family and father. In these
dreams, Xiuquan was commanded to alter his ways.
After failing the imperial examinations for the fourth
time (only a tiny minority passed), Xiuqaun became
interested in Christianity and came to interpret his
early visions as being part of a Christian religious
experience.

After defeating a detachment of the Qing army in
1850, Xiuquan declared himself the Heavenly King of
the Heavenly Kingdom of Peace. A series of military
victories saw Xiuquan and his supporters gain control
of Nanjing which in 1853 became the capital of the
Taiping Kingdom.
More and more people joined the movement, and
this increased the threat of Xiuquan to the Chinese
state. In 1855, the Taipings almost took Beijing. With
their backs to the wall, the Qings accepted a series
of reforms, including allowing for the creation of
regional armies free of Manchu control. This allowed
for the mobilization of more troops. As the war
turned against the Taiping, Xiuquan could not handle
the pressure nor the reality of defeat and increasingly
withdrew from society. In 1864, he died from illness,
poison or suicide.

Xiuquan began to study and preach. He found
followers in the disenfranchised Chinese peasantry
who were drawn to his vision of a better future.
Centered on Taiping, Xiuquan called for the end of
private property, advocated the separation of the
sexes into separate civil, military and social units, and
forbade prostitution and drug use while imploring
all loyal Chinese to join him in his quest to remake The Taiping rebellion was crushed. But its legacy is an

plaguing the Chinese state, but that revolution and
disorder came out of massive societal change. Many
argued that it was better to stick to traditional ways
and methods even if these seemed unlikely to solve
the problems facing China internally and externally.
Others argued for a more limited form of reform
that might industrialize China without changing the
underlying structure.
This approach to reform can best be seen in the
self-strengthening movement (1860-1895). The
self-strengthening movement sought to place
Western industrial technology on top of a base of
traditional Chinese society. Although the movement
achieved some gains, it was limited by the lack of
commitment to genuinely altering the Chinese state
or its society. Industrialization brought tremendous
change to Europe, and Chinese authorities feared
that European technology would undermine Chinese
values, traditions and their positions as well. This
had a tremendous impact on China. By the late

19th century, China suffered further setbacks as
foreign powers began to carve up its empire. China
ceded Vietnam to France; Japan got Taiwan; China
lost control of Burma and had to recognize the
independence of Korea.
The disintegration of the Chinese state led to the
outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in 1899. To rid China
of “foreign devils” and their dangerous ideas, the
Boxers targeted foreigners, Chinese people suspected
of being sympathetic to foreigners, and Chinese
Christians. The Boxer Rebellion was crushed by a
combined force of British, Russian, French, German,
U.S. and Japanese forces. The Qing state limped on
until 1912 when the last Qing emperor abdicated
the throne. As China entered the 20th century, its
relative power to Europe and its nearest rival, Japan,
had dramatically diminished. As the new century
dawned, Chinese leaders acknowledged that in order
to catch up, they would have to accept meaningful
social and political change.

JAPAN
Japan faced similar challenges as China. Until the
mid-19th century, Japan was ruled by the Tokugawa
Shogunate, a conservative ruling elite focused on
maintaining power rather than improving the country.
Fearful of outside influences, the government had
largely excluded foreigners and foreign ideas. The result
was that Japan under the Tokugawas had fallen behind.

threat, the shogun eventually gave in when Perry
returned the following year. European powers
demanded and were granted similar trading and
diplomatic privileges. Similar to China, Japan had
been forced to sign unequal treaties which threatened
Japan’s independence and economy.
In response to these treaties, some groups began
to advocate for a new government centered around
the emperor. Although the imperial court in Kyoto
had long been relegated to a ceremonial rather than
administrative or executive role, its gardens, halls
and buildings started to be filled with groups that
hoped a new government led by the emperor might
better deal with the foreign threat.

The Tokugawa Shogunate found itself increasingly
under pressure during the 19th century. Declining
crop yields, famines and even starvation created
widespread dissatisfaction. Externally, foreign powers
wanted access to Japan. Although the Tokugawas
refused to open up Japan to foreign traders and ships

regulated presence in Nagasaki), it was becoming
clear that the Tokugawas lacked the military and A civil war broke out between those loyal to the

MEIJI RESTORATION
The Meiji Restoration (January 3, 1868) is named
after Emperor Meiji, considered the 122nd Emperor
of Japan. The Restoration and his reign led to rapid
modernization, which swept away much of Japan’s
feudal and isolationist policies transforming the
country into an industrialized power. Before the
Restoration, the shoguns ruled, and it was in their
interest to keep the emperor isolated in his palaces
and ignorant of contemporary events. Emperors and
their family rarely left their palaces and often died
prematurely. All five of Emperor Meiji’s siblings died
as infants, and only five of his 15 children survived
into adulthood. Having contracted smallpox, his
own father died at 36. While the rapid modernization
of Japan is indisputable, historians still debate the
degree to which Emperor Meiji supported reform,
with some claiming he had almost no role, with
others painting him as an active participant in
the process. Whatever the case, Emperor Meiji
has been, and will likely continue to be, closely
associated with the rapid modernization of Japan.

was transferred away from the nobles and large
landholders to those who tilled the soil. In return
for private ownership of the land, farmers paid
an annual tax on the value of their land. This
created a reliable and stable tax base. This was not
all positive, as those who could not meet the tax
obligation were pushed off their land and forced to
find employment in the city as part of the growing
number of factory workers.

The Meiji Restoration gave birth to a period of
reform. Realizing how far Japan had fallen behind,
both progressive and conservative forces in Japan
were more willing to learn and adopt ideas from
Europe and America. The period of reform brought
many changes, including the ending of many of the
hereditary ranks, privileges and relationships that
had defined feudal Japan.
The Meijis wanted their political system to emulate
the West. A constitutional committee travelled to
several Western countries to study European and
American political systems. This created much debate
over which version of Western democracy best suited
Japan. The Meiji settled on the Bismarckian example,
which, although it had a parliament, placed ultimate
authority in the executive branch. The result was a
system that, although it looked like and acted like a
democracy, was in practice still highly authoritarian.
Reformers understood that success ultimately
rested with reforming and modernizing the state
and the economy. To stimulate production, land

The Meiji government also pursued a policy of
industrialization. Personal profit and the sanctity
of capital were not the guiding principles but
rather whether the industry served the state. With
this perspective, the Meiji government might favor
one company over another or force a weaker, less
productive company to merge with a stronger,
better organized one or even to shutter its doors.
This approach worked, and at the dawn of the 20th
century, Japan had a strong industrial economy.
Japan looked to the West for inspiration and
technical and educational know-how. European
officers, mainly from Germany, were employed
to help Japan develop a modern army based
on meritocracy and universal conscription. The
Japanese armed forces were quickly modernized
with the ultimate goal of being able to compete with
European and American forces. Inspired by the
American educational system, the Meiji government
instituted universal education. With an emphasis
on technical training, the Japanese government
sponsored a series of programs encouraging bright
students to study abroad while inviting leading
European and American scholars to teach in
Japan. These schools and opportunities were open
to women as well. Emphasizing duty, service and
loyalty as the ultimate virtues of education, the
state downplayed the individualism which might be
gleaned from an American education.

KOREA
The period 1700-1900 was a time of tremendous change
for Korea. Since the second century BCE, China militarily,
economically and culturally dominated Korea, forcing Korean
monarchs to pay tribute to Beijing. In 1392, Yi Seong-gye
(1335-1408) overthrew the ruling Goryeo family to create
the Joseon Dynasty. His descendant Sejong (the Great, 13971458) reformed the Korean government, civil service and legal
system along Confucian lines. He also used Chinese characters
to create the first written Korean alphabet, “hangul.”

Beset by both Japanese and Chinese invasions in
the 1620s and 1630s, Koreans followed a policy of
strict isolation, earning the nickname of the “Hermit
Kingdom.” However, Korea continued to trade with
China, importing not merely goods but also Buddhist,
Confucian and Western texts on religion, science
and history. Many of these works were Chinese
translations of books introduced by Catholic Priest
Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) into China in the mid1500s. In the early 1700s, King Yeongio (1694-1776)
and his grandson, King Jeongio (1752-1800), initiated
a period of reform that streamlined the tax system,
modernized the military and promoted the creation
of schools, universities and a national library. The
advent of movable type printing presses helped create
a flourishing print culture in Korea. During this
period, the leaders of the Silhak movement demanded
that schools begin to teach Western science instead
of Confucian classics. Influenced by Catholic
missionaries, many Silhak leaders also became
attracted to the egalitarian aspects of Christianity.
Starting in 1784 diplomat, Yi Sung-hun (1756-1801)
established a grassroots Catholic movement focused on
conversion and especially baptism throughout Korea.

EXTERNAL PRESSURES
From 1839-1842 China and Great Britain fought
the First Opium War. Japanese and Korean leaders
watched in horror as British forces defeated China’s
woefully antiquated military. Western diplomats then
forced the Qing government to sign a series of unequal
treaties which opened Chinese ports to Western trade.
Worried by the growing popularity of Christianity
among working-class Koreans and the Chinese
defeats in the Second Opium War (1856-1860),
aristocrat and scholar Choe Je-u (1824-1865) created
a new religious belief system known as “Donghak”
(or Eastern Learning) that drew from native Korean,
Confucian, Buddhist and even Christian beliefs.
Although Donghak proved very popular among the
Korean masses, the royal government began to see
it as a threat. In 1864, government officials executed
Choe on charges of misleading the Korean people and
promoting social chaos.

Daewongun (1820-1898) became acting regent.
He strengthened the central government’s power,
implemented a series of merit-based civil servant
exams and levied taxes against Confucian-run
schools. During this time, Gojong’s military forces
beat back French (1866) and American (1871)
expeditions that sought to open Korea by force. In
1873 Gojong’s consort Queen Min (1851-1895) forced
him into exile. Crowned Empress Myeongsong, Min
continued to build up Korea’s imperial government
and military.
In 1882, Korea’s government signed a treaty with the
U.S. granting American merchants trading rights
in Korea, granting American citizens in Korea
the right of extraterritoriality, guaranteeing the
rights of American missionaries to proselytize, and
pledging mutual support for one another in the case
of attack. American missionaries migrated to Korea
in large numbers, founding schools and opposing
traditional Korean practices such as polygamy and
having concubines.

From the Persian meaning “Mountain of Light,” the
Koh-I-Noor diamond is virtually unmatched in its
beauty and size. A part of the British Crown Jewels,
Queen Victoria acquired the diamond after the British
conquered the Punjab during the Second Anglo-Sikh
War (1848-1849). Displayed at the Great Exhibition, a
massive international exhibition held in England in 1851,
some felt that although the size of the diamond was
undoubtedly impressive, its appearance, especially
its shape was a disappointment. The following year,
Prince Albert decided to have the diamond recut. The
cutting took over a month, shaving some 80 carats off
the diamond, reducing its size to 105.6 carats. After the
upheaval and violence of 1857-1858, Queen Victoria
(r. 1837-1901), became increasingly uncomfortable
with Britain’s role in India and the diamond itself.
Despite these concerns, Victoria continued to wear
the diamond. In 1902, the diamond was added to the
crown of Queen Consort Alexandria (1844-1925). The
complicated chain of ownership, and how the British
acquired it, means that many nations, including India,
Pakistan, and Afghanistan, have claimed ownership
over the diamond, and asked it be returned.

SUMMARY
This chapter has identified the challenges of creating an efficient and industrialized state. It
demonstrated how various nations had to confront both external and internal challenges. While some
nations responded to these threats and successfully modernized, others did not. Modernization along
Western lines was a difficult and risky undertaking as it threatened to fundamentally alter a state,
undermining both traditional social relations and the ruling elite.

spreading the benefits of modernity to indigenous
peoples around the world. Although colonialism
did raise the standards of living for some conquered
peoples who worked in the military or civil service
of various colonial regimes, for most Africans and
Asians colonialism offered little improvement and
further separated them from the systems of power
while denying them the ability to govern their lives
as they so wished. This chapter examines the rise of
imperialism throughout the world and the response of
indigenous peoples to this challenge.
125

SCIENTIFIC RACISM
Popular from the late 18th through the early 20th
centuries, scientific racism used pseudo-science to
assert that certain groups or “races” of people were
biologically and culturally superior to others. In the
mid-1700s, Enlightenment thinkers argued that human
beings were primarily rational and capable of using
science and education to improve their lives and the
well-being of their societies. This desire to “rationalize”
the world was exported as European Empires covered
the globe.
In 1735, Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778)
published his magnum opus Systema Naturae, which
categorized by species over 10,000 plants and animals.
Although describing humans as a species of primate
originating in Africa, Linnaeus classified homo sapiens
into four varieties—European, African, Asian and
American Indian. He depicted white Europeans, such
as himself, the most biologically and socially advanced
group of humans. Although Linnaeus’s work influenced
philosophers like Jean Jacques Rousseau, it also helped
imperialists justify the exploitation of non-white
peoples. Other intellectuals picked up on Linnaeus’s
work with devastating results.

In the 1850s, Catholic Monk Gregor Johann Mendel
(1822-1884) conducted experiments with peas at the
monastery of St. Thomas in Moravia. Mendel selectively
bred sure peas, noting that parents passed distinctive
traits such as pod length, seed shape and flower color
to their offspring. He accordingly calculated the laws
of inheritance, including the concepts of dominant
and recessive traits. His work paralleled that of British
naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) who, in his
seminal work On the Origin of Species (1859), argued
that through the process of “natural selection,” different
species which compete with one another pass down to
their descendants’ random mutations such as longer
legs to run faster or camouflaged fur to hide better. In
time, these individuals survived longer and had more
children, creating entirely new species that would
compete with the old species for resources. Thus,
competition could lead to the extinction of the old
species a process which Herbert Spencer (1820-1903)
dubbed “survival of the fittest.”
In the 1880s, Spencer pioneered “Scientific Darwinism,”
the belief that in the brutal world of international
relations, some cultures, such as white European nations,
were more adaptable and thus more deserving of survival
than others. Spencer thus provided a pseudo-scientific
veneer for not just imperialism and colonialism but also
In the early 1800s, German doctor Franz
Joseph Gall developed the field of phrenology,
the belief that the size and shape of the human
cranium determined the mental capacity of
different ethnicities. Throughout the 19th
century, phrenologists like Charlotte Fowler
Wells (1814-1901) with her husband, two
brothers, and sister-in-law, toured the United
States and Europe. Phrenologists were
active in popular science texts and helped
to create their own professional journals that
popularized their “findings.” The “science” of
phrenology and the journals that published
their work attempted to provide justification
for the enslavement of African Americans and
the dispossession and control over Native
Americans and their land based on the size and
shape of human craniums. Phrenologists often
intentionally selected the skulls of children or
smaller-than-average individuals to artificially
buttress their claims.

laissez-faire capitalism. He believed that the cutthroat
business world of the late 1800s mirrored the natural
world. Therefore, nations or empires that prospered
at the expense of their weaker neighbors were merely
following the “law of the jungle.” Scientific Darwinism
influenced businesspeople like Andrew Carnegie (18351919), writers like Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936), and
even politicians like Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919).
In 1883, Charles Darwin’s cousin Francis Galton (18221911) coined the term “eugenics.” This represented the
belief that humanity could be improved through selective
breeding. American zoologist Charles Davenport (18661944) founded the International Federation of Eugenics
Organizations in 1925, which sought to maintain white
racial purity by warning against “intermingling” with
other non-white groups. Davenport helped influence
the creation of strict immigration laws which favored
white asylum seekers from European countries over
individuals of African, Asian or Latin American descent.
Even progressive social workers like Margaret Sanger
(1879-1966) argued that those unable to afford children
should use contraceptives or agree to sterilization so as
not to create a drain on charitable and social services.
In the 1920s and 1930s, fascists like Adolph Hitler
(1889-1945) and his followers used scientific racism

Map of Growing European Control over
Africa 1880-1913 / Scramble for Africa

to justify his Lebensraum policy. In Nazi ideology, the
biologically and culturally superior Aryan Germans
had a natural right to dispossess and murder millions of
Jews, Slavs and other “undesirables” to build a greater
Germany across Europe. Although the uncovering
of the Holocaust in the later stages of World War II
discredited scientific racism throughout the world, the
concept continued to exist in reduced forms down to
the present.

SCRAMBLE FOR AFRICA
The “scramble for Africa” (1880-1914) demonstrates
how imperialism came to define the relationship
between Europeans and the rest of the world. As
European nations industrialized, business and political
leaders actively searched for raw materials and more
markets in which to sell their nations’ manufactured
goods. Increased competition and a desire to control
and profit from territorial acquisition encouraged
European powers to cast their eyes toward Africa.
When the so-called “scramble for Africa” began in
the 1880s, Europeans controlled about 20 percent of
Africa. By 1914, they occupied nearly the whole of the
African continent.

To avoid direct conflict over Africa, European
leaders agreed at the Berlin Conference (18841885) to develop a set of formal rules for controlling
African territories. The conference established the
concept of “effective occupation,” meaning that a
European nation could only gain recognized colonial
control over an African domain if it had established
treaties with local leaders and begun developing it
economically. European powers also had to promise to
promote Christianity and commerce, bring European
civilization to Africa and suppress the slave trade.
While Europeans sat in Berlin discussing the fate of
Africa, not a single African person was consulted or
invited to the conference.

Illustrated by the English cartoonist Edward
Linley Sambourne (1844-1910), “The Rhodes
Colossus” represents European plans for
Africa. A play on words, the image mimics the
famous Colossus of Rhodes (one of the seven
wonders of the ancient world) by depicting
Cecil Rhodes (1853-1902) holding a telegraph
line signifying his desire to have a rail and
telegraph line from “Cape to Cairo” to better
control and profit from the British presence in
Africa. Here Cecil Rhodes is depicted as an
almost unstoppable giant who looms over the
whole continent. The image speaks to British
power and the imperialists’ desire to rule and
control Africa for their benefit. At the time of
the publication, Cecil Rhodes served as prime
minister of Cape Colony (part of what would
later become South Africa) and had been a
founding member of De Beers Consolidated
Mines. This image became widely reprinted
and is closely associated with the “scramble
for Africa” and British imperialism.

Anticipating new rules about acquiring territory
in Africa, King Leopold II of Belgium (1835-1909)
employed a variety of methods to make it appear
as if Belgium had long and substantial ties with
Central Africa. His plans worked, for at the Berlin
Conference, Leopold was recognized as the head of

Leopold II’s Congo Free State was rife with violence.
With the Congo Free State now in hand, Leopold and
his agents were desperate to extract wealth. European
companies were allowed nearly free reign and, to
maximize profit, employed a host of oppressive and
violent tactics to appropriate land and coerce labor.

at an astounding rate. Due to their brutal and
indiscriminate killing of elephants, European hunters
and merchants had, by the mid-1890s, virtually wiped
out their source of profits. Leopold had mismanaged
his colony and exploited, mistreated and abused the
indigenous Congolese.

Belgian efforts to extract profits from the Congo Free
State initially centered around ivory elephant tusks.
Demand for ivory was high and European companies,
without any thought as to the lives of African elephants
or the sustainability of the trade, harvested ivory

However, Leopold would be granted a second chance to
glean profits from his colony. Scottish-born John Boyd
Dunlop’s (1840-1921) development of the pneumatic
tire led to an increased demand for rubber, which came
from the sap of a tree that grew readily in the Congo.

Having learned nothing from his previous efforts,
Leopold once again allowed European companies free
reign to harvest rubber plants in the Congo. These
companies gave little consideration to the people
harvesting the crop. To increase profit and production,
company officials and their security forces began
cutting off the hands and feet of Africans to intimidate
them into working faster. Journalist Edmund Morel
(1873-1924) would learn and later expose the truth
of what was happening in the colony. In response to
international pressure, Leopold II handed over his
private colony to the Belgian state in 1908.

AFRICAN RESISTANCE TO
EUROPEAN IMPERIALISM

In the late 1800s, many European nations rushed to
take part in the “scramble for Africa.” Great Britain
led the way, controlling Egypt, Sudan, Kenya and
South Africa. France established French West Africa,
which included Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Ivory
Coast, Dahomey and Nigeria, and French Equatorial
Africa, which consisted of Chad, Gabon and parts of
the Congo. Germany maintained colonies in Burundi,
Tanzania and Rwanda. Even tiny Belgium’s ruler King

The First Italo-Ethiopian War of 1895-1896 represented
an important example of successful African resistance
to European imperialism. Following the unification of
Italy in 1871, Italian leaders sought to gain overseas
colonies to provide raw resources for Italy’s growing
industrial sector, find new lands for poor Italians to
settle, and gain the prestige that came from being a
colonial power. In 1889, Italy and Ethiopia signed the
Treaty of Wuchale by which the Ethiopian Emperor
Menelik II (1844-1913) acceded to Italy’s demands to
occupy the province of Eritrea in return for Italian and
British recognition of his regime. Deliberately writing
different versions of the treaty in Italian and Amharic
(one of the major languages of wider communication
in Ethiopia), Italian diplomats claimed that Ethiopia
had agreed to become an Italian protectorate. When
Menelik II repudiated the treaty, Italian troops invaded
in 1895. Aided by Empress Tatyu Betal (1851-1918),
Menelik raised a 100,000-man army that included
all the ethnic and religious minorities of Ethiopia.
This powerful army won a significant victory over
Italian forces at the Battle of Adwa in March 1896.
In the Treaty of Addis Ababa (1896), Italy recognized
Ethiopia’s independence.

The son of the Negus (King) Haile Melekot
(1824-1855) and a palace servant named
Ejigayehu Lemma Adyamo, Menelik
was captured by the Ethiopian Emperor
Tewodros II (1818-1868) and married
to his daughter Altash. Following
Tewodros’s suicide in 1868, Menelik
slowly built up allies among Ethiopia’s
different ethnic groups and European
powers such as the French and Italians.
In 1883, he married his third wife, Taytu
Betul. A member of the ruling family
of Semien Province, Tatyu’s dynastic
marriage to Menelik helped him solidify
his claim as Ethiopian emperor in 1889.
Together they founded the capital of
Addis Ababa (New Flower) on the site
of her imperial home. During the First
Italo-Ethiopian War, Menelik and Tatyu
worked tirelessly to rally the people of
Ethiopia to resist the invading Italian
forces. Following the war, the imperial
couple helped to introduce post offices,
electricity, motor cars and railroads to
Ethiopia. Menelik died in 1909, Tatyu
passed away four years later.

In addition to Menelik and Tatyu, Samori Ture (18281900) led a spirited resistance to European imperialism
in West Africa. Born into the Mandika of Guinea in the
1830s, Samori created a coalition of Muslim groups
that conquered parts of Mali, Senegal and the Ivory
Coast to create the Wassoulou Empire in the 1860s.
Although a skilled warrior, Samori lacked modern
European-style artillery. He accordingly signed a
treaty with the French Empire, giving up some land in
return for a non-aggression pact. However, constant
violations of the treaty by French colonial forces led
to the outbreak of war in 1892. Adopting a “scorched
earth” policy, Samori fled eastwards with his entire
population. Although captured by the French six years
later, Samori still remains one of the most revered antiimperialist leaders in African history.

While Samori fought the French in Guinea, a Matumbiborn Muslim prophet named Kinjikitile “Bokero”
Ngwale (d. 1905) led the Maji Maji Rebellion against the
German colonial government of Tanganyika. Urging his
followers to put aside their ethnic differences, Bokero
insisted that the “holy water” or maji he gave them
would stop German bullets. Although executed by
German officials in 1905, his followers held out against
German forces for another two years. Over 100,000
died in the uprising.

(1728-1779) in the late 1760s and 1770s, Australia
began as a penal colony in 1787. By the time the British
government stopped shipping convicts to Australia
in 1869, over 160,000 prisoners had been deported
to the colony. By the late 1800s, Europeans began
voluntarily migrating to Australia in larger numbers.
They came mostly to farm or herd sheep. Boasting an
impressive export economy, Australia attracted foreign
investors and their capital. To encourage migration
and the growth of trade, immigrants were offered free
passage and free land. The discovery of gold in Victoria
in 1851 also accelerated migration. When Cook first

New Zealand developed along a different path.
Resistance from the Māori people made settlement
more difficult for Europeans, many of whom chose
to relocate to Australia. Australia and New Zealand
gained responsible government over the 19th century
as the British parliament allowed the larger Europeandominated colonies within its empire more control
over local affairs. The politics of these places, then and
now, were heavily influenced by British traditions.
Even today, Australia and New Zealand are a part of
the British Commonwealth and remain constitutional
monarchies.

MIDDLE EAST
In the Islamic regions of the Middle East, the 17th
and 18th centuries constituted periods of reform and
change as well as losses of influence and power. The
quest to control the Mediterranean was aided by a
European victory at the battle of Lepanto in 1571.
Despite its defeat, the Ottoman Empire remained a
potent force in the Middle East, North Africa and the
Balkans. Subsequently, the Ottomans took over Tunis
from the Spanish Habsburg Empire in 1574, Fez from
the Portuguese in 1578 and Crete and Venice in 1669.
Murad III (1574-1595) also conquered parts of the
Caucasus and Azerbaijan in 1576. Wars in the 17th
century with European powers led to the loss of Hungary,
the Banat of Temesvár, Transylvania and Bukovina. In

1812, the Ottomans also lost parts of their holdings
along the Black Sea. In Anatolia and the Balkans, local
ruling elites increasingly took control using nationalist
uprisings, particularly among groups of Christians, to
their advantage.
Many usurped the Ottoman tax system by sending
only small amounts to the Ottoman government. The
Ottoman rulers of Istanbul seemed oblivious to the
resistance going on in the provinces. In the early 18th
century, during the Tulip period (1717-1730), some
Ottoman elites began to imitate European lifestyles
and dress. Sultan Ahmad III (1703-1730) established
his summer residences along the Bosporus River and
the Golden Horn, containing gardens inspired by
those of the French royal family at Versailles. Tulips,
originally wildflowers from central Asia, became not
only popular throughout the Ottoman Empire but
were also imported to Holland by Oghier Ghislain
de Busbecq (1522-1592), an ambassador of Emperor
Ferdinand I (1503-1564) to the Ottoman court.
This led to the spread of tulips across Europe. The
printing press also found its way into the Ottoman
empire, helping to disseminate history, geography
and literature books written in Turkish. The
responses toward Western imperialism and advances
were initially filtered into state-directed reforms that
tried to stop Western influences, in particular those
regarding religion and culture.

In the 19th century, the three Muslim empires that had
once dominated the Middle East and Asia were either
overthrown or significantly weakened. The Mughals in
India, the Safavids in Persia and the Ottoman Empire
had been reduced by attacks from with Western forces
with more advanced military and financial resources.
As we learn in other chapters, Britain turned India into
a crown colony. Persia was sandwiched between the
Russian and British spheres of influence and power.
After 1830, the Ottomans experienced a continuous
loss of territory, especially in North Africa.

occupied Sudan and founded Khartoum. He fought
the Ottomans in Syria but lost his navy to a combined
Anglo-French fleet. Foreign powers – primarily
French and British – increasingly invested in Egypt by
building the Suez Canal and constructing railroads.
Lavish spending by him and his sons bankrupted the
country, forcing the rulers of Egypt to sell their shares
in the Suez Canal Company to Britain. Eventually,
Britain installed Muhammad Pasha’s grandson as the
new viceroy, or khedive, in charge of Egypt, a position
he held until 1922.

In 1798, Napoleon invaded Egypt, but he and his army
were eventually expelled in 1804 by an Anglo-Ottoman
alliance. Egypt became independent under the military
governor Muhammad Ali Pasha (1769-1849). The
long reign of the Albanian Ali Pasha allowed him to
establish some reforms. He had served in the Ottoman
army against the French, which made him aware of
European military superiority and that it only was
possible to defeat European powers if military reforms
were initiated. He scouted out information from France,
established munition industries and modernized the
educational and public health system. He supported
private landownership and focused on cash crop
production of sugar and cotton. He also invaded
other areas to expand his territory and influence. Ali

During the late 19th century, a complicated situation
arose in Sudan. Muhammad Ahmad (1844-1885), also
called the Mahdi, led a successful uprising against the
Egyptian and British presence between 1881-1885. The
Mahdiyya or Mahdist rebellion was a complex blend
of traditional African religions, fundamentalist Islam
and nationalism. When Muhammad Ahmad came
out of the struggle victorious, he soon established
traditional Sharia courts in Sudan in the hope of further
strengthening and legitimizing his rule. Ahmad would
hold power until the British, in 1898, established the
protectorate of Sudan.
While the Ottoman Empire had to deal with the loss of
territory, the Qajar family took control of Iran in 1794
by deposing Lotf ’ Ali Khan (c.1769-1794), the last Shah
of the Zand dynasty. Adopting European-style military,
technological and educational influences, Qajar rulers
expanded into the Caucasus but lost the territories
of modern-day Georgia, Dagestan, Azerbaijan and
Armenia to the Russian Empire. Under the Qajar dynasty,
the idea of the Iranian kingship became reinvigorated.
Shah Naser al-Din (1831-1896) introduced major
reforms focused on the modernization of his military.
Military and commercial relationships with the West
led to Iran's encounter with the world market, which
allowed western goods to flood Iran’s internal markets.

Anglo-Russian Convention acknowledged Russian
influence in northern Persia as the British claimed
control over the south. The Persian Constitutional
Revolution (1905-1911) led to the creation of a
constitutional monarchy. Not only were the Shahs
losing power, but as foreign influence increased, it was
outsiders who increasingly made the decisions for Iran.
This encouraged the military officer Reza Khan (18781944) to attempt to seize control of the government. In
1925, Khan now formally known as Reza Shah created
a new state officially called the Imperial State of Persia.
Worried about both the Soviets and the British, Reza
Shah undertook a series of reforms to modernize Iran.
Many of the reforms in the Middle East during the
18th and 19th centuries were state-directed and open
to Western influences. However, fundamentalist Islamic
movements such as Wahabism, as it developed in Saudi
Arabia, provided counterparts to modernist influences

SOUTHEAST ASIA 1500-1750
For the countries of mainland Southeast Asia—Burma
(Myanmar), Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam—
the period from 1500-1750 was predominantly marked
by political consolidation into Buddhist kingdoms.
Growing access to European gunpowder weapons
allowed local kings to expand their territories. For
example, King Bayinnaung (1551-1581) helped expand
Burmese political and economic influence into Japan
and throughout the region. As the population of the
region grew, local governments became larger and
demanded more taxes, and this encouraged a shift away
from subsistence agriculture toward cash crops such
as sugar. Buddhist kings profited from such trade and
taxation. As a means of both legitimizing their rule and
demonstrating their power, these kings invested in the
creation of religious texts, libraries, monasteries and
Buddhist temples.
Both the Chinese and Japanese wished to expand their
influence throughout Asia. While China’s primary
influence in neighboring areas like Vietnam or Burma
remained primarily economic, Japan sought political
control over areas such as Taiwan, which it conquered
in 1895. The four colonial powers in the region—

different Malay states against one another, eventually
creating a protectorate over the entire region in 1909.
Both Burma and Malaysia underwent rapid economic
growth under the British. In addition to building railways
and developing steam navigation and oil drilling, Burma
also increased rice cultivation and produced timber
and teakwood. The port of Rangoon (Yangon), the
colonial capital, developed into a significant transaction
crossroads for the region. Tin mining developed in
Malaya, and Chinese laborers were recruited to work
in the mines. In time, Chinese immigrants came to
represent nearly half the population of Singapore. A
large concentration of Chinese also migrated to Kuala
Lumpur, the colonial capital of the Federated Malay
States. Indian laborers likewise became a sizable
population in Singapore and throughout Burma. For the
greater part of the 19th century, Malaysia was divided
into the British-owned straits settlements – Penang,
Melaka and Singapore, whose sultanates became British
client states. In 1895, British officials consolidated all of
Malaysia under their rule.

Siam (Thailand), located between the British in Burma
and Malaya and the French in Indochina, retained its
independence from colonial powers throughout this
period. King Mongkut (1851-1868) brought western
science and political techniques to the nation. Although
forced to grant Britain and France extraterritoriality

Portrait of Jeremias van Vliet
Historically, many southeast Asian women
worked as merchants. As women traditionally
managed households, working as merchants
was seen as an extension of their domestic
duties. Osoet Pegua (1615-1658) represented
one such individual. Little is known about her
life. In fact, no portrait of Osoet was ever made.
Born in 1615 in Ayutthaya, the capital of Thailand
(Siam), Osoet was of Burmese and Mon descent.
At a young age, she began working at the walled
compound of the Dutch East India Company
(Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC).
Quickly learning Dutch, the 16-year-old Osoet
began a relationship with Dutch trader Jan van
Meerwijck. Following van Meerwijck’s death,
Osoet married Jeremias van Vliet (c. 1602-1663),
the leading VOC official in Thailand, in 1638.
Over the next four years, the couple produced
three daughters. Over time, Osoet became
an intermediary between King Prasat Thong
(c. 1600-1656) and the VOC. However, when
Dutch officials recalled van Vliet to Batavia over
corruption charges, King Thong refused to let
Osoet or her daughters leave Thailand. Osoet
then formed a relationship with junior VOC
partner Jan van Muijden. Using the hapless van
Muijden as a proxy, Osoet effectively took over
the management of the VOC office in Ayutthaya.
Under her capable leadership, the VOC secured
record profits and gained considerable influence
with the Thai royal court. Following her death in
1658, King Sanpet VI (1630-1656) allowed for her
to be buried in the Dutch compound in Ayutthaya
and permitted her children to immigrate to the
Netherlands.

Regional wars and epidemics also swept across
southeast Asia during this time. The Kingdoms of Lan
Xang and Lanna (current day Laos) fought off a series
of invasions from Thailand and Vietnam. Under the
capable leadership of King Settathirath (1534-1571),
the unified kingdoms of Lan Xang and Lanna began
a period of rebuilding and economic development.
From the 800s to the 1600s the Khmer Empire
flourished in what is today Cambodia. Under the able
reign of Jayavarman II (c. 700-850) and Jayavarman
VII (c. 1122-1218) the Khmer built complex temples
and palaces such as Angkor Wat. However, a series of
civil wars in the 1400s allowed King Borommaracha
II (1424-1448) of Thailand to conquer Khmer in 1432.
For the next four centuries, Cambodia would remain
a Thai vassal state.
China politically and economically dominated
southeast Asia until the 19th century. In 1862, the
French Empire used the persecution of French
Catholic missionaries as a reason to invade the
southern provinces of Vietnam, including the strategic
port of Saigon. By 1885, French forces occupied
northern Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. French
colonists used forced labor to create massive rice and
rubber plantations along the Mekong delta. Under
the pretense of “civilizing” the Vietnamese, French
officials renamed the region French Indochina,
forced Vietnamese to adopt French names, learn the
French language and convert to Roman Catholicism.
To avoid prison, the Vietnamese opposition leader
Ho Chi Minh (1890-1969) traveled abroad. During
this time, he visited France, Britain, the United States,
the Soviet Union and China. Converting to socialism,
Ho became head of the Vietnamese communist party,
through which he created a resistance movement to
overthrow the French imperial regime.
137

While Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia struggled to
survive Chinese and French expansion, the people of
the Philippines struggled to resist Spanish domination.
In 1521, Admiral Ferdinand Magellan (1480-1521),
leading a fleet of five ships, claimed the Philippines for
Spain. In 1565, a Spanish invasion fleet seized the island
of Luzon and established a colonial capital at Manila.
From 1565 – 1821, Spanish officials in Mexico City
administered the Philippines as part of the viceroyalty
of New Spain. Following the independence of Mexico
in 1821, the Philippines became a royal colony
governed from Madrid. Spanish officials in Manila

used lavish gifts to forge alliances with local chiefs.
Over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, Manila
became a Spanish settlement filled with merchants,
soldiers, Catholic missionaries and some bureaucrats
that would stay connected to Mexico City. Outside
of Manila, a Chinese merchant community began to
form. Many Chinese converted to Catholicism and
intermarried with local elites.
Catholic missionaries from several orders established
hundreds of schools and rural churches, most
concentrated in the islands of the north and some in

Emilio Aguinaldo

One of the leading figures of Philippine independence,
Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy was born into a wealthy family of
Chinese and Tagalog descent in Cavite el Viejo on March
22, 1869. He attended the Colegio de San Juan de Letran
and became a captain-general of his home province in
1895. Aguinaldo became involved with the Katipunan, a
secret society that led an armed resistance against Spanish
colonial rule the following year. Becoming a skilled insurgent
known as “Magdeleno” (after Mary Magdalene), Aguinaldo
and his “Magdelano” forces became known for carrying out
planned attacks on Spanish colonial forces. For instance, at
the Battle of Zapote Bridge in February 1897, Aguinaldo ordered his troops to ring a local
bridge with dynamite and lace the river beneath with punji sticks. When a Spanish army
of 12,000 attempted to cross, the Magdelenos destroyed the bridge and routed the army.
In March, representatives of the Philippine revolutionary government elected Aguinaldo as
its generalissimo. In October 1897, Aguinaldo commissioned the creation of a constitution
that further legitimized his regime. Following extensive negotiations with Spanish officials,
Aguinaldo agreed to cease resistance, dissolve his government and go into exile in Hong Kong.
When the Spanish-American War broke out in 1898, Commodore George Dewey arranged for
Aguinaldo to be brought to the Philippines to create a new revolutionary government. After a
prolonged siege, Spanish authorities surrendered Manila to American forces. Although Spain
agreed to cede the Philippines to the U.S. in return for $20 million, Aguinaldo declared the
creation of a provisional Philippine republic in January 1899. Aguinaldo would lead a guerilla
war against occupying U.S. forces for the next two years. Captured by American forces in
Luzon on March 23, 1901, Aguinaldo acceded to U.S. control of the Philippines. Ironically,
when imperial Japanese forces invaded the Philippines in December 1941, Aguinaldo reemerged to lead a pro-Japanese collaborationist government. On February 1942, Aguinaldo
took to the airwaves to give his “Bataan Address,” which urged American forces in the
Philippines to lay down their arms. Captured when American troops retook the islands in
1945, Aguinaldo was released from prison under a general amnesty for all former Japanese
collaborators. He then lived a quiet life in retirement, dying in 1962.

the south reaching through the Visaya archipelago and
into northern Mindanao. Resistance against Spanish
encroachment grew and a group of nationalists,
including José Rizal (1861-1896), demanded reform.
By 1896, the reform movement had grown to include
militant elements, including a secret society known as
the Katipunan, which started an armed revolt against
Spain. Arrested and found guilty of treason, Rizal was
executed by means of a firing squad on December 30,
1896. In doing so, Spanish authorities turned Rizal
into a martyr in the cause of Philippine independence.
In 1898, the Spanish-American war reached the

Philippines, and nationalist hero Emilio Aguinaldo
(1869-1964) declared independence from Spain on
June 12, 1898, which would lead to the establishment of
the First Philippine Republic on January 21, 1899.
Spain turned the Philippines, along with Puerto Rico and
Guam, over to the U.S. following the American victory
in the Spanish-American War (1898). Consequently,
the Philippine-American War (1899-1902) broke
out. More than 200,000 Filipinos died, mostly due to
famine and disease. The Philippines would not gain its
independence until 1946.

SUMMARY
By 1900, most of Africa and Asia lay under the direct or indirect control of an imperialist power. In just
a few centuries, the divided nations of Western Europe had become powerful empires with modern
militaries, governments and economies. While Britain reigned over the largest number of territories, other
nations like France, Germany and Italy held sizable empires. Although designed to enrich the home
countries, imperialism had the effect of spreading European politics, science, technology, economic
beliefs, religion and even popular sports across much of the developing world. This era also witnessed
the origins of local independence movements, which in time would lead to nationalist movements across

The 20th century brought profound changes to the
world. The outbreak of the First World War led to the
emergence of newly independent nations, dismantling
of monarchies, and millions of deaths at the hands
of totalitarian regimes. Those who opposed these
authoritarian states were exiled or killed as dictatorial
leaders sought to control nearly every aspect of the
state. The key events of this period examined in this
140

chapter (World War I, the Russian Revolution, and
the struggle for independence in India), helped set
the stage for not only the emergence of nationalist
movements across the world but also global economic
and political transformations that eventually triggered
the rise of Nazi Germany and the arrival of a new
conflict, World War II.

CHAPTER 11 WORLD IN CRISIS, CONFLICT, AND THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE

WORLD WAR I
Fought between 1914 to 1918, World War I constituted
the first global conflict in history. At the end of the
conflict, 40 million combatants and civilians lay dead,
120 million were displaced, the infrastructures of a dozen
European countries were in ruins, and the political map
of Europe had been fundamentally transformed.

Austrian Prince Klemens von Metternich (1773-1859)
promoted the concept of a “balance of power” in which
European nations would join systems of interlocking
alliances. This would prevent war as no country would
dare risk a regional dispute exploding into a larger war.
Although precarious, the balance of power prevented a
large battle on European soil for nearly a century. By the

In 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Empire represented
a large, multiethnic state. Millions of Serbians living
within the empire desired independence. On June 28,
1914, Serbian revolutionary Gavrilo Princip (18941918) assassinated the Austro-Hungarian Archduke
Franz Ferdinand (1863-1914) and his wife Sophia
(1868-1914) in Sarajevo. When Serbia refused Austria’s

Serbian nationalists, Austro-Hungary responded with
a declaration of war on Serbia. Serbia’s ally and fellow
Slavic nation Russia declared war on Austro-Hungary.
Germany declared war on Russia and Britain, with
France responding by declaring war on Germany.

troops before Allied forces abandoned the campaign.
In May 1916, British and German naval forces fought
a bloody but inconclusive battle off the coast of Danish
Jutland. On July 1, 1916, the Battle of the Somme broke
out. The battle resulted in an Entente victory. A total of
1,500,000 died, on both sides, during the battle.

Both sides expected a quick victory in the conflict.
However, the development of modern military
technology, including Browning machine guns, mustard
gas, airplanes and eventually tanks, quickly outstripped
the 19th-century battle tactics familiar to most European
generals. With cavalry impractical against machine
guns, millions of soldiers hunkered down in trenches
and sniped at one another across miles of devastated
countryside dubbed “no man’s land.” Soldiers in the
trenches battled not just the enemy but also “trench foot,”
snakes, rats and the elements.
At the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914, over
half a million German, British and French troops were
killed. From February 1915 to January 1916, Entente
soldiers (many of whom were from Australia and New
Zealand) attempted to attack the Ottoman’s Dardanelles
Straits. The Entente lost over half a million men before
abandoning plans to knock the Ottomans out of the
war. The Battle of Verdun represented one of the most
protracted battles of World War I. On February 21, 1916,
German forces launched a major offensive to take Paris.
The battle lasted 10 months and killed a total of 600,000

The Christmas Truce of 1914 is considered one of the most
unusual events in warfare. At 8:30 p.m. on December 24,
1914 (Christmas Eve), German troops lit candles in their
trenches and began singing carols and wishing Merry
Christmas to their British rivals across No Man’s Land.
British troops began serenading the Germans, and the
two groups sent out scouts to assess the situation. Soon
soldiers from the two armies were pledging not to fire
on one another. All up and down the front, men walked

across no man’s land to shake hands, sing carols, toast
one another and exchange presents. Impromptu bands
were formed to provide musical entertainment while
other soldiers participated in a pick-up football game.
Although many soldiers participated in the truce, active
fighting continued in other theaters. Worried about the
effect such fraternization might have on morale, British
and French officers forbade any future celebrations with
enemy troops.

The First World War represented a total war that
consumed all aspects of the societies involved in the
conflict. Both Britain and Germany blockaded one
another’s coasts. Neutral nations like the United States
made tremendous war profits trading with one side or
the other. For the most part, Americans wished to stay
out of the war. This changed when a German submarine
sank the British freighter Lusitania in 1915, killing 1,195
people (including 123 Americans), which encouraged
more Americans to speak out in favor of war against
the Triple Alliance. Although the Germans promised
to stop sinking non-military vessels, they resumed
unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917. At the
same time, newspaper stories about a document known
as the Zimmerman Telegram surfaced. The purported
telegram revealed a scheme between Germany and
Mexico by which Mexico would use German aid to
invade the United States and regain lands lost in the
U.S.-Mexican War of the 1840s. Although he had been
re-elected in 1916 on the campaign slogan “he kept us
out of war,” U.S. President Woodrow Wilson (18561924) bowed to public demand and, on April 6, 1917,
asked Congress for a declaration of war.

years of stalemates and defeats on the Eastern Front,
millions of ordinary Russians demanded that Czar
Nicholas II (1868-1918) withdraw from the war.
Radical Russian socialists, known as Bolsheviks, made
successful inroads with peasants and workers sick of
war. Seizing the opportunity, German officials secretly
shipped Russian Communist leader Vladimir Lenin
(1870-1924) back to Russia. In October 1917, Lenin’s
Bolsheviks captured many of the major cities in Russia
and instituted the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics
(USSR). The “October Revolution” would have
tremendous consequences for the subsequent histories
of the 20th and 21st centuries.

Reinforced by American troops and equipment, Entente
forces began an all-out push against Germany in October
1918. Deserting their former ally, the Ottomans and
Austria-Hungary signed separate peace treaties with
the Entente. Unable to continue a sustained resistance
to the Entente Powers, Germany agreed to an armistice
on November 11, 1918. At the Paris Peace Conference
held in January 1919, Woodrow Wilson insisted that
Europeans agree to a peace plan along American lines,
as outlined in his “Fourteen Points.” One of these

without resorting to war. However, European leaders
like British Prime Minister David Lloyd-George (18631945) and French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau
(1841-1929) demanded that Germany alone accept
responsibility for the war and make steep reparation
payments to the victors. Even in the United States,
Congress rejected the Paris Peace Treaty and voted
against joining the League of Nations. In addition, by
denying Germany and the USSR representation at the
Versailles Conference and saddling millions of Germans
with high taxes to pay for reparations, the victorious
Entente powers helped set the stage for World War II.
Before, during and even after the war, there was much
opposition to World War I, including from socialist,
anarchist, syndicalist and Marxist groups, even Christian
pacifists. While leaders of the Social Democratic Party
of Germany (SPD) encouraged their members to vote
against a coming war, in the end they voted for the war
on August 4, 1914. Left-wing forces such as the Russian
Bolsheviks and the socialist faction of the Social
Democratic Party of Germany, led by Karl Liebknecht

(1871-1919) and Rosa Luxemburg (1871-1919), were
vehemently opposed to the war and the support of the
German Parliament to fund the war. In 1916, Liebknecht
and Luxemburg founded the anti-war Spartacus League
(Spartakusbund), which later became the basis of the
Communist Party of Germany. Producing anti-war
pamphlets signed with Spartacus after the leader of
the slave uprising in the Roman Republic, Liebknecht
and Luxemburg organized anti-war strikes and were
eventually incarcerated in 1916 and sentenced to 2
1/2 years in prison. Following the German November
revolution, which led to the abdication of Emperor
Wilhelm II (1859-1941) in 1918, the Independent
Social Democratic Party (USPD) with which the
Spartacus League was affiliated, and which consisted of
anti-war former Social Democrats, as well as the Social
Democratic Party of Germany, assumed power in the
new Weimar Republic. Released from prison just before
the signing of the armistice on November 11, 1918,
Liebknecht and Luxemburg were founding members of
the Communist Party of Germany.

The newly formed Communist Party was dedicated to
undermining the current government. Seen as the chief
instigators, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were targeted
and eventually assassinated by the Cavalry Guards of
the Freikorps (Garde-Kavallerie-Schützendivision)
on 15 January 1919. The killing of the two communist
leaders caused increased upheaval and violence across
Germany. It continued to deepen the divide within the
German left, which eventually was one of the causes

146

that strengthened right-wing forces in the German
political landscape and led to the eventual rise of Adolf
Hitler and the National Socialist Party of Germany. The
murder of Luxemburg and Liebknecht did not weaken
the Communist Party of Germany, which remained a
major party during the Weimar Republic (1918-1933)
and was a leading voice in the underground resistance
movement in Nazi Germany.

which ended up becoming the francophone part of
Cameroon, and one-fifth, bordering Nigeria, became
British. In East Africa, the German general LettowVorbeck (1870-1964) scored victory after victory as
his troops marched undefeated through Mozambique,
Nyasaland and northeastern Rhodesia.

AFRICA AND THE FIRST
WORLD WAR
Although primarily considered a European
phenomenon, a considerable amount of fighting during
World War I occurred in Africa. Working together,
British and French forces attacked German colonies
in Africa, including invading, and then partitioning,
Cameroon and Togo. Togo became French, while
four-fifths of Cameroon was occupied by the French,

The campaigns in Cameroon and East Africa had
devastating consequences for the African population.
Villages were often burnt, and food supplies were
confiscated by European troops, leading to famines,
such as the one in Rwanda from 1916-1918. Many
Africans employed as porters for the armies in the
East African campaign died of malnutrition, disease or
overwork. Most of the troops fighting for the colonial
powers in Africa were Africans, but these troops
might also be sent to Europe. The French conscripted
over 600,000 Africans into the army. In the French
army alone, 30,000 African troops died fighting in
Europe. Conscription led to widespread rebellions
against French colonial control. Part of this resistance
to colonial powers was spurred by the paradox of the
colonial soldier who had been treated as an equal in war
but not outside of it.

THE STRUGGLE FOR
INDIAN INDEPENDENCE
During the latter part of the 19th century, a new, more
direct form of Indian nationalism developed. Indians
were well aware that other parts of the empire had
been given more control over local affairs, a process
the British had resisted in India. Over a million Indians
volunteered to serve during the First World War. Many
expected that, due to their sacrifices, after the war, they
would be granted more control over the running of
India. The British did hire and promote more Indians
within the civil service but ultimately refused to hand

over actual control. As such, British India continued to
be run by the British to serve and enrich Britain.
After the war, discontent in India grew as inflation,
high taxes and an influenza pandemic put many people
on edge. Failing to fix the underlying problems and
increasingly fearful of rebellion, the British extended
wartime emergency measures, which prevented Indians
from gathering or protesting British rule. The violence
of British rule could be seen on April 13, 1919 when

way to confront and end Natal’s discriminatory laws.
After some soul searching, which included reading
Hindu and Christian texts, Gandhi developed a
form of non-violent resistance known as satyagraha.
Roughly translated as “soul force,” satyagraha is a
non-violent protest in which the protester tries to
alter the oppressor through love, compassion and a
demonstration of resolve.
Gandhi organized protests to draw attention to the
unfair and discriminatory laws. Tired of the disruption
and bad press, in 1914, the government of Natal
abolished a slew of discriminatory laws, including
unfair taxation of Indian workers and property owners;
they recognized non-Christian marriage and agreed to
continue to allow free non-indentured Indian people to
remain and to immigrate to Natal.
General Reginald Dyer ordered his men to open fire on
a crowd that had gathered to celebrate a Sikh religious
festival. According to British figures (which some claim
are far too low), the Amritsar Massacre killed 379
people and wounded more than 1,000. The violence of
Amritsar encouraged many to join the movement for
Indian independence.
Mohandas Gandhi (1869-1948) is most closely
associated with this new push for self-rule. Born
into a relatively wealthy family, Gandhi studied law
in England. In 1893, he became involved in a labor
dispute in the Colony of Natal in Southeast Africa.
In Natal, Gandhi came face-to-face with the poor
conditions suffered by migrant Indian workers.
Similar to elsewhere, especially in the Caribbean,
plantation owners in Natal had imported thousands
of indentured laborers from India. After completing
their indentureship, some wished to stay in Natal,
but new and increasingly strict regulations limited
their freedom and discriminated against them. This
included an 1896 law that stripped Indians of the right
to vote. Learning firsthand that while the courts could
be a valuable tool for change, they could be ignored by
oppressive governments, Gandhi wanted a more direct

CHAPTER 11 WORLD IN CRISIS, CONFLICT, AND THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE

Returning to India a national hero (he received the
moniker “mahatma,” meaning great soul) in 1915,
Gandhi wanted to learn more about his native land.
As he toured around India, Gandhi witnessed how the
repressive and discriminatory laws of the British held
India back. Developing a version of Indian independence
rooted in the traditions of the village, Gandhi advocated
that people use non-violence to free India from British
rule. He asked Indians to stop supporting colonialism by
boycotting British products, to stop working for the British
state, and to no longer pay unfair and predatory taxes.

Map of the Partition of India

During the 1920s, Gandhi successfully turned the
Indian National Congress (a nationalist political party)
into a mass movement capable of challenging British
rule. With the help of Gandhi, the independence
movement grew in power and popularity. Gandhi
worked toward his vision of a multicultural and
free India based on mutual respect. Employing his
direct non-violent stance, Gandhi and his supporters
demanded that Britain “Quit India.”

During the 1930s and 1940s, the power of another
independence group, the All-Indian Muslim League,
had increased. Led by Muhammed Ali Jinnah (18761948), the Muslim League wanted to partition India
into separate Hindu and Muslim states. This was in
direct opposition to the pluralistic cooperative state
envisioned by Gandhi. As it became increasingly
apparent that the British would be forced to ‘Quit’ India,

RUSSIAN REVOLUTION
The early 20th century was a period of social, political
and cultural change as important revolutions would
occur in Iran, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, Mexico and
China. These revolutions challenged the existing order
and sought to create states capable of better serving
their citizens and meeting the challenges of modernity.
In the early 20th century, Russia appeared like an
unlikely candidate for a communist revolution. Russian
troops and the secret police worked in tandem to quell
any discontent or calls for reform. Ruled by a czar, the
czar’s word was final, and he could, and often did, rule
with an iron fist. Russia had no tradition of democracy;
there was no freedom of the press or association. This
autocratic rule extended over a 5,000-mile expanse
and comprised more than a hundred different ethnic
and linguistic groups.
Russia had fallen behind the other Great Powers. At
the beginning of the 20th century, as other nations had
successfully industrialized, nine out of 10 Russians were
still peasants. The middle class was small and politically
still relatively weak as the czar and a small group of
aristocrats continued to hold most of the wealth and
power. During the second half of the 19th century,
partly due to fears of falling behind, Russia started to
invest in industry and had a small urban working class
by the turn of the century. Like elsewhere, these workers
were poorly paid, had virtually no rights, and worked
long hours in often dangerous conditions. The proof
of this falling behind could be found in Russia’s defeat

CHAPTER 11 WORLD IN CRISIS, CONFLICT, AND THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE

in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). Fought over
rising tensions and imperial ambitions, especially over
access and control over Pacific territories, the Japanese
victory confirmed their ascendency while highlighting
Russia’s failure to keep pace. This put pressure on the
czar and increased demands to reform the Russian state.

The Revolution would have to wait another 12 years.
The catalyst for this event was World War I. To change
Russian fortunes, Czar Nicholas went to the front
to take direct control of the army. The czar could not
change the war’s course as Germany drove deeper into
Russian territory.

Members of Russia’s middle class wanted reform.
Although divided over what to reform and how far
reform should be carried out, many desired for Russia
to become a Western-inspired constitutional monarchy
similar to what existed in Britain. They did not ask
for the dissolution of the monarchy or the aristocracy
but wanted to implement a parliamentary system that
would give them some say in how the government
operated. Czar Nicolas II (r. 1894-1917) refused to allow
significant reform or to alter his position and power.

The only thing keeping the czar on his throne was the
forces of law and order which had stayed loyal to him.
Even these elements began to waver. The final blow to the
czar’s rule came in 1917 when troops, instead of firing
on a crowd of protestors in St. Petersburg, joined the
protestors. Without power or protection, Czar Nicolas
II abdicated his throne. The following year, Nicholas,
his wife and five children were executed.

On January 22, 1905 (known as Bloody Sunday),
workers attempted to petition the czar by gathering
outside his palace in St. Petersburg. They called for
improved working conditions, better pay and an eighthour workday. They came in peace, singing songs like
God Save the Czar. Instead of hearing their demands
the unarmed subjects were met with bullets. While the
numbers vary widely, hundreds of people were killed by
bullets or from being trampled as people tried to flee.
This was a turning point for many Russians. After this,
the widely held belief that it was not the czar but his
ministers responsible for the problems in Russia seemed
to go up in smoke.
Coupled with the general discontent and disillusionment
with the poor progress against Japan, Bloody Sunday
led to a wave of strikes across the Russian Empire. These
events are called the Revolution of 1905. Needing to
calm the people, the czar agreed to a more limited form
of monarchy, a parliament called the Duma, and a new
Russian constitution. Czar Nicholas II did not believe in
these reforms, and as soon as discontent settled down,
he took back much of these concessions and tried to
rule as he always had. Going back on his word further
undermined the trust many had placed in the czar, Vladimir Lenin
serving to increase the number of people advocating for
reform or desiring a revolution.

With the czar out of the way, a new Provisional
government operated out of the Duma. Dominated
by liberal thinkers who wished to modernize Russia
without completely altering the current system, the
Provisional government failed to bring order to the
Russian state. It continued the war effort despite how
unpopular it had become. At the same time, the Russian
experiment with democracy spread to the local level
as workers elected councils called Soviets to govern
factories. These Soviets offered a rival government and
power structure to the Provisional government.
At this point, a long-time revolutionary named Vladimir
Ulyanov (known as Lenin) gained increasing notoriety
and power. Exiled for his revolutionary activities, Lenin
stayed committed to revolution in Russia. Indeed,
Lenin had written numerous influential pamphlets on
communism and Russia since leaving the country in
1900. He was critical of capitalism (which he believed,
just like Marx, would be done away with) and Russia’s
participation in World War I.

Still living in Zurich when the czar lost his throne in
1917, the 47-year-old Lenin knew the time was right
for his return, but Switzerland, which remained neutral
during the war, was surrounded, and it seemed that
there was no way to get to Russia. Aware that Lenin was
opposed to the war, the Germans agreed to put him on
a train home so that Lenin could use his influence to
agitate against the war effort. Once he arrived, Lenin
announced that the revolution would provide “peace,
land and bread.” Despite his years in exile, Lenin judged
the mood of Russians perfectly, which helped him win
sympathy for the communist cause.
While on the train from Switzerland, Lenin composed
his April Theses which called on communists to end
any support for the Provisional government. Caught
between the communists and those who wanted to reestablish the old system, the Provisional government
began to waver.

Called on to defend the desperate Provisional
government, the Soviets, instead of supporting the
government, overthrew it. This is known as the second
revolution. These actions ensured that the second
revolution was indeed a socialist one.
Lenin worked to establish peace with Germany. The
Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which finally got Russia out
of the war, stands as a testament to how badly Lenin
wanted peace, for he gave Germany some of Russia’s
most fertile and industrialized areas and a third of the
Russian population. Lenin defended losing so much
territory by stating that it did not matter, for soon, a
worldwide communist revolution would make such
treaties irrelevant. After years of fighting, losing so

much territory to Germany was, for many Russians, a
bitter pill to swallow.
Although he promised peace for the next nearly four
years, Russia would be involved in a devastating civil
war that pitted the communists against an alliance of
czarist forces and Russia’s former war allies (who hoped
to do away with Lenin and force Russia back into the
war). Luckily for Lenin, most troops from England,
France, Japan and the United States were withdrawn
after the war ended in 1918. As Commissar of War, Leon
Trotsky’s leadership played a crucial role in suppressing
the counterrevolution allowing the communists to
claim victory in the civil war.

153

After the civil war, Lenin turned his attention to
reforming Russia. True to his Marxist roots, Lenin
abolished private ownership of land and, to better
organize Russian industry, confiscated factories and
merged them into giant government-controlled
trusts. He established the legal equality of women,
including making divorce more accessible, while
implementing universal education. Lenin did not
seek consent for his actions as he had no intention
of letting the Soviets direct policy and quickly
brought them under the control of the Communist
party. He ruled like an autocrat, creating a party
dictatorship rather than a communist state along the
lines envisioned by Marx. Dying in January 1924, it
would be up to Lenin’s successors to bring forward
the revolution and the vision of a better and more
egalitarian world led by workers.

SUMMARY
World War I ushered in a new era of warfare. Not only had conflict become global, but it was now
much more destructive and deadly. The war also demonstrated how the modern state could be
reconstituted to fight what is now known as total war. The Russian Revolution led to the creation
of the first Marxist-inspired state. Sympathizers hoped that the Soviet Union would create a more
egalitarian society along Marxist-Leninist lines. Instead, a strong one-party authoritarian dictatorship
emerged that ruled with little opposition and increasing repression of alternative voices by sending
political opponents to forced labor camps. The independence movement in India gave birth to new
nations and forms of national conflict and struggle. The campaign for Indian independence inspired
other colonies to fight for sovereignty. The early decades of the 20th century presented numerous
issues and problems but also brought hope as dedicated groups all across the globe struggled for
increased freedoms and equality.

On December 13, 1918, U.S. President Woodrow
Wilson (1856-1924) arrived in Paris to streets thronged
with cheering crowds. Over the past 18 months,
Wilson had provided manpower and supplies crucial

and France. The first president ever to travel abroad to
negotiate a peace treaty, Wilson had journeyed to Paris
to participate in the 1919 Versailles Peace Conference.
Encouraged by such a warm reception from ordinary
Parisians, Wilson believed that if the conference
delegates would follow his “Fourteen Points,” that future
world wars could be prevented.

Woodrow Wilson’s proposed “Fourteen Points”
represented a combination of progressive political
thought, laissez-faire economics and old-fashioned
power politics. They included open treaties,
freedom of the seas, equal trade, a decrease in
armaments among all nations, and an adjustment
of the colonial claims of different countries. Wilson
also insisted on the evacuation of all Central Powers
forces from Russia, the restoration of the Belgium
government, the return of Alsace and Lorraine to
France, a readjustment of Italy’s border with Austria,
national self-determination for the ethnic minorities
of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, national selfdetermination for the peoples of the Balkans, and
the creation of Turkey and Poland as independent
nations. Lastly, Wilson suggested the creation
of a League of Nations to maintain world peace
and prevent future wars. The European delegates
at the Paris Peace Conference were amazed at
the boldness of Wilson’s proposal. French Prime
Minister Georges Clemenceau reportedly stated,
“God gave us the Ten Commandments, and we
broke them. Wilson gives us the Fourteen Points.
We shall see.”

156

A product of American progressivism, Wilson failed
to understand neither the deep-seated rivalries that
had triggered World War I nor the anger and despair
many Europeans grappled with in the wake of four
years of bloody warfare. For Prime Ministers George
Clemenceau of France (1841-1929), David LloydGeorge from Great Britain (1863-1945), and Vittorio
Orlando of Italy (1860-1952), there was no question
that the terms of the Versailles Peace Treaty upon the
defeated Triple Alliance would be harsh. In the final
version of the treaty, Germany was forced to reduce its
military to the size of a police force, give up territory
in the east to Poland and in the west to France, plus its
overseas colonies. Section 233 of the document likewise
laid the moral blame for the war entirely at Germany’s
feet. Most controversial, a Reparations Committee
set up by the Entente powers determined in 1921 that
Germany would pay $31.5 billion (in U.S. dollars) in war
reparations. As none of the Triple Alliance powers had
representation at Versailles and were forced to accept
either the treaty or military occupation, the war’s end
left Germans embittered. They scornfully referred to
the treaty as the Diktat (dictated peace) and repeatedly
sought ways to work around it.
One of the few Fourteen Points that the leaders of
Britain and France did not object to was the final one,
namely that “[a] general association of nations must
be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of
affording mutual guarantees of political independence
and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.”
The delegates at the Versailles Conference established
the Covenant of the League of Nations as part of the
Versailles Peace Treaty signed in 1919. Consisting of a
National Assembly, Executive Council and Secretariat,
the League sought to provide a forum for resolving
international disputes.

U.S.A. Resists League of Nations 1919
Although Wilson received the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize
for his efforts, a Republican-controlled Senate led by
Senator Henry Cabot Lodge (1850-1924) blocked U.S.
entry into the organization. Lodge was primarily angry
because the Republican Party had been afforded
no representation in the American delegation to the
Paris Peace Conference. Furious at this blow to his
plans, Wilson embarked on a national speaking tour
to drum up support for American entry into the league.
Suffering a stroke in Pueblo, Colorado in September
1919, Wilson would have diminished health for the
remainder of his presidency.

Perhaps the greatest threat faced by belligerents was
an influenza pandemic that swept the world. The
outbreak was dubbed the “Spanish flu” because while
other nations still at war suppressed information about
the pandemic, neutral Spain had no such newspaper
or press restrictions. Although its precise origins are
unknown, some believe that the disease may have
actually originated in Kansas. Spread throughout
the world by humans brought into close proximity in
wartime military camps and field hospitals, the disease

killed between 20-40 million worldwide (including
675,000 Americans) in just one year. Already caring for
millions of wounded veterans, doctors throughout the
world struggled to treat the influx of influenza victims.
Ironically, the fact that the American and European
public had recent experiences in wartime sacrifices
and government regulation of their lives meant that
they responded to medical demands for sanitation,
inoculations and vaccines with considerable maturity
and compliance.

CHAPTER 12 INTERWAR YEARS AND THE RISE OF FASCISM

In late 1923, the Allied Reparation Commission formed
a subcommittee headed by U.S. banker Charles G.
Dawes (1865-1951) to address the issue of German
war reparations. In April 1924, the committee offered
its proposal, known as the “Dawes Plan.” The scheme
reduced Germany’s annual reparation payments until
the nation’s economy recovered from hyperinflation.
The German government would replace its inflated
Papiermark with a new form of currency called the
Reichsmark, pegged to real estate rather than specie.
As a sign of good faith, France and Belgium would
withdraw their troops from the Ruhr Valley. U.S.
banks would loan Germany $200 million to rebuild
its economy and make reparation payments to Britain
and France, who would then use such funds to repay
American loans incurred during World War I. For his
efforts, Dawes would become U.S. Vice-President and
win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925.
So long as U.S. loans could guarantee German
reparation payments, the Dawes system functioned.
However, a stock market crash in October 1929 and a

subsequent depression, known as the Great Depression,
abruptly ended the conspicuous consumption which
had defined the 1920s. Between 1929-1932, the world’s
GDP fell by 15%. Savings and pensions were wiped
out, unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25%, and
prices for farm goods fell by nearly 70%. Under these
circumstances, American banks lacked the capital to
loan money to Germany. European and American
leaders floated different proposals to cancel Germany’s
reparation payments (and British and French loans to
the United States) but failed to reach a solution.
Ironically, the political instability of the 1920s triggered
a period of tremendous German artistic and cultural
expression. Walter Gropius (1883-1969) pioneered
international or rational architecture, which drew from
modernism to reflect the values of a young, urban
generation of Germans. Rejecting traditional European
architecture’s gilded and ornamental style, Gropius
created giant skyscrapers composed of glass and steel,
such as the Fagus building in Alfeld and the Haus am
Horn in Weimar.

became the center for a vibrant community of foreign

to experiment with new forms of artistic expression

Faulkner (1897-1962), F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940),
Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961), Ezra Pound (18851972) and Katherine Anne Porter (1890-1980) created
some of their most memorable works in Paris. AfricanAmericans, including Josephine Baker (1906-1975),
Langston Hughes (1901-1967) and Richard Wright
(1908-1960) likewise flocked to Paris to live and work
in an environment free of much of the racism they
encountered back home.

Although Italy was among the “Big Four” at the Paris
Peace Conference, the British, French and American
delegations did little to help them gain Austrian
territory. Italian resentment at the Treaty of Versailles
gave journalist and former socialist turned fascist Benito
Mussolini (1883-1945) political ammunition to use in
his rise to power. In March 1919, Mussolini formed
his first fasci di combattimento (fighting leagues).
Although he coopted certain progressive ideas, such as
an eight-hour workday and women’s suffrage, Mussolini
primarily pushed an anti-socialist message. A month
later, Mussolini’s “black shirts” burned down the offices
of a socialist newspaper in Milan and killed four people.
Within a year, fascists broke up strikes, suppressed labor
unions and intimidated political officials. From 19211922, known throughout Italy as the “biennio nero”
(two black years), Mussolini’s black shirts consolidated
their hold over the Italian political system.

over to him the official reins of power. For 18 months,
Mussolini served as part of a coalition government
but in early 1925, Mussolini ordered a crackdown on
all groups opposed to fascist rule. By 1927, he had
abolished elections, curtailed freedom of the press,
and outlawed opposition parties. The Organizzazione
di Vigilanza Repressione dell’Antifascismo or ORVA
(Organization for the Vigilant Repression of AntiFascism) assassinated those who opposed Mussolini’s
regime. Fascist-led committees controlled school
curricula and approved textbooks. The government also
arranged national holidays and vacations for workers.
The government even attempted to control language
by banning foreign-sounding words, renaming public
places, and promoting fascist slogans such as “Mussolini
ha sempre ragione” (“Mussolini is always right”),
“Credere, obbedire, combattere” (“Believe, obey, fight”),
and “Un Popolo, un impero, un capo” (“One people,

restrictions.

As Italy had been among the victors of World War I, it
did not have to face the issue of reparation payments.
However, in 1926 inflation set in, and unemployment
started to rise. Following the outbreak of the Great
Depression in 1929, Italy’s fascist government created
public works and welfare programs and provided loans
to banks and businesses. Fascist trade unions, known
as syndicates, secured a 40-hour work week, welfare
benefits, vacation time and pensions. Committees of
business owners and workers, known as corporations,

gained Libya. When Mussolini came to power, he often
postured as a modern-day Caesar, referring to the
Mediterranean by its traditional Roman name as the
mare nostrum (our sea). In 1923, Mussolini used the
murder of four Italians on the Greek island of Corfu
to occupy the area until reparations were made. The
following year he strong-armed Yugoslavia into giving
Italy the city of Fiume on the Dalmatian coast. In October
1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia. Although Emperor Haile
Selassie (1892-1975) and his forces fought bravely, the
400,000-strong Italian army crushed all resistance. In
April 1939, Italian troops occupied Albania, made the
teaching of Italian mandatory in Albanian schools, and
stocked the Albanian government with Italian officials.

Having failed to gain Austrian-held territory at the end
of World War I, Italy attempted to build an overseas
empire in the 1920s. As early as 1912, Italy had defeated Italy’s aggressive foreign policy worried other European

economic sanctions on Italy. Mussolini responded by
allying with Nazi Germany and creating the “RomeBerlin Axis.” In May 1939, Mussolini and Hitler signed
the “Pact of Steel,” which committed each nation to
support the other in case of invasion. Ironically, when
Germany and the USSR invaded Poland on September
1, 1939, Italy once again declared itself neutral.
Like Germany, the devastation of World War I and the
political turmoil of the 1920s inspired Italian architects,
artists and filmmakers to find new forms of expression.
Inspired by the futurist movement, Italian architects
like Gio Ponti (1891-1979) and Giovanni Muzio
(1893-1982) developed the novacento italiano (Italian
twentieth century) movement. In particular, Ponti’s
Pirelli Tower and Villa Planchart utilized glass, steel
and concrete to create large structures that projected
strength and functionality. Artists like Fortunato
Depero (1892-1960) likewise produced paintings and
164

sculptures that celebrated industrial development and
the development of new technologies.
Throughout the 1920s, Italy was home to the “Italian
Futurism” movement in filmmaking. Futurist directors,
including Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (1876-1944),
Arnaldo Ginna (1890-1982), Bruno Corra (1892-1976)
and Giacomo Balla (1871-1958), created cinematic
innovations such as superimposition, fade-outs and
the use of light and color to mimic human emotions.
In the 1910s, Corra and Ginna experimented with
adding color to film. Anton Giulio Bragaglia’s (18901960) Thaïs (1917) dealt with the tortured love affairs
of Countess Vera Preobrajenska. As the movie’s scenes
become more surreal, her trysts and their implications
become more complicated. Because the Fascists heavily
censored movies in the 1920s and 1930s, the Italian
film industry declined, only to enter a golden age in
the postwar period with the works of Federico Fellini
(1920-1993) and Sergio Leone (1929-1989).

the region. The key issue was the migration of Jewish
people from Europe to the Middle East. Arab leaders
and people wanted to restrict migration, while various
Jewish people and organizations hoped to promote and
increase migration. During the war, the British had
reached understandings with both Arabs and Jewish
people on the future of the Middle East. After the war,
British policy focused upon their own geopolitical
considerations and this led to both Arabs and Jewish
authorities losing faith in the British.

After the First World War, a series of mandates were
established that gave Britain and France control over
vast territories in the Middle East. The establishment
of the Mandate System did little to ease tensions
between various groups in the Middle East. The
British Mandate for Palestine further complicated
the situation between Arabs and Jewish people in

The British lacked a clear and comprehensive policy for
the Mandate and the Middle East as a whole. Inspired
by its chief proponent Theodor Herzl (1860-1904), the
development of Zionism in the later 19th century put
further pressure on the British as Jewish people the
world over began looking to develop their own state.
Zionism encouraged many Jewish people to migrate
to the Middle East which increased friction between
Arabs and Jewish people.
Beginning in the early 1920s, the United States
began restricting immigration from Eastern Europe.
Until the passing of more restrictive rules, the U.S.
had been one of the most popular destinations for
Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. In response
to this policy, Jewish migration to the Middle East
increased. This further accelerated after 1933 when
Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany. The
British Mandate lasted until 1948. The day before the
British Mandate for Palestine was set to expire, David
Ben-Gurion (1886-1973) announced the creation
of an independent Israel. In 1949, after fighting a
coalition of Arab forces, Israel became a member of
the United Nations.

CHAPTER 12 INTERWAR YEARS AND THE RISE OF FASCISM

DISARMAMENT
The Interwar period was a time of massive change
throughout the world. At the end of the First World
War, Russia remained embroiled in a civil war; the
German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires lay
in ruins; and new countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia
and Yugoslavia struggled to survive. For the first time,
the United States played a leading role in rebuilding the
nations of Europe along democratic lines. However,
the outbreak of the Great Depression led to the rise of
fascism in Germany, Italy and Spain.

limited the number of cruisers and submarines each

Most remarkably, in 1928, French Foreign Minister
Aristide Briand (1862-1932) and U.S. Secretary of State
Frank B. Kellogg (1856-1937) met in Paris with the
leaders of 13 other nations to sign the Kellogg-Briand
Pact that outlawed war as a means of dispute resolution.
Although well-meaning, the signers of the pact had no

bobbed hair and sheiks in zoot suits danced to the latest
tunes in jazz clubs. Suffragettes marched in favor of
women’s rights, teetotalers celebrated the prohibition of
alcohol, families drove to silent movies in model A and
model T Fords, and barnstormers dazzled crowds with
their death-defying biplane stunts.
The rise of the American automobile industry
fundamentally transformed American society. Although
commercially available since the 1890s, the earliest
cars were notoriously expensive and accident-prone.
However, in 1908 Michigan-born inventor Henry T.
Ford (1863-1947) began production of his Model-T
Ford automobile. By experimenting with assembly
lines and standardized and interchangeable parts
and by paying his employees $5 a day, Ford lowered
production costs and created the first motor car that
millions of middle-class families could practically
afford. Other fledgling car companies followed suit,
and by the onset of the Great Depression, 23 million
cars plied American roads. In addition to providing
new transportation and employment opportunities,
automobiles provided Americans with more leisure,
vacation and socializing time.
168

The interwar period also witnessed the golden age of
the American movie industry. Blessed with a moderate
climate and a variety of natural environments, Hollywood,
California rapidly emerged as ground zero for movie
making. Much as Henry Ford had used assembly lines
to churn out cheap, affordable cars, so to enterprising
Hollywood producers such as Adolph Zukor (18731976) of Paramount Studios; Louis B. Mayer (c. 18831957) of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayor (MGM); and Jack
(1892-1978), Harry (1881-1958), Albert (1884-1967)
and Sam Warner (1885-1927) of Warner Brothers
developed the studio system to produce cost-effective
movies that were then distributed to movie theaters
across the nation. For the price of 15 cents, ordinary
Americans could laugh at the comedic slapstick of
Charlie Chaplin (1889-1977) in The Kid (1921), delight
in the swashbuckling adventures of Douglas Fairbanks
(1883-1939) in The Mask of Zorro (1920), experience
the complexities of love with Greta Garbo (1905-1990)
in Flesh and the Devil (1927), or witness the grandeur
of middle eastern culture in Rudolph Valentino’s (18951926) The Sheik (1921). With the appearance of Al
Jolson’s (1886-1950) The Jazz Singer in 1927, “talkies”
became popular with American audiences. However,
early American cinema also had a darker side. In 1916,

Born into an upper-class family in Berlin in 1901,
Marie Magdalene “Marlene” Dietrich (1901-1992)
developed an interest in theater at a young age.
After failing to gain admission to a classical dance
academy, Dietrich found success as a chorus girl
and singer in German vaudeville. She eventually
transitioned into leading roles in plays and musicals,
including Frank Wedekind’s (1864-1918) Pandora’s
Box, William Shakespeare’s (1564-1616) The
Taming of the Shrew, and George Bernard Shaw’s
(1856-1950) Back to Methuselah. After appearing in
German movies such as Café Elektric (1927), I Kiss
Your Hand, Madame (1928), and The Ship of Lost
Souls (1929), Dietrich moved to the United States
in 1930 to break into the American film industry.
Her leading performances in The Blue Angel (1930),
Shanghai Express (1932) and Desire (1936) garnered
both box office sales and critical acclaim. Much like
the formidable, independent characters she played
on screen, Dietrich led a fashionable lifestyle and
was often in the public eye. Much like many male
actors of the time, she pursued an active social
life. She reportedly had liaisons with Gary Cooper
(1901-1961), Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (1909-2000),
Jimmy Stewart (1908-1997), Erich Marica Remarque
(1898-1970), John Wayne (1907-1979) and John F.
Kennedy (1917-1963). Conscious of her German
background, Dietrich worked actively during the
Second World War to entertain American troops and
appear in films that popularized the Allied war effort.
During the 1950s, Dietrich returned to performing
in plays. She passed away in Paris in 1992, leaving
behind a legacy as one of Hollywood’s most popular
and successful stars.

During the First World War over 380,000 AfricanAmericans served in the U.S. war effort. While living
in France, they were treated with the same respect
as white soldiers. Upon returning home at war’s end,
many black veterans refused to return to the status of
second-class citizens under segregation laws. During
the “Red Summer of 1919,” a series of race riots broke
out in cities across America. Riots initially broke out
in Washington, D.C. and Norfolk, Virginia in July. In
Chicago, the stoning death of a young black man for
swimming near a segregated beach led to a riot that left
38 dead and over 500 injured. Two years later, white
mobs burned and looted the black business district of
Tulsa, Oklahoma, killing upwards of 300 and injuring
800. During this period, violence against African
American people, including hundreds of lynchings,
were carried out throughout the nation.

SPAIN IN THE INTERWAR
PERIOD
In the 1930s, Spain became the site of a bloody civil
war. In 1936, the Spanish military and conservative
Catholics revolted against the elected Spanish
government. Mussolini and Hitler supplied General
Francisco Franco’s (1892-1975) “Franconia” forces
with weapons, vehicles and advisors. The conflict also
served as a training ground for Italian and German
troops who would go on to fight in World War II. The
Republican of Loyalist forces who continued to support
Spain’s constitutional government received aid from
Mexico and the Soviet Union. After four years of bloody
fighting, Franco’s forces emerged victorious. However,
the war also convinced many otherwise ambivalent
Americans, British and French that fascism represented
a growing danger to their countries.

JAPAN IN THE INTERWAR
PERIOD
While the Spanish Civil War raged in Europe, the
Japanese Empire began to emerge as the dominant
military power in Asia. After the United States forced

Japan at gunpoint to end its two-hundred-year policy
of isolation in the 1850s, the Japanese government
adopted the Meiji reforms, seeking to modernize its
country by borrowing from western examples. For
instance, the Japanese created textile factories based
on British precedents, telegraph and electric lights
based on American models, and a modern military that
resembled Germany’s armed forces.
To sustain its increasingly industrial economy, Japanese
leaders considered creating colonies throughout Asia
to supply the motherland with raw materials. During
World War I, Japan joined the Entente powers to
seize German-held territories in China. At the Paris
Peace Conference in 1919, the Japanese delegation
proposed an amendment to the Versailles Treaty that
would forbid any member of the proposed League of
Nations from discriminating against other members
based on race. When the measure was defeated, Japan
began reconsidering its relationship with its western
allies. By the 1930s, the Japanese government was
becoming increasingly conservative and xenophobic.
In September 1931, the Japanese military seized
control of Manchuria. It created the puppet state of
Manchukuo, ruled by Henry Puyi (1906-1967), the last
Qing emperor. When the League of Nations asserted
that Japan had acted illegally in taking Manchuria,
Japan pulled out of the organization.

SUMMARY
Even today, the interwar period remains one of the least understood eras in world history. Many who
fought in World War I believed that the conflict would end quickly and with little loss of life. Four years
and 37 million deaths later, the fighting ended with an armistice. However, many of the problems
which had led to the outbreak of war in August 1914 remained unresolved. The German and AustroHungarian empires had fallen, and the ethnic minorities they had governed over now sought to
establish their own nation-states. In the early 1920s, western European nations like Germany and
France took tentative steps toward political liberalization. However, the bloody legacy of the First
World War led to a questioning of traditional western morality, religion and art. The scholars and
artists of the interwar years experimented with new architectural, painting and cinematic techniques
to capture the randomness and absurdity of the world around them. Following the Great Depression,
large sections of the middle classes in western nations found themselves unemployed, destitute and
willing to follow fascist leaders that promised a return to the power of traditional monarchies and
empires but with the trappings of elections and representative government. By the 1930s, the rise
of Hitler in German, Mussolini in Italy and Franco in Spain seemed to mark the beginning of a new
era of authoritarianism in Europe. It would take another world war and a drawn-out cold war before
democracy became a possibility for millions of people around the world.

World War II

Selection on the ramp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, 1944

Fought from 1939-1945, World War II was the bloodiest
war in world history. Fought in theaters stretching from
the frozen fields of Russia to the sweltering jungles of
Myanmar, the Second World War witnessed the defeat
and division of Germany, the use of nuclear weapons
on Japan, the expansion of Soviet-style communism
throughout Eastern Europe, the emergence of the
United States as a superpower, and the decline of
colonial empires around the world.

In many ways, the failures of the Paris Peace Conference
set the stage for the Second World War. Held at the
French palace of Versailles in 1919, the conference
included representatives from the victorious powers
Great Britain, France, Italy (who had been an ally of
Germany and Austro-Hungary until 1915), and the
United States. Germany and the Soviet Union were not
allowed representation. While U.S. President Woodrow
Wilson (1856-1924) wanted to create a peace treaty
171

with lenient terms, the British and French wanted harsh
punishments for the defeated nations. They created a
peace treaty and terms that forced Germany to accept
the blame for starting the war and to agree to pay steep
reparation payments to Britain and France.

THE RISE OF FASCISM
The United States, which did not sign the Versailles
Peace Treaty, agreed to loan money to Germany to finance
its reparation payments. However, the postwar Weimar
government of Germany faced consistent economic
stagnation and inflated currency throughout the 1920s.
In 1929, the Great Depression undermined economies
and governments on both sides of the Atlantic. Desperate
Europeans began turning to radical political figures who
promised solutions to their problems. In 1922, Italians
elected journalist and World War I veteran Benito
Mussolini (1883-1945) as Prime Minister.
Germans watched events in Italy with much interest.
In 1923, Adolph Hitler (1889-1945), a veteran of
World War I and National Socialist German Workers’
Party (Nazi) leader, launched an armed coup against
the Weimar Government. Defeated and thrown into
prison, Hitler wrote a biography entitled, Mein Kampf
(My Struggle). In this work, Hitler discussed his service
as a corporal in the German Army during World War
I, his disillusionment with the Kaiser’s surrender, and
his brushes with poverty in the 1920s. Throughout his
work, Hitler railed against Jews, whom he blamed for
the rise of international communism and Germany’s
defeat in the Great War. He also stressed that Germans
had a “national destiny” in gaining lebensraum (or
living room) in Eastern Europe.

Benito Mussolini

Born into a working-class family in Romagna, Italy
in 1883, Benito Mussolini was named after Mexican
revolutionary Benito Juárez (1806-1872). After
serving two years in the Italian military, Mussolini
became a journalist. Well-versed in the works of
leftist European intellectuals, he became a leading
Italian socialist. When the First World War broke
out, Mussolini broke with socialism and became a
corporal in the Italian army. In 1919, he founded the
first Italian fascist party. Three years later, Mussolini
and 20,000 fascist followers marched on Rome to
demand the resignation of Italian Prime Minister
Luigi Facta (1861-1930). Appointed as the new
prime minister, Mussolini set out to remake Italian
society in his image. A master of propaganda,
Mussolini projected the image of a strong leader
who dressed in military costumes, surrounded
himself with his armed Black Shirt followers, and
used parades and radio broadcast speeches to
enhance his reputation. Taking on the moniker of
El Duce (or leader), Mussolini dismantled Italy’s
constitution to create a police state under his control.
In doing so, Mussolini created the first fascist
state in Europe. Fascism differed from traditional
authoritarianism in that fascist leaders were often
democratically elected, exalted nationalism above
any other consideration, created cults of personality
surrounding their leaders and concentrated political
power in the hands of dictators and their followers.

CHAPTER 13 WORLD WAR II

For an individual who would cause the death of millions,
Adolph Hitler came from an unremarkable background.
Born to a single mother, Hitler was raised in Braunau
am Inn in Austro-Hungary, near the German border.
After his mother died of cancer, Hitler became a
homeless watercolor artist living on the streets of
Vienna. In 1914, he volunteered for service in the
German army, serving as a dispatch runner. While
recovering from a mustard gas attack, Hitler learned of
Germany’s surrender. Devastated, Hitler believed that
Jews and subversives had undermined the German
war effort from within. He became a member of the
German Worker’s Party in 1919. A master orator,
Hitler soon became a rising star in the organization.
When the party rebranded itself the National Socialist
Workers Democratic Party (or Nazi Party for short),
Hitler designed its swastika insignia. In 1921, Hitler
became the undisputed leader of the Nazi Party.
Two years later, Hitler and his followers attempted a
military coup to take over the German government.
Referred to as the “Beer Hall Putsch” because it began
in a Munich beer hall, Hitler’s movement failed, and he
received a five-year prison sentence. Realizing that he
could achieve his goals through mass party mobilization
rather than a coup, Hitler, after being released from
prison, began working toward gaining control of the
German government.
By the 1920s, the inability of the Weimar government to
address the problems of war reparations and inflation
caused the regime to become very unpopular in the eyes
of the German public. Hitler agitated for overturning
the Treaty of Versailles and making Germany great
again. Before the Weimar Republic came into being,
Germany was controlled by authoritarian rulers. After
the surrender in World War I, a new constitution was
written, which established a democratic government,
that had a president, chosen by the German people,
who appointed a chancellor and cabinet ministers.
As hyperinflation set in following the outbreak of the
Great Depression, many Germans lost their pensions.
The death of Chancellor Gustav Stresemann (1878-1929)
further weakened the Weimar government. The German
economy also relied heavily on U.S. loans, and when
the Great Depression hit, Washington discontinued
the program. The downfall of the German economy in
1930-1931, eventually paved the way for the ascent of
the Nazis to political power. Unemployment rose from

2.25 million in early 1930 to 6 million and beyond in
1932. It significantly affected the governing coalition of
Social Democrats and moderate conservatives, which
collapsed leading to new elections. Those on the right
(the Nazis) and the left (Communists) gained followers
and with that, seats in the Reichstag. In 1930, the Nazis
won 107 seats (they had held only 12 after the previous
election). As the economy became more and more
unstable, Hitler promised that the Nazi Party would
combat unemployment and provide aid to farmers.
In the next national election, the Nazi Party won 14.5
million out of 35 million votes, making it the largest
173

party in the government. Hitler continued to agitate
for reform and was eventually appointed chancellor by
President Paul Hindenburg (1847-1934) on January 30,
1933. Within eight weeks, Hitler created a dictatorship.
He proclaimed his office to be the true source of
executive, legislative and judicial power, eliminated
competing political groups, and stirred up the masses
against the biggest and most dangerous enemies of the
Nazis: the communists.
The National Socialists also gained momentum in the
German Reichstag due to the disagreement among leftwing forces. The Social Democrats refused to work with
the Communist Party because of their radical views.
In March 1932, Ernst Thälman (1886-1944) ran for
the German presidency against the Social Democrat
Hindenburg and Hitler. The famous slogan of the KPD
was “A vote for Hindenburg is a vote for Hitler. A vote for
Hitler is a vote for war.” After Thälman lost the election,
he tried to persuade the leaders of the SPD to organize
a general strike to prevent the National Socialists from
taking power. Having been refused, Thälman pushed
for the overthrow of Hitler’s government.

In late February 1933, the Reichstag building caught fire.
Claiming that the state was in danger, Hitler persuaded
President Hindenburg to grant him emergency
powers. The Nazis accused the Communist Party of
setting the fire. This gave them an excuse to arrest
and silence critical left-wing opponents. Thälman
was arrested on March 3, 1933, and spent 11 years in
solitary confinement. In August 1944, he was sent to
Buchenwald concentration camp. The same month,
Hitler ordered that he be killed.
On March 5, 1933, the Nazis won 43.9% of the votes in
the Reichstag. Using the near majority, Hitler passed
the Enabling Act, granting him and his government
the power to rule by decree. To solidify his power,
Hitler banned the Communist Party and arrested
its leaders so they could no longer vote against him.
Within a month, Hitler transformed the German
government from a democracy to an authoritarian
dictatorship. In April 1933, new laws were passed
to remove opposition party members from all
government departments. In May 1933, all trade
unions were banned and reorganized into a Nazicontrolled organization, the German Labor Front or
DAF (Deutsche Arbeitsfront). The Social Democratic
Party was outlawed as well. By July 1933, all political
parties except the Nazis were banned, as Germany
became a one-party dictatorship.
Having seized control of the German political system,
Hitler turned next to stifling dissent within his own
ranks. During his rise to power, Hitler had used the
Nazi party to formally agitate for more power. However,
behind the scenes he relied upon a group of paramilitary
party members known as the Sturmabteilung
(storm battalion), informally known as the SA or the
“Brownshirts” due to their habit of dressing in brown
shirts complete with ties. Hitler used the Brownshirts
to intimidate, beat or even kill political rivals. Although
many Brownshirts were World War I veterans
completely loyal to Hitler, they were also a well-trained
and well-armed group that could at times prove difficult
to rein in. In June 1930, Hitler received word of a rumor
that SA leader Ernst Röhm (1887-1934) planned
to launch a coup against him. On June 30 to July 2,
Hitler ordered a group of handpicked Brownshirts and
Gestapo (secret police) agents to purge Röhm and his
followers. Hitler used his emergency powers to suspend
all political and civil rights, to arrest anyone suspicious
of agitating against the government, and keep them in
CHAPTER 13 WORLD WAR II

prison indefinitely without fair trials or due process. As
only Nazi Party members could now become judges,
Hitler’s regime controlled what judicial processes
remained in Germany.
The Nazis reorganized Germany into Gaue, or districts,
and put them under the command of Gauleiters (district
leaders). Each town was also divided into smaller units
called Viertels (quarters). Each quarter had its own
warden who would monitor his section and investigate
suspicious individuals. The warden was the direct link
to the Nazi Party. People were encouraged to report
their families, neighbors and friends if they were not in
full support of Hitler and the Nazi Party.

Within the state, all cultural activities were geared
toward propagating the ideology of National Socialism.
Many cultural events were organized to show open
support for Hitler. Everything was strictly controlled,
and non-monitored art and cultural activities were
prohibited. The Nazis used an immense propaganda
machine to support Hitler and the Nazi state. Joseph
Goebbels (1897-1945) was put in charge of the Nazi
propaganda programs, which were broadcasted
through completely controlled radio stations, cinemas,
speeches, parades and rallies, youth organizations and
K-12 education. Given limited opportunities, women
were told to concern themselves with “children, church,
kitchen” (Kinder, Kirche, Küche).

Hitler worked closely with Heinrich Himmler (19001945), the head of the SS and the Gestapo. Himmler

the German state. Furthermore, Jews had to publicly
wear a yellow star embossed with the word “Jew” and
obtain a “J” label on their passports. On November 9,
1938, during Kristallnacht (Night of the Broken Glass),
over 7500 Jewish businesses and over 400 synagogues
were destroyed, more than 90 Jews were killed, and
over 30,000 arrested.

On September 15, 1935, the Nazi government announced
the passage of a slew of laws that discriminated against
Jewish people. These Nuremburg Laws, (the Reich
Citizenship Law and the Law for the Protection of
German Blood and German Honor) emphasized that
Germans, but not Jewish people, belonged to the socalled Aryan race. According to these discriminatory
laws, Jewish people threatened the purity of the German
people and thus, the Nazis believed that they had to
identify and separate Jews from German society. The
law banned marriages and relationships with Jews and
pushed Jews into ghettos. The rules also applied to the
Sinti and Roma communities. The Reich Citizenship
Law underscored that only racially pure people could
hold German citizenship, which meant that Jews
could never be considered full German citizens. The
situation worsened in 1938 when new laws were passed
that prohibited Jews from any participation in public
life. The regulations also highlighted if Jews were to

Jews were collected from the ghettos and sent to the

Germany’s defeat in 1945 and the end of World War II.
By the time of their liberation, over 6 million Jews died
in the Holocaust and another 6 million Romani, Slavs
and other targeted groups had also been killed by the
Nazis. Millions of prisoners of war, especially from the
Soviet Union, also died at the hands of the Nazis.

Many people blindly supported Hitler because he
reduced unemployment. He built up the German
weapon industry, which created many jobs and helped
promote economic efficiency. Overall unemployment
fell from 6 million in 1933 to below 1 million in 1939.

Kristallnacht was a wave of statesponsored terrorism directed against
Germany’s Jews from November 9-10,
1938. In early November, Nazi officials
expelled over 5,000 Jews of Polish
descent from Germany. When learning
that his parents had been among
the deportees, 17-year-old Herschel
Grynszpan (b. 1921) assassinated
Ernest vom Rath (1909-1938), a German
embassy official in Paris. Vom Rath died
on November 9, the anniversary of Hitler’s
1923 attempted coup known as the “Beer
Hall Putsch.” When Hitler’s propaganda
minister Joseph Goebbels suggested
that his followers begin a series of
spontaneous demonstrations to protest
the assassination of vom Rath, violence
against Jewish synagogues, businesses
and homes broke out across Germany,

Because of the British refusal to accept or even consider
peace, Hitler reluctantly ordered his staff to plan an
invasion of Britain. His generals could see no clear
path to using Blitzkrieg over a body of water as large as
the English Channel. The German air force (Luftwaffe)
offered a different approach, one they hoped would
bomb Britain into submission. This led to the famous

Battle of Britain; an aerial war fought between July 10
and October 31, 1940.
The Luftwaffe’s plan initially targeted military
installations, especially British airbases. This was a
successful strategy, but for reasons still debated, the
Luftwaffe switched its focus to civilian and government
targets, especially those in London.

Because of this change in tactics, Londoners
became the first to prove that it was possible
to live under the stress of nightly air raids.
Aided by advances in radar technology, the
British could shoot down approximately two
German planes for every one it lost. This,
combined with an increase in the production
of the number of aircraft, ensured that
Germany failed to gain aerial superiority.
Hitler acknowledged this waste of resources
and withdrew from the Battle of Britain in
October 1940, although the bombing of
Great Britain, especially at night, would last
until 1941. Many see the Battle of Britain as
a turning point as Hitler was forced to fight a
much longer and drawn-out war.

In August, Roosevelt met with British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill aboard the HMS
Prince of Wales off the coast of the Dominion
of Newfoundland, to issue the Atlantic
Charter of Freedom. Although not a formal
treaty, the charter represented a statement
of common goals both nations pledged
to work toward. The charter consisted of
eight points, including a pledge to seek no
territorial expansion, no territorial changes
except those freely agreed upon, the right
of all people to choose the government
under which they lived, free trade, labor
and economic rights, freedom from fear and
want, freedom of the seas, and the creation
of a system of worldwide general security.

Japanese Aichi and Nakajima dive bombers sank four
American battleships and damaged four others. By
day’s end, over 2,300 American servicemen had been
killed. The following day U.S. President Franklin D.
Roosevelt declared December 7 “a day that would live
in infamy” and asked Congress to declare war against
Japan. Germany responded by declaring war on the
United States. America had now entered the fray.
Following the launching of Operation Barbarossa,
Stalingrad and the oil fields it defended, remained a
tempting military target. Throughout summer 1942,
General Friedrich von Paulus (1890-1957) and the
German 6th Army advanced deep into Ukraine. By
October, German Junker bombers had pummeled
much of Stalingrad into dust, although Russian forces
clung desperately to the city’s western edge. Ordering
Russian troops to hold Stalingrad at all costs, Stalin
had fresh reinforcements constantly ferried into the city
across the Volga River. Raw Russian recruits, many
unarmed, were forced by their officers to advance on
German forces under pain of death if they retreated.
While Russian snipers such as Vasily Zaitsev (19151991) pinned down German troops inside the city,
Soviet Marshall Georgi Zhukov (1896-1974) surrounded
Paulus’s army with two large Soviet forces. Although
Hitler insisted that his troops fight to the death, Paulus
surrendered his remaining 91,000 soldiers to Russian
forces on February 2, 1943.
CHAPTER 13 WORLD WAR II

BATTLE OF STALINGRAD
In the meantime, as German forces advanced deeper into
Russian territory, they faced increasingly stiff resistance
plus exposure from the brutal Russian winter. German
armies failed to take either Leningrad or Moscow. Over
the opposition of his generals, Hitler ordered an all-out
assault on the city of Stalingrad. Beginning in August 1942,
General Friedrich von Paulus (1890-1957) led a combined
army of 270,000 soldiers armed with 500 Panzers and
600 Junker and Stuka bombers against 187,000 Russian
defenders armed with 400 outdated T-34 tanks and only
200 IL-2 monoplanes and Yakovlev single-engine fighters.
For six months, German and Russian forces waged a
bloody campaign for the city involving block-by-block
fighting, carpet bombing, sniper attacks, psychological
warfare and starvation. With Allied military aid and
their brutal “not one step backward policy,” Russian
forces regained control of the city at the loss of over
a million casualties. With their own losses at nearly
a million men, the Germans were forced to retreat.
Operation Barbarossa was a defeat, and Germany now
lay open to invasion.
While Russian forces carried out the vast majority
of fighting against the Axis powers, Great Britain
and American troops launched a campaign to defeat
German and Italian forces in Africa and thus defend
the Suez Canal. British forces under General Bernard
Montgomery (1887-1976) decisively defeated German
General Erwin Rommel’s Afrika corps at the Battle
of El Alamein in November. Having secured North
Africa, British and American forces launched a
successful invasion of Sicily in July 1943. In September,
Allied forces landed at Salerno. Following heavy
losses to entrenched German and Italian forces, Allied
divisions captured Naples, Monte Cassino, and Rome.
Mussolini’s fascist government collapsed, and the new
regime held the former dictator prisoner. Although
rescued by German commandos, he was recaptured
and executed in April 1945.

Polish and French troops under Supreme Allied
Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower (18901969) stormed the beaches of Normandy, France.
Despite high casualties and 10,000 Allied losses by
the end of the day, the Allied forces had secured a
beachhead and opened a second front in the war.
Allied forces made rapid strides across northern
France using their own combinations of massive ariel
bombardments and rapid tank attacks. In late December
1944, German forces pushed back Allied troops at the
bloody “Battle of the Bulge.” Although Axis forces were
almost spent, the Allies enjoyed constant infusions of
new soldiers and material and were soon on the offensive
again. On August 25, 1945, Allied forces liberated Paris,
with German forces agreeing to leave without destroying
the city. Fighting would further intensify as British and

Back home, the Second World War took its toll on
virtually all aspects of American society. Factories were
recalibrated to churn out weapons, ammunition, tanks,
planes, ships and uniforms. The federal government
contracted with large agricultural corporations and
small family farms to procure food for the troops.
As millions of men enlisted in the military, women,
African Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans found
employment in America’s burgeoning wartime industrial
sector. Iconic figures such as “Rosie the Riveter”
became popular symbols of wartime production. Taking
advantage of wartime labor conditions, labor organizer
A. Philip Randolph (1889-1979) planned a “March on
Washington” to occur in 1941. On the personal appeal
of President Roosevelt, who reminded Randolph of
the need to defeat fascism abroad before dealing with
civil rights at home, Randolph called off the march. In
return, Roosevelt supported the creation of the Fair
Employment Relations Act, which called for an end
to job discrimination. Randolph’s plan for a March on
Washington would come to fruition during the civil
rights movement of the 1960s.

American armies advanced toward the German border.
While British and American forces pushed eastward,
the Red Army invaded East Prussia. Russian forces
advanced upon Berlin by taking the German city of
Konigsberg in April 1945. For two weeks, two million
Soviet and Allied forces fought Berlin’s defenders, many
of whom were Hitler Youth or elderly civilians with little
military training. On April 30, Adolf Hitler, his wife
Eva Braun (1912-1945), and a few of his commanders
committed suicide in their command bunker. Two days
later, Russian forces raised the flag of the Soviet Union
over the burned-out remains of the German Reichstag
building. The remaining German troops surrendered.
The war in Europe was now over.

CHAPTER 13 WORLD WAR II

WAR IN THE PACIFIC
In April 1942, the United States launched a risky bombing
raid against Japan. Led by Lieutenant Colonel James
Doolittle (1896-1993), 16 Mitchell bombers launched
from the USS Hornet dropped bombs on Tokyo and
other targets throughout the island of Honshu. Forced to
abandon their aircraft in China, Japanese forces captured
many of the U.S. pilots involved in the raid. The following
month, American and Australian forces defeated a
Japanese invasion fleet off the coast of New Guinea. In
June, U.S. Admiral Chester Nimitz (1885-1966) led a
fleet of three aircraft carriers, seven heavy cruisers and 15
destroyers against a large Japanese fleet led by Admiral
Yamamoto. U.S. forces forestalled future Japanese raids
on Hawaii by sinking four Japanese aircraft carriers.
At the grueling Battle of Guadalcanal, fought from
August 1942 to February 1943, 60,000 U.S. marines and
sailors defeated 36,000 entrenched Japanese defenders
determined to fight to the death (less than a 1,000 of the
Japanese soldiers surrendered). By securing Guadalcanal’s
airfield, the United States could now conduct direct
bombing of the Japanese home islands.

While the United States engaged in an “island hopping
campaign” across the Pacific, Chinese forces under the
command of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek (18871975) continued to tie down half a million Japanese
troops. Isolated by Japanese armies that controlled
the eastern Coast of China and large areas of Burma
and French Indochina, Chiang’s forces, headquartered
in Chongqing, relied on Allied supplies flown in
by air over the “hump” of the Himalaya Mountains
from British-controlled India for survival. Chiang
also contended with a growing Chinese communist
movement led by former school teacher turned
revolutionary Mao Zedong (1893-1976). In fact,
Chiang considered wiping out his communist rivals as
more important than fighting the Japanese. Although
treated as an equal by President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt at the 1943 Cairo Conference, Chiang was,
in reality, relegated to the status of a junior partner in
the overall Allied war effort.

BIG THREE CONFERENCES

DROPPING THE BOMB

While German and Russian forces engaged in bloody
combat along the Eastern Front and Chinese and
American forces battled the Japanese in Asia and the
Pacific, the leaders of the three strongest Allied powers—
Great Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union—
held a series of conferences to plan war strategy as well
as determine the map of the postwar world.

By 1943, Allied forces had successfully pushed Japanese
forces back to the home islands. American bombers
launched round-the-clock firebombing raids on Japanese
cities, most notably Tokyo. However, Allied leaders
became worried that an invasion of the Japanese home
islands might cost upwards of a million casualties and
drag on for years as Japanese troops and civilians fought
diligently to their deaths. As such, President Roosevelt
and his generals looked for an alternative to invasion.

In November 1943, Franklin Roosevelt, Winston
Churchill and Joseph Stalin met in Tehran, Iran. In
addition to discussing the date for a cross-channel
invasion from Britain and the willingness of the United
States to supply military aid to the USSR, the three
leaders issued the Tehran Declaration, which called for
Poland and other Eastern European countries to enjoy
the right of self-determination once the war was over.
At the subsequent Yalta Conference in February 1945,
Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin agreed to divide control
of Germany and Austria between their nations and
France, establish a coalition government in Poland, and
lend their support to creating a United Nations. At the
third and final conference, held in Potsdam, Germany,
in July and August 1945, Harry S. Truman (1884-1972),
Clement Attlee (1883-1967) and Joseph Stalin demanded
the unconditional surrender of Japan, planned to divide
Germany and Berlin, discussed the donation of American
money to rebuild Europe, and promised to hold free and
fair elections in Eastern Europe.

Following the death of President Franklin Roosevelt in
April 1945, his successor, Harry S. Truman, authorized
the use of nuclear weapons against Japan. On August 6,
1945, the crew of the U.S. bomber Enola Gay dropped a
21-kiloton atomic bomb named “Fat Man” on Hiroshima,
Japan. Three days later, American forces dropped
another atomic bomb dubbed “Little Boy” on Nagasaki.
When counting not only the immediate victims of the
atomic blasts but also those who died later from radiation
poisoning, it is estimated that between 90,000-166,000
residents of Hiroshima and 60,000-80,000 people living
in Nagasaki died. Unaware that the United States only
possessed two atomic bombs, Japanese officials agreed to
the Allied demand for unconditional surrender, insisting
only that the Japanese Emperor Hirohito (1901-1989)
be allowed to remain in power as a symbolic ruler. On
September 2, 1945, Japanese delegates signed documents
of surrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Harbor.
The war in the Pacific was now at an end.

The Manhattan Project represented one of the most
top-secret projects of the war. Led by physicists
Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967) and Enrico
Fermi (1901-1954) and coordinated by U.S. Army
General Leslie Groves (1896-1970), scientists for
the Manhattan Projects worked first in Chicago,
then in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Experimenting with
Einstein’s concept that matter and energy were
interchangeable, Oppenheimer and Fermi’s team
learned through constant experimentation to split
uranium 238, a very unstable isotope. On July
16, 1945, the Manhattan team detonated an 18.6
kiloton atomic bomb dubbed “the Gadget” on a
barren stretch of desert near Alamogordo, New
Mexico. Upon witnessing the power of the nuclear
blast, Oppenheimer quoted the Hindu holy text,
the Bhagavata, by stating, “I have become death,
the destroyer of worlds.”

From April 25 to June 26, representatives from
over 50 countries gathered in San Francisco to
draft the charter for the United Nations. Similar in
principle to the League of Nations, the UN would
act as an international forum to air grievances
between nations and seek peaceful solutions to
global problems. The Charter of the United Nations
established a governing structure that resembled a
parliamentary democracy. Each of the 51 nations
that initially joined the UN sent delegates to meet
once a year in a General Assembly. Regardless
of the size of each member state’s delegation,
they received one vote each in assembly votes.
Delegates generally debated the adoption of
international treaties and set up and evaluated the
work of UN subcommittees, including the World
Health Organization and the UN Children’s Fund.
The UN also featured a number of permanent
committees. The United Nations International Court
of Justice oversaw the prosecution of war criminals
and international terrorists. The UN Secretariat ran
the day-to-day operations of the UN and enforced
General Assembly resolutions. The UN Security
Council constituted the most powerful part of the
United Nations. It initially featured five permanent
members–the United States, Soviet Union, Britain,
France and China (Chiang Kai-Shek’s Kuomintang
government until 1971, Mao Zedong’s PRC regime
afterward) each of which wielded a veto over
Security Council resolutions. The Security Council
was charged with maintaining international peace
and stability, investigating conflicts, establishing
peacekeeping missions and setting up economic
sanctions. Since its first session in 1946, the
United Nations has played an active role in
shaping global politics.

SUMMARY
By 1945, the Second World War ended in a complete victory for the Allied Powers. Although victorious,
Americans, British, French and Russians soon came face to face with the true costs of the war.
Between 40 and 50 million people died in the conflict, many of them civilians. Six million Jews and 6
million Romani, Slavs, homosexuals and other target groups died in the Holocaust. The economies
of much of Europe and Asia lay shattered. Of all the prewar powers, only the United States could
boast a booming economy and a fully operational military. Furthermore, two erstwhile allies, the U.S.
and the USSR, were moving toward a cold war that pitted American capitalism and freedom against
Soviet beliefs in planned economies and a collective mentality. For the next 50 years, the conflict
between these two superpowers would help shape world events.

On April 25, 1945, Second Lieutenant William Robertson
of the 69th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army crawled
across a damaged bridge that spanned the Elbe River
near Torgau, Germany. At the other end stood Soviet
Lieutenant Alexander Silvashko of the 58th Guards
Rifle Division. Reaching the middle of the bridge,
Robertson shouted “American” and was escorted to
meet Silvashko. The two men shook hands and hugged
before breaking into an impromptu celebration. This

meeting was auspicious. For four long years, over 25
million Soviets had died as the Red Army pushed Axis
forces westward into Germany. Since D-Day, June 6,
1944, U.S. and Allied forces had pushed eastward from
Normandy, suffering over two million casualties. The
“Torgau handshake,” as it was later called, represented
the first time American and Russian soldiers had met on
the battlefield. Yet despite this friendly meeting, within
two years, the United States and the Soviet Union would

be locked in what President John F. Kennedy (19171963) would call a “long twilight struggle” known as the
Cold War. From 1947-1991 the U.S. and USSR fought
not just a conflict for strategic domination, natural
resources or political power, but an ideological one in
which both sides courted and pressured third-world
nations into adopting their codes of ethics, systems of
governance and culture. In doing so, the Cold War did
much to shape the postwar world.

United States, Britain, France and Italy refused to give
the Soviet Union representation at the 1919 Paris Peace
Conference. The United States, Great Britain and Japan
aided the White Russian forces in their unsuccessful bid
to roll back the Russian Revolution.

Although many European and American progressives
were impressed that the USSR appeared to be immune
to the effects of the Great Depression, Franklin D.
Roosevelt waited until February 1933 to diplomatically
recognize the Soviet Union. Seven years later, when

Even before the end of the war, American and Soviet
interests began to diverge. Although the United States
provided the most funding and supplies for the Allied
war efforts, the Russians had done the most fighting by
far, having lost over 28 million soldiers and civilians
by 1945. The United States and Great Britain looked
forward to a postwar world based on free trade and
democratic values as outlined by the Atlantic Charter.
In contrast, many Soviet leaders viewed the war as an
important stage in establishing a worldwide communist
revolution. Given that Russia had been invaded three
times in the past two centuries, Stalin was unwilling to
tolerate regimes in Eastern Europe that were unfriendly
to the Soviet Union. Realizing that the Soviet Union
would be occupying much of Eastern Europe at
war’s end, Roosevelt and his advisors hoped that the
planned United Nations would allow the two emerging
superpowers to compromise and work together as they
had done during the war.

governments struggled to feed their populations. Large
sections of Poland, the Soviet Union and France had
experienced the destruction of “scorched earth” tactics.
Although victorious, the British Empire was exhausted
and would continue to decline as a world power over
the next half-century. Of all the Allied powers, only the
United States emerged from the war with fixed borders
and a thriving industrial economy.

The war also sparked a process of decolonization
across the world. During the conflict, Great Britain and
the United States had been able to mobilize overseas
colonies and non-aligned nations to support the
Allied war effort with the promise, as espoused in the
Atlantic Charter, of freedom and equality at the war’s
conclusion. The issue of what to do with areas annexed
by the Axis powers remained a thorny one. Occupied
nations that Nazi Germany had attempted to colonize
such as Poland and Ukraine regained their sovereignty

On February 22, 1946, George Kennan (1904-2005), an
American diplomat living in Moscow, wrote an 8000-word
“Long Telegram” to Secretary of State James Byrnes (18821972). Byrnes had asked Keenan to speculate on why Soviet
officials opposed the recently created World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (two organizations that worked in
tandem to maintain economic stability and fund development
especially in the third world). Although Kennan admired the
toughness and resilience of the Russian people, he distrusted
Stalin and his regime. Kennan also disapproved of President
Roosevelt’s policy of engaging the Soviet dictator on friendly
terms. Concerned about recent tensions between the U.S.
and the Soviet Union, Kennan wrote a lengthy essay on
the foreign policy motives of the Soviet Politburo and what
the United States should do to counter them. In his essay,
Keenan argued that the United States should seek to stop
communist expansion in its tracks rather than engage in a
direct confrontation with the USSR. This “containment” policy
would become the basis for U.S. policy toward communism
until the end of the Cold War.

CHAPTER 14 COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION OF THE WORLD FROM 1950

Although the U.S. and Soviet Union had pledged to
support free and fair elections for Central and Eastern
European nations following the war, Soviet officials
held sham elections in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and
the Russian-occupied sectors of Germany. In areas
that had a coalition government, like Czechoslovakia,
Soviet-backed socialists used “salami tactics” to take
over key military and law enforcement positions
and gradually leveraged such power to take over the
entire government. American officials worried about
the development of Soviet satellite states, took an
increasingly assertive stance against what they perceived
as Soviet expansionism.

THE TRUMAN DOCTRINE
Franklin Delano Roosevelt died in April 1945. His
successor, the conservative and cantankerous Harry
S. Truman (1884-1972) of Missouri, tended to see the
world in much starker terms and adopted a harsher
tone with the Soviet Union. To this day, scholars debate
whether one of the reasons Truman allowed the atomic
bomb to be used on Japan was to intimidate Stalin with
the military and technological power of the U.S.
In March 1946, Winston Churchill delivered a speech
at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri. In his
speech, Churchill insisted that “[w]e welcome Russia
to her rightful place among the leading nations of the
world.” But he expressed concern that “From Stettin
in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain
has descended across the Continent. Behind that line

lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and
Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna,
Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia, all these
famous cities and the populations around them lie in
what I must call the Soviet sphere. All are subject in
one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to
a very high and, in some cases, increasing measure of
control from Moscow.” Churchill concluded that only
a strong response led by the United States and Great
Britain could meet the threat of communist aggression.
The speech had an immediate impact upon U.S. public
opinion toward the USSR.
In fall 1946, the Soviet Union attempted to pressure
Turkey into allowing it to place a military based on the
Dardanelles Straits as a prelude to joint control of the
area. When the United States dispatched two aircraft
carriers to the region, the USSR backed down. At the
urging of a group of statesmen known as the “wise men,”
Truman and his congressional allies passed the 1947
National Security Act. The measure created the cabinet
position of Defense Secretary, Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA), Joint Chiefs of Staff and National
Security Council (NSC). Truman also offered Greece
and Turkey $400 million in aid to ensure they embraced
western style democracy rather than socialism. He also
announced what would become known as the “Truman
Doctrine.” The United States would not attempt to
roll back communism where it already existed but
would contain it and aid third-world governments in
resisting communist insurgencies within their borders.
Truman also announced the creation of the Marshall
By 1948, Stalin had become very concerned that
the United States, Britain and France had combined
their occupation zones in Germany and Berlin and
that Marshall Plan money had helped reindustrialize
these areas. In July 1948, East German officials sealed
the border between West Germany and Berlin. As a
municipality of West Germany (even though located
deep in East Germany) West Berlin received most of
its fresh food, gasoline and coal from the West. Since
the end of the war, Soviet officials had allowed West
German trucks to ferry goods and people between the
West German border and Berlin. Not wanting to confront
the Soviet Union directly, the United States began the
“Berlin Airlift.” For 15 months, the U.S. conducted over
250,000 flights to West Berlin, delivering much needed
food, fuel and supplies to the 2 million inhabitants of the
city. By spring 1949, East German and Soviet officials
relented and once again allowed supply convoys from
West Germany to West Berlin.

Mao Zedong’s Little Red Book, formally known as
Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, represented
one of the most influential political tracts of the 20th
century. Compiled in 1964, the book contained 267
sayings attributed to Chairman Mao. Forming a crucial
part of Mao’s cult of personality during the Cultural
Revolution, The "Little Red Book" was modeled on
popular collections of quotes from Chinese scholars like
Confucius and Mencius that Chinese schoolchildren had
used for centuries. In the 1960s, the Chinese Ministry
of Education aimed to give a copy to every Chinese
citizen. Red Guards would also routinely ask whether
ordinary Chinese had a copy with them or whether they
could quote passages from the book from memory. Two
of the most often recited quotes from the "Little Red
Book" were, “Every Communist must grasp the truth:
Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun” and
“A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay,
or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be
so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind,
courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution
is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class
overthrows another.”
CHAPTER 14 COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION OF THE WORLD FROM 1950

From 1966-1976, Mao launched the “Cultural
Revolution.” Although officially designed to combat
corruption and keep the Chinese people in a permanent
state of communist revolution, in reality, the Cultural
Revolution involved creating a cult of personality around
Mao. At Mao’s urging, groups of young people known as
“Red Guards,” indoctrinated by the ceaseless reading of
a collection of their leader’s teachings incorporated in
“Little Red Books,” scoured the Chinese countryside.
They humiliated, beat and killed individuals considered
“capitalist roaders,” destroying churches, temples
and other symbols of China’s past, all with little or no
opposition from Chinese officials. Although figures
vary, it was estimated that over two million people died
during the Cultural Revolution, a movement that did
not officially end until Mao died in 1976.

DECOLONIZATION IN AFRICA,
ASIA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST
During the Second World War, Allied Powers such as
Great Britain and the United States enjoyed tremendous
support from their colonies and overseas territories.
Indian Gurkhas, Australian and New Zealand “diggers,”
and Filipino “hunters” all contributed to the Allied
war effort with the hope of independence for their
homelands when the war was over. The one recurrent
theme that ran through the Atlantic Charter, Tehran,
Yalta, Potsdam Declarations, and the Charter of the
United Nations was that of national self-determination
for all peoples including the developing world. From
the 1940s to the 1970s, Great Britain, Germany, Italy,
Japan, France, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands were
forced to grant independence to most, if not all, of their
overseas empires. To be sure, many imperialists fought
the loss of their overseas territories tooth and nail. As
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill quipped
in November 1942, “I have not become the King’s
First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation
of the British Empire.” However, not even a figure as
formidable as Churchill could turn back the forces of
decolonization in the developing world.

The Mau Mau revolt began when poor Kikuyu
people, having been forced off their traditional land,
made war against British officials and upper-class,
“Anglicized” members of their communities. Many
Mau Mau adopted British Scout uniforms and merit
badges to fool British soldiers into believing they
were loyal Kenyans. Over time, the Mau Mau began
to wear scout uniforms as symbols of resistance
and pride.

World War II, virtually the entire continent lay
under the control of one European power or another.
During World War II, 1.3 million Ghanese, Kenyan,
South African, Botswanan, Malawian and Zambian
troops served in the British forces and returned home
with a sense of group solidarity and confidence. In
1960, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
(1894-1986) gave a speech in Johannesburg, South
Africa, in which he recognized “the wind of change
blowing through the continent.” Although Britain’s
leaders granted independence to many African
colonies, they fought to keep Kenya and Rhodesia
(current day Zimbabwe) in the empire.
From 1952-1960, British troops ruthlessly suppressed
the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya. Kikuyu men and

them invincible to British bullets. As such, they fought
ferociously in battle. British officials killed over 20,000
Mau Mau during the conflict and placed another 20,000
Kikuyu and other minorities into brutal “labor camps”
that bore more than a passing resemblance to German
concentration camps. Although British colonial forces
defeated the largest Mau Mau army in 1956, they could
not stop international pressure and local resistance. At
the First Lancaster House Conference, held in 1960,
British and Kenyan delegates worked out a roadmap
for a transition government that provided complete
independence for Kenya in 1963.

ALGERIAN WAR FOR
INDEPENDENCE
During the Second World War, most of France’s
overseas territories were occupied by Japanese, British,
or American forces. This made France’s resumption
of power in such areas tenuous at best. Nevertheless,
under Charles De Gaulle (1890-1970), a former general
and hero of two World Wars, the French government
attempted to reconstitute its prewar empire.

Women such as Djmila Bouhired (b. 1935) played leading roles
in the Algerian liberation movement. Born into a middle-class
family in colonial Algeria, Bouhired ran into discipline problems
in primary school for shouting “Algeria is our Mother” instead of
the customary “France is our mother” at morning assemblies.
Becoming an active demonstrator against French imperialism,
the dedicated and determined Bouhired once endured 17 hours
of torture at the hand of colonial officials without revealing any
useful information. In July 1957, French authorities arrested
Bouhired on charges of bombing a café that killed 11 people.
French attorney Jacques Verges agreed to represent Bouhired
at trial. In a sensational courtroom event that garnered
international attention, Verges accused French colonial officials
of carrying out the bombing. When a jury found Bouhired
guilty and sentenced her to death by guillotine, protest groups
campaigned on her behalf. Due to the personal intervention of
Moroccan Princess Laila Ayesha, French President René Coty
commuted Bouhired’s punishment to life imprisonment. After
serving five years at a prison in Reims, she was released in
1962 as part of a general amnesty policy.

Korea and Japan experienced a tumultuous relationship
in the 1800s and 1900s. For centuries the Kingdom
of Korea had been a vassal state to the Chinese Qing
dynasty until, in 1895, Japan defeated China in the
First Sino-Japanese War. With China no longer able
to influence Korean affairs, Japanese merchants,
diplomats and colonists soon began migrating to
the peninsula. By 1905, Tokyo demanded that Korea
accept Japanese supervision over its government and
become a protectorate of Japan. In 1907, Japanese
officials pressured the Korean Emperor Gojong (18521919) to give up the throne in favor of his son, the
crown prince Sunjong (1874-1926). They soon forced
Sunjong to sign a treaty that allowed Japan to annex
Korea. Although the United States had signed a treaty
of friendship with Korea in 1882, the administration of
Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) refused to intervene.
The Japanese colonial government suppressed Korean
history, language and cultural teaching and began a
campaign to force Koreans to accept Japanese names
and cultural identities. Thousands of Koreans resisted
through boycotts, strikes and guerilla warfare. Following
Japan’s defeat in World War II, Korea became divided
into Soviet and American spheres of influence.

over the Yalu, a 200,000 poorly armed yet determined
Chinese “volunteer” army moved into Korea on October
19. Chinese and North Korean troops pushed UN forces
south using human wave tactics and the brutal Korean
winter to maximum advantage. MacArthur publicly
demanded the authority to use nuclear weapons
against China. President Truman worried about the
Soviet reaction and aware that the Soviet Union had
successfully tested an atomic bomb in 1949, decided to
relieve MacArthur of command. Battle lines stabilized
near the 38th parallel, as the war continue to drag on.

EISENHOWER AND
THE COLD WAR

Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1880, Douglas
MacArthur (1880-1964) graduated first in his West
Point class in 1903. In 1941, he coordinated resistance
to the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. When
ordered to retreat to Australia, he promised the Filipino
people, “I shall return.” Three years later, he fulfilled
his promise, wading to shore to demonstrate his
resolve. Following the war, MacArthur was appointed
Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan.
A stern operator, he oversaw the distribution of aid
to the Japanese population, restarted the national
economy, supervised the rebuilding efforts and
helped create a new Japanese Constitution in 1947.
In 1950, MacArthur was given command over UN
forces in Korea.

196

In the U.S. Presidential election of 1952, Dwight
Eisenhower (1890-1959), a moderate Republican, retired
Army general and architect of D-Day, easily defeated
Democrat Adlai Stevenson (1900-1965). Eisenhower
and his militantly anti-communist Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles (1888-1959) reduced conventional
armed forces and increased America’s stockpile of
nuclear weapons in a strategy of “massive retaliation.”
Seeking an end to the stalemate in Korea and taking
advantage of the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953,
the Eisenhower administration supported an armistice
agreed to by the USSR, China, the United States and
North Korea (although not initially by South Korea).
Signed in July in the border town of Panmunjom, the
armistice remains in effect down to the present, making
the Korean War the most protracted armed conflict in
recent history.

IRANIAN INTERVENTION AND
THE FIRST INDOCHINA WAR
Although Eisenhower fulfilled his campaign to end
the fighting in Korea, his administration engaged in
other theaters of the Cold War. Angered by an AngloAmerican monopoly over their oil fields, Iranians
backed the progressive government of Prime Minister
Mohammad Mosaddeq (1882-1967) in 1951. Two
years later, the CIA helped Shah Reza Pahlavi (19191980) launch a military coup against the left-leaning
government of Prime Minister Mosaddeq.

CHAPTER 14 COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION OF THE WORLD FROM 1950

In September 1940, the Japanese Empire conquered the
French colonial possession of Indochina (modern-day
Vietnam). School teacher turned revolutionary Ho Chi
Minh (1890-1969) launched a guerilla movement against
the Japanese and their Vichy French collaborators. The
United States and Great Britain provided weapons and
logistical support for the rebels. As Japanese forces
abandoned the region in 1945, Ho proclaimed the
Republic of Vietnam. Hoping for U.S. recognition, Ho
and his followers were dismayed when the Truman
administration announced that it would support the
return of Indochina to the French. Ho then ordered his
Viet Minh forces to fight the French occupiers, this time

with Russian and Chinese support. From 1946-1954, the
Viet Minh fought an increasingly successful war against
French forces. In 1954, Vietnamese troops surrounded
and destroyed a well-armed French garrison at Dien
Bien Phu. Exhausted from decades of fighting, the
French announced to the United States their intention
to retreat from Vietnam. Although declining to aid
the French directly, Eisenhower and Dulles instead
poured money and military aid into Ngo Dinh Diem’s
(1901-1963) anti-communist government in the newly
created republic of South Vietnam. At the same time,
Eisenhower dispatched the U.S. Navy to defend Taiwan
during intense shelling from the Chinese mainland.

Ho Chi Minh was born into a family of scholars and
teachers in Hoang Tru, Vietnam, in 1890. He received
a traditional Confucian education before traveling
to France, the United States and Great Britain.
While living in Paris from 1919-1923, he became
involved with the French socialist movement. He
had unsuccessfully petitioned the delegates at
the 1919 Paris Peace Conference to recognize the
independence of Vietnam. From 1923-1924, he
attended the Communist University of the Toilers
of the East in Moscow before returning to Vietnam.
Traveling widely throughout Europe and Asia in the
1930s, he furthered his education in Russia and
worked with communist forces in China. In 1941,
Japanese imperial forces seized Vietnam. Ho returned
home to create the Viet Minh resistance movement.
During the Second World War, Ho received military
supplies and medical treatment from the American
Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a precursor of the

CIA. At the end of the conflict, Ho Chi Minh declared
the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
on September 2, 1945. When France began military
operations to retake Vietnam, Ho’s Viet Minh forces
retaliated. From 1946-1954, Ho waged a successful
war against French forces, achieving a significant
victory against them at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu,
where more than 10,000 French soldiers surrendered
to the Viet Minh. In 1954, France pulled out of
Vietnam, and the United Nations called for a general
election in 1956 to decide the country’s future.
South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem refused to
participate in the election and created the Republic
of Vietnam, headquartered in Saigon. Ho Chi Minh
created a new revolutionary movement, the Viet
Cong, to overthrow Diem’s regime and its American
backers. Although Ho died in 1969, his movement to
unify Vietnam came to fruition with the fall of Saigon
in 1975.
197

Throughout the 1950s, the Eisenhower administration
sponsored projects such as Radio Free Europe and
Radio Liberation to encourage dissension and revolt
behind the Iron Curtain. Yet when Soviet troops and
tanks crushed riots in East Germany in 1953 and a
full-fledged uprising in Hungary three years later, the
U.S. failed to intervene. The United States worked in
partnership with the Soviet Union to end a joint seizure
of the Suez Canal by British, French and Israeli forces
in 1956. The successful launch of Sputnik I, the first
artificial satellite to be launched into orbit, encouraged
American Cold War strategists to consider that the
Soviet Union might possess the ability to strike the U.S.
with nuclear-tipped missiles from half a world away.

By the late 1950s, the Eisenhower administration
attempted to deemphasize tensions with the Soviet
Union. In 1953, Russian reformer Nikita Khrushchev
(1894-1971) became the premier of the Soviet Union.
Denouncing Stalin’s brutal purges in a secret party
meeting in 1956, he implemented a policy of freeing
some political prisoners, allowing the publication of
critical accounts of life under Stalinism, permitting
Russian citizens to travel abroad in large numbers,
and pursuing closer ties with the West. This created
an enormous rift with Mao Zedong, who condemned
Khrushchev’s speech and designated himself the true
inheritor of Lenin’s and Stalin’s socialist legacies.

CUBAN REVOLUTION
During the Cold War, countries were pressured to embrace
democracy or socialism. While a few countries joined
what is known as the non-aligned movement, a group
of countries that strove not to be drawn into the clash of
superpowers, those closer to America or the Soviet Union
were not always free to make a choice. Being only 90 miles
off the coast of Florida, Cuba was a vital ally to the United
States. Cuba, however, did not have much experience

In 1959, Khrushchev toured Los Angeles, New
York, Pittsburgh, Iowa and Washington DC.
Having been raised in a farming family, he
particularly enjoyed his time in Iowa, where
he toured Iowa State University’s agricultural
education program. An enthusiastic supporter
of corn production, he hoped to duplicate the
success of Iowa’s corn industry in the Soviet
Union. He also wanted Eisenhower to visit the
USSR. This invitation was revoked after the
downing of an American U2 spy plane caught
flying over Soviet airspace in May 1960.

with democracy, having had a long history of autocratic
rule. During the colonial period, Cubans had little role in
the running of the government and, after independence
(1902), had a string of dictators who ruled with an iron
fist. In 1933, one such dictator, a 32-year-old sergeant by
the name of Fulgencio Batista (1901-1973), seized control
of the government. Batista would manage the government
directly or through puppet governments until 1944 when
his candidate for the presidency lost the election. Batista
returned to power in 1951 after staging a bloodless coup.
This is known as Batista’s second dictatorship.

Fidel Castro (1926-2016) would emerge as Batista's
toughest critic and rival. A long-time radical, Castro,
while studying law, became increasingly active in
student politics and after graduation, established his
own law firm. Critical of Batista’s government, Castro
even brought legal actions against the dictator. This
was a dangerous game. It also taught Fidel that law
in a lawless state was useless and that violence, as

Although he had once been dedicated to social reform,
upon returning to power in 1951, Batista was more
focused on winning the support of the Cuban elite and
increasing his personal fortune. Batista worked with the
United States and its corporations to attract investment
in Cuba. In a few short years, American investors came
to own a majority of Cuba’s public utilities, its railways
and mines. The ultimate symbol of the profits made
by American corporations was the gold-coated phone
given by ITT Corporation to Batista after he approved
a large and, for ITT, very profitable telephone rate
increase. Batista’s new approach caused him to lose the Fidel Castro and
support of many Cubans, who began looking for new His Men in the

advocated by Lenin, was the only vehicle for social
change. Concluding that he could no longer tolerate
the Batista regime, Castro first attempted to overthrow
the state in 1953 with an unsuccessful attack on a
provincial army barracks. Sent to prison, Castro was
released in 1955.
Wanting to continue his efforts against Batista, Fidel
traveled to Mexico with his brother Raul (b. 1931).
In Mexico, they would be introduced to the young
Argentine Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara (1928-1967). A trained
doctor who had become a leading Marxist, Che joined
the brothers in their quest against Batista and would
later be a martyr to the cause of worldwide revolution.
In December 1956, Fidel set sail with 81 others to unseat
Batista’s government. Ambushed by government forces,
less than 20 would survive the landing. Refusing to Cubans and American corporations was taken and

In April 1961, an operation known as the Bay of Pigs
was launched to remove Castro from power. Led by
Cuban exiles and funded covertly by the United States,
the failed operation increased Castro’s power while also
strengthening relations between the Soviets and Cuba.
The Bay of Pigs accelerated Soviet interest in Cuba. To
ensure Soviet influence over a territory near the U.S.,
Khrushchev sent large sums of economic, technical
and military aid to Cuba. By 1962, the Soviets began
secretly importing into Cuba, ballistic missiles capable
of carrying nuclear warheads into the U.S.
On October 22, 1962, President John F. Kennedy (19171963) demanded that the missiles be removed from
Cuba. Kennedy then imposed a naval blockade on
the island as Soviet ships advanced toward Cuba. On
October 27, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev informed
Kennedy that he would remove the missiles if the U.S.
agreed not to attack Cuba. No one bothered to tell
Castro. Enraged, Castro sent Cuban soldiers to take
over the missile sites. The Soviets defended the missiles
and took them back to the Soviet Union.
During Castro’s time as the leader of Cuba, the economy
relied heavily on the Soviet Union and it was in much
trouble, especially after the break-up of the Soviet Union
in 1991. While the effects of the Cuban revolution
continue to be debated today, one thing is clear; Fidel
Castro turned a small Caribbean nation into one of the
world’s best-known and most talked about places.

BERLIN WALL
Although the Caribbean proved an important theatre in
the Cold War in the early 1960s, it was not the only one.
Throughout the 1960s, thousands of East Germans and
other groups living behind the Iron Curtain migrated
to the West, often through the free city of West Berlin.
Worried about losing skilled labor, East German and
Soviet officials slowly choked off migration to the West.
On August 12, 1961, East German officials sealed the
border with West Berlin. Over the next several weeks,
brick walls topped by barbed wire, minefields, and a no
man’s land sprang up between East and West Berlin.
Although limited amounts of travel and trade between
West and East Germany continued throughout the Cold
War, the Berlin Wall essentially sealed both societies off
from one another. Linked to the United States and NATO,
West Germany became more capitalistic, individualistic
and materialistic. Dominated by Russia, East Germany
was characterized by single-party rule, state control of
the economy, a police state complete with the secret

police (Stasi), a controlled educational system, and
constant inculcation of communist ideology.
In summer 1963, U.S. President John F. Kennedy visited
West Germany, including a trip to West Berlin. In front
of the West Berlin Rathaus Schoneberg (city hall),
Kennedy gave a rousing speech in which he declared,
“Ich bin ein Berliner” (I am a Berliner). Although
Kennedy primarily sought to show solidarity with a key
Cold War ally, his speech helped cement, in the eyes of
many Americans and Europeans, the perception that
the West stood for freedom, opportunity and the future.
In contrast, the Eastern Bloc appeared to be a closed
police state trapped in the past.

(1908-1973), proved a key figure in the Cold War. A
Texas native, admirer of Franklin Roosevelt, and former
Senate majority leader, Johnson had little foreign
policy experience. After being sworn in as president,
LBJ primarily concentrated on domestic issues, using
the death of JFK to push through the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, and declaring
war on poverty with an expansive set of social welfare
programs known as the Great Society.
Initially, Johnson continued to uphold the foreign
policy initiatives of his predecessors. In 1964, the
People’s Republic of China detonated its first nuclear
bomb and edged closer to displacing Taiwan as the
official representative for China on the UN Security
Council. The Johnson administration responded by
increasing U.S. military and economic assistance to Ngo
Dinh Diem’s South Vietnamese government. However,
Ho Chi Minh’s Viet Cong movement, supplied by both
the USSR and the PRC, only continued to increase
in manpower and popularity. Relying on a cadre of
Kennedy appointees including Defense Secretary
Robert S. McNamara (1916-2009), Secretary of State
Dean Rusk (1909-1994) and National Security Advisor

McGeorge Bundy (1919-1996), Johnson began to send
American combat troops to Vietnam.
Throughout the early 1960s, North and South Vietnam
fought a bloody civil war. Communist China supported
the North Vietnamese, while the United States backed
the regime of Ngo Dien Diem in Saigon. In early August
1964, the U.S. Navy destroyers U.S.S. Maddox and U.S.S.
Turner Joy were patrolling the Gulf of Tonkin off the
coast of North Vietnam. On August 2, three North
Vietnamese patrol boats engaged in a skirmish with
the Maddox. Two days later, the Maddox and Turner
Joy reported another attack and returned fire. However,
conflicting reports stated that the American destroyers
fired at what they thought was a second attack, although
no North Vietnamese ships were actually spotted. In
any case, President Johnson appeared live on television
before the American public to report the attacks and
announce his intention to retaliate. On August 7,
Congress agreed to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution,
providing the President with wide latitude to conduct
military operations in Vietnam. It was the closest the
United States ever came to formally declaring war on
North Vietnam.

CHAPTER 14 COLD WAR AND DECOLONIZATION OF THE WORLD FROM 1950

THE END OF THE COLD WAR
For the rest of the 1970s, the United States remained
preoccupied with domestic issues such as the decline of
the steel belt, drastic increases in oil prices, stagflation,
the Iranian hostage crisis, and the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. The one diplomatic breakthrough during
this period was the improvement of diplomatic relations
between the United States and the People’s Republic of
China. Following the success of Communist forces in the
Chinese Civil War in 1949, the United States refused to
recognize Mao Zedong’s regime. Chinese intervention
in the Korean War and support for Ho Chi Minh’s
Viet Cong forces in the Vietnam War likewise hobbled
efforts at dialogue. In 1969, Sino-Soviet relations began
to deteriorate. This was caused, in part, by a border
dispute which, in 1969, led to Soviet and Chinese troops
engaging in a brief shooting war over the ownership of
Zhenbao Island on the Ussuri River near Manchuria.
In the meantime, the Nixon administration’s desire
for Chinese support for aiding America’s exit from
Vietnam provided an opportunity for a thaw in SinoU.S. relations. After several meetings between Chinese
officials and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger,
President Richard Nixon made a highly advertised
goodwill trip to Beijing in 1972, meeting with Chinese
Party Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai
(1898-1976). During the trip, the parties discussed
the possibility of diplomatic recognition and closer
economic and cultural ties between China and the
United States. When Mao died four years later, moderate
reformer Deng Xiaoping (1904-1997) came to power.
In 1978, President Jimmy Carter (b. 1924) and Deng
established diplomatic relations. To reassure America’s
Taiwanese allies, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations
Act of 1979, which required the U.S. to defend Taiwan
in case of invasion.

that the USSR could not keep up with American military
spending, Gorbachev announced the new policies of
glasnost (openness and transparency) and perestroika
(restructuring). Above all, Gorbachev sought to allow
criticism of the government and to open Russia’s
state-run economy to liberal reforms.However, the
pace of change soon outstripped the ability of Soviet
officials to control its effects. In November 1989,
Soviet and East German leaders agreed to tear down
the Berlin Wall. As thousands of Eastern Europeans
fled to freedom in the West, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine and the Baltic states
began withdrawing from the USSR and turning their
backs on communist ideology. Following a failed coup
against Gorbachev’s regime, Soviet leaders disbanded
the USSR in December 1991.

TIANANMEN MASSACRE
Events took a different turn in China. The collapse of
the Soviet Union created tremendous demands for
political, economic and social change among ordinary
Chinese citizens. Uncertain of what to do, the Chinese
government of Deng Xiaoping made minor concessions
and played for time. However, throughout spring 1989,
thousands of demonstrators congregated in Tiananmen
Park in Beijing, where Mao Zedong had proclaimed
the existence of the PRC exactly four decades before.
Building makeshift monuments to freedom and
marching with placards, hundreds of demonstrators
camped overnight in the park. Chinese officials
negotiated with the protesters while building up police
and military forces surrounding Tiananmen. When
talks stalled, Deng ordered the military to disperse the
crowd on June 4. Even to this day, it is estimated that
hundreds, possibly thousands, of demonstrators died
in the ensuing conflict. Although the United States and
other Western countries imposed economic and cultural
sanctions on China, East-West relations were restored
by the time of the Clinton Administration in 1993. As
a result of the Tiananmen Massacre, the CCP sent a
message that although it would continue to liberalize
economically, it would tolerate no social liberalization
or threats to its power.

The election of conservative Republican Ronald Reagan
(1911-2004) in 1980 brought about a resurgence in
Cold War tensions. Dismissing the Soviet Union as
an “evil empire,” Reagan drastically increased military
spending, provided additional military and economic
aid to allies in the third world, and began a massive
military build-up of both conventional and nuclear Although official accounts vary, it is estimated that

SUMMARY
The Cold War was a unique kind of conflict. Deeply ideological, the Cold War pitted supporters of
democratic government, capitalism and individualism against proponents of one-party political systems,
socialist economic planning and the collective good. On another level the war represented a struggle
between the world’s two most powerful nations. Although the Cold War did explode into real conflict—
Korea and Vietnam for instance – it was largely a war carried out in the shadows, involving boycotts,
propaganda and national reputations. Although the United States and its allies won the war, significant
geopolitical issues remained to be solved.
Although the Soviet Union was dismantled, Russia remained a viable state. The role that Russians, in
shock and angered by the loss of the Cold War but still possessing a powerful conventional military
and nuclear arsenal, would play on the world stage remained to be determined. Although the countries
of Eastern Europe were now free, their economies remained fragile. Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and
Slovaks now had to determine if their nations would progress with free markets or some form of
capitalist-socialist hybrid system. Germans now openly discussed the possibility of reunification. But
what type of relationship would a unified Germany have with its neighbors? Although a key U.S. ally in
the Cold War, Japan now stood as a nation with a powerful economy that could increasingly say no to
the will of the American government. Finally, as the Tiananmen Square Massacre revealed, although the
People’s Republic of China had liberalized key sectors of its economy, it would not reform its political or
constitutional system. Therefore, although there was much to celebrate at the end of the Cold War, the
people of the world looked forward to the end of the 20th century with a mixture of hope and uncertainty.

The Modern
World

President Reagan is giving his famous speech 1984 at the
Berlin Wall behind the Brandenburg Gate on the West
Berlin side.
Created in 1961 by the East German government to
prevent local citizens from fleeing to the West, the
Berlin Wall represented a collection of bunkers, guard
towers and barbed wire fences that spanned 96 miles
through downtown Berlin. In three decades, over 140
people were killed trying to cross the barrier. As the
Cold War intensified, the Berlin Wall became a symbol
of communist oppression.

Following the announcement of Mikhail Gorbachev’s
liberalizing glasnost and perestroika policies of the
mid-1980s, the pro-Kremlin East German government
faced public pressure to reform. Bowing to such
pressures, GDR Politburo Member Gunter Schabowski
announced in a November 9, 1989 press conference that
the East German government would allow freedom of
travel between the two Germanys. When a reporter

asked when this policy would take effect, the startled officials
responded, “As far as I know—immediately, without delay.”
Within minutes of Schabowski’s statement, East German
crowds took sledgehammers to the Berlin Wall, a hated symbol
of Soviet repression. When border guards refused to fire on the
Mauerspechte (wallpeckers), East Germans began climbing
over the wall to be greeted with flowers and champagne from
elated West Berliners. The fall of the Berlin Wall marked a
crucial moment in the emergence of a post-Cold War world.
This chapter discusses the political, economic and social factors
that led to the fall of the Soviet Union and the emergence of a
“new world order.”

Completed in 1791 as a monument to King Frederick Wilhelm
of Prussia, the Brandenburg Gate represented one of the most
famous landmarks in Berlin. Located near the Berlin Wall on the
West German side, the gate served as a symbol of hope and
unity during the Cold War. Most famously, it served as the site
for U.S. President John F. Kennedy’s June 26, 1963 “Ich bin ein
Berliner” speech. The gate was also a popular rallying point for
demonstrators during the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

CHAPTER 15 THE MODERN WORLD

THE FALL OF
THE SOVIET UNION
The death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 created a
power vacuum in the Kremlin. Georgy Malenkov (19011988), a loyal Stalinist, initially emerged as the new
premier. However, less than two years later, the popular
political reformer Nikita Khrushchev replaced the dour
Malenkov as the key powerbroker in Moscow. In a
secret speech delivered to the 20th Party Congress on
February 14, 1956, Khrushchev condemned Stalin for
“his intolerance, his brutality, and his abuse of power”
against “not only against actual enemies but also against
individuals who had not committed any crimes against
the party or the Soviet Government.” Over the next two
years, Khrushchev shuttered “GULAG” labor camps,
freed thousands of political prisoners, eased travel
restrictions to and from the USSR, and announced
a “peaceful cooperation” policy with the West. To be
certain, Khruschev did not hesitate to brutally crush an
uprising in Hungary in 1956. Nevertheless, his tenure as
premier marked a definite thaw in the Cold War.
During the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, U.S. President
John F. Kennedy successfully prevented the installation
of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. Soviet leaders
blamed Khruschev for caving to Western pressure and
two years later backed Leonid Brezhnev (1906-1982)
to become the new premier. A communist hardliner,
Brezhnev rolled back many of the Khruschev-era
reforms. For instance, in what became known as the
“Brezhnev Doctrine,” the Soviet leader argued that any
attempt to overthrow a socialist government in the
Eastern Bloc threatened all socialist nations throughout
the region and justified invasion by the Soviet Union
and its Warsaw Pact allies. Brezhnev used this rationale
to justify the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in
1968 to suppress the reform movement known as the
“Prague Spring.” Brezhnev restored many state controls
over the Soviet economy, emphasizing slow and steady
industrial and agricultural growth. Although this
approach allowed the Soviet economy to avoid the
boom-and-bust cycles of Western nations it also came
at the expense of chronic shortages of consumer goods
and stagnated living standards throughout the USSR.

1924) administrations to create the Strategic Arms
Limitation Treaties (SALT I and SALT II), which
limited the stockpiles of nuclear arms each nation
could possess and the circumstances under which
such weapons could be used. However, any hopes for
a breakthrough in the nuclear arms race ended with
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Since the end
of the Second World War, both Soviet and Western
diplomats had treated Afghanistan as a buffer state. Yet
in 1973, the Soviet-backed leader of the Afghanistan
socialist party Mohammed Daoud Khan (1909-1978)
seized control of Kabul and announced the creation
of the left-leaning Republic of Afghanistan. Offended
by Khan’s Marxist government and its support from
the Soviets, many Muslim chieftains who controlled
the surrounding countryside worked to undermine
both Khan and his Soviet allies. From 1979-1989,
Mujahedeen (those who struggle) forces used guerrilla
tactics—ambushes, assassinations, bombings and hitand-run attacks—to wear down Soviet forces. In a
striking parallel to the United States’ defeat in Vietnam,
the Soviet-Afghan War sapped the USSR of manpower,
morale and resources. The conflict also economically
and diplomatically isolated the Soviet Union in the eyes
of the world community.

SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT
Throughout the 1970s, many Eastern Europeans
became frustrated by rising food prices and declining
living standards. In June 1976, Polish Prime Minister
Piotr Jaroszewicz (1909-1992) announced drastic price
increases for essential goods such as butter, meat and
sugar. When an estimated 20,000 Warsaw residents
took to the streets in protest, state security services
lying in wait launched a vicious crackdown. Realizing
they had a common enemy, Polish labor unions joined
forces with intellectuals to create the Worker’s Defense
Party (KOR) to provide a united front that look to build
a better Poland.

In 1980, electrical engineer Lech Walesa (b. 1943)
worked closely with KOR to launch a strike at the
Gdansk shipyards. Similar strikes quickly broke out
across the nation. Walesa coordinated with local strike
leaders to form the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee.

ranks of the Polish clergy. In 1978, he became Pope Jean
Paul II, the first non-Italian pontiff in nearly 500 years.
Lending the moral weight of the Roman Catholic Church to
the solidarity movement, the newly installed pope quickly
attracted millions of followers on both sides of the Iron
Curtain. John-Paul II also steered the Catholic Church on a
more conservative course away from the liberation theology
and Vatican II movements of the 1960s. In May 1981,
Turkish extremist Mehmet Ali Ağca (b. 1958) attempted to
assassinate the Pope. John-Paul II not only recovered but
met with and forgave his assailant in prison. As a religious
leader who could command respect amongst Polish dock
workers and Vatican hardliners, John-Paul II became one
of the most popular pontiffs in church history.

centralized planning, staggering inefficiency and deepseated corruption, the Soviet economy proved unable to
clothe and feed the USSR’s 276 million people. Years of
emphasizing military over civilian production appeared to
have failed as the United States and Great Britain launched
a massive military buildup that the Soviet Union could
no longer keep up with. By the 1980s, a young generation
of Soviet citizens had come of age. Well-educated and
upwardly mobile, they had grown up on illegal but
readily available Western news programs, music and
television shows, and many had become openly critical
of communism and socialism. Furthermore, many ethnic
minorities living under Russian domination, including
Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks,
Hungarians, Ukrainians and Azerbaijanis, clamored for
more autonomy, control over their internal affairs, and
increasingly, independence. The bloody stalemate in
Afghanistan continued unabated, with most of the free
world openly supporting the Mujahadeen.
To tackle these problems, Gorbachev announced two
new policies: Glasnost (publicity or openness) which
promised freedom of speech, including the ability to
criticize the government, and Perestroika (restructuring
or reforming), which sought to relax governmental
control over the economy, encourage privatization and
provide transparency to the taxpayers. Although wellmeaning, these initiatives did little to stem the forces
already tearing the Soviet Union apart.

Born in 1931, Gorbachev represented a break from an earlier generation
of Soviet leaders who witnessed the Romanovs’ absolutism, the
Russian defeat in World War I, and the October Revolution. A committed
Marxist-Leninist, Gorbachev became a reformer in the tradition of Nikita
Khrushchev. Walking a difficult tightrope, Gorbachev openly supported
Brezhnev’s crackdown on Prague Spring in 1968 while privately
becoming frustrated by the corruption and waste he encountered
because of centralized planning. Throughout the 1970s, Gorbachev
avidly read the works of Western Marxist intellectuals and networked
with Italian, German and French socialists. Upon becoming a member
of the politburo in 1980, Gorbachev helped to advance Yuri Andropov
(1914-1984) to the position of premier following Brezhnev’s death two
years later. When the sickly Andropov passed away in 1984 only to be
replaced by the even more ill Konstantin Chernenko (1911-1985), who
died of cancer in March 1985, Gorbachev became the new leader of the
Soviet Union.

One of the first victories for the LDF came in the Supreme

Born in 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama, Rosa Parks
grew up on stories of “slavery days” told by
her grandfather. Growing up in Montgomery,
Alabama, Parks attended segregated schools
and received a high school education and training
as a seamstress at the Montgomery Industrial
School for Girls. Joining the NAACP in 1943, she
received training as a nonviolent demonstrator
from the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle,
Tennessee. In 1955, she spontaneously refused
to give up her bus seat to a white man, triggering
the Montgomery Bus Boycott. She died in 2005
in Detroit.

(1943-2018), had to walk several miles across dangerous
train tracks to attend a second-rate school for African
Americans when a brand new white primary school
lay a few blocks from her home. Thurgood Marshall
and his associates pushed the case through state and
federal courts. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court under
the leadership of the recently installed Chief Justice Earl
Warren (1891-1974) ruled in favor of Brown. Speaking
for a unanimous court on May 17 Warren asserted
“[w]e conclude that, in the field of public education,
the doctrine of “separate but equal” has no place.
Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.”
The results of the Brown decision were instantly
controversial. Southern legislatures passed dozens of
“interposition” laws designed to find ways around, or
at least delay desegregation. Over the next 12 months,
only a few schools throughout the nation started any
form of desegregation. This prompted Warren to issue
another decision known as Brown II demanding that
schools begin desegregating “with all deliberate speed.”

at the back of buses and surrender their seats to white
passengers on demand. Acting on her own, Parks was
arrested and quickly released on bail. Local black leaders
including local NAACP President E. D. Nixon (18991987) and 27-year-old Dexter Avenue Baptist Church
minister Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968) quickly
formed the Montgomery Improvement Association to
rally public support for Parks. The MIA coordinated a
massive strike on Montgomery’s public transportation
system that lasted for over a year. Nixon and King
also launched a federal lawsuit Browder v. Gayle that
challenged Montgomery’s segregated bus system. On
December 20, 1956, the Warren Court struck down
segregation in public transportation.

Drawing from the success of the Montgomery Campaign,
King and other civil rights leaders including Ralph
Abernathy (1926-1990), Joseph Lowery (1921-2020),
Bayard Rustin (1912-1987) and Fred Shuttlesworth
(1922-2011), gathered in January 1957 in Atlanta,

hostility, they would not return violence with violence.
In addition to possibly changing the hearts of their
oppressors, such nonviolent tactics also provided a
powerful image to the world of armed officers using
brutal tactics against unarmed demonstrators seeking
basic civil rights.
The next battle in the civil rights movement came in
the fall of 1957 when nine African American school
children and their families attempted to desegregate
Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas. When
Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus (1910-1994) called
out the Arkansas National Guard to prevent the students
from attending classes. Although U.S. President Dwight
Eisenhower had previously proved reluctant to support
the civil rights movement, he was not about to allow a
state governor to contest the authority of a federal court
order. He dispatched the 101st Airborne to protect the
students from harassing mobs and ensure that they were
allowed to pursue their education at Central High School.
Three years later, four African American students
attempted to peacefully desegregate a Woolworth’s
lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. Their
efforts sparked a series of similar sit-ins across the
nation. They also inspired a group of seven black and
six white “freedom riders” in spring 1961 to travel
throughout the south by bus, deliberately disobeying
local segregation laws. Although the riders faced violent
attacks in Anniston and Birmingham, Alabama, their
efforts helped draw worldwide attention to the plight of
civil rights protesters.

In 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC launched
an all-out campaign against segregation in Birmingham,
Alabama. On April 3, King was arrested for participating
in a public protest without a permit. While imprisoned,
King wrote his seminal “Letter from Birmingham Jail”
which outlined his philosophy of nonviolence. To keep
up the momentum, the SCLC and local civil rights
leaders made the controversial decision to allow schoolage children take part in the protests. When Birmingham
Public Safety Commissioner Eugene “Bull” Connor
(1897-1973) sought to disrupt the demonstrations by
using police armed with clubs and dogs, and firemen
wielding water cannons, national news cameras captured
the confrontations and turned national public opinion
decisively against the defenders of segregation. On May
10, a newly installed city government and the SCLC
reached an agreement to free all arrested demonstrators,
end segregation of parks and public transportation,
and allow African Americans to hold positions in
Birmingham’s police and city government. However,
the success of the Birmingham campaign was tragically
undercut four months later by the murder of four
young girls. On the morning of Sunday, September
16, 1963, white supremacists placed a bomb in the
Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, a key meeting point
for civil rights demonstrators. At 10:22 a.m. the bomb
went off, killing four young girls - Addie Mae Collins
(14 years old), Denise McNair (11 years old), Carole
Robertson (14 years old) and Cynthia Wesley (14 years
old). The brutal bombing revealed the true horror of
segregation and encouraged even more support for the
civil rights movement.

Organized by A. Philip Randolph and Bayard
Rustin, the March on Washington for Jobs and
Freedom held on August 28, 1963, attracted
between 200,000-300,000 demonstrators,
70-80% of whom were African American.
Auto Union Worker President Walter Reuther
played a key role in organizing the march. The
march played a leading role in the passage of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In August 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. and the leaders
of other civil rights and labor organizations led 250,000
demonstrators in a march on Washington. Standing
before the Lincoln Memorial King, delivered his “I Have
a Dream Speech” in which he envisioned:
When we allow freedom to ring, when we let it
ring from every village and every hamlet, from
every state and every city, we will be able to
speed up that day when all of God’s children,
black men and white men, Jews, and Gentiles,
Protestants, and Catholics, will be able to join
hands and sing in the words of the old Negro
spiritual: “Free at last! Free at last! thank God
Almighty, we are free at last!
The son of a Baptist minister, Martin Luther King Jr. was
raised in Atlanta and subsequently attended Morehouse
College and Boston University. Pastor at the Dexter
Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, King
at age 26 became a spokesman for the Montgomery Bus
Boycott. Catapulted to national fame, he helped form
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and
carried out a series of high-profile civil rights campaigns
throughout the 1950s and 1960s.
As support for the civil rights movement grew, national
political leaders carefully watched its development.
One such figure was Lyndon Baines Johnson, a largerthan-life Texan who had served as a congressman,
Senate majority leader, and vice-president. Elevated
to the presidency following the assassination of John
F. Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963, Johnson
sought to use the publicity generated by the March
on Washington and the martyrdom of JFK (who, like
Eisenhower, had initially been lukewarm on the civil
rights movement) to push through Congress the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 that struck down segregation in large
areas of public life - parks, restaurants, movie theaters,
stores, libraries and public transportation. For his
tireless support of civil rights, King received the Nobel
Peace Prize in October 1964.

many of whom were college students, fanned out across
Mississippi to set up “freedom schools” that helped
local African Americans register to vote. On June 21,
1964, Ku Klux Klan members aided by local police
officers murdered three activists - James Chaney (19431964), Andrew Goodman (1943-1964), and Michael
Schwerner (1939-1964) - in Neshoba County. At the
1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City,
New Jersey, Fannie Lou Hamer (1917-1977) led efforts
to create the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party as
an alternative to the state’s all-white delegation.
The events of Freedom Summer inspired Martin Luther
King Jr. and his SCLC followers to plan a Voting Rights
March from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. On
Sunday, March 7, 1965, in what the national media
later referred to as “Bloody Sunday,” Alabama state
troopers brutally beat demonstrators on the Edmund
Pettus Bridge. Two days later, James Bevel (1936-2008)
and another group of demonstrators were arrested for
trying to cross the bridge. President Lyndon Baines
Johnson federalized the Alabama National Guard and
ordered them to protect the demonstrators. He also
successfully leveraged the images of armed police
officers accosting peaceful demonstrators on national
television to secure passage of the Voting Rights Act of
1965 which allowed the federal government to monitor
local elections and guard polling places to prevent voter
suppression and intimidation. On March 21, King and
his followers peacefully crossed Edmund Pettus Bridge
and marched to Montgomery, attracting an estimated
25,000 demonstrators. On the steps of the Alabama
State Capital, King delivered his seminal “How Long,
Not Long” speech.

Following the Voting Rights March, Martin Luther King
Jr. and the SCLC began to take strong stands against
the war in Vietnam and in support of economic justice
for Americans living below the poverty line. In 1968,
King launched his “Poor People’s Campaign” to march
on Washington DC. On April 4, 1968, embittered white
supremacist James Earl Ray assassinated Martin Luther
King at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee.

Born in 1921 in Peoria, Illinois, Betty Friedan graduated
from Smith College. Finding work as a journalist,
Friedan published the bestselling Feminine Mystique
in 1963. The book described the feelings of isolation
and a lack of fulfillment faced by many American
women in the postwar period. She co-founded the
National Organization for Women in 1966 and served
as its first president. A tireless advocate for women’s
rights, she died in Washington DC in 2006.

voice in the civil rights movement. In the 1950s former
small-time criminal, Malcolm Little (1925-1965) went
through a religious awakening in prison. Becoming a
devout member of the African American led Nation
of Islam, Little adopted the name “Malcolm X.” Giving
speeches across the nation to sold-out stadiums,
Malcolm X urged African Americans to stand up for
themselves and to take pride in their African heritage.
After a falling out with the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
(1897-1975), leader of the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X
went on a hajj to Mecca. Although moderating his racial
beliefs and showing a new willingness to work with other
civil rights groups, Malcolm X differed sharply from
King in his insistence that ‘[w]e declare our right on this
earth to be a man, to be a human being, to be respected
as a human being, to be given the rights of a human
being in this society, on this earth, in this day, which we
intend to bring into existence by any means necessary.”
However, on February 21, 1965, three gunmen, possibly
rival Nation of Islam members, assassinated Malcolm X
at an Organization of Afro-American Unity held at the
Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan.
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the civil rights
movement and women’s rights movements often
worked together to achieve similar objectives. From the
beginning, women played a leading role in the civil rights
movement. Ella Baker (1903-1986) not only helped to
organize the SCLC but was also a founding member of
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).
Gloria Richardson (1922-2021) led the Cambridge
Movement in Maryland whose sit-ins and protests led

to widespread desegregation across the Old-Line State.
As a civil rights attorney, Pauli Murray (1910-1985)
helped to organize the defense for Brown v. Board and
drafted portions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She also
helped to find the National Organization for Women
(NOW) in 1966.
Many women’s rights activists gained inspiration from not
only the civil rights movement but also the publication of
Betty Friedan’s seminal The Feminine Mystique (1963).
Throughout her work, Freidan articulated the feelings of
repressed anger and disillusionment which many middle
and working-class women felt in an American society
that was rapidly progressing in terms of technology,
education and employment opportunities, yet which
still consigned them to the traditional women’s roles
of mother, teacher, secretary and nurse. The Feminine
Mystique encouraged women to organize and join
organizations such as NOW which pushed for equal
pay, employment rights and educational opportunities
in law, business and medical schools. In the late 1960s
women’s rights activists pushed for an Equal Rights
Amendment that would forbid discrimination based
on gender. Approved by Congress in 1972, the ERA
failed to gain the necessary ratification of 2/3rds of
the states to become official. However, the following
year women earned a substantial victory in the field
of reproductive rights. In the landmark U.S. Supreme
Court case of Roe v. Wade (1973), the High Court
upheld the right of a woman to an abortion during the
first trimester of pregnancy.

The struggles of African Americans and women to
gain equality inspired other marginalized social
groups to stand up for their rights. For instance,
in 1962 Mexican-American migrant worker and
social activist Cesar Chavez (1927-1993) mobilized
poor agricultural laborers to form the United Farm
Workers (UFW). Drawing from King’s nonviolence

philosophy, in 1965, Chavez launched a widely
publicized strike on behalf of poor, Filipino
employees of several vineyards in Delano, California.
Forced to the bargaining table, several large agrobusinesses signed agreements with the UFW,
promising to improve working conditions, pay and
more opportunities for professional advancement. In
1975, Chavez and his followers successfully lobbied
the California legislature to pass the California
Agricultural Labor Relations Act which allowed
workers to collectively bargain and go on strike.
The success of the civil rights movement also inspired
Native American activism. In 1968, Dennis Banks
(1937-2017), George Mitchell (1936-2015), Russell
Means (1939-2012) and other activists founded the
American Indian Movement (AIM) in Minneapolis,
Minnesota. AIM soon gained national recognition for
carrying out a series of well-publicized occupations at
the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington DC, and
Wounded Knee, South Dakota, the site of a massacre
of Native Americans by federal troops in 1890. By

days, AIM brought public attention to centuries of
Native American abuse and exploitation at the hands
of whites.
Of all the social movements of the mid-twentieth
century, the LGBTQ+ remains one of the most
complex. Although individuals who identified as
queer could be found across all social classes and
ethnic groups, they often lived double lives on the
margins of “polite society.” However, the social
forces unleashed by the 1960s served to unify
and politicize the growing LGBTQ+ community.
On the early morning of June 28, 1968, New York
City police raided the Stonewall Bar in Greenwich
Village, an establishment that catered to a largely

gay clientele. When patrons resisted arrest, thousands
of demonstrators spontaneously came to their aid.
Over the next several days, activists and their allies held
demonstrations across the United States. The Stonewall
Riots represented the first large-scale outpouring of
LGBTQ+ activism on a national level and helped inspire
the creation of the Gay Liberation Front a year later. On
June 28, 1970, the first Gay Pride March occurred in
New York City. Three years later the National Gay and
Lesbian Taskforce began to lobby Congress and the
White House for the advancement of LGBTQ+ rights.
In 1977, Harvey Milk (1930-1978) became the first
openly gay man to win an election, becoming a member
of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. However,
Milk’s tragic assassination by disgruntled former Board
of Supervisors member Dan White (1946-1985) in 1978
revealed the ongoing dangers LGBTQ+ Americans still
faced in American society.
By the early 1970s, a growing percentage of Americans
had become frustrated by the rapid pace of social change
and the breakout of so many social justice movements.
President Richard M. Nixon (1913-1994) dubbed this
group the “silent majority.” They primarily represented
working- and middle-class whites who were religiously
conservative. Angered by the social upheavals of the
period and worried by inflation, rising gas prices and
a weak economy, white conservatives began to borrow
from the tactics used by civil rights demonstrators
including holding sit-ins and marches to protest the
expansion of government.
219

Enjoying a commanding lead in the presidential
election of 1980, Ronald Reagan (1911-2004) and
his Republican supporters took control of the U.S.
Senate and made sizable inroads in the House of
Representatives and governor’s mansions across the
country. Seeking to reduce the size of the federal
government and roll back many New Deal and Great
Society reforms, the Reagan administration did little to
advance civil rights other than by appointing African
American Samuel Pierce (1922-2000) as the Secretary
of Housing and Urban Development, and Sandra Day
O’Connor (b. 1930) as the first female justice of the
U.S. Supreme Court. The early 1980s witnessed the
first outbreak of AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome) in the U.S. A deadly, blood-based disease that
attacked the immune system, the Reagan administration
did not publicly acknowledge AIDS until 1986 and only
committed funding to fight it in 1987.

wake of Martin Luther King’s assassination nearly a
quarter century before. On April 29, 1992, four police
officers used excessive force on an African American
named Rodney King (1965-2012) after an extensive
car chase. Caught on tape by a local resident, videos of
the beating soon appeared on media outlets across the
world. When a jury acquitted the four police officers,
riots exploded across Los Angeles. Over the next six
days, 53 people died and 2,383 were injured in the
fighting. Demonstrators set more than 7,000 fires and
caused over $1 billion in property damage.
President Bush’s slow response to the situation proved
a factor in his defeat in the 1992 presidential election
to moderate Democrat William Jefferson “Bill” Clinton
(b. 1946). Although Clinton supported initiatives such
as the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Voting Rights Act of
1993, and Hates Crimes Prevention Act of 1994, he
also adopted a “tough on crime” stance, curtailed
social spending, and signed the 1996 Defense of
Marriage Act that defined marriage under federal law
as between one man and one woman. The Clinton
administration also offered qualified support for the
Million Man March, a demonstration in Washington
DC on October 16, 1995, led by Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan (b. 1933) and SCLC activist James
Bevel. Two years later, the first Million Woman March
occurred in Philadelphia.

When Ronald Reagan stepped down from the presidency
in 1988, he threw his support to Vice President George
H.W. Bush (b. 1946). A New England-born World War
II hero who made a fortune in the Texas oil industry,
Bush was a loyal Republican. He served as head of
the CIA, ambassador to the UN, chairman of the
Republican National Committee, and a special envoy
to China before becoming vice president. Known

organizer in Chicago, Obama began accumulating
the skills and contacts to become a national political
figure. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004, he received
the Democratic nomination for President in 2008. After
defeating Republican nominee John McCain (19362018), Obama became the first African American U.S.
President. As President, he oversaw the creation of the
Affordable Care Act and the killing of Osama Bin Laden
(1957-2011). In 2009, he received the Nobel Peace
Prize.

presidential nominee of a major political party and,
following the 2008 presidential election, the first
African American president. During his victory night
speech on November 8, Obama remarked “If there is
anyone out there who still doubts that America is a
place where all things are possible; who still wonders
if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who
still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is
your answer.”
Although Obama’s election certainly represented a
milestone in the advancement of civil rights across
America, his tenure in the White House was frequently
beset by racial and ethnic tensions. In 2013, George
Zimmerman’s (b. 1983) killing of 17-year-old unarmed
African American student Trayvon Martin (19952012) sparked protests across the nation. The following
year riots broke out in Ferguson, Missouri when
police officers shot Michael Brown (1996-2014). The
subsequent killing of Eric Garner (1971-2014) after
being locked in a chokehold by a New York City police
officer sparked additional protests and the rise of the
Black Lives Matter movement. In May 2020, when
Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin (b. 1976)
killed George Floyd (1973-2020) by kneeling on his
neck, Black Lives Matter protests broke out across the
nation. Although civil rights leaders and movements
have been extremely influential and important, the issues
of poverty, oppression, inequality and racism continue.

GLOBAL INTEGRATIONS
The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 created a power
vacuum, raising profound questions about the future
of Europe and the world in general. American officials
envisioned a peaceful world united by free trade and
democratic values in which the U.S. would play a
leadership role. As early as 1948, the United States
supported the creation of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The GATT encouraged
countries to eliminate tariffs and standardize their trade
relations to promote free trade across the world. In 1995,
over a hundred nations contributed to the creation
of a new institution, the World Trade Organization.
As of 2000, only China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and
Vietnam clung to centrally planned economies.

Germany and the Benelux countries (Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg) joined the European
Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) to coordinate the
buying and selling of heavy industrial materials. Among
its provisions, the ECSC charter called for the creation of
a European Parliament. Consisting of members elected
in each member state, the Parliament initially started
as a think tank and consulting body, but over the years
accumulated political power and began to function as a
sovereign government.
The ECSC proved so successful that just six years later
the founding members signed the Treaty of Rome. The
treaty established the European Economic Community
(EEC or EC), an organization that struck down tariffs,
synchronized commercial laws and promoted the free
flow of people, ideas, food, fuel, products and money
between member nations. The treaty also established the
European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM)
that urged the peaceful development of nuclear energy.
In 1986 the Benelux countries, Britain, Denmark,
France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain signed
the Single European Act (SEA), committing themselves
to the creation of a common European economy by
1992. The SEA also granted more power to the European
Parliament, allowing the EC to pass legislation based
on majority rule rather than unanimous consent of
member states.
On March 7, 1992, the leaders of 12 European nations
- Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and
Spain - gathered in the Dutch town of Maastricht.
They signed the Treaty of Maastricht that formalized
the creation of the European Union as a common
government that wielded a large degree of control
over foreign policy and economics. The treaty also
established the Euro as the official currency of the EU,
set the powers for the European Parliament and Court
of Justice, and established EU citizenship rights. Over
the next 30 years, many Eastern European nations such
as Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania,
Bulgaria and the Baltic States would join the European
Union. Great Britain withdrew from the EU in 2020 in
a process popularly called “Brexit.”

forces and weapons stockpiles, NATO began to expand
eastward. Designed in 1949 as a defensive block to
Soviet expansion, in 1998 the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland all joined NATO. Six years later, Bulgaria,
Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and the Balkan States
joined the military alliance. Such actions brought about
severe protests from Russian officials who argued that
NATO was an obsolete relic of the Cold War and that
such an expansion of Western military power served to
destabilize the balance of power in Europe.

The end of the Cold War left the United States not only
the sole remaining political and military superpower,
but the nation with the world’s largest and most powerful
economy. The rise of the internet greatly facilitated the
trend toward globalism. Developed by the U.S. military
in the 1980s as a way for military officials to remain
in contact in the wake of a nuclear strike, the internet
proved extremely popular when repurposed for civilian
purposes, making communications, record keeping and
information instantaneous and free.

The end of the Cold War also brought about an increase
in nuclear proliferation around the world. During the
conflict, only the U.S., Soviet Union, Britain, China and
France possessed nuclear weapons. All powers likewise
signed the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Under
the terms of this treaty, nuclear powers would not share
their technology or weapons with non-nuclear powers.
However in the 1990s, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan
and South Africa also developed nuclear arsenals.

Other countries were quick to join the drive toward
globalization. By the turn of the 21st century India,

CHAPTER 15 THE MODERN WORLD

After building a coalition of over 40 countries, the Bush
Administration launched an air and ground invasion of
Iraq on March 20, 2003. With overwhelming military
force, Allied troops captured Baghdad by April 9.
President Bush appointed diplomat Paul Bremer (b.
1941) as head of an interim government. Although
U.S. forces captured Saddam Hussein in December,
American officials and troops could do little to quell
the outbreak of violence between Iraqi Sunni and Shia
Muslims. Such infighting led to a massive humanitarian
and refugee crisis. In 2007 the Bush administration

committed an additional 20,000 American troops to
stabilize the situation in Iraq.
The chronic instability of the Iraqi government and
mounting U.S. casualties due to ambushes and suicide
bombings caused many Americans to turn against the
war effort. In 2008, Barack Obama had articulated his
desire to end the war. By 2011, all remaining American
troops were evacuated, leaving Iraq an intact but still
deeply divided country.

SUMMARY
The 30 years since the end of the Cold War brought about unprecedented change throughout the
world. The fall of the Soviet Union ushered in the political and economic unification of Europe and
the expansion of NATO. As the last remaining superpower, the United States enjoyed a preeminent
position of power and influence in world affairs. However, trends toward globalism and a “new world
order” soon ran into trouble. The Persian Gulf War, Balkan conflict, 9-11 attacks, Afghanistan War,
and Iraq War proved that the post-Cold War world was anything but a peaceful place. Although the
United States and Western Europe remained key players in world affairs, they faced new challenges
in an increasingly powerful China, a resurgent Russia, and the outbreak of conflict in places such as
Georgia and Ukraine.
